MOSCOW -- Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday
said that he does not preclude the chance of Russia joining NATO
and his country will never be in isolation from Europe and "the
civilized world."
</P>
<P>
In a Sunday morning interview with the BBC, asked whether
Russia's integration into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
can take place, Putin said "Why not?" and called the Russian
culture "part of the European civilization."
</P>
<P>
However, the West's attempts to exclude Russia from the debate
over NATO's eastward expansion have led Moscow to oppose any such
moves, said Putin.
</P>
<P>
"But this does not mean we are going to shut ourselves off from
the rest of the world. Isolationism is not an option," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is part of the European culture, and I cannot imagine
my own country in (Russia-Putin-NATO)

JERUSALEM -- Israel's cabinet voted unanimously Sunday to
withdraw Israeli troops from a border zone in south Lebanon by
July, but said it prefers to do so within a framework of an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli Defense Forces will deploy on the border with
Lebanon by July 2000 and from there will ensure the safety of the
northern towns and villages," said a cabinet statement issued
after several hours of debate.
</P>
<P>
"The government will act to ensure that this deployment will be
carried out in the framework of an agreement," the statement said,
referring to Prime Minister Ehud Barak's efforts to revive stalled
peace talks with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed in last December after
nearly four years of break, broke down in mid-January over a
dispute on the fate of the Golan Heights, a Syrian plateau seized
by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War. (Israel-Lebanon-Pullout)

MOSCOW -- The Russian military Sunday said that the situation
in the liberated parts of the breakaway republic of Chechnya is
becoming complicated as some small rebel groups have moved into
populated areas to attack federal troops.
</P>
<P>
A battle between a Chechen rebel detachment and Russian federal
units broke out near the populated area of Komsomolskoye,southeast
of Grozny on Sunday morning, said the Russian Interior Ministry's
press center in the North Caucasus, cited by the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who descended into the foothills from their
mountain positions under the cover of darkness, have failed to
break through the federal lines.
</P>
<P>
The Fighting was still raging at the battle site, where roughly
70 rebels had been kept locked up inside the federal encirclement,
the press center said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, militants launched sudden attacks at the Russian
Interior Ministry's seven checkpoints or blockhouses near Chechen
capital of Grozny and in the Nozhay- Yurt, Urus-Martan and
Naurskaya districts, but caused no casualties among federal
servicemen, the Interfax quoted the press center as saying. (

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch Windows 2000-Based Online Securities Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In preparation for the migration of In-Trade, portal of its
Internet trading service, CASH on-line will launch its Windows
2000-based securities trading platform through iGame, a simulation
Internet securities trading game.
</P>
<P>
Ken Khoo, managing director of CASH Group, said at the press
conference that Windows 2000 is expected to be fully migrated into
In-Trade in the third quarter of this year, and the iGame will
enable investors to get familiar to the new technology.
</P>
<P>
"Windows 2000 is robust enough, a perfect match for our mission
of critical online trading business," he said. "CASH on-line is
the first in Hong Kong to have a financial services system on
Windows 2000."
</P>
<P>
The application of Microsoft's Windows 2000 as a platform for
iGame, and ultimately the In-Trade system, confers the highest
security, reliability and speed to users.
</P>
<P>
Windows 2000 is the first operating system that incorporates
128-bit encryption technology, which leaves very tiny possibility
of cracking the encryption key, because it requires at least 450
million times the age of the universe to do so.

conducting online transactions," said Felix Miao, deputy chief
executive officer of CASH on-line. "With the Windows 2000 platform,

<HEADLINE> Iran Favors Expansion of Ties Among ECO Members: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Relations among the Economic
Cooperation Organization (ECO) members have expanded far beyond the
economic domain and promotion of ties with ECO members top the
agenda of the Islamic Republic of Iran, said a senior Iranian
official here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Improvement of economic and commercial relations among the ECO
members and fair share of regional states in global economy are of
special significance, Iran's First Vice President Hassan Habibi
told the opening session of the first meeting of the ECO
commerce ministers.
</P>
<P>
He said that economic cooperation at regional level can serve as
a means for confronting global challenges, the Islamic Republic
News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The ECO was founded in 1985 with an aim to enhance economic
cooperation among regional states. Its members now comprise Iran,
Pakistan, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kirgizstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Although the ECO members share a lot in culture, there are many
political and economic obstacles to their economic convergence,
Habibi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in light of peace and security in the region, it
would be possible for ECO member states to attract foreign capital
and enter into joint venture projects with an aim of attaining
economic development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
A practical and realistic plan for expansion of trade can
prepare the ground for collective cooperation among ECO members,
and for liberalization of trade among them through removal of non-
tariff barriers and easing tariff barriers, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The first vice president said, however, that the private sectors
in the member countries should take harmonious measures to expand
trade among them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's Commerce Minister Mohammad Shariatmadar said
the first meeting of the ECO commerce ministers is expected to
prepare the ground for promotion of economic cooperation,
especially in the field of commerce, among member countries.
</P>
<P>
To attain sustainable development, one should take into
consideration global development and utilize the process of
globalization for welfare and improvement of economic conditions of
nations, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that promotion of trade among the ECO members is one of
the programs of the organization.
</P>
<P>
Despite a 35 percent growth in export by the ECO members in the
1993-1998 period, the organization's share in global trade has
remained unchanged and even declined, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the session should work out suitable
strategies for removal of current problems and draw up speedy and
effective formulas for expansion of trade among the ECO members.
</P>
<P>
He added that the strategies should be based on expansion of
trade among member countries and paving the way for attaining
sustainable economic growth and contribution to global trade.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for adoption of measures to identify and
strengthen economic and commercial cooperation, sign a draft
agreement concerning framework of cooperation among the ECO members
to facilitate regional trade, export financing and granting
export credit.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic of Iran has taken some steps, including
gradual removal of non-tariff barriers and their transformation
into tariffs so as to ease export and import regulations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister said that Iran has adopted measures to join
the World Trade Organization (WTO) and predicted that no major
obstacles would be thrown in the way for Iran's WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
He expressed dissatisfaction with current level of commercial
exchanges among the ECO members and said through adoption of proper
policies, it would be possible to remove problems and expand
relations among the ECO members.

of some kinds of locally-manufactured foreign cigarettes. The new
prices came into effect a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian daily Al-akhbar quoted on Monday sources of
a Egyptian tobacco company as saying the price hike will bring more

Market sources noted that a steady increase in the number of
local smokers of foreign brand cigarettes enable the tobacco
companies made huge profits at the expense of Egyptian tobacco

Foreign companies are manufacturing their cigarettes at the
Egyptian Eastern Company, five U.S. dollars for each 1,000

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Have Same Rights With Greek Cypriots: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou underlined on Monday Turkish Cypriots who flee
the breakaway northern area of the island are entitled the same
rights as all other citizens of the Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
For the past two months, over 200 Turkish Cypriots have fled
northern Cyprus and come to live in the government-controlled
southern area of the island.
</P>
<P>
Those Turkish Cypriots said they are forced to do so because of
the large number of settlers from Turkey, the bad living conditions
and low paid-jobs in the north.
</P>
<P>
On their arrival, the Cyprus government's welfare services
provide them with food and lodging and then take them to live where
they choose, usually in the coastal towns of Paphos and Limassol
where many Turkish Cypriots live.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said strict regulations are followed to determine the
identity of any person who crosses into the government-controlled
areas.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said Turkish Cypriot citizens have the same rights as
Greek Cypriots and they will be treated as citizens of the republic
according to its constitution and laws.
</P>
<P>
For those who are proved not to be Turkish Cypriots, "they are
treated in the same way as illegal immigrants," Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
He added "procedures foreseen by international agreements are
followed and these persons are deported to the country they came
from."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after a
failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway
state, recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Before 1974, there were some 120,000 Turkish Cypriots. Reports
said there are now less than 60,000 Turkish Cypriots in northern
Cyprus. Turkey has implanted more than 80,000 Turkish colonist
settlers in the area, in addition to 35,000 heavily armed Turkish
soldiers deployed there.

A Belgian judge recently ordered police to investigate
allegations by an Iranian-born Belgian national that Rafsanjani is
responsible for kidnapping, torture, harassment and psychological
violence perpetrated between April 1983 and February 1989 in Tehran
and two other Iranian cities.
</P>
<P>
The order has invited strong protests from the Iranian
government and political factions, who termed the act as a
politically-motivated plot to tarnish Rafsanjani's image.
</P>
<P>
Actions of various power centers in any country make sense
within the framework of the country's territorial integrity, but
this should not run counter to international norms and regulations,
Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the issue does not at all represent the view of the
Belgian government, Michel said the aim of his phone call to
Kharrazi is to reiterate Brussels' interest in strengthening
relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret over the situation and said his government
will do its best to solve the problem and inform the Iranian
government of the outcome.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov: Putin's NATO Comment "Hypothetical"  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A statement on Sunday by acting
Russian President Vladimir Putin that Russia does not rule out
joining NATO was "a hypothetical answer to a hypothetical question,
" Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"A phrase must never be torn out of its context," Ivanov told
the independent NTV television network, commenting on Putin's
statement made in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The statement has sparked mixed reactions from across Russia's
political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Putin "set out Russia's fundamental principles for
its relations with the North Atlantic alliance, which means that
we are ready for and interested in being NATO's partner in dealing
with key modern problems, and primarily in creating a new
architecture of European security.
</P>
<P>
"We would not like matters that are vital to us to be dealt
with behind Russia's back. We would like to take part in dealing
with those matters. Everything in the world changes, and it is in
Russia's interest that NATO should change as well, both in essence
and content," the Interfax news agency quoted Ivanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the interview with BBC, Putin said attempts to exclude
Russia from the debate over NATO's eastward expansion have led
Moscow to oppose any such moves.
</P>
<P>
"But this does not mean we are going to shut ourselves off from
the rest of the world. Isolationism is not an option," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Russia could join NATO, Putin replied, "I don't see
why not."
</P>
<P>
"We believe we can talk about more profound integration with
NATO, but only if Russia is regarded as an equal partner," Putin
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Russia froze its ties with NATO last March when the military
bloc started a 78-day bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
Relations between Moscow and Brussels thawed last month with the
visit to Moscow by NATO Secretary George Robertson.
</P>
<P>
But mistrust persists in the relationship as Russia remains
adamantly opposed to NATO's further expansion eastward. NATO's
criticism of Russia's military actions against rebels in its
breakaway republic of Chechnya has also strained their ties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Decision yet to be Made for Clinton's Trip to Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"No decision has been made," said a White House National
Security Council spokesman when asked about Pakistani newspaper
reports that Clinton will stop at an air base near Islamabad after
leaving Bombay on March 25.
</P>
<P>
Clinton planned his visit to South Asia in 1998, but postponed
his trip after India staged a nuclear test and Pakistan quickly
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
He then decided the trip on 2000, which would have included
three nations, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. But Pakistan was
dropped when the White House announced the planned the trip in
January on the ground that the civil government was overthrown by
the military there last October.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that the schedule for the trip has yet to
be finalized. Clinton is expected to arrive in New Delhi on the
evening of March 19 and visit Bangladesh the following day before
returning to the Indian capital.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Minister: Developments on Cyprus on Positive Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Education Minister
Ouranios Ioannidis Monday expressed his satisfaction over the
recent developments on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with Greece's Macedonia-Thrace Minister
Yiannis Magriotis in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki,
Ioannidis stressed that the post Helsinki era had created a
favorable conjunction of circumstances for Cyprus that could lead
to viable solutions, according to the Macedonian Press Agency (MPA)
.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was faced with its responsibilities while it was called
to meet the demands set by the European Union (EU) and function
within the framework of international law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
To reunite the divided island, the two communities on Cyprus
have held two rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks in New York
and Geneva respectively and the third such talks will take place
in New York in May.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the May 15 New York talks as a decisive one, Greece,
a key supporter of Cyprus, has repeatedly said that it will help
reunite the divided island within the framework of a bizonal,
bicommunal federation in line with U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Cohen to Visit Vietnam Next Week  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two-day Vietnam visit early next week will be the first one
by a U.S. official since the defeated U.S. troops left Vietnam 25
years ago and will also come amid celebrations there a quarter-
century after the 1975 fall of the U.S.-backed government of South
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is expected to visit Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the
former Saigon, and discuss making bilateral military-to-military
ties "more regular and routine", a senior U.S. defense official
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between Washington and Hanoi have improved
slowly since President Bill Clinton normalized relations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The defense official, who asked not to be identified, said the
talks will include bolstering cooperation between Hanoi and
Washington in finding and returning the remains of some 2,000
American troops still missing from the war. The secretary will
visit a search site where a U.S. warplane is believed to have
crashed southwest of Hanoi.

The two Polish scientists were freed on March 3, almost seven
months after they were kidnapped by Chechen rebels on August 10
last year, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin expressed the hope that this example will help Polish
politicians and the public realize against what forces Russia is
conducting its bloody fight and take concrete measures to stop all
forms of support for Chechen separatists, the Kremlin press

</P>
<P>
Ties between Moscow and Warsaw chilled recently following the
mutual expulsion each of nine diplomats and vandalizing of
diplomatic missions of the two sides. Russia has repeatedly voiced
its dissatisfaction with anti-Russian activities by Chechen
sympathizers and asked Warsaw to close the so-called Chechen
information center in Poland.

Observers believe that the release of the two Polish scientists

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- More heavy rain is expected
to fall over South Africa's flood-ravaged Northern and Mpumalanga
provinces on Tuesday, the Pretoria Weather Bureau announced on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the prospect of more rains will not come from Cyclone
Gloria, which has downgraded to a tropical depression on Sunday
and will not impact on weather patterns over South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Instead, a new tropical high is expected to develop over South
Africa's KwaZulu-Natal Province during Monday night and move
towards northeastern South Africa or even southern Mozambique on
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Province's Joint Operation Center spokeswoman Ronel
Otto said the police and the army will be on standby in case of
any emergency.
</P>
<P>
But the rescue teams in the flood-stricken regions are still
afraid that if it starts rain again all repairs done to the
damaged bridges and roads would be washed away.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains have claimed 120 lives in Mpumalanga and Northern
provinces over the past three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Four Candidates Nominated for Rwandan Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Democratic Republican
Movement (MDR) , which is dominated by the Hutus, has named four
candidates for the post of premiership, Rwanda News Agency
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the party, the MDR's political bureau
named four front runners including three men and a woman. They are
Bernard Makuza who got the highest vote and is widely expected to
win the race, Celestine Kabanda, Marie Jose Mukandamage and
Mugalura Alex.
</P>
<P>
According to Arusha peace accord of 1993, the MDR is the only
qualified party in the war-torn African country to nominate
candidates for premier.
</P>
<P>
Official sources in Kigali said that Makuza maintains the
highest probability to become Rwanda's prime minister, the third
since Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF) came to power in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
Makuza has been Rwanda's Ambassador to Germany and his father
was a minister of education in President Gregory Kayibanda's
government shortly after independence.
</P>
<P>
Political parties in coalition government are expected to
convene within the next few days to elect the new prime minister
from the four candidates.
</P>
<P>
Celestin Rwigema resigned as Rwanda's premier early last week
saying that the political climate was not favoring for him to be
the head of the government.
</P>
<P>
In his resignation letter to president Pasteur Bizimungu,
Rwigema said that the repeated summons by the National
Transitional Assembly to explain some technical problems led to
his resignation.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Urges Syria to Meet Israel's Security Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel will not discuss with
Syria the border issue until Syria gives a clear response to
Israel's proposal on other issues in the peace talks, Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
If Syria really wants to make peace with Israel, it has to
discuss the security arrangement, water and normalization of ties
with Israel, Levy told the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee of
the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
If the two sides only discuss the border issue, there will be no
peace between the two countries, Levy added.
</P>
<P>
Levy also rejected Syria's demand for Israel's withdrawal to the
pre-war June 4, 1967 lines.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria held two rounds of peace talks in the United
States since the end of 1999, but the talks have been stalled in
January.
</P>
<P>
Although no details about the peace talks had been officially
disclosed, earlier reports indicated that Syria wanted to discuss
the borders before addressing other issues in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Syria also wanted Israel to write down its commitment to return
the entire Golan Heights to Syria as a condition for the resumption
of further peace talks, which has been rejected by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, during a cabinet meeting on
February 27, did not spell out his readiness to withdraw to the
June 4, 1967 lines, but maintained that four of his predecessors
had agreed to such a withdrawal and said he does not want to "throw
away the past."
</P>
<P>
Syria has expressed its welcome to Barak's remark, saying it
could pave the way for the two sides to return to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic efforts are going on to help the two sides reopen the
peace talks. But Israel has already rejected a report that the two
sides will finalize a peace agreement within four to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the strategic Golan Heights from Syria during the
1967 Middle East War.

</P>
<P>
The Iranian official put the total number of Iranian prisoners

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Willing to Discuss Confidence Building Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Replying to questions after a meeting between Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and U.N. chief's special adviser for Cyprus Alvaro
de Soto, Papapetrou also underlined the commitment from the Greek
Cypriot side to a federal solution on Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
It was the first official meeting between Clerides and de Soto,
who arrived here last week for a familiarization visit, to prepare
the ground for the third round of Cyprus peace talks scheduled for
May.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island after a failed pro-
Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Since then the U.N. has been trying for years to bring the two
sides back together in a bizonal bicommunal federation formula, but
the talks between the two rival sides have been stalled since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sponsored two rounds of proximity talks with the two
sides in a new effort to settle the Cyprus issue. A third round
will begin in New York on May 23.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said the Greek Cypriot side is ready and willing to
go to the talks with a constructive spirit and looks forward that
the Turkish side will come to these talks with the same spirit.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Greek Cypriot side is ready to discuss the Turkish
Cypriot side's demand for the establishment of a confederation in
Cyprus, he made it "absolutely clear that our side will firmly
speak on the solution of the federation."
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said the Greek Cypriot side honours its signature to
the high level agreements reached between the two sides and urged
the Turkish side to do the same.
</P>
<P>
In 1977 and 1979 the two sides signed agreements providing for
the establishment for a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
Since the summer in 1999, the Turkish side has been demanding a
confederation of two states in Cyprus, a position rejected by the
Greek Cypriot side, the U.N. and all key players in the Cyprus
peace effort.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer said here on Monday he will help thaw relations between
Germany and Iran through his current visit to the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Germany went through a tough period in their
traditional relations last year and it is hoped that the two
countries will be able to improve their relations, Fischer told
reporters upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day official visit, he will have talks with
Iranian officials on rehabilitating relations, said Fischer, who is
heading a high-ranking political and economic delegation, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on major obstacles to bilateral relations,
Fischer declined to make a direct answer but said the two countries
should look into prospects for mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said he is to meet President Mohammad Khatami and Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on Tuesday. Economic officials of
the two countries are scheduled to hold talks here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's visit, the first by a German foreign minister since
1991, is aimed at making arrangements for the upcoming visit of
Khatami to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the biggest importer of non-oil commodities of Iran
and one of Iran's major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries were strained last year due
to the imprisonment of a German businessman who was sentenced to
death for an affair with an Iranian woman and a Berlin court's
ruling that Tehran had ordered the slaying of three Kurdish
dissident leaders and their translator in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The German businessman was acquitted of the charges and was
released in January.

<HEADLINE> President: Turkish Economy Should Open to International Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- "Turkey should remain an economy
open to competition in the world," President Suleyman Demirel was
quoted by the Anatolia News Agency as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Competition is the only way leading to a permanent atmosphere
that can create better conditions for not only developed but also
developing economies, Demirel said at the second International
Competition Symposium organized by the Turkish Competition Board in
the country's largest city of Istanbul Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, all institutions of contemporary Turkey should catch up
with the world standards and they should be restructured in a way
compatible with the global competition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which was accepted as a candidate for membership of the
European Union at its Helsinki summit last December, is trying hard
to keep in line with the standards of the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
In his year-end report which reviewed the developments in 1999
and set the goals of 2000, the president said that in the new
century Turkey will "assume a place as one of the 10 major
developed countries of the world."
</P>
<P>
Sending a message to the symposium, Demirel stressed that
globalization makes regional and global integration inevitable
while it spreads competition to the world scale in every field.
</P>
<P>
Demirel described competition as the most important condition
for realizing and harmonizing with this new order.
</P>

"The Turkish entrepreneurs have come to realize the necessities

<HEADLINE> Iran Opposes Oil Output Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday voiced its opposition
to any increase in the oil output of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), claiming that the oil market is to see
a big drop in demand.
</P>
<P>
"Fundamentals and reality of the oil market do not point to
shortage of supply," Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said,
adding all market parameters have failed to prove a crude shortfall
in the second quarter of 2000 and there is no need for a higher
crude supply to the market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Zanganeh said Iran
is seeking market stability and safeguarding mutual interests of
oil producers and consumers in the long run.
</P>
<P>
He said oil prices, which have topped 30 U.S. dollars per
barrel, will normally go on a downward trend in the third quarter
of the current year.
</P>
<P>
Western consuming countries, primarily the United States, have
urged oil-exporting countries to raise production in the second
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Oil Ministry claimed the demand for crude oil
has started to drop by 3 million barrels per day (bpd) for the
second quarter of the year, calling on OPEC members to maintain the
current level of output beyond March 31.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the second biggest OPEC producer with a quota at 3.6
million bpd and is currently producing about 3.3 million bpd after
OPEC decided last year to cut down outputs to raise then slumping
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Iran, whose producing capacity was reported at 4 million bpd,
feared that it might lose its current share in the OPEC if the 12-
nation oil-producing bloc raised production ceiling.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said oil ministers of Iran, Libya and Algeria had
made a recommendation on extension of OPEC output level beyond
March in their statement in Tripoli on January 21.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the three countries will hold consultations
with the other OPEC members and are expected to hold a meeting
ahead of the OPEC meeting in Vienna on March 27 to decide whether
to maintain their reduced quotas.

<HEADLINE> International Mining Conference Opens in Toronto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A week-long international mining
conference opened Sunday in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The Mining Millennium 2000 convention is expected to attract
some 10,000 participants from around the world, according to the
Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada.
</P>
<P>
A World Mines Ministries Forum is included in the convention
for an exchange of views among almost 60 official government
delegations and representatives from more than 70 countries.
</P>
<P>
The largest mining conference ever held in Canada is devoted to
discussions ranging from environment protection and economic
issues to problems with indigenous peoples concerned with access
to land and resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Metal prices will be an interesting topic for the meeting.
Nickle prices, for example, were at their lowest level a year ago
for the previous 11 years, trading under 2 U.S. dollars a pound.
The price soared to 4.68 dollars last week.
</P>
<P>
The demand for nickel increased by 5.5 percent in 1999 and is
expected to rise 6.5 percent this year, as compared with an
average annual growth rate.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Slams Proposed NATO Military Exercise in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Monday rapped up
at the military exercise by the international peace-keeping force,
known as KFOR, and NATO in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, saying
the move will not be conducive to the peace and stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The statement was contained in a letter to the president of
the Security Council from Vladislav Jovanovic, the Yugoslav
permanent representative to the United Nations.The letter was
circulated here Monday as official U.N. document.
</P>
<P>
KFOR and NATO, which made up a majority of the peace-keeping
force in Kosovo, are planning the military exercise, "Dynamic
Reply 2000" for Kosovo at the end of this month through the
beginning of April, Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding its billing as a routine military undertaking,
the very name of the exercise implies a dress rehearsal of a
possible reply to the challenges that KFOR/NATO may face in Kosovo,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"The exercise is expected to be held without prior approval by
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, of which Kosovo and Metohija
is an integral part," and "constitutes a provocation, a threat and
an escalation of pressure on eve of the first anniversary of the
NATO aggression," which, beginning on March 24 last year, lasted
78 days in air strikes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The step "is contrary to Security Council Resolution 1244" and
"the customary conduct of the U.N. peace-keeping forces, as well
as the Charter of the United Nations and the basic documents of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted the resolution on June 10 last
year, demanding the full respect of the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
prior consent of Belgrade on major decisions by the U.N. Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).
</P>
<P>
"Alongside the plans to construct United States military bases
in Kosovo," he said, "it aims at transforming this Serbian
province into a testing ground for the NATO military and is a
function of promoting ethnic Albanian terrorism and separatism."
</P>
<P>
"The exercise would in fact be a blatant demonstration of
force and would make no contribution to regional peace and
stability," he added.
</P>
<P>
The letter came as Bernard Kouchner, head of UNMIK, and Klaus
Reinhardt, the military commander of KFOR, are briefing the 15-
nation Security Council Monday on the current situation in Kosovo,
a big challenge for the U.N. in the region after NATO's 78-day
bombing.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Urged to Learn History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A most eminent philosopher in
Canada urges his countrymen to learn more of history, warning "
utilitarian training" is over-emphasized in education and may
become "obsolete overnight".
</P>
<P>
Public education is being redesigned solely for preparing
people for work, overlooking what Canadians really need to learn --
their history, according to John Ralston Saul.
</P>
<P>
"It will not serve them well over the long term, because that
kind of utilitarian training -- with the change in technology
every five or 10 years -- it's all obsolete overnight," he was
quoted as saying by the National Post newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
Saul, who is married to Governor-General Andrienne Clarkson,
believes that "by training people in this narrow way, you're
training them to be unemployed in the long term."
</P>
<P>
"In order to know what to do in society as a citizen, you have
to have an understanding of your history. It will even help you in
your job," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The philosopher wants to start remedying that by opening a
lecture on history later in the month.
</P>
<P>
He will speak on 19th-century politicians including Louis
LaFontaine and Robert Baldwin, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
"That, then suddenly makes people realize that what happened in
the 19th century in Canada was not just some sort of colonial
accident, that the country was a choice, put into place by people
who wanted it to exist," the philosopher said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Protests Over UNMIK Plan to Issue "Special Travel Documents" for Kosovo Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Belgrade Monday lodged "the
strongest protest" over the intention of Bernard Kouchner, the U.N.
Special Representative for Kosovo and the head of the U.N. Mission
in Kosovo (UNMIK), to issue travel documents for Kosovo residents,
saying that the plan, if carried out, would "amount to yet another
flagrant violation" of the relevant Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
The protest was contained in a letter from Vladislav Jovanovic,
charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations,
to the president of the Security Council. The letter was published
here as official Security Council document.
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding the contention of the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) that they will issue '
special travel documents,' and not 'passports', which does not
infringe the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
there is no evidence in the history of issuance of such documents
by United Nations representatives to citizens of countries in the
territories of which operations have taken place," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The realization of this intention, one in a series of
arbitrary actions taken by the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General of the United Nations in contravention of his
mandate, would amount to yet another flagrant violation" of the
June 10, 1999 Security Council resolution "in wanton disregard for
the Security Council and the Charter of the United Nations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It would also amount to a gross violation of the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
the consequences of which should be disregarded by the State
Members of the world organization as they would be conducive to
the realization of the aspirations of ethnic Albanian separatists
in Kosovo and Metohija and the creation of Greater Albania," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Swiss People to Vote on Accession to United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- People in Switzerland are to vote
on the country's accession to the United Nations as supporters of
an initiative have collected well over the necessary 100,000
signatures ahead of Wednesday's deadline to force a nationwide
vote.
</P>
<P>
Head of the initiative committee Remo Gysin said Monday that
the aim of the vote was to end Switzerland's isolation and get it
to accept its global responsibilities. To date, about 126,000
signatures have been collected.
</P>
<P>
"If Switzerland wants to be effective in development,
humanitarian and economic activities, it needs partners," Gysin, a
Social Democrat member of parliament told Swiss radio
International. "There are 188 partners waiting to welcome us."
</P>
<P>
The UN membership was rejected in a previous vote in 1986.
Along with the Vatican, Switzerland is the only country not to be
a member of the UN.
</P>
<P>
The organizers of the signature initiative said that the effort
made to collect the signatures had helped the development of a
popular movement for membership of the UN.
</P>
<P>
But they also noted that the Swiss people's knowledge about the
UN was limited, and that a lot of effort would have to be put into
informing the public before the referendum is held. The government
now has to call a nationwide vote on joining the UN within 39
months.

MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Monday welcomed Israel's
decision to pull out its troops from Lebanon by next July.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of this decision can be an important step
toward a comprehensive peace in the Middle East," the Russian
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>

Russia "has always called for the restoration of Lebanon's
sovereignty over all of its territory in compliance with U.N.
Security Council Resolution 425," the Interfax news agency quoted
the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moscow believes that a firm settlement of the southern Lebanon
problem, including the security provision to northern Israel,
requires "a close link between the Syrian and Lebanese tracks of
the peace process," the document said.
</P>

"Only this approach will prevent new outbreaks of tension in

<HEADLINE> More Russians Support Continued Assault on Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Up to 70 percent of Russians
support the continuation of military actions against Chechen
rebels, 9 percentage points than three years ago, the Interfax
news agency reported Monday, citing poll results.
</P>
<P>
Of 1,600 adults polled late February by the All-Russia Center
for Public Opinion, only 22 percent support negotiations with the
Chechens, in contrast to 27 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
The margin of error of the polls was 4 percent, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
According to the recent poll, 59 percent of those who support
the continuation of the offensive or were undecided on the issue
believe military actions should go on even if federal troops
suffer big losses, up from 38 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said about 1,500 federal troops have died fighting
rebels since the campaign was launched last September following
two waves of armed incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a
spate of apartment bombings.
</P>
<P>
About 300 people were left dead in the blasts in Moscow and two
other Russian cities, which were blamed on Chechen militants.

role of micro business development in employment creation and
poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Minister of State Cephas Msipa stressed at the

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Police Persuade Veterans to Leave Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's police Monday said they
are negotiating with former freedom fighters to peacefully leave
the white- owned commercial farms they have invaded.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of police Wayne Bvudzijena said they were hopeful
that the ex- combatants would leave the farms peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic that the war veterans will listen to our
peaceful call," he said. "All our officers in the provinces are
engaged in the persuasion process right now."
</P>
<P>
He said he could not say what would happen if the war veterans
refused to listen to the call for a peaceful retreat neither
could he speculate on the outcome of the process.
</P>
<P>
He said he was not sure if there had been any direct
instruction from the government on the action for the police to
take if the negotiations failed.
</P>
<P>
Ex-combatants invaded more than 40 white-owned commercial farms
 throughout the country starting two weeks ago and threatened to
remain at the farms until their demands for land were met.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa ordered the war veterans
to vacate the farms last Friday threatening unspecified police
action if they refuse.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe said the government would not stop the
war veterans from invading the farms because they were
demonstrating peacefully for equitable distribution of land.
</P>
<P>
War veterans leader Chenjerai Hunzvi said they would not leave
the farms, but ordered them to remain calm and orderly.
</P>
<P>
The government announced last week that it would amend the
constitution to include a clause on compulsory acquisition of
land.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Committed to Reducing Green House Gases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is committed to the
reduction of green house gas emissions by improving energy
efficiencies and adopting renewable energy, Zimbabwean Mines,
Environment and Tourism Minister Simon Moyo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister was officially opening a one-day seminar on the
Zimbabwe National Strategy Study (ZNSS) for climate change.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe's contribution to global emission of green house
gases is negligible at present, but with increasing
industrialization the country will be adding to global levels," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the country had a challenge of understanding principles
of Clean Development Mechanisms (CDM) by policy makers,
industrialists and the community.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize the lack of widespread awareness of these
concepts as a shortcoming requiring redress," Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar marked the end of the ZNSS project which was
launched in 1997 with an objective of developing a national
position on the CDM initiatives.
</P>
<P>
It would identify projects to be included in the country's
profile and develop better understanding of CDM principles.
</P>
<P>
About 30 participants were drawn from the World Bank,
Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries and the Zimbabwe Investment
Centre.

LUANDA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Cabinda Gulf Oil Company
(CABGOC) and its associates operating in Angola will increase its
purchase from the Angolan market so as to reduce its operation
cost.
</P>
<P>
Jim Price, director of CABGOC's department of enterprise
development, said said here Monday that the company will spend 40
million U.S. dollars on the acquisition of goods and services from
the Angolan enterprises this year.
</P>
<P>
Price said that CABGOC, a filiale of the Chevron Oil Company,
spent some 30 million dollars in Angola last year, 36 percent
more than that in 1998.
</P>
<P>
This amount of money will be spent on air transportation,
service of public security, communication and constructive
materials.
</P>
<P>
CABGOC and its associates will also invest in the establishment
of agricultural and fishing companies in Angola, with an aim to
avoid the high- price import.
</P>
<P>
CABGOC is headquartered in the Cabinda Province, the northeast
Angolan enclave rich in off-shore oil reserve. It is currently
operating in the profitable oil fields Block Zero and Block 14.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Continue Mediating in Burundi Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela is in good health and not considering
giving up his mediation in the Burundi peace process, his
secretary Zelda Le Grange said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During his recent visit to Nigeria, Mandela said that
"circumstances far beyond our control" might force him to end his
political work.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from Mandela's home in Qunu in the Eastern Cape
Province, Le Grange said that Mandela has been "a bit misquoted".
</P>
<P>
She clarified that "he did not say he was sick or resigning
tomorrow" and what Mandela had actually said was that the times
might come "sooner or later" when he might have to pass the baton
to a younger person.
</P>
<P>
Le Grange said Mandela is presently continuing with his normal
political duties and working at his rural home.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana
Dlamini-Zuma said in Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi, that
Mandela will continue mediating in Burundi peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"At present, Mandela has not resigned," Zuma told South African
Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Burundian government spokesman Luc Rukingama also said her
country has not received any notification from Mandela's team that
he is considering quitting the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mandela last December succeeded former Tanzania President
Julius Nyerere, who died last October, as the chief mediator for
the Burundi peace talks aimed at ending the conflict between
Tutsi-led Burundian government and Hutu rebels, which has claimed
at least 200,000 lives since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian government and opposition parties concluded their
latest round of talks on Sunday in Arusha, Tanzania, where the
negotiating teams have drafted proposals for a period of
transition and integration of Hutu rebels into the Tutsi-dominated
army and government.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Launches Project to Safeguard Women's Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia Monday launched a
project of proventing all forms of trafficking in women and
children on the occasion of International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
The three-year project has been designed and will be
implemented in cooperation with the International Organization of
Migration. The government of Finland supports the project with
about one million U.S.dollars.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the signing ceremony, Prime Minister Hun Sen
spoke highly of women's role in all kinds of activities in society.
"Without women's participation, we could not have established a
strong movement aimed at protecting our country and bolstering up
a once strong nation to get back its place," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the Royal Government of Cambodia and he
himself will dedicate this 90th International Women's Day to kick
off a nation-wide campaign to safeguard and promote women's rights,
and a campaign against the trafficking of women and children.
</P>
<P>
Violence against women and trafficking in women and children
are two social problems that have become particularly acute in
recent years in Cambodia, though significant progress has been
made in formulating and adopting legislation to protect the right
of women.
</P>
<P>
According to figures offered by the Ministry of Women's and
Veterans' Affairs (MWVA), around 60 percent of the more than 14,
000 commercial sex workers in the country enter the profession
involuntarily. An estimated 30,000 Cambodian women have been
trafficked to forced labour situation in neighboring Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Government of Cambodia recognizes trafficking as a
serious problem and has taken a number of legislative and other
steps to deal with it.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Inflation Rises to 3 Pct in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The oil price increase took its
toll in the Philippines' inflation rate in February which went up
slightly to three percent from January's 2.6 percent, the National
Statistics Office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The office's data show that prices of services, housing and
repairs (H&AMP;R) and fuel, light and water (FLW) contributed to the
pick up in the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Prices of selected food items such as rice, fruits and
vegetable,sugar and cooking oil, however, were lower compared to
February last year.
</P>
<P>
Chief economist with the Bankers Association of the Philippines
Johnny Ravalo said the country's inflation is likely to increase
until May even without any oil price adjustment.
</P>
<P>
"Even without the oil price increase issue, inflation will
still continue to rise in the next few months as last year's
figures were historically low," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But this increase is not bad nor good for the country. This
year's average inflation rate is likely to fall within the
government's six to seven percent target," he added.
</P>
<P>
Philippines' inflation reached 9.9 percent and 8.7 percent in
February and March 1999, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Bares Long-term Plan for Coco Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
bared Monday a long-term development plan that would rehabilitate
and revitalize the coconut industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace said that Estrada stressed the need to
realize the great potentials of the coconut industry by supporting
its farmers in a speech at the inauguration of the Maunlad Model
Farm in Quezon province in the northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"The coconut industry is among the consistent top dollar
earners of the country as it contributes an annual average income
of 700 million U.S. dollars from the export of coconut products
and by-products,"Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he had directed Secretary Edgardo Angara of
the Department of Agriculture and Administrator Eduardo Escueta of
the Philippine Coconut Authority to map out a long-term plan to
develop the industry.
</P>
<P>
Estrada assured farmers that he would issue an order before the
end of this month to tap some 50 billion pesos (1.25 billion
dollars) in coconut levy funds to rehabilitate the industry.
</P>
<P>
The president also urged all government agencies, non-
government organizations and farmers' organizations to support the
country's Coconut Preservation Act of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said this includes the creation of a task force to stop
the illegal cutting of coconut trees.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the Philippines has the world's
biggest coconut plantation and some 20 million Filipinos depend on
the coconut industry for their livelihood
</P>
<P>
However, the president lamented, coconut farmers remain poor
because they lack the technology and modern support to remain
competitive.
</P>
<P>
"We must replicate the model farm here. We must plant various
crops, raise livestock, and raise fisheries. This way, we can
bring the income up from 10,000 pesos (250 dollars) per hectare to
100,000 pesos (2,500 dollars) or more," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Police on Alert Against Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine National Police Chief
Panfilo Lacson alerted Monday all 1,733 chiefs of police in the
country against possible hostilities by dissident terrorists in
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lacson told the chiefs of police particularly
those from the far-flung municipalities to be alert and ready at
all times against possible harassments by the leftist dissidents.
</P>
<P>
"The National Headquarters has provided you with the resources
for communication, mobility and firepower. You are therefore
expected to utilize these to the fullest in any confrontation with
dissident terrorists," Lacson told the concerned Staff offices at
a meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned the police chiefs against falling for the "
harass and ambush" tactics, particularly by the rebel New People's
Army,wherein an isolated station or detachment is harassed by a
small group of dissidents while a bigger group lays ambush on the
government reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
Lacson's warning came in the aftermath of an ambush staged by
members of the NPA in Bohol province in the central Philippines
last week that killed 10 government troops.
</P>
<P>
The slain government troops were out to reinforce an isolated
Army post in a nearby town which came under harassment fire from
the NPA.
</P>
<P>
"From the looks of it, the real target was not the detachment
but the reinforcements," Lacson assessed.

<HEADLINE> Manila Unfazed About OFWs' "Mysterious" Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential Palace
said Monday that there may be a "hasty generalization" on the
allegations that 113 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) died under
mysterious circumstances while they were working abroad last year.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican told reporters that the
government, through the Office of Legal Assistant for Migrant
Workers' Affairs of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), has
been closely monitoring the deaths of our OFWs.
</P>
<P>
"While it is true that 113 were classified as 'with no report
on the cause of death,' it is hasty generalization to state that
they died mysteriously," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
He said some Philippine diplomatic posts abroad failed to
specify in their report the exact cause of death of an OFW. The
DFA reports that in these cases, a majority, if not all, of them
died of natural death, he added.
</P>
<P>
Barican assured that in cases where there is suspected foul
play,the DFA normally requests the assistance of the National
Bureau of Investigation to conduct an autopsy upon the request of
relatives.
</P>
<P>
The DFA, he said, also instructed the concerned post to make
appropriate representations with the local police authorities
where the death of the OFW occurred to conduct a thorough
investigation on the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
Senator Loren Legarda claimed Sunday that 607 Filipino workers
abroad died in 1999 and 113 of these cases were not sufficiently
explained.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, there are about 4.5 million
Filipinos working abroad and they earn the country about 7 billion
U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Because of their contributions to the economy, the government
has described them as "modern heroes."

<HEADLINE> Over 400 Hot Spots Found in Sumatra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Satellite pictures have shown
more than 400 hot spots in central Sumatra, Indonesia, on March 5
and some were emitting smoke haze toward the Malacca Straits,
Singapore Environment Ministry (ENV) and the Meteorological
Services Singapore(MSS) said in a press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of hot spots has increased significantly in the past
days compared with about 20 intermittent hot spots seen in Sumatra
a week ago, the ENV and MSS noted.
</P>
<P>
ENV and MSS also said that the increase in number of hot spots
has resulted in slightly hazy conditions over Singapore in the
afternoon pushing the 24-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) up
to the moderate range of 53 at 4:00pm. (PSI 50 or less is good.)
</P>
<P>
However, they said the forecast low-level winds over Singapore
are likely to change from the current westerly to north-westerly
in the next few days and hence only a small portion of the smoke
haze generated is likely to be carried over to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The satellite images of the hot spots have been sent to the
Indonesian Environmental Impact Management Agency as part of the
cooperation between Singapore and Indonesia on haze-related matter,
they added.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, haze caused by land and forest fires in Indonesia
enveloped the region from August to Early November that year and
severely affected Singapore's air quality.

UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday met in a closed-door session to hear the briefing by

Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEx) launched Monday,
listed better market services and support of China's capital needs
as key directions of development of the HKEx.
</P>
<P>
"HKEx will provide services that add real value for investors,
market intermediaries and listed companies," he said at the press
conference on the merging of Hong Kong's stock exchange, futures
exchange and their three associated clearing houses into the HKEx.
</P>
<P>
The new entity will continue to lead in innovation of products
and services, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong securities market will continue to serve as a
leading capital formation center for Chinese mainland enterprises,
to support China's capital needs to finance its rapid economic
development and modernization in the new economy," he said, adding
that the HKEx's global focus and orientation will also reinforce
Hong Kong's role as the major gateway for international investors
into China.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting HKEx's strategy of globalization and technology,
Lee said, "Hong Kong Exchanges will seek alliance opportunities
with other major international exchanges to establish Hong Kong as
a major trading center and regional hub for global stocks in the
Asian time zone, and advance Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center."
</P>
<P>
He said the initiative will strengthen Hong Kong's position as
an integral part of a 24-hour trading platform linking the three
main time zones of Europe, America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Lee told the press that Hong Kong Exchanges is also committed
to investing in technology to increase the speed and efficiency of
transactions, and expand the compatibility and linkage of its
trading and settlement systems enabling the early realization of
straight-through-processing.
</P>
<P>
The initiative of the merger was raised a year ago by Hong Kong
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang in an effort to boost Hong Kong's
competitiveness and help secure its position as a leading regional
financial center.
</P>
<P>
The merger will allow a single entity to handle all trading and
settlement of stock and derivatives products, eliminating
duplication of functions.
</P>
<P>
"The merger brings many advantages such as economies of scale,
greater efficiency, reduced costs, and more financial strength for
developing state-of-the-art electronic trading systems. Market
coherence will be improved, and risk management enhanced," said
Lee.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Endeavors to Restore Normal Power Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government is making
efforts to restore incessant electricity supply to all regions of
the country as early as possible, said a minister here.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Michel Murr said at an inauguration ceremony
for a new transformer on Saturday that the power plants can feed
Beirut and some other areas with 20-24 hours of power a day.
</P>
<P>
The 120-megawatt facility, which is located in Jamhour, east of
capital Beirut, was installed by Lebanese staff without foreign
help, Daily Star newspaper quoted the minister as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the government pledged to restore around-the-
clock electricity supply before March 5.
</P>
<P>
The unit is the second transformer to be installed in Jamhour,
which lost 11 of its 12 transformers in the February Israeli air
raids against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On February 8, Israeli warplanes bombarded three power stations
in retaliation for Hezbollah guerrillas' attacks. For weeks
intermittent power outages have plagued the country.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan FM Goes Abroad for Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
Lakshman Kadirgamar, who came back home after a cure in Europe in
late January, has gone abroad again for medical treatment, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that he was expected to return
to Sri Lanka in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
But it did not say where Kadirgamar had gone, nor did it
mention the ailment for which he was seeking treatment.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the mystery to security considerations.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar, who comes from the minority Tamil community, has
been viewed as a traitor by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
rebels who have been fighting for a homeland for minority Tamils
in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The minister has been leading a campaign to isolate the LTTE in
the international community by exposing the guerrillas' terrorist
activities in Sri Lanka. He is widely seen to be high on the LTTE'
s hit list.

COLOMBO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A two-year rehabilitation program
for the displaced in the war-torn region of Sri Lanka's north and
east is to be carried out by Cooperative for American Relief
Everywhere(CARE), aid officials said Monday.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The ongoing ethnic war between government troops and the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has forced hundreds of
thousands of civilians to move from one district to another in
northern and eastern areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural productions, animal husbandry, health care,
productivity, primary education for displaced children and skill
development of adults are the main focus of the program, officials
said.

<HEADLINE> SOS Hospital in Somali Capital Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The main child and maternity
hospital of Mogadishu reopened for the public services Sunday
after it had closed its doors twice within a month over a dispute
of sacked former security guard.
</P>
<P>
Asha Ali Mohamed, a pregnant woman told reporters Monday that
she was happy about the reopening of the SOS hospital. But she
expressed concern over how long the hospital would remain open.
</P>
<P>
The lady who has been pregnant for eight months said SOS is the
only hospital that can perform operations for pregnant women.
"So, if it is closed again, I won't have somewhere else to turn
to,"she lamented.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the SOS child and maternity hospital is very
important for the people in Mogadishu since it treats more than
200 children and over 100 women daily free of charge.
</P>
<P>
The SOS compound also accommodates nearly 500 orphans and
abandoned children who attend classes where both Somalis and
international aid workers including Italian nuns support them.
</P>
<P>
Last time the hospital had its doors closed was five days ago
when gunmen supporting the sacked hospital guard, Ali Dahir,
attacked the hospital, killing one of the security guards and
wounding four others.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic courts militiamen have again intervened and secured
the area with over a hundred militiamen and several battle wagons,
but that could not ease the tension surrounding the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred students mainly orphans attending 15 classes of
 elementary and intermediate level education have also been sent
back home.
</P>
<P>
The doctors operating in the SOS hospital and other in
solidarity with them have likewise issued an ultimatum warning the
people of Mogadishu that they are considering a total cessation of
their operations and medical assistance if the SOS maternity
hospital crises is not settled.
</P>
<P>
As a quick response, the chairman of the Islamic courts, Sheikh
Hassan Addeh, and faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid got onto
their feet and met with elders from the Sarur subclan of Habar
Gidir to which the sacked security guard of the hospital belongs,
for a possible settlement of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The SOS hospital administration has asked Ali Dahir to leave
the premises of the hospital and turn in a vehicle in his
possession but owned by the hospital, something Ali Dahir had
persistently denied.
</P>
<P>
The contents of the meeting by Hussein Aidid, Sheikh Hassan
Addeh and representative of the sacked security guard, was not
disclosed officially.
</P>
<P>
However, it is believed that the discussions have brought about
this solution leading to the reopening of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The hospital which had been working throughout the years of the
civil strive in the Horn of Africa country first halted its
operations after an Italian nun, Sister Marsia, was kidnapped by
Somali gunmen in late1998.

<HEADLINE> EU Will Stand Firm on Sanctions Against Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To freeze political relations and isolate Austria from full
participation in EU functions are the two basic principles of EU
policy for that country, and Portugal will ensure the same policy
is undertaken by the other 14 EU members, said Guterres, whose
country holds the current rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
If Austria doesn't change its cabinet, the EU will continue to
isolate the country, said Guterres.
</P>
<P>
Guterres was in Helsinki holding talks with Finnish President
Tarja Halonen and Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen on the EU summit
in June, which is expected to focus on employment and economic
reform as well as Europe's defense and security.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen said the isolation of Austria will likely last a long
time under the present situation.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) decided last month to cut off all
political relations with Vienna to protest the entry of the ultra-
right Freedom Party into the new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Joerg Haider resigned last week as leader of the Freedom Party
in an attempt to appease the anger expressed by his praise of
Waffen SS veterans and the Nazi regime. But EU countries said they
will continue their isolation of Austria despite his resignation.

<HEADLINE> About 1,000 Rebels Reportedly Killed in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces have killed
up to 1,000 Chechen rebels in the past three to four days, a top
Russian commander said Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 rebel fighters remain in the breakaway republic,
but they can no longer mount organized resistance and only move
around in small groups of 10-15 each, said Colonel General Gennady
Troshev, deputy commander of the federal forces in the North
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Troshev as saying that federal
troops also destroyed a rebel airdrome on frozen Lake Goluboye in
Vedeno district near the border with the republic of Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
The airport was prepared to receive a light sports plane to
evacuate rebel ringleaders Shamil Basayev and Khattab, Troshev
said.
</P>
<P>
He denied recent reports that a group of Russian paratroopers
was ambushed in southern Chechnya, but acknowledged that 31
federal servicemen died fighting back rebel attempts to break
through encirclement.
</P>
<P>
Russian warplanes and helicopter gunships continued their raids
on rebel positions in Chechnya, flying some 60 sorties Sunday and
targeting the Argun and Vedeno Gorges.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Major General Alexander Otrakovsky,
commander of the group of marine units in Chechnya and chief of
the Arctic Fleet coastal troops, died Monday of heart attack
Monday in Vedeno, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Otrakovsky, 53, joined the federal campaign against rebels last
September.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- The United Arab Emirates signed a long-delayed contract to
buy 80 F-16 jet fighters from Lockheed Martin Corp. for about 6.4

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

July from the embattled strip of southern Lebanon that they have
occupied since 1982, preferably in the context of an accord with
Syria.
</P>

integration" with NATO even by joining it so long as Russia "is
regarded as an equal partner."
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Moves by British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and his wife Cherie to block the publication of memoirs
by their children's former nanny were defended by Cabinet Office
Minister Lord Falconer on Monday.
</P>
<P>
With the legal battle going to the courts on Monday, Lord
Falconer, a close friend of the prime minister and his family,
said Cherie had been "extremely upset" by the publication of the
story in a Sunday newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He told the BBC the Blairs were fully justified in seeking an
injunction which forced the Mail's Sunday newspaper to halt
printing the revelations early on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Cherie will formally start proceedings on Monday to prevent the
newspaper from printing further revelations by Rosalind Mark, the
former nanny. The move came amid reports that the Blairs are
poised to sue Ms Mark.
</P>
<P>
The Times newspaper, quoting a Downing Street source, said the
Blairs were considering legal action against Ms Mark for breaching
a confidentiality agreement by revealing details of their private
life.
</P>
<P>
Lord Falconer said a decision on whether the family should seek
damages would be made in the next few days.

<HEADLINE> More Efforts Urged to Nab Cyber Porn Peddlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Internet has become a haven for
pedophiles looking for new victims and Canadian law enforcers
should increase attention to the growing problem, the Ottawa Sun
newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
There are few police teams in this country dedicated to
trolling the Web for pedophiles on the prowl for pre-pubescent
images, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The region's five-man hi-tech unit also probes computer
component theft and threats via e-mail but Internet child porn
could easily fill all their hours on the job.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the unit joined 37 other police forces from
across the country in a 35-hour online project to ferret out Web
surfers looking to download child porn.
</P>
<P>
During the 36-hour blitz, Ottawa-Carleton identified 28
suspects, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Steve Sullivan, executive director of the Canadian Resource
Center for Victims of Crime, was quoted as warning "parents should
keep an eye on the websites and chat rooms their children visit
and haul the computer out of their kids' bedrooms."
</P>
<P>
"The kids never know who they're talking to. They could think
they're talking to another 12-year-old boy or girl but it's really
a 35-year-old pedophile," he added.
</P>
<P>
The watchdog group will be meeting with officials from the
federal solicitor general's office in a few weeks to lobby the
department for a nationwide task force, according to the newspaper.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion Ye Zhaoyin of
China is among the favourites to win the women's singles title at
the All England Badminton Championships.
</P>
<P>
According to the main draw of the tournament, which begins in
Birmingham on Wednesday, top seeded Ye will have a bye in the
first round. In the second round, she will meet Marina Yakusheva
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The only threat in the upper half of the draw to Ye's bid for a
successive fourth title of the championships will be from her
teammates Gong Zhichao, joint 3/4 seed for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese women player Dai Yun, runner-up at the World
Championships in Copenhagen last year, also has a direct entry in
the second round, in which she will play against Tine Rasmussen of
Denmark.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes to the draw, Dai Yun will meet her arch-
rival world champion Dane Camilla Martin in the final.
</P>
<P>
While in the men's singles, reigning All England champion Peter
Gade-Christensen, the top seed, has a golden chance to retain his
title with the withdrawl of his compatriots Olympic gold medallist
Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen and ex-world champion Peter Rasmussen.
</P>
<P>
China's Sun Jun, world champion in Copenhagen, is also
sidelined by injury.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen is staying at home in Denmark to be with his wife
who has been hit by a mystery illness. Rasmussen, who has
struggled with injuries since his world title triumph in 1997,is
nursing an injured foot.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen, now approaching the veteran stage, is hoping to
defend his Olympic title in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen will also miss next week's Swiss Open and there are
now serious doubts in the Danish camp about him gathering enough
ranking points to make their Olympic squad.
</P>
<P>
The place for Hoyer-Larsen, who was seeded second in the
tournament, will be taken by a player from the qualifying round.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no second seed, as the main draw has been done,
"said a press officer for the tournament.

<HEADLINE> IMF Forecasts 3.5-4.3 Percent GDP Growth in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) is expecting a robust recovery of the Hong Kong economy with
its GDP growing by 3.5 to 4.3 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The forecast appears in the Staff Report, released Monday, on
the IMF's annual consultation with China in respect of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The report predicts that the Hong Kong SAR will benefit from a
further improvement in the external environment, including
continued robust growth of output and exports in the Chinese
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The IMF attributes the successful turnaround of the economy to
the Hong Kong authorities' skillful economic management, the
credibility of policy-making, and the economy's flexibility and
resilience.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the IMF expressed its continued support for the
linked exchange rate system, which is underpinned by strong
fundamentals, a flexible economy and a resilient banking system.
</P>
<P>
The IMF noted the high quality regulatory and supervisory
framework of the banking system and welcomed the forthcoming
reforms of the banking sector in Hong Kong, saying that the
announcement of the timetable for reforms provided a window of
opportunity for necessary consolidation in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong Kong SAR,
welcomed the positive assessment in the report.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF's positive assessment is a clear endorsement of the
macroeconomic policies adopted by the Hong Kong SAR government. I'
m confident that Hong Kong, with its sound fundamentals, will
continue to sustain a strong and solid recovery," Tsang said.

<HEADLINE> HK Financial Secretary Hails Launch of HKEx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang Monday hailed the launch of the Hong Kong Exchanges
and Clearing Limited (HKEx), which was formed under the ambitious
financial reform plan he initiated a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"Today marks a major landmark in our drive to become Asia's
leading securities and futures market and to be among the top five
equities exchanges in the world," said Tsang at the launching
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The merging of Hong Kong's stock exchange, futures exchange and
their associated clearing houses into the HKEx is a move of
keeping up with the changes in the new world of securities trading,
which require size and technology, as well as transparency and
integrity, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong Exchanges - the new symbol of unification - has
upgraded Hong Kong to the center stage of the global financial
market in the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang was happy that the overwhelming majority of the members
of the exchanges have decided to opt for shares in the HKEx, which
was scheduled to be listed in the third quarter of this year,
rather than taking the cash alternative.
</P>
<P>
Under the merging terms, each stock broker seat holder will get
800,000 shares of the HKEx and each futures broker seat holder 1.
39 million shares.
</P>
<P>
They can choose a cash alternative of 3.88 HK dollars per share
which will yield about 3.1 million HK dollars (about 400,000 U.S.
dollars) for each stock broker and realize 5.39 million HK dollars
(about 690,000 U.S. dollars) for each futures broker, according to
a report by the South China Morning Post.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Minority NPC Deputies Stress Social Stability for Reviving Western Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Social stability should be
maintained in the ethnic minority regions so as to attract more
investment and facilitate economic growth. This is a view shared
by deputies from Tibet and Xinjiang to the Ninth National People's
Congress, China's highest law-making body which has been in
session here since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While discussing the government work report by Premier Zhu
Rongji during a joint panel discussion on Sunday of deputies from
Tibetan Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
Dorje Cering, commissioner of the Qamdo Prefecture in Tibet
Autonomous Region, said his personal work experience has shown
that stability could result in marked growth in local economy.
</P>
<P>
"Crackdown on illegal activities for the sake of social
stability in Qamdo prefecture has greatly spurred local economy
and facilitated the influx of investment from outside," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tibetan official, the number of private
businesses run by outsiders in Qamdo have risen from approximately
3,600 two years ago to more than 5,800 in early this year, which
have contributed to some one third of the region's tax income.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, this view is echoed by Dorje Cering, commissioner of
the Ali Prefecture in Tibet, who cited own region as an example.
Thanks to a series of policy incentives and stable social
environment as a result of an effective drive against separatism
and drug smuggling in Ali, there are now more investors from
outside Tibet than local residents, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yao Yongfeng, a NPC deputy from northwestern Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, endorsed the viewpoint elaborated in
Premier Zhu's government work report, which attaches great
importance to ethnic unity in the development of western areas.
Local ethic Uygur (Uighur) people in Yao's hometown Kashi, for
instance, has profited from learning how to grow vegetables from
immigrant farmers from eastern Shandong Province.

<HEADLINE> East China to Benefit from New Development Strategy: NPC Deputies ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The newly-announced government
strategy to develop the economically backward western region of
China in a big way has been a hot topic among deputies to the
National People's Congress (NPC) who are here attending the NPC
annual session.
</P>
<P>
It is more exciting for some venture-minded and farsighted
entrepreneur-turned NPC deputies. "In seeking space for further
expansion, I have decided to set up factories in western areas,"
said Lu Guanqiu, a farmer-turned industrialist from eastern
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Lu explained that it is not a mere makeshift move in response
to the government scheme. "Those who recognize this historic
opportunity first will have the start of others," said the
chairman of the board of directors of the world's largest
universal-joint manufacturer, the Wanxiang Group.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report he delivered at the NPC session,
Premier Zhu Rongji asked the developed eastern, coastal areas to
step up assistance for their western counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Lu said entrepreneurs in the eastern region have for long eyed
the western provinces, where there are things they badly need --
abundant natural resources, cheap labor and vast markets, plus
favorable government policies.
</P>
<P>
"Many industries in the western region are enjoying much high
profit rates than their eastern competitors," said Lu, "Every
businessman could see it."
</P>
<P>
In fact, a large number of eastern companies, which have an
upper hand in capital, technology, management and namebrand, have
built their presence in the western region in various forms.

<HEADLINE> East China to Benefit from New Development Strategy: NPC Deputies ( 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhejiang Province alone, for instance, sells 100 billion yuan
worth of local industrial products in the western region, while
enterprises from Shanghai, China's largest industrial city and
financial center, have opened more than 1,000 factories in the
region, with an investment of about 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The eastern region relies on the backing of a developed
western region," said Xu Kuangdi, mayor of Shanghai. "A real
'national team' could not be formed to join the world competition,
until the western part of the country is developed."
</P>
<P>
It is imperative for China to develop the western part in a big
way to meet the requirements of a worldwide economic restructuring
and increase the country's competitiveness in the international
arena, Xu said, adding that the development of the western region
is closely linked to a sustained development of the eastern region
and even that of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
"East-west cooperation will be beneficial to both sides," said
Zhang Zhongwei, governor of southwestern Sichuan Province. "The
western region could boost its local economy by introducing funds,
development projects and advanced managerial experience from the
east, while enterprises in the eastern, coastal areas could share
our resources, acquire markets and have space for further
development."
</P>
<P>
The eastern, coastal areas are the best developed in China and
in the past two decades, these areas have pioneered in the
country's reform and opening masterminded by the late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The western region is composed of 9 provinces and ethnic
autonomous regions and one centrally-administered municipality,
covering 5.4 million sq. km., 56 percent of the country's total,
and has a population of 285 million, 23 percent of the national
total.

<HEADLINE> China's Law-makers Support Agricultural Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's law-makers, who are here
attending an annual session of the country's top legislature,
expressed today their support for the government move to
restructure the agricultural sector, saying the move is bound to
speed up its modernization.
</P>
<P>
To kick-start the restructuring program, China's development
planning minister Zeng Peiyan proposed detailed measures the
government needs to take in that regard in his annual report to
the Third Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The first indication of such a move, however, is a government-
mandated lowering of production goals for grain and cotton this
year, something never done by the government since the founding of
New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"This signals an end to the era of seeking the greatest
possible output," commented Cai Lifeng, a deputy from central
China's Hunan province. "Restructuring the agricultural sector is
meant to discard the traditional agricultural production pattern
and shift the basic goal from quantity to quality."
</P>
<P>
Li Wenquan, a deputy from eastern China's Shandong Province,
said the restructuring program is launched out of a need for
quality farm products.
</P>
<P>
China has posted consecutive bumper harvests between 1996 and
1999, maintaining an annual grain output of 500 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the great output, farmers are complaining about
stagnant income levels as a result of declining prices for
agricultural products. In 1999, for instance, per-capita income of
Chinese farmers grew 3.8 percent on a yearly basis, 0.5 percent
lower than the growth rate for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Turning out products of better quality in line with market
needs is regarded as the key to solving such a problem, according
to Chi Haibin, a Standing Committee member of the Ninth NPC.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Paper Questions Israeli Seriousness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Syria's official newspaper Tishrin
said on Monday the Israeli cabinet decision to withdraw from south
Lebanon by July "raises new doubts over the seriousness of Israel
to build a real peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
The paper's editor-in-chief Mohammad Kheir al-Wadi said in an
editorial that the decision approved on Sunday by the Israeli
cabinet "does not talk about a pullback, but instead, about
redeployment" of forces.
</P>
<P>
"This means that Israel will not withdraw totally to the
international border but wants to keep strategic areas of southern
Lebanon," he charged.
</P>
<P>
This, he warned, "carries the seeds of war for the whole region
and complicates further the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"Israel's decision stresses on the security of its military and
civilian agents in south Lebanon" which was aimed at "incorporating
the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army into the Lebanese official
military and security structures," said the article.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet said on Sunday in a statement that "The
government has decided unanimously that...the army will redeploy
along the international border by July 2000, from where it will
ensure the security of the localities of northern Israel."
</P>
<P>
"The government will work to ensure that the redeployment is
carried out within the framework of an accord," it said.
</P>
<P>
Wadi pointed out that the government statement fell short of
mentioning the U.N. Security Council resolution 425 demanding a
total and unconditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This was "a deliberate action from the side of Israel since it
does not want to implement the U.N. resolution" which was approved
in 1978, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss said Lebanon welcomes the
Israeli pullback from the south under the U.N. resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet made the decision just to undermine the unity
between Beirut and Damascus, the main power broker in Lebanon, the
Wadi said. The two insisted that their respective peace deals with
Israel are "inseparable."
</P>
<P>
It was also aimed at preventing Arab League foreign ministers to
meet in Beirut next weekend from forging a unified front of
solidarity with Lebanon, Wadi said.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel were serious it would have relaunched the
negotiations with Syria by committing itself to withdrawing from
the Golan Heights and implemented resolution 425," the article
concluded.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which resumed last December,
have been frozen again since January over Israel's refusal to give
a written pledge to fully withdraw from the Golan, captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Gabriel Mugabe arrived here Monday for a three-day visit aimed to
promote bilateral ties with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah is due to meet with
Mugabe to jointly seek ways of boosting the relations, especially
the economic links between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Although Kuwait said that Zimbabwe has always supported the
Kuwaiti just causes, their economic ties were only worth mentioning
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency, Kuwait and Zimbabwe signed
a trade agreement in October 1997, under which a joint committee
was formed to follow up bilateral trade issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides initialed an accord over protection and promotion
of investment in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
In mid 1999, the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development
granted Zimbabwe 226.27 million Kuwaiti dinars (about 746.69
million U.S. dollars) in loans to finance projects in agriculture,
transport and communications fields.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM in Beirut to Show Arab Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel
Ilah al-Khatib arrived here Monday afternoon for a few-hour visit
to show Arab solidarity with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters that he conveyed a message from
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein to Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Abdullah expressed his kingdom's solidarity with
Lebanon and its support to the Lebanese people in resisting the
Israeli aggressions, as well as demanded Israel to end its
occupation in south Lebanon by implementing the UN resolution 425,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved in 1978, calls for a total and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his brief stay, Al-Khatib will also meet with Parliament
Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib and Hoss will discuss the coming Arab League foreign
ministers meeting slated for March 11-12 in Beirut. The convening
of the meeting was widely viewed as a show of Arab solidarity with
Lebanon in confronting Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call last month, Abdullah told Lahoud that Jordan
supports Lebanon and condemns the recent Israeli air raids against
three power stations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel launched tit-for-tat air raids against Lebanon's
infrastructure facilities on February 8, Beirut has witnessed
intensive diplomatic activities to affirm Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Beirut has received Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Saudi
Crown Prince and First Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-
Aziz, Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister Sabah Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.

<HEADLINE> WFP Condemns Killing of Aid Worker in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) Monday expressed outrage at the killing of a U.N.
volunteer working for the WFP humanitarian operations in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"I'm deeply shocked and saddened by the senseless murder of yet
another humanitarian worker," Catherine Bertini, WFP Executive
Director, said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
Bertini called for a thorough investigation and the bringing to
justice of the murderer, according to the news release issued by
the Rome-based U.N. food agency.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Flood not to Recur in Nigeria: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian meteorologists Monday ruled
out possibility of a recurrence of Mozambican type of flood in
their country.
</P>
<P>
This is because there are differences in wind movements, the
News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has since early last month been groaning under the
assault of floods which claimed hundreds of lives and forced tens
of thousands of people to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
The tropical storms that bring rains to the southern African
sub-region were not the same as those along the west coast of the
continent, the report quoted the scientists as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chief meteorologist Sampson Wilson said that southern Africa
receives its rains during January to March when cyclones such as
Fline and Felicia, which originate from the Indian Ocean, blow
inland, wreaking havoc along their paths.
</P>
<P>
"This is the nature of their weather," he said. "There is no
way our rainfall can get to the magnitude of that in south Africa
and Mozambique."
</P>
<P>
Assistant chief meteorologist David Orkuma said: "We may
experience some occasional flash floods along the coastal areas.
This may be far in between, but certainly not common here."
</P>
<P>
According to the meteorologists, since the west African
coastline is not lying at right angle to the wind direction, the
impact of such storms are minimal and cannot be significant.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists have assured that the recent harmattan dust haze
from Sahara desert, which has been disrupting air plights over the
country considerably, would only last for a few days before
ending.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Relief Operations Intensified in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- International relief workers on
Sunday and Monday intensified their relief operations in the
flood-stricken regions of southern and central Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The operations, carried out in helicopters and light aircraft,
involved taking food and medical care to the victims of the
flooding.
</P>
<P>
The first British, German and French military helicopters
joined small squadrons from South Africa and Malawi that have
borne the brunt of the rescue effort since mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Two French warships docked in Maputo port on Saturday evening,
and the first of the seven C-130 airplanes belonging to the U.S.
Air Force arrive Sunday in the Hoedspruit air base, in South
Africa, where 800 marines who will take part in the relief
operations in Mozambique will be stationed.
</P>
<P>
Two of Britain's four Puma helicopters arrived at Maputo
airport early Sunday as a 100-member commando unit prepared to
swing into action after diplomatic wrangles and delays. One area
the group was to target was the delta of the River Save, on the
boundary between Inhambane and Sofala provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican National Disasters Management Institute is
working to coordinate this multi-national effort.
</P>
<P>
President Joaquim Chissano reportedly said that his country
will need about 250 million U.S. dollars in aid in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
For the hundreds of thousands, cut off from food and safe
drinking water, the relay flights of food, medicine and
water-purification equipment may make the difference between life
and death.
</P>
<P>
Cholera and diarrhoea are said to be the biggest dangers to the
flood victims. Now, the official death toll was 200.

<HEADLINE> LG Electronics' Annual Sales in China to Reach 1.7 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's LG Electronics said
Monday its sales in China will reach 1.7 billion U.S. dollars this
year.
</P>
<P>
LG's 10 affiliates in China registered 1.4 billion dollars in
sales last year by selling electronic products such as TVs, air
conditioners and microwave ovens, surpassing sales at home.
</P>
<P>
Roh Yong-ak, president of LG Electronics China, said China will
soon become a global export center because of low production costs.
</P>
<P>
Since its entry into the Chinese market in 1992, LG has grabbed
the second largest market share for microwave ovens and the eighth
largest for air conditioners, according to Yonhaps News.
</P>
<P>
Under a contract signed with Chinese TPV Holding Co., LG will
supply six million Braun picture tubes for TV and monitors in
exchange for three million monitors from TPV as part of its
strategy to produce TVs suitable for Chinese consumers.

HONG KONG, March 6 (Xinhua) - Hong Kong SAR Acting Chief
Executive, Anson Chan, expressed Hong Kong's determination and
confidence to offer a very competitive bid for the 2006 Asian
Games here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's 26-member 2006 Asian Games bid committee
appointed on Friday held its first meeting here on Monday, Anson
Chan said: "I can tell you that we are all determined and
confident that Hong Kong will put together a very competitive bid.
"
</P>
<P>
She said as Chairman of the Bid Committee, she would personally
oversee the work. The government would give the Sports Federations
&AMP; Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, (SF&AMP;OC) its "full support,
" but cross-sectoral community partnership among the public,
business and sports sectors is also "very, very necessary."
</P>
<P>
"We are fully aware of the keen competition from neighboring
countries. We need at the end of the day to be able to convince

<HEADLINE> Hinterland to Become New Frontiers of Opening-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The move, a major part of the government-initiated "Revive-the-
West" program, is aimed at building the under-developed, resource-
abundant west into a prosperous economic zone compatible with
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Formation of the new open zone will not only improve the
country's economic layout, but also exert influence beyond China
to the heartland of Asia and Europe, and further enhance China's
economic competitiveness in the world, experts predict.
</P>
<P>
In his Report on the Work of the Government delivered Sunday,
Premier Zhu Rongji pledged to place more emphasis on the opening-
up of the west.
</P>
<P>
Minister in charge of the State Development Planning Commission
Zeng Peiyan said today China plans to put 70 percent of its
treasury bonds, government-appropriated funds and foreign loans in
revitalizing its vast western areas this year. Ten new large-scale
development projects will be launched, in addition to 78 projects
already under construction.
</P>
<P>
Related provinces, autonomous regions and municipality are
moving into top gear. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region which
borders eight countries, for example, has listed some large-scale
projects in 10 major sectors, involving 180 billion yuan of total
investment.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to build Xinjiang into an important international
business and trade center in west China, as well as a corridor to
the outside world," said regional chairman Abdul'ahat Abdurixit,
who is here attending the annual NPC session.
</P>
<P>
Tibet Autonomous Region followed suit. It has also selected 10
sectors open to overseas investment, including infrastructure,
agriculture and animal husbandry, and tourism projects. Regional
chairman Iegqog said, "We will invite investment through different
channels in a market-oriented manner."
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways is investing 100 billion yuan in the
next five years to construct railways in the west, including two
cross-border railways in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government departments concerned are busy preparing
a detailed directory for overseas investment and preferential
policies. And establishment of state-level development zones is
also under discussion, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Though underdeveloped, West China has its own advantages in
opening to the outside, because it shares border with a dozen-
strong countries.
</P>
<P>
West China refers to Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan,
and Guizhou provinces, Ningxia, Xinjiang and Tibet autonomous
regions, and Chongqing Municipality, with an area of 5.4 million
square kilometers and a population of 285 million, accounting for
56 percent and 23 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
By the first half of last year, the western area had approved
over 10,000 overseas-funded enterprises, compared with more than
200,000 in the east.

<HEADLINE> China to Reverse Deflation Trend by Year-End: Top Planning Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to rein in its
two-year-old trend of deflation by the end of this year, a senior
Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, told a press conference at the on-going Third
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) that thanks
to improved domestic and international economic conditions and the
Chinese government's policy to expand domestic demand, "the trend
of deflation will be basically reversed."
</P>
<P>
He gave an upbeat prediction to economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that economic growth will reach the target of
seven percent this year. If we do a good job in implementing
government policies, the growth rate may even be higher," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's foreign trade volume has begun to bounce
back in the latter half of last year, he said that China's imports
and exports may score more points.
</P>
<P>
Zeng admitted to uncertain factors that may affect China's
foreign trade this year, including the lingering impact of the
Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, he said that China plans to put 70
percent of the proceeds from treasury bonds, government-
appropriated funds and foreign loans into revitalizing its vast
western areas this year.
</P>
<P>
Ten "major" development projects will be launched, in addition
to 78 key projects which will garner 30 billion yuan of government
funding this year.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about China's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO), he said that over the 13 years of
protracted negotiations for China's accession to the world trade
body, China has not slowed down its pace of opening wider to the
outside world, though the U.S. failed to grant the permanent NTR
treatment to China.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.S. would make good its commitment and grant the
permanent NTR treatment to China as early as possible, as part of
the WTO deal reached between the two countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Top Army Brass Emphasizes Party Leadership over Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- General Zhang Wannian, a vice
chairman of the Central Military Commission, called on officers
and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to be absolutely
loyal to the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the call at a panel discussion attended by deputies
to the National People's Congress from the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"Upholding the Party's absolute leadership over the armed
forces is a fundamental principle for our army building," he said.
"All soldiers and officers of the PLA, leading officers at all
levels in particular, must have a clear stand on this question."
</P>
<P>
"The whole army should, under any circumstances, act according
to directions of the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at
the core, and maintain, for ever, its nature, original color, and
style as a people's army," the general said.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking during the discussion, Defense Minister Chi
Haotian, who is also a vice chairman of the Central Military
Commission and a state councilor, urged further implementing
military strategic guidelines in the new period, pushing ahead
with the building and reform of the army, and elevating the army's
modernization to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts should be made to foster and educate new-style
military talents of a high quality, further carry out military
exercises with focus on science and technology, make efforts to
improve the ability of managing the army and handle modern warfare
under the new situation, the defense minister said.

<HEADLINE> Top Corruption Fighter Vows to Wipe out Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's top corruption fighter
called for strict administration of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) and efficient measures to tighten supervision in a bid to
further promote the building of a clean government and good Party
style and eradicate corruption.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee Standing Committee and secretary of the CPC
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, made this call today
when attending a group discussion of Heilongjiang deputies to the
Ninth National People's Congress, in session here since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Leading Party officials should first of all strictly abide by
political disciplines, Wei said, adding that it is a question of
education and graft prevention for the majority of Party members
and officials, while for a handful of corrupt officials it means
severe punishment, with nowhere left for them to hide.
</P>
<P>
Two lines of defense should be erected, he said, referring to a
high ethical standard-Party disciplines and state laws. Leading
officials should tighten controls over their subordinates, spouses
and other family members.
</P>
<P>
Supervision should follow wherever officials go in an effort to
timely expose and deal with corruption cases or any violation of
law, Wei said, pointing to behind-the-scenes transactions.
</P>
<P>
Strict administration should begin with strict discipline, and
severe punishment should be meted out to whoever dares to defy
Party disciplines and state laws, Wei said, warning that "
peacemaking and philistinism" are prevailing within the Party.
</P>
<P>
Measures must be taken to show the Party's determination in
rooting out corruption in a bid to win back people's trust, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Pace for Adjusting Agricultural Structure to Be Accelerated: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a panel meeting of the deputies of the 9th National People's
Congress from Hunan Province on the on-going session, the premier
said that "we should never neglect or weaken the foundation of
agriculture at the time when Hunan, his native province in central
China, has relatively ample supply of grain and other farm
produce as elsewhere in the country."
</P>
<P>
He said effective measures should be taken in both agricultural
production and circulation so as to guide farmers in growing less
farm crops that do not gear to market demand and expanding the
acreage of high-quality farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
said the policies pertaining to grain circulation system is
expected to be further improved and the principle on purchase of
surplus grain from farmers at protective prices should be upheld.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the related policies on scope of grain
varieties to be purchased at protective prices should be
readjusted in order to protect the farmers' enthusiasm, to promote
the adjustment of agricultural production patterns, and to ease
the financial burden of the state.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the premier called for taking all means to increase
farmers' income and strictly implementing policies and measures to
relax the burden of farmers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkish Parties Bargaining for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Since the seven-year tenure of
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel will end on May 16, a severe
bargaining among political forces, mainly over the ruling
coalition-proposed amendment of the constitution for a second term
of Demirel, came to a scene and is still going on without
consensus.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution which forbids a second term of
president, the parliament will elect the successor of Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, hoping to avoid divisive
squabbles among his coalition partners over who should succeed
Demirel, has been campaigning to amend the constitution to allow
Demirel a second term in office.
</P>
<P>
An amendment to the constitution requires a two-thirds favor of
the parliament's 550 members, that is 367 votes, but the combined
strength of the ruling coalition in the parliament barely reaches
350, including the independent deputies who support it.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to draw supports from opposition parties, Ecevit
attached two other constitutional amendment items to his formula,
which concerned the conditions for banning a party and
parliamentarians' salaries.
</P>
<P>
However, the major opposition Islamist Virtue Party (FP), which
is facing a closure case at the Constitutional Court, called for
more expansive and definite changes on the subject, and threatened
to object to the Ecevit's three-item package unless its demands
were met.
</P>
<P>
The FP insisted that besides amending the constitutional clause,
which states that a party can be closed if it becomes "a focal
point of criminal activity", the part which says, "No political
party can be allowed to function if it is found to be the
'extension' of an already banned party," should also be amended.
</P>
<P>
In January 1998, the pro-fundamentalist Welfare Party (RP) led
by former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan was closed for anti-
secularist activities in Turkey, a country with a majority of
muslim but adopted secularism as a constitutional principle in
1937. The FP, which came into being a few months after the RP's
closure, has been accused in recent months of pursuing the same
anti-secular line as the RP and is reportedly facing possible
banning.  Meanwhile, the authorities have mounted a nation-
wide crackdown on the clandestine Islamic organization Hezbollah,
which wants to set up a fundamentalist regime in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
As time is running out to pass a possible constitutional
amendment
and hopes are now being pinned on negotiations expected to take
place during Kurban Bayrami, the 10-day Feast of the Sacrifice
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit had called for the issue to be discussed at the
inter-party conference committee in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the conference committee sessions led to intensive
bargaining between the FP and Ecevit's Democratic Left Party (DSP).
Ecevit's coalition partners, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP)
and Motherland Party (ANAP) tried in vain to seek a compromise.
</P>
<P>
The conference committee will discuss the package for the last
time Monday. But the meeting is not expected to change the
situation as the DSP is unwilling to make further concessions while
the FP is seeking to gain extra advantages through tough
bargaining.
</P>
<P>
Now that weeks of bargaining have yielded no results and the
minimum 367 votes needed for the constitutional amendment are
nowhere in sight, hopes are being pinned on a "secret" round of
bargaining expected to take place between the political parties
during the Bayram holiday.

<HEADLINE> Paris Club to Write off Nigeria's Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Paris Club is considering to
write off about 19 billion U.S. dollars debt owed by Nigeria by
the end of this month, French Ambassador to Nigeria Phillip
Peltier said.
</P>
<P>
The Punch, a Nigerian daily newspaper, Monday quoted Peltier as
saying that the Paris Club was well disposed to the recent
write-off of the debt the west African country owed to France.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the media at the weekend in the Nigerian capital
Abuja, Peltier said the move to write off the debt by the Paris
Club would be considered " before the end of March, 2000".
</P>
<P>
"We are doing our best to assist Nigeria to proffer a solution
to its numerous problems. We are not far from an agreement," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that the French government was determined to
invest in Nigeria, despite the recent religious crisis in some
parts of the country, adding the religious riot "is not enough to
discourage foreign investments in Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's foreign debt stock is estimated to reach 31 billion
U.S. dollars, among of which about 20 million U.S. dollars is owed
to the Paris Club.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ibrahim Bunu, minister of the federal capital
territory, also advised his fellow Nigerians to put aside the
religious differences and join hands with the government to
encourage foreign investment in the country.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Sends Envoy to Meet Ugandan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy of Sudanese
President Omar al-Bashir is in Uganda to present a message from
Bashir to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, a senior Ugandan
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ali Nimeri, also Sudanese State Minister of Foreign Affairs,
arrived here Sunday and he is expected to meet Museveni Monday or
later, Minister for Presidency Ruhakana Rugunda told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere said that
Museveni is till in northern Uganda and the timing for the meeting
is not clear yet.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the main content of the special message from
Bashir, Rugunda said that it mainly concerns the implementation of
the peace agreement signed by the two presidents in the Kenyan
capital Nairobi on December 8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi agreement between Uganda and Sudan aimed at
improving the bilateral relations between the two neighbors.
Since 1995, the two countries have been accusing each other of
allowing rebels to operate from their respective territories.
</P>
<P>
Museveni has on several occasions expressed dissatisfaction
with Khartoum's dragging in implementing the pact. A ministerial
meeting was last week held in Nairobi to review its
implementation.

<HEADLINE> Nearly Half of Ugandan Kids Below Normal Height: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 50 percent of all the
children in Uganda are below the normal height due to
insufficiently developed long bone, the Uganda Nutrition and Early
Childhood Development Project saud.
</P>
<P>
Some 38 percent of Ugandan children under six years of age are
stunted, the institution said in a report on Child and Home
Initiatives for Long- Term Development.
</P>
<P>
Stunting in children mainly results from insufficient diet
lacking in essential nutritional qualities. Other causes include
irregular or inappropriate feeding patterns, inadequate general
care, parenting practices that neglect affection, frequent illness
as well as poor personal hygiene.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition can weaken the immune system resulting in frequent
 infections, which further impedes growth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Kumi, a district in eastern Uganda,
has the highest number of stunted children under six. More than
60 percent of children in that age group there are suffering from
stunting.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian, Eritrean Leaders Confident in OAU Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) said here Monday that the leaders of Ethiopia and
Eritrea reaffirmed their confidence in OAU's efforts to achieve a
peaceful and lasting solution to their 22-month border dispute.
</P>
<P>
The technical arrangements of the OAU peace plan for the
settlement of Ethio-Eritrean conflict are yet to be fully accepted
by Ethiopia, the OAU said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But both Ethiopian and Eritrean leaders reaffirmed their will
to see that the technical arrangements are consistent with the
letter and spirit of the framework and the modalities.
</P>
<P>
An OAU delegation led by Ahmed Ouyahia, special envoy of
current OAU Chairman Abdelaziz Bouteflika, made shuttle visits
between the two nations from February 23 to March 5, 2000.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the two Horn of African countries, Ouyahia
met Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Eritrean President
Isaias Afwerki, focusing on the peaceful settlement of the war
between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea reaffirmed their acceptance of
the framework agreement and the modalities, two sections of a
three-part peace plan that endorsed by the 35th OAU Summit in
Algiers in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the technical arrangements, the third part of the
OAU's peace plan, the OAU statement said, "a consensus was reached
on some of their provisions while others require additional
efforts in order to secure the common acceptance of the full
document by both parties".
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, during his 12-day shuttle visit,
Ouyahia also held talks with OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed
Salim and Anthony Lake, special envoy of U.S. President Bill
Clinton over the settlement of the Ethio-Eritrean conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia has been actively engaged in a constructive dialog
with the OAU and its peace partners," the Ethiopian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs said in a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia wants the technical arrangements for implementing the
plan to be worked out through consultation and dialog.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Shows Interest on Van Nistelrooy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger confirmed his interest in PSV
Eindhoven striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy, but he added that any
possible deal is not imminent.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Netherlands are claiming that PSV are resigned
to losing the services of the prolific Dutch international to
Highbury next season.
</P>
<P>
Wenger saw Van Nistelrooy score a hat-trick for PSV against
Ajax last month to take his goal tally for the campaign to 22 - a
match also watched by Chelsea boss Gianluca Vialli and
representatives from Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal manager played down claims that a deal has been
already been agreed.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted: "He is a very good player - and he is one of
the players we are interested in.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if he will sign him because at the moment I am
more worried about our season and if we react it will be in May to
prepare for next season. At the moment we are not close to signing
anybody."
</P>
<P>
Van Nistelrooy has made a massive impact with PSV in the last
two seasons after learning his trade with Dutch Second Division
club Den Bosch.
</P>
<P>
After a season with Heerenveen, he signed for Eindhoven in 1998
and his first season brought him 31 goals in 34 games - and a
first cap for his country against Germany.
</P>
<P>
He scored his first international goal against Morocco last
April and this season has continued in the same prolific form with
Eindhoven to make him Dutch football's leading marksman.

<P>
"To be honest, I am fed up with it. It was racism directed at
me."

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Inmates' Families Under Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JI'NAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Cao Kai's father was jailed for
theft five years ago and his mother married another man. But the
boy did not turn into a street urchin although his life seemed
cruel and difficult.
</P>
<P>
Cared for by relatives and friends, and prison officers in
particular, Cao has been able to receive an education like other
children.
</P>
<P>
Now 12, he is a third-grader at a primary school in the city
of Zaozhuang in east China's Shandong Province. In January, before
the Spring Festival, the New Year on China's lunar calendar, the
boy unexpectedly received a gift -- 200 yuan (about 25 U.S.
dollars) from his father's prison hundreds of miles away, which
allowed him to enjoy a decent festival.
</P>
<P>
The money was not mailed by his father, who is serving a term
in the Ji'nan Prison of Shandong Province, but by a foundation at
the jail.
</P>
<P>
The foundation was started by the prison management
authorities with the goal of helping inmates whose families are in
economic difficulties, and was assisted by people from all walks
of life, including prison officers, inmate relatives, and
companies such as the Shandong Heavy-duty Motorcycle Group.
</P>
<P>
The day it was founded, January 14, it received 103,400 yuan (
about 12,457 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Liu Hong, a relative of a prisoner, took out 500 yuan from her
purse without a second thought when she learned that of the
foundation, saying, "The prison authorities are showing warm
hearts to inmates, so am I."
</P>
<P>
Inmates who are willing to help the needy relatives of their
peers can contribute 20 cents to the foundation each month, on a
voluntary basis. One inmate, Zhao Hu, said the foundation gives
him a chance to show a moral conscience.
</P>
<P>
Two prisoners-turned-businessmen, Zhu Dongfeng and Liu Guanglu,
donated 500 yuan each to the foundation, saying they want to do
something useful for society.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people have been recipients of the foundation,
which distributes money in amounts from 100 to 600 yuan, once a
year.
</P>
<P>
Huai Xiaoshan, the prison's deputy commander, said the
foundation complies with the central government's policy of
reforming inmates, and will help them cultivate a sense of being
helpful.
</P>
<P>
Apart from cash, prison officers also give care in other forms,
like visiting prisoners' families to send greetings, and donating
books, clothes, and other necessities to the needy.
</P>
<P>
To care for inmates, prisons in Beijing allow those who have
displayed good behavior to eat with their visitors, telephone
their families, and even stay with their spouses overnight during
festivals.

<HEADLINE> HK Media Hail Chinese Premier's Government Work Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's
government work report delivered at the Third Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing Sunday was commended
by the mass media here Monday as being "frank, practical and
realistic."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese language newspaper Ta Kung Pao Monday said in its
editorial titled "A practical, realistic government work report"
that in the premier's government work report, "there is more
practical analyses and figure quotes, and less visionary aged
slogans," while touching more and more on the expectations and
wishes of the ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji delivered another frank assessment of the
country's situation in his third government work report to the
Ninth National People's Congress, said South China Morning Post in
its editorial Monday.
</P>
<P>
The English language newspaper said what made the deepest
impression on delegates was probably the admission about anti-
corruption in the report. "There could be no illusion that the
premier was not serious about the fight against graft," the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
In a feature about Zhu's report, another Chinese language
newspaper Wen Wei Po said the report is realistic and there is no
lack of fresh suggestions for work for this year and for the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The feature said that the report for the first time did not
mention the country's GDP growth rate, and for the first time the
government work report stuck out the establishment of a social
security system and for the first time in the recent ten years the
government work report criticized Lee Teng-hui by name and placed
on a par Lee's "two-states statement" and "Taiwan's independence."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily said in an editorial that the
premier's report was permeated with a realistic and enterprising
spirit from the beginning to the end. It said that more than one
third of the report expounds sticking to the policies on enlarging
"domestic demands," restructuring the economic stratagem, keeping
on reforming and strengthening management.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three Hong Kong televisions Sunday broadcast alive
the NPC opening ceremony and Zhu's delivering of the report.

<HEADLINE> International Seminar on El Nino Held in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A four-day international seminar
about the impacts of El Nino on global climate was launched here
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Present at the seminar are dozens of scholars from 20 countries
including China, the United States, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Kenya and Panama.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was sponsored jointly by the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP), the National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR) of the United States and the Macao-based United
Nations International Institute for Software Technology.
</P>
<P>
According to the participants, human beings have noticed El
Nino phenomenon and related disasters rather early, but it is
during the recent years that meteorological scholars began to
conduct overall studies about the causes and impacts of El Nino in
global scope. However, the studies remain at a primary stage.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, the scale of El Nino phenomena has
tended to grow more serious, and the one occurring between 1997
and 1998 caused the most serious catastrophe in the century and
its impacts spread around the earth.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the UNEP and NCAR carried out a
project on reducing the impacts of environmental emergencies
through early warning and preparations. The project is expected to
last 19 months.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is part of the actions to promote the project. And
scholars hope that the seminar will enable them to make more
exchanges about their studies and help unveil the secrecy of El
Nino with the aid of higher scientific and technological means.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Gender &AMP; HIV/AIDS Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua)-- A symposium on Gender and HIV/AIDS
opened here today, with participants calling for more care for
women who are more prone to HIV/AIDS infection.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is co-sponsored by the Beijing offices of the UN
Department Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the UN Theme Group on HIV/AIDS,
and the All China Women's Federation, and is being coordinated
with International Women's Day on March 8.
</P>
<P>
Chief speaker Madhu Bal Nath, advisor on gender and HIV/AIDS at
UNIFEM headquarters, pointed out that among the world's 33.4
million adults who have been infected with HIV/AIDS, 43 percent
are women, and women account for about 50 percent of the 16,000
newly infected daily. These figures are expected to increase.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries have seen a drastic increase of HIV/AIDS
infection recently, and women living in poor conditions face even
tougher living and medical care conditions after becoming infected.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, this also brings harm to their children. According to
estimates, 1.7 million children under the age of 15 had died of
AIDS by the end of 1998, and 90 percent of them were infected by
their mothers.
</P>
<P>
Madhu Bal Nath pointed out that men should shoulder their due
responsibilities for the care of women, and be faithful to their
marriage partners.
</P>
<P>
Also, efforts, such as the establishment of poverty-relief
projects, should be made to improve the economic conditions of
women, so they will have a better chance to avoid HIV/AIDS
infection.

<HEADLINE> Teachers No Longer Rank Students Entirely on Their Grades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A survey by the Beijing Education
Science Institution shows that about 70 percent of middle and
primary school students do not like to be ranked on their grades
alone.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education passed a regulation recently stating
that teachers have no right to rank students according to their
scores or to make their scores public.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a 17-year old high school student killed his
mother with a hammer because she pressured him to improve his
grades and scores. The incident sent shock waves around the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Education, Chen Zhili, called for stringent
measures to relieve the workload of primary and middle school
students.
</P>
<P>
More and more educators believe that primary and middle schools
should not concentrate on the grades of students, but cultivate
and master good study habits at school and at home as well.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yunxiao, deputy director of the China Youth and Children's
Research Center, said students have the right to keep test results
to themselves.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bin, the state education supervisor, said that as test
scores keep changing, it is wrong to judge the performance of
students on grades alone. "We should not focus our attention
entirely on students' scores, because they do not reflect the
overall development of students."

<HEADLINE> China's Entry into WTO: Popular Topic in NPC Deputies's Panel Discussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, after its entry into WTO, China will face
many opportunities for development. "But the work of preparations
for the entry into WTO is very important for China's industries
and government departments to seize opportunities, to take
advantages and shun disadvantages," he added.
</P>
<P>
China has made the commitment that it will gradually open more
of its economic sectors to the outside world, including
telecommunications, banking, securities, insurance, commerce,
foreign trade, tourism and video industries.
</P>
<P>
According to economic analysts, upon its entry into WTO, many
of its economic sectors, including telecommunications, banking,
insurance, securities, foreign trade, automobile and foreign trade,
will be affected due to the low-level development on domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
Many NPC deputies have shown concerns for the training of
employees in various sectors. Pi Qiansheng, director of Tianjin
Municipal Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation,
said that those involved in the city's foreign trade and other
external affairs should acquaint themselves first with the rules
of WTO.
</P>
<P>
The rules, policies, laws and regulations for China's entry
into WTO is another hot topic for discussion among the deputies.
</P>
<P>
Wang Weicheng, said there are related laws and regulations
pertaining to planned economy in many sectors. If they are not
amended, they might hinder the retooling of state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, governments both at central and local
levels have gone in for preparations for entering WTO.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, has said that the Chinese government is screening the
existing laws and relations and revising some of those which do
not comply with WTO. He said his ministry is also working to
popularize some knowledge about WTO's regulations among its staff
members.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Municipal government has sponsored study sessions among
its leading officials on the related WTO knowledge and the
possible impact on the city following China's entry into WTO.

<TEXT>
<P>
Discussing a government work report delivered by Premier Zhu
Rongji at the ongoing session of the National People's Congress (
NPC) with NPC deputies from Tianjin, Li said, "With the deepening
of reforms and development of a market economy, we face an
increasing number of problems, especially those concerning
people's interests."
</P>
<P>
In such a situation, he said, doing a good job of mass work is
the key to ensuring progress in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Li, also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said, for
leading officials, being able to do mass work is a basic
requirement.
</P>
<P>
He called for leading officials to help people know where their
interests lie and be united in striving for their own interests.
</P>
<P>
He said mass work needs making earnest efforts and accumulating
experience.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that, fundamentally speaking, reform means a
readjustment of interests and that reform cannot benefit every
member of society. But reform should benefit the society as a
whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
In doing mass work, officials should know that the people are
masters of the country while officials are servants, he said. Li
urged officials to be strict with themselves, be honest and treat
people as equals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
today urged government officials to study earnestly advices and
suggestions proposed by deputies to the Ninth National People's
Congress, in session here since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Li did this when discussing with deputies from southwest
China's Sichuan Province the government work report delivered by
Premier Zhu Rongji Sunday. The deputies are meeting in Beijing for
an 11-day annual session to blueprint the nation's development
strategy for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the discussion, the vice premier also talked about
developing the vast western areas and the strategy of invigorating
the nation through education, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Major issues that dominated the Sichuan deputies'discussions
today include seizing opportunities created by the central
government strategy of developing the western areas, fully tapping
local natural resources, protecting the ecological environment,
furthering economic restructuring and raising the income level of
rural residents.
</P>
<P>
As a province with a huge population, Sichuan lags behind the
eastern regions in economic development, and the wealth disparity
is even widening, said a deputy named Zhang Zhongwei. He added
that Sichuan should cherish and seize opportunities as a result of
the government strategy of prioritizing western regions in its
economic work agenda.
</P>
<P>
Other issues discussed today were about improving water control
facilities when developing the west, fostering new and hi-tech
industries, accelerating development of education in ethnic
minority regions, and strengthening the preservation of ecological
environment.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Chinese Claiming War Compensation from Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese community in
Malaysia, which was forced to surrender its belongings during the
Japanese occupation of the country during the Second World War, is
claiming war compensation from the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
The claim of 500 million ringgit (about 131.578 million U.S.
dollars) was done in goodwill and friendship, without any
intention whatsoever of revenge or confrontation, Lai Kuan Fook,
chief executive secretary of the Federation of Chinese
Associations of Malaysia said in Kuantan, some 260 kilometers East
from here, Sunday night, according to Bernama news agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official briefed the Chinese community in Kuantan on the
efforts taken by the federation, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Lai said he, together with the federation's Secretary-General S.
T. Wong went to Tokyo last December 7 to send the memorandum of
claim to the Japanese Prime Minister's Department and the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Four of the federation's leaders were invited last month for a
dialogue with the Japanese ambassador to Malaysia who promised
that he would transmit their claims and views to Tokyo, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So far the Japanese government, its diplomats, officers from
Prime Minister's Department and Foreign Office never denied our
claim," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
If the claim was met, he said the federation proposed, among
others, to set up an education fund as well as to better equip the
Chinese old folks homes as they were the ones who suffered in the
hands of the Japanese military.
</P>
<P>
According to Lai, when Japanese troops invaded the then Malaya
(now Malaysia) in 1942, the Japanese military ruler had forced the
Chinese community to collect a sum of 50 million ringgit (about 13.
157 million U.S. dollars at the present rate), in "tribute money."
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it was extortion money as they were forced to hand
over their belongings at gun-point," Lai said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Online Health-Care Emerges in Australia  By Qi Zijian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- With the development of the
Internet and the popularity of the e-commerce, people were
thinking of the availability of the online health-care. Now this
new service is emerging in Australia.
</P>
<P>
A combined effort by the Australian government and the health-
care industry has boosted the online service that is described as
"a more efficient and interactive way which would bring about a
profound change to this industry."
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the federal government launched "Health Online:
A Health Information Action Plan for Australia," aimed at
harnessing information technology to improve the way health-care
is managed and delivered.
</P>
<P>
Health Online is a plan seeking to promote new ways of
delivering health services and providing information to consumers.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it is designed to help health providers such
as general practitioners, specialists and pharmacists keep up to
date with new therapies and procedures.
</P>
<P>
In the future, for example, Australians in regional areas will
increasingly use online "tele-health services" for high quality
and interactive health advice.
</P>
<P>
Doctors, on the other hand, will be using electronic links to
medical journals and online "chat rooms" to keep abreast of the
latest treatments and exchange notes.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that in the past the industry was slow to
accept database sharing or the Internet commerce transactions due
mainly to concerns about patient confidentiality and other privacy
issues.
</P>
<P>
However, the industry, which has been wasting vast amounts of
money through the delivery of unnecessary care, the performance of
redundant tests and procedures, and excessive paper-based
administration, is being transformed.
</P>
<P>
The analysts noted that the Internet could even topple
communication boundaries between consumers, providers, insurers,
and health-product distribution chains.
</P>
<P>
For example, they said, medical labs will use the Internet to
streamline the reporting of results to doctors and then expand
services to patients.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, consumers will be able to select their preferred e-
pharmacy for prescriptions, they said.
</P>
<P>
In Australia, the online health-care service is already in
development.

Late last year, Health Communications Network (HCN) listed on
the Australian Stock Exchange after raising 20 million Australian
dollars (13.2 million U.S. dollars) from investors.
</P>
<P>
The HCN, set up five years ago by the federal government to
develop electronic-communications infrastructure across the health-
care sector, provides Internet-based health information to more
than 70 percent of Australian hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The HCN's online education database includes articles from key
medical journals such as the Lance and the British Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the prospects of the online health-care, some of the
country's traditional mining or resources companies are
restructuring and transform themselves into providers of e-
commerce solutions for the health industry.
</P>
<P>
They provide complete management systems for health-care
companies. For individual physicians, the services include patient
billing, drug-information database, Internet stores for ordering
medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some of the companies are setting a higher target.
</P>
<P>
Around the world, vast amounts of data relating to cancer,
cardiac disease, trauma and immunization are collected by
hospitals and clinics.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the health-care industry's size and
fragmentation, a successful system has yet to be devised for the
data to be easily and efficiently shared among industry
participants.
</P>
<P>
These Australian companies are trying to provide medical
registry platforms to collect date from, and connect with one
another, doctors, hospitals, medical research groups and
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
As online health-care pioneers, these companies are beginning
to cast their view on the Asia-Pacific region.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 3,500 young staffers at
fourteen airports in central and south China today signed
agreements to donate blood as needed after any possible air
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The voluntary program, the first of its kind in the country,
was organized by the Ministry of Health and the Central-South
Bureau of the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China,
based on the idea that victims suffering from blood loss in an air
disaster be in immediate need of blood.
</P>
<P>
Airports are often quite distant from urban areas, and a health
official said that 90 percent of all air disasters occur near
airports within 10 minutes after an aircraft takes off or lands.
</P>
<P>
The agreements also ensure that once needed, the volunteers
will go to the accidents sites immediately to donate blood for the
victims.

<HEADLINE> Ross to Break Israeli-Palestinian Deadlock: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis
Ross will manage to bring Israelis and Palestinians back to the
negotiating table, the Jerusalem Post daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. special coordinator is expected back Tuesday for more
shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East region, trying to push forward
peace talks both on the Israeli-Palestinian and the Israeli-Syrian
tracks.
</P>
<P>
His mediation will be accepted this time, as all the sides are
sick of "the sinking mode" in the peace process and are ready to
give the peace a new chance, the report quoted one top member in
the Israeli negotiating team as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is Ross' second attempt in less than two weeks to break the
deadlock between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He returned to Washington last Monday after his compromise
formula failed to bring the sides together following a week-long
intensive efforts.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that he briefed U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the situation and came
back with new proposals.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks on both interim and final-status
issues were suspended after the breakdown of a summit between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat last month at the Erez check point on the Gaza-Israeli
border.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders could not resolve their differences over troop
redeployment from 6.1 percent of West Bank land, the size and
timing of the final withdrawal, and the question of whether a
framework agreement can be skipped.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum signed last September,
Israel and the Palestinians were to reach a framework agreement by
February 13 and conclude a final peace accord by September 13.
However, the framework deadline had already been missed because of
the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
During Ross' last trip here, Barak conveyed through him to the
Palestinians a bridging promise to be flexible on the next
withdrawal. However, his gestures were rejected by Arafat, who
complaining that Barak is responsible for the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority also sent signals after its
Friday night meeting that it would adopt unilateral measures
regarding declaring statehood and further withdrawal should Israel
continue ignoring the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The tense situation made some Israeli ministers, including
Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres, Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, and Justice minister Yossi Beilin, call on
Barak to pay more attention to the Palestinian track during their
cabinet meeting in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
There also have been several meetings between senior officials
of both sides to discuss ways to solving the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazan, met with
Israeli Knesset (Parliament) Speaker Avraham Burg in Tel Aviv
Sunday, following a meeting between Burg and Arafat in the West
Bank town of Ramallah on Friday. Beilin also met with Abbas in
Ramallah last week.

<HEADLINE> Husseini, Ben-Ami Discuss Issues Concerning Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO)
executive member in charge of Jerusalem affairs Faisal Husseini met
on Monday in West Jerusalem and discussed issues concerning
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The economic situation and daily business among the Palestinian
residents in East Jerusalem are getting worse and we are concerned
that if this situation has not been changed, East Jerusalem could
face some security problems," Husseini told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We raised this issue to the Israeli side for consideration and
urged the Israeli side to take some measures to help the
Palestinian residents to improve their daily life," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, he said, the security issues in East
Jerusalem has become another main topic and the two sides have
discussed several suggestions to maintain the security and order in
the city.
</P>
<P>
"In our view that Jerusalem is still under occupation and only
the success of the peace process can help solve the Jerusalem
issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the housing problems among Palestinian residents in
East Jerusalem, he said he had asked the Israeli side not to
demolish any more Palestinian homes built without the so-called
permits.
</P>
<P>
According to figures issued by the Palestinian side, there are
about 180,000 Palestinian living in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for Pope John Paul II's visit to Israel and the
Palestinian territories later this month, Israel has stopped house
demolitions for some time in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Husseini said he had also asked the Israeli side to
consider release of more Palestinian prisoners from East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said that security cooperation between the two sides is
so important for maintaining order in East Jerusalem and the
Palestinian side has promised to do so in the future.
</P>
<P>
"It is Israel's sole responsibility to protect Pope John Paul's
visit to Jerusalem, but it is also necessary to coordinate with the
Palestinian side in this matter to prevent any eventuality from
happening," Ben-Ami said.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that Israel will take measures to help improve
the economic situation for the Palestinian residents in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian residents should receive equal treatment in
dealing with daily business as the local Israelis," he added.
</P>
<P>
As asked whether he will continue to meet foreign leaders and
diplomats in the Orient House in East Jerusalem which the Israeli
side does not like, Husseini told Xinhua that he will do so in the
future because East Jerusalem is part of the Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
"Our position on this matter is very clear and no body can stop
us to do that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Husseini called Jerusalem-based foreign diplomats to a meeting
in the Orient House last week, informing them that Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat will not meet the foreign leaders and
diplomats if they refuse to meet Husseini in the Orient House.
</P>
<P>
Orient House is in fact the representative office of the PLO in
East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> France Encourages Investment in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 (Xinhua) -- France is encouraging more
investment in Malaysia as the latter is undergoing fast economic
recovery, its Minister of State for Foreign Trade Francois Huwart
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Confident of your economy, we are encouraging on behalf of our
government for a better cooperation and more investment in
Malaysia," he told reporters after meeting with Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Putra Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
The state minister said France had many world-class companies
with vast experience in the areas of environment, energy and
automotive and their participation in Malaysia would enhance the
current cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He described Paris-Kuala Lumpur ties as excellent and said the
bilateral ties between the two countries were not merely confined
to partnership or joint ventures but also extended to other areas
such as technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
He also said his talks with Mahathir were "fruitful." They
discussed, besides bilateral relations, globalization and the
prime minister expressed his concern about the many negative
consequences of the process such as employment, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I can say that we, the French government, think we are in
favor of a regulated globalization... a more balanced one," he
said.
</P>
<P>
France is the 13th biggest investor in Malaysia with direct
investment for 1994-98 totaling 510 million ringgit (about 134.21
million U.S. dollars). There are some 170 French companies
operating in Malaysia, among which are automobile company Citroen,
telecommunication company Alcatel and Carrefour hypermarkets.
</P>
<P>
The total Malaysia-France trade in 1999 amounted to 8 billion
ringgit (about 2.105 billion dollars) against 4.191 billion
ringgit (about 1.102 billion dollars) in 1998, a 34 percent drop
from that in 1997 due to the regional economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Huwart, leading a 20-member delegation, arrived here Sunday
night on a one-day visit.

<HEADLINE> India to Launch Mission to Moon in 2008 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the ISRO said in Bangalore that the mission could
take place in 2008 and it could be undertaken by using the
technology available within the ISRO and by suitably modifying the
existing Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the mission, ISRO Chairman Krishnaswami
Kasturirangan said the proposed lunar mission "can provide impetus
to science in India, challenge to technology, and possibly a new
dimension to international cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ISRO spokesman S. Krishnamurti said that a high
level meeting of space and other scientists held recently at
Ahmedabad endorsed ISRO's decision to launch a lunar mission
officially announced first in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary studies to examine the scientific aspects and
technical feasibility of undertaking the mission to the Moon are
already on," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, the Indian Moon mission
is justifiable in the context of renewed interest by the
international community following recent observations suggesting
presence of water in the Moon and the fact that private
enterprises in advanced countries are trying to establish
permanent self-supporting community on the Moon.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland's Aviation Group Makes Less Money in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- SAirGroup, owner of Switzerland's
national carrier Swissair, registered a profit of 273 million
Swiss francs (about 164 million U.S. dollars) in 1999, 24 percent
lower than in the previous year, according to latest figures
published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
SAirGroup attributed the decline to the downturn in the air
transport sector, saying that last year was a difficult time to
make money in the airline industry with fuel costs soaring and cut-
throat competition on key transatlantic routes keeping ticket
prices down.
</P>
<P>
Despite last year's poor performance, SAirGroup chief executive
officer Philippe Bruggisser was optimistic about the future of his
company.
</P>
<P>
"In building our aviation group, we are creating an
increasingly steady earnings base. And with the stability that
this provides, we are excellently placed to finance further
expansion," said Bruggisser.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years SAirGroup has transformed itself into
an organization with two prime areas of activity -- Swissair and
airline-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
The company said that airline-related activities made a
substantial contribution to income generation, helping offset the
adverse impact of the downturn in the airline cycle.

<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie are
poised to sue their former nanny, The Mail on Sunday, and a
literary agent for damages after an intimate account of their
family life was published in the newspaper's early editions.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Philip Morris, the world's biggest cigarette company, is

sector and into luxury hotels, or media or mobile phones, to make
wider use of its Marlboro brand.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The cornerstone of Mohamed Fayed's claim that his son Dodi
and Diana, Princess of Wales, were planning to marry and that the
couple chose an engagement ring while on holiday in the south of
France is undermined Monday by the bodyguard who nearly died with
them. Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the Paris crash in
August 1997, described the suggestion about the ring as "a myth".
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Dozens of helicopters and supplies worth about 25 million
pounds were finally dispersed across Mozambique Sunday as the
operation to rescue flood victims from imminent death turned into

</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor leaders have been warned that the party could lose the
next general election if one in five of its traditional supporters

<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua)-- The Japanese government today
donated about 82,000 U.S. dollars to a school in a poor town in
Shandong Province, east China.
</P>
<P>
The donation will be used to finish the construction of a
school building that was begun four years ago but is still
unfinished for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
The school is the only one in the town of Haogezhuang. It has
more than 700 students and was built in the 1960s. Moreover,
because of last summer's flooding, the school building has become
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government, through its embassies and consulates,
is providing aid in small sums to China and other developing
countries to improve local medical and educational conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Pilot Hasan Musharafa, chief of EgyptAir's Operations Sector,
said two simulations will be conducted for the incidents of the
Egyptian plane that crashed off the U.S. coasts on October 31 as
new information emerged on the accident.
</P>
<P>
Musharafa, who participated in the investigation procedures,
said the U.S. national Transportation Safety Board decision to
resume fishing out the rest of the plane wreckage, particularly the
second engine and the flight control system proves that
investigations are proceeding on the right course.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The Arab Labor Organization (ALO) conference resumed on
Sunday its proceedings to discuss a report by its Director General
Ibrahim Kwaider on manpower problems and he unemployment rates on
the threshold of the new century.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign Minister Amr Moussa denied the U.S. warning against
Egypt over its support to Lebanon. Egypt did not receive messages
or warnings from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was responding to the question from the press on whether
he and other Arab Foreign Minister had received any American
messages in this respect as some news media reported.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- President Hosni Mubarak Sunday paid a visit to land

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Beefed-up security measures, which caused traffic jams in
many cities and towns in Israel Sunday, are likely to remain in
force until the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Security sources reported that more explosive devices had
been prepared by Hamas bomb-makers than those found or which
exploded in the raid of their Taibeh hideout last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police head Yehuda Wilk told reporters Monday that the
security forces had managed to cut off one terrorist branch, but
not all of them.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and American intelligence agencies are locked in
dispute over Syrian President Hafez al-Assad's medical condition. A

CIA report recently handed over to Israel states that Assad is
stricken with "intermittent dementia."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Military Intelligence, however, does not approves of

the manner in which this diagnosis was made through a compilation
of reports by people who have met Assad personally and those who
have heard of fluctuations in his coherence and ability to
concentrate.
</P>
<P>
The dictionary definition of dementia is "a condition of
deteriorated mentality, often with emotional apathy" and is usually
treated by psychiatric and geriatric physicians.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli cabinet Sunday voted unanimously to withdraw the
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from Israeli-occupied security zone in
south Lebanon to the international border by July, 18 years after
the Lebanon War, and less than a year after Prime Minister Ehud
Barak promised so in his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
After 13 hours of intensive debate, all 23 ministers agreed
to leave South Lebanon with or without an agreement. This cabinet
resolution, unlike previous promises is binding, and the IDF has
already been ordered to prepare for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Education Minister Yossi Sarid's decision to add works by
Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish to Israel's high-school literature
curriculum has been objected by Barak.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions are not yet ripe for teaching Darwish in the
schools," Barak told his confidants Saturday night in his first
comment on a subject that is threatening to shake the coalition yet
again.
</P>
<P>
Darwish is known for his poem about longing for the Palestinian
statehood and the suffering of displaced Palestinians. Sarid's
decision has riled opposition circles and may lead the opposition
Likud party to submit motion of no confidence against the prime
minister on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Initiate ASEAN Human Rights Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will initiate a plan to
establish the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) human
rights regional forum, a senior official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"As the first state in ASEAN which has the ministry of human
rights, Indonesia will initiate a plan to form a joint
consultation forum on human rights affairs, the forum may be
called ASEAN regional forum on human rights," Minister of Human
Rights Affairs Hazballah M. Saad told Xinhua in a sidelines of
hearing with the House of Representatives (DPR) Commission I on
security, foreign policy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know exactly how the forum will work, but I
think it will be a consultation forum under which ASEAN members
can discuss together and help each other on human rights issues,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"In ASEAN, there is only Indonesia which has the ministry of
human rights, and up to now (in ASEAN) there is yet a special
forum to discuss human rights issues. This is very important to
initiate such a forum so ASEAN countries can handle their human
rights problem well without any pressure and intervention from
external side and can help each other," Saad said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will socialize this plan to ASEAN members and then
invite them to discuss such a proposal in the near future, may be
in June, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a hearing with the Commission I, Saad said that
Indonesia has got supports from Scandinavian countries
particularly Norway in connection with the plan.
</P>
<P>
"This (forum) is expected to be a forum to restore Indonesian
credibility (on human rights issues) in the world," he said.

<HEADLINE> Remains of Ancient Plank Road Found in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, MARCH 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists recently
found the remains of a plank road constructed during the Three
Kingdoms (220-280) period on the east bank of the Qinhe River, a
tributary of the Yellow River, in southern Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts found square-shaped and orderly arranged holes, 30
centimeters long and 50 centimeters deep, built along a nearly 200-
meter-long section of a cliff by the lower reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
The holes are parallel with the surface and about three to four
meters apart. On some sections, the holes are divided into two
rows.
</P>
<P>
An original inscription was also found on a nearby cliff,
saying that a thousand soldiers and craftsmen built a plank road
and related buildings here during the Three Kingdoms.
</P>
<P>
According to the inscription, experts have concluded that the
holes on the cliff were remains of the plank road, which was
presumably constructed in the year of 224 by the Wei Kingdom, one
of the three great powers in China at that time.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) --South China's Guangdong Province
will reduce its present government payroll by 49.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, when the work is accomplished, the
number of governmental departments will be slashed from 44 to 24,
but the number of the provincial government's affiliated
organizations will rise to 17.
</P>
<P>
Four new organizations will also be set up, including three
which will be responsible for section management.
</P>
<P>
During the restructuring, 15 percent of all department chiefs,
as well as another 25 percent of the section chiefs, will be
removed to their posts, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, these laid-off government workers
either will be sent to study at universities or to work at state-
owned enterprises administered by the province or at grassroots
units or organizations affiliated to the provincial government.
They will also be encouraged to start up their own businesses,
local sources said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Governor Lu Ruihua said a detailed
plan regarding the size of each department of the provincial
government will be completed this month.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that they will accomplish the restructuring in three
years and attempt to employ several methods for properly
relocating the laid-off governmental workers.
</P>
<P>
This reshuffling, designed to slim down over-staffed
governmental departments at the central level, was completed in
late 1998.

<HEADLINE> Fetus Removed from Young Chinese Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- An autoecious fetus that has been in
the abdomen of a young man in Shaanxi Province, northwest China,
for 28 years was surgically removed recently.
</P>
<P>
A physician at a hospital attached to Hanzhong Medical School
found the 6-kilogram cyst containing an ossified male fetus as he
performed an operation on a 28-year-old farmer, surnamed He.
</P>
<P>
"The fetus' teeth, hair, skin and pubes are similar to that of
an adult, but his anus and bellybutton and those of a fetus. His
genitalia is the size of a three-year-old kid," said Liu Jianmin,
who was in charge of the operation.
</P>
<P>
Liu called the fetus an identical twins of the patient.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary diagnosis made by the Xi'an University of Medical
Science shows that the fetus was a germ cell that became a
parasite in a normally growing fetus which ceased to grow in the
course development. It then lived on the nutrition provided by the
spleen artery of the patient.
</P>
<P>
The family of He said his stomach was larger than ordinary when
he was born. The fetus was found during an ultrasonic wave check-
up after his stomach was injured in fieldwork.
</P>
<P>
Liu and his colleague described this as an unprecedented
medical phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Single Account System Introduced to Check Misuse of Construction Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, a reform-
pioneering province in south China, plans to experiment with the
treasury single account system, a kind of new system under which
payment for government-funded projects will be directly made by
the exchequer.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the second half of this year, Guangdong would
adopt the system for all local construction projects involving the
use of government funds, said Provincial Governor Lu Ruihua, a
deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) who is
currently attending its 3rd annual session.
</P>
<P>
The new account system will be in taxpayers' interests and
commensurate with Premier Zhu Rongji's statement that "reform of
the administration and management system should be deepened to
strengthen supervision and restraint mechanisms" in his government
work report to the on-going NPC session on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the NPC session this morning, Xiang Huaicheng,
minister of finance, said, "we will undertake to study how to
implement the treasury single account system as a basic measure to
tighten management, combat corruption and thus help build a clean
and honest government."
</P>
<P>
The payment system will make the financial work transparent and
check the misuse and even deflation of funds for construction
projects by local governments, units or individuals, while
enabling banking departments to control and utilize funds still
more effectively, in a bid to avoid repeated, overlapped
construction and wastes, according to a Finance Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister further noted that violations of relevant
regulations and law-breaking activities are rather serious in
banking and economic work; financing cannot be fully guaranteed;
the pace for readjusting spending patterns, though already
initiated, are still too slow and too ineffective.
</P>
<P>
These reform measures constitute "a major component part of the
current banking reform and an objective requirement for
implementing the principles of administering the country by law
and ensuring that the government performs its duties in compliance
with the law.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is a necessary requirement for increasing economic
and budgetary supervision and a very effective means of building a
clean and honest government through the methods of improving the
banking system."
</P>
<P>
This year, the central government plans to appropriate as high
as 89.3 billion yuan (10.8 billion US dollars) to capital
construction and issue another 388 billion yuan (45.5 billion US
dollars) of treasury bonds for investment in this sector.
Meanwhile, local governments will invest handsomely in
infrastructure. And some local observers acknowledged that the use
of these funds will surely produce great effects on the country's
economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Western Regions: China's New Hope in New Century (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts stressed that the great development of the west calls
for finding solutions to sharp contradictions between development
and the environment, between population size and resources.
</P>
<P>
Yang Fan, a researcher of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that in coming decades, it will be unrealistic for
China to settle all its newly increased population in its eastern
areas, which are already densely populated and deficient in
resources.
</P>
<P>
The vast western region with rich resources has great potential
to attract the newly-born population, he said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Yang said, China's economic development, including
that in east China, has been affected by insufficient demands.
Quite a lot of funds, technology and labor need to find new areas
to flow to.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the country's west can become a new economic growth
area, predicting that, when developed, it can absorb more than 300
million people, provide more than half of east China's energy
needs and 60 percent of its raw materials needs.
</P>
<P>
Though no details have been worked out, the strategy of
developing the west will definitely prioritize protection of
ecological environment and infrastructural construction.
</P>
<P>
With China's impending entry into the World Trade Organization
(WTO), more foreign investment is expected to go to the country's
west, they said.
</P>
<P>
The west faces a host of challenges. It has a weak
infrastructure, and is deficient in technology, talented people
and funds. That is why achieving the objectives of developing the
west is a long-term task and a systems project, as Premier Zhu
Rongji said.

<P>
Zeng Peiyan, Minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, told a press conference at the on-going Third
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) that over
the 13 years of protracted negotiations for China's accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO), China has not slowed down its
pace of opening wider to the outside world, though the U.S. failed
to grant the permanent NTR treatment to China.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.S. would make good its commitment and grant the
permanent NTR treatment to China as early as possible, as part of
the WTO deal reached between the two countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Destiny of State Sector Heatedly Discussed (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The central gvovernment is also cool-headed in assessing the
problems. President Jiang Zemin has pointed out that restructuring
of state industries and retooling of state enterprises remains a
long-term task.
</P>
<P>
Li Qingyun, an economist from the prestigious Beijing
University, said a top priority for SOE reform in the future is to
establish a market-oriented management system in state firms,
turning them into modern enterprises efficient in management and
sensitive to market changes.
</P>
<P>
But pulling State enterprises out of financial difficulties
doesn't naturally result in a complete retructuring of the economy,
which calls for closing more inefficient enterprises, eliminating
excessive production capacities, and withdrawing state-owned
economic presence in some sectors, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The space for growth in traditional industries is already
limited for the state economy, and the state sector needs to seek
new growth areas for the next century, according to Lu Xueyi, also
an economist with the Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
His veiw is echoed by Xu Kuangdi, mayor of Shanghai. Citing
successful technological innovations as a major contributor to
local industries' new competitive edge, Xu said that Shanghai will
focus on developing bio-medicine and an information industry,
waste no time in building an advanced computer center, speed up
the building of a new system for translating new technological
findings into products, facilitate growth of high-tech industries,
and attracte talents.
</P>
<P>
For firms in the traditional industries, however, they need to
upgrade equipment to sharpen their competitive edge. Li Xinjia, a
deputy from south China's Guangdong Province, said the ability to
develop new products with self-owned intellectual property rights
concerns the survival or death of state enterprises, and such
enterprises also need to follow the glogal economic trend to
survive competition.
</P>
<P>
The root cause for all problems facing the state sector,
however, is attributed to a lack of talents. The deputies here
agreed that staffing state enterprises with high-quality managers
is crucial to brightening their prospects in the new century.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- With the turning-around of loss-
making operations in the state sector already within reach, the
destiny of the sector is becoming a hot issue for deputies to the
nation's legislature and members of its top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) and
members of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) agreed here that the
future of the state sector is crucial to achieving a sound
national economy blessed with sustainable growth and a successful
reform of the economic system.
</P>
<P>
A looming challenge for the sector is China's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO). "We barely have the time to
celebrate our turning-around last year, because we are facing an
even bigger challenge from a flood of cheap foreign petrochemical
products as a result of the WTO membership," said Bai Chengqiang,
president of the Jilin Petrochemical Industry Group.
</P>
<P>
Other than petrochemicals producers, China's impending entry
into the WTO is expected to impact the nation's manufacturers of
automobiles, textiles and electronic products. Even if some State
firms have pulled out of difficulties and started to turn a profit,
it is widely held that these firms are not strong enough to rival
multinationals.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that the potential danger for profitable
state firms to deteriorate into money losers will become a
prominent problem in the future. To prevent the worst from
happening, they said, a series of problems need to be addressed
immediately such as inefficient management, lack of a market
awareness, huge debts, and sluggish market demand.
</P>
<P>
Li Jingwen, an economist from the Academy of Social Sciences
and a CPPCC Natonal Committee member, said a complete turn-around
for the state sector calls for even greater efforts in the next
ten years.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Mexico Sign Free-Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Mexico signed here
Monday a free trade agreement, eliminating most customs charges
imposed by the two sides on each other's imports.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and his Mexican counterpart
Rosario Green signed the agreement at a ceremony also attended by
President Ezer Weizman and visiting Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
The agreement entitles Israel to free trade with all three
members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which
also include the United States and Canada, but leaves it somewhat
short of the rights enjoyed by full NAFTA members.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo arrived here Saturday night for a four-day visit at the
invitation of Weizman. He is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister
Ehud Barak later Monday.

<HEADLINE> 29 Palestinian Students Detained for Stoning Jospin Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-nine Palestinian students
detained for stoning French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin have been
released, a Palestinian source said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The release was ordered by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of the students were freed from Jericho prison, and the
rest from Bethlehem and Nablus, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Of the initial 120 students arrested for hurling stones at
Jospin on February 26 when the French prime minister visited
Birzeit University in the West Bank city of Ramallah, the 29 freed
overnight were the last to be remain in detention.
</P>
<P>
Jospin was slightly injured in the head in the incident,
triggered by his remarks in Israel, in which he branded the
Lebanese resistance group Hezbollah as "terrorists."
</P>
<P>
Arafat denounced the stoning incident and ordered the closure of
Birzeit University. He also apologized to Jospin for the incident.
Palestinian police made over 100 arrests under the case, triggering
continuous clashes in the West Bank in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Students at Birzeit University had boycotted courses since
Wednesday to protest their fellow students' detention. Some 100
went on hunger strike over the matter on Saturday. On Sunday,
hundreds of Palestinians had marched in Ramallah, calling for
students' release.
</P>
<P>
Commander of Palestinian Preventive Security Gebriel Ragoub said
Sunday that the two-week crisis is heading for detente. "What has
happened in the university was unintentional and unplanned," he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Announce New Senates on March 21 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Candidates winning in Thailand's
first senatorial election, held on March 4, will be officially
announced on March 21 provided that they receive a unanimous vote
of endorsement from the Election Commission of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Thai News Agency (TNA) quoted a latest report of the
Election Commission as saying Monday that the process to fully
review the election and scrutinize the reportedly alleged frauds
and irregularities to ensure free and fair votes was underway, and
was expected to be completed and finally announced by the time the
current Senate's term ends on March 21.
</P>
<P>
An advanced vote was arranged for Thai people, aged 18 upwards,
living overseas, and for local citizens who were unable to
exercise their rights on the exact election day, March 4.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that as of last night, results from 51
provinces had been handed over, and the rest were expected Monday.
</P>
<P>
The commission would consider all complaints filed against
individual candidates, who would have a chance to deny the
allegation and clear themselves.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's first democratic Senate election ended Saturday,
with an unexpectedly high voting rate.
</P>
<P>
The election is the first one since Thailand adopted
constitutional rule 68 years ago and is widely seen as the first
test of the country's political reform under its 1997 constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under the new charter, senators will be elected, rather than
hand-picked by the prime minister, and will be entitled with more
substantial power than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
So the competition for the 200 seats in the upper house turned
out to be quite fierce.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Secures $2M Housing Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has secured
a two- million-U.S. dollar loan for the construction of at least
450 low-cost houses countrywide, a government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
National Housing Authority spokesman Juddah Mundunda said at
the weekend that the construction would be financed through a loan
agreement between the Zambian government and the Nairobi-based
Shelter Afrique Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said 500,000 dollars of the loan had already been disbursed
to the Zambian government and the first phase of the housing
program would involve the construction of 100 units in the capital
Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
According to Times of Zambia newspaper reports Monday, the 450
houses will be built in each of Zambia's nine provinces to
supplement the Presidential Housing Initiative.
</P>
<P>
Under the on-going program, Zambia plans to construct more than
100,000 houses a year in the next 10 years to resolve the current
pressing housing problem in the country.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Cuts Down Funding to Former President Kaunda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has cut down
its funding to the office of former President Kenneth Kaunda to
122 million kwacha (about 46,000 dollars) from 319 million kwacha
(about 120,000 U.S. dollars) last year, The Post newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP) described
the reduction as political, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Rabbison Chongo, chairman of the Finance and Economic Affairs
of the UNIP, said that the reduction only confirmed that the
government is not conformable with Kaunda, who ruled the country
after its independence in 1964 until 1991, when he was defeated by
current President Frederick Chiluba in a multi-party elections.
</P>
<P>
Chongo dismissed earlier reports in the state media that
Kaunda's office has been offered 300 million kwacha as this year's
allocation.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba has repeatedly urged Kaunda to quit party politics to
be respected as founding father of the country, but Kaunda has
rejected his appeals.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Sets up Committee to Raise Funds for Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's parliament has set up a
parliamentary committee to raise funds and other materials for
flood victims in Mozambique, a senior parliamentarian said.
</P>
<P>
"The Zambian parliament members have responded to the call to
help our brothers and sisters in Mozambique and so far a committee
has been set up to raise money for the flood victims," said Vernon
Mwaanga, parliamentary chief of the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians found it prudent to help alleviate the
sufferings of the people in the flood-hit Mozambique, the Times of
Zambia newspaper Monday quoted Mwaanga as saying lately.
</P>
<P>
The money would be deposited in the SOS-Mozambique account and
other materials would be directed to the SOS-Mozambique committee
headed by Sebastian Kopulande, former Zambian Permanent Secretary
at State House.
</P>
<P>
Mwaanga also commended the government for donating 120 tons of
food and medical aid worth over one million U.S. dollars to the
displaced people in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's response was in line with the
resolutions of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
emergency meeting, compelling all member countries to be involved
in the Mozambique situation.
</P>
<P>
The 14-member SADC was also working on long-term plans to
rebuild infrastructures after the Cyclone Eline-induced floods.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has been hit by devastating floods for the past
three weeks. Reportedly, about two million people have been
displaced.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The three East African Community
countries have undertaken a project to build a high capacity
digital transmission network as part of the planned network
expansion, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
East Africa's Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania last October signed
the East African Community Treaty aimed at promoting a regional
economic integration and building a common trade market.
</P>
<P>
The project, funded through a 70-million-U.S. dollar loan from
the East African Development Bank and the European Development
Bank, is to help the region take greater advantage of new digital
technology.
</P>
<P>
Local trade experts said that poor telecommunications in the
region is one of the areas that has held back further
consolidation of trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors to the region have also complained that
inadequate communication infrastructure restricts them to urban
areas, while raising their cost of investing elsewhere in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
The project will involve rehabilitation and expansion of the
existing communication facilities. New satellites compatible
with digital communication will also be installed, the weekly
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's hospitality industry will
launch an international program this week to accommodate the
preferences of smokers and non-smokers in the country's hotels.
</P>
<P>
The program sponsored by the Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers
and Caterers will be launched Wednesday, the East African weekly
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "the Courtesy of Choice", the program is meant to create
smoking and non-smoking zones in hospitality establishments
through the use of existing ventilation systems and air-flows.
</P>
<P>
The areas are appropriately designated, using signs and table
cards for the convenience of guests and tourists.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya's capital Nairobi, several major hotels including the
Hilton Hotel and Nairobi Safari Club are already running the
program on a voluntary and self-regulatory basis.
</P>
<P>
Peter Nduru, chief executive of the association, said that the
initiative is one of the measures taken by the country's
hospitality industry to revitalize the sector, as Kenya's tourism
industry is currently experiencing an upward surge in bookings
after a three-year slump.

<HEADLINE> Community Clash Kills 30 People in Southern Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The community clash caused by land
disputes in Nigeria's southern Osun State have claimed over 30
lives by Sunday, the leading Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Ogunsua, or traditional ruler of Modakeke in Osun State,
Francis Adedoyin Sunday accused Ogun Governor Adebisi Akande of
insensitivity to the clash which began on Friday between his
domain and the university town of Ife.
</P>
<P>
Adedoyin said nine indigenes in his domain have died including
a clergyman.
</P>
<P>
But the State Commissioner of Police of Osun, Johnson Nwoye
said that the situation was under control and more policemen have
been deployed to the crisis zone from the nearby states.
</P>
<P>
Local police ruled out any link between the Ife-Modakeke
flare-up with bloody religious rioting that has killed hundreds of
people in northern and southeastern Nigeria in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The townspeople of Ife and Modakeke, both inhabited by Yorubas,
one of the three main ethnic groups in the country, have a
long-standing rivalry over land ownership and political supremacy
in the area that has sporadically erupted into violence since
1997.

<HEADLINE> Tibet to Conduct Fifth Census This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region in
southwest China plans to conduct a population census this year,
according to regional government officials.
</P>
<P>
This will be the region's fifth census, following the previous
one in 1990.
</P>
<P>
This census was decided on by the central government in 1998
and preparations have been in full swing at all levels, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
A special office and a leadership panel have been set up for
the census, which will cover many aspects of Tibet's population,
including population structure and living conditions there.
</P>
<P>
Current official figures show that the current population of
the autonomous region stands at 2.44 million, 95 of whom are
ethnic Tibetans and five percent Han and other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials say the census will provide reliable
sources for the region's plans to develop its economy and maintain
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The census will also have an influence on China's strategy of
developing western China, as well as Tibet's overall social and
economic development in the 21st century, the officials added.

<HEADLINE> New Genetic Technique for Wild Panda Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- With a newly developed genetic
probe, China now is able to categorize various biological features
of its wild giant panda population.
</P>
<P>
The probe is the world's only instrument for identifying animal
parenthood and genetic background, according to Zhang Anju, of the
Chengdu Panda Breeding and Research Base, one of the instrument's
inventors.
</P>
<P>
With the probe, scientists can abstract the full genome from
panda droppings to determine population features, sex percentages,
age configuration, family tree, genetic diversity, and evolution
process.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species,
and it is difficult to track them in the wild, much less conduct
research, experts say.
</P>
<P>
This new technique is expected to help Chinese scientists learn
more about wild pandas in order to offer better protection for
them, Zhang noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang, capital of Liaoning
Province in northeast China and one of the country's old
industrial bases, is now China's robot development center, Xinhua
has learned.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tianran, director of the Shenyang Automation Institute
affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told Xinhua that
the institute has developed spot welding robots, assembling robots,
carrying robots, and many other types of robots since it began
research in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
These products are widely used in automatic-welding production
lines in the manufacturing of automobiles and engineering
machinery, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The institute also developed a robot in 1997 which can work 6,
000 meters under the sea, and now China is one of five countries
approved by the United Nations to conduct deep-sea mining.
</P>
<P>
The institute created the Xinsong Robot Automation Co., Ltd. in
1998, named after Jiang Xinsong, the "father of China's Robots."
</P>
<P>
The company has completed more than 60 programs for robot
engineering appliances and developed over 120 robot units, earning
some 300 million yuan (about 36 million U.S. dollars) in pre-tax
profit.
</P>
<P>
The company now accounts for one-third of China's total robot
output.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Mobile Communication System for Railway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Railway Ministry has put a new
wireless mobile communication system into operation in the
construction of a railway in the southern part of the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Based on digital technology, the new systems enables people to
communicate at a distance of nearly one kilometer along the
construction route, said Wei Zuqing, inventor of the system and an
engineer with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
In the past, railway personnel had to set up temporary aerial
cables for communications along the construction line. After
construction of one section of the railway was finished, the cable
equipment was dismantled and moved to another site, a very
difficult and inefficient procedure.
</P>
<P>
The new system requires far less investment and time and labor,
and officials with the Ministry of Railways suggest that it can
also be used in oil exploitation, geological exploration, and
traffic-infrastructure construction projects.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Invest Heavily in Its "Silicon Valley" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has kicked off
a massive project to reinforce investment in its Zhongguancun area,
one of the country's demonstration zones for the high-tech
industry.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Liu Qi said the municipal government will invest
one billion yuan (about 120 million U.S. dollars) this year as
development funds for small and medium-size high-tech enterprises
in the area, known as China's "Silicon Valley."
</P>
<P>
These fund will come from Beijing Holdings Ltd., the only
listed company of the Beijing Municipal Government in Hong Kong.
The company has so far raised four billion HK dollars, three
billion of which has been used as investment for Beijing's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Zhongguancun, located in northwest Beijing, is home to nearly 5,
000 private high-tech businesses and dozens of academies and
research institutes. About 1,100 computer companies, including
IBM, Microsoft, and Compaq, have established themselves in this
area.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said this latest investment is a bid to speed up the
construction of the Zhongguancun area and attract more domestic
and overseas investment to the city's high-tech industry.

<HEADLINE> Seven-Year Anti-Poverty Objective Attainable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The objective of China's seven-
year poverty alleviation program, started in 1994, is attainable
despite difficulties, according to deputies attending the 3rd
Session of the Ninth National People's (NPC) Congress.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, China's impoverished population had been reduced to 34
million, compared with 250 million in 1978. Starting in 1994, the
central government initiated a large-scale anti-poverty program
that aims to wipe out poverty in rural areas by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Years of poverty eradication have enabled governments at all
levels to gain much experience. "We have found different ways that
do work in helping the poor out of difficulty. That's why I
believe China is capable of fulfilling its poverty relief
objectives this year," said Yang Caishou, director of Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region poverty relief office.
</P>
<P>
The region managed to cut its poor population from over 15
million in 1984 to 1.69 million at the end of last year, involving
a total of 7.5 billion yuan of investment, according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China is another
example. Guyuan Prefecture, reportedly the country's most
impoverished area, bid farewell to poverty last year, reporting
an average per-capita income that is greater than 1,000 yuan, the
national poverty line.
</P>
<P>
"Since the most impoverished area has succeeded, I believe
other localities can make it, too, within the year," said
regional chairman Ma Qizhi.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the optimism comes from increased investment
by the central government. From 1986 to 1999, the central
government poured over 130 billion yuan of poverty relief into
pockets of poverty in central and western regions. And this year,
it will inject 26 billion yuan for the effort.

JAKARTA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Some parts of Indonesia's Riau
province in Sumatra island has been covered by smoke from forest
fires, according to the Antara News Agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, citizens in the provincial capital of Pekanbaru
and other areas have been ordered to put on masks when they go
outside, the report quoted the provincial health office's acting
head Ridwansyah as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite the thick smoke, students continue to attend school as
no order has been issued for them not to go out, Ridwansyah added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that since late last month, Pekanbaru has been
blanketed by thick smoke, especially in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The local government said recently it is monitoring more than
100 hot spots across the province.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, blazes on Kalimantan and Sumatra islands swept out
control, and a huge smoke cloud paralyzed the region. The 1997
fires destroyed about 5 million hectares of forest in the country
with an economic loss of about 4 billion U.S. dollars.

HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyclone Eline-induced floods that
hit Zimbabwe late last month have caused at least 100 deaths and
destroyed an estimated loss of 10 billion Zimbabwean dollars (250
million U.S. dollars), the daily Herald reported Monday
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mogadishu Has 1st Somali-speaking TV After 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- People in the Somali capital are
now for the first time in 10 years enjoying programs from a new
local and privately owned Technicolor television.
</P>
<P>
There is desperate need among the people for a Somali-speaking
television, Ali Iman Sharmarkeh, director of the television, said
at a press briefing on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The one-million-dollar television for business purposes is
owned by Horn Afrique Media Incorporation based in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Horn Afrique is now running two Somali language-speaking
channels, one for the children and another for the adults from
6:00 p.m. until midnight everyday.
</P>
<P>
There are cartoons and traditional stories for children, most
often presented by a lady as teacher. The channel for adults most
likely goes ahead with various entertainment programs including
songs and movies censored in accordance with the tradition and
religion of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Also available in the same television system are four more
channels including CNN and one sports channel hired from the
international commercial televisions.
</P>
<P>
Despite the need of the people to have a Somali-speaking
television, still the required money for such privilege is beyond
the means of most of the people.
</P>
<P>
To apply for the subscription, each family has to pay 150 U.S.
dollars for a receiving antenna, a down converter, a remote
control, a decoder and a voltage stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
After buying the equipment, the client will then have to pay 10
dollars for rent every month.
</P>
<P>
During the first three days in which the television had been
operating, only 57 customers (families) have subscribed and paid
the incurring fees.
</P>
<P>
Several well-off families have installed their Somali TVs while
few business centers and restaurants are likewise applying for it
in an effort to enhance their business.
</P>
<P>
The television station has employed about sixty former media
personnel, actors and reporters.
</P>
<P>
Sharmarkeh believed that if they survive for one year, they
will be able to retain back what they had invested into the
business.
</P>
<P>
However, many Somalis think that this television is very
expensive and therefore would not make its owners rich.
</P>
<P>
Abdulwahab Abdullahi Omar, one citizen in Mogadishu, said that
he'd rather buy a satellite dish with only 150 dollars and watch
22 channels from the Arab-Sat with no rents at all.  CNN, MBC and
Al-Jazira are also available in the Arab-Sat, he said.
</P>
<P>
These worries can also be seen from the way the new TV station
is behaving. Both of the Somali-speaking channels choose the
cheapest presentable programs which are often filmed inside their
studios.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, life is continuing and signs of normalcy can be seen in
 Mogadishu, the capital of the Horn of Africa country which has
had no central government since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Green Food Becoming Popular in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Green food is becoming more popular
in China as a result of improving living standards. As an example,
in Fuzhou, capital of coastal Fujian Province in east China, green-
food growing bases are now unable to meet local demands.
</P>
<P>
Along with Fuzhou, other major green-food growers in China
include Beijing, Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province, and several
cities in Shandong Province also in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
These places now produce a combined 30 percent of the country's
green vegetables and fruit, which account for only 10 to 20
percent of total vegetable and fruit production, leaving great
potential for the development of China's green-food agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Chinese now have greater interest in green food for in variety,
quality, and safety guarantees, and the market for green food is
sharply increasing.
</P>
<P>
The green-food industry took off later in China compared with
developed country, but has seen great progress although facing
difficulties such as a shortage of money, backward technology, and
a fledging market and legal system.

<HEADLINE> China Presses for Improvement of Housing Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Construction
has built more than 400 pilot residential projects in urban areas
throughout the country in a bid to improve quality and provide
models for the country's construction industry.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the ministry, the
government has set high standards for building materials, design,
landscaping, and other auxiliary facilities for the pilot homes.
</P>
<P>
He said the country is launching massive housing construction,
building 410 million square meters of floor space in 1999 with a
total investment topping 401 billion yuan, up 19.6 percent and 11
percent, respectively, over the 1998 figures.
</P>
<P>
"Speaking from an overall point of view, there are many quality
problems in housing construction," said one expert with the
ministry, who stressed the necessity of building more experimental
residences in different areas as a reference for the housing
industry.
</P>
<P>
The building campaign for experimental housing began in 1986,
and the program has helped improve the overall quality of the
country's apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
All provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions
throughout the country have been urged to attain the goal of
building at least 25 percent of their apartment houses according
to the standards set by the experimental residences by the end of
this year.

<HEADLINE> Private Jet Owner to Open Private Aviators' Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's first private jet owner
from Hunan province in the central-south, a deputy to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) attending its on-going 3rd annual
session, has been most frequented with the query from his fellow
deputies: "Did you come by your private aircraft?"
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jian, a 39-year-old private entrepreneur, general manager
of the Hunan Yuanda Air-Conditioner Corporation Ltd. now owns
three planes worth more than 100 million yuan (12 million US
dollars). And he flew into the Chinese capital for the NPC annual
sessions by his own jet in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, he purchased an eight-seat aircraft from
Cessna Aircraft Co., the largest U.S. manufacturer of executive
jets.
</P>
<P>
"I will add the number of my aircraft to 10 by the end of 2000,
and then set up an air club," said Zhang with an air of
ambitiousness, adding that the club will draw a growing number of
private entrepreneurs in China.
</P>
<P>
Two-decade-long reform and opening up has made it financially
feasible for private businesspeople in the country to afford their
own planes for business trips, and a formal aviators' club will be
of great help, he added.
</P>
<P>
The company, set up in 1992, now one of major air-conditioner
producers in the world, has been leading the sector in China over
the past years.
</P>
<P>
In China's amended Constitution, the private business is
defined as a vital integral component of socialist market economy.
And in January, a law concerning solely-funded individual
enterprises went into effect.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Premier Zhu Rongji elaborated in his government work
report to the present NPC annual session that the central
government will further encourage the growth of private economy
and other non-government economies.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had recorded 1.48 million
privately-run businesses, according to authoritative data
available, and non-Public-owned economies contributed 24 percent
to gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998, as against merely 1
percent in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Denies Indian Security Presence at Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali Foreign Ministry
denied that Nepal has agreed to allow the presence of Indian
security personnel at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in
Kathmandu as reported Saturday by the French news agency AFP, The
Kathmandu Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Murari Raj Sharma told the English daily that
the news was not true. "The news holds no truth. Nepal has not
entered into any agreement with India," he said.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Indian Minister of State for Civil Aviation Chaman
Lal Gupta as saying Saturday that "Nepal had admitted of security
lapses at its international airport and had agreed in principle to
allow India security at the TIA," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The English daily also quoted a highly placed official at the
Home Ministry as denying that there has been any kind of agreement
regarding TIA security between Nepal and India, not even in
principle.
</P>
<P>
A Home Ministry source ruled out the possibility of India's
posting their security at TIA, saying India has not sent any team
here to discuss the issue as reported by AFP.
</P>
<P>
After an Indian Airlines passenger plane was hijacked on route
from Kathmandu to New Delhi on December 24, 1999, India has
suspended its flight here and suggested posting security personnel
at TIA, which was rejected by the Nepali government.

<HEADLINE> Oil Slick Threatens Wildlife on SE Australia Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A four-kilometer long oil slick
was threatening wildlife and commercial oyster farms on the
central coast of the New South Wales (NSW) state in southeast
Australia, authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The state's fire brigade said 600 liters of diesel oil spilled
into the water near Brisbane in the east Australian state of
Queensland after a motor cruiser caught fire and sank on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fire brigade spokesman Ian Krimmer said the authorities were
concerned about the local penguin and pelican colonies and
commercial oyster farms.
</P>
<P>
Fire crews were called to the Ettalong Beach at 6 a.m. on
Monday after a strong diesel smell was reported, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the spill has come from a boat that was involved
with fire yesterday and consequently sank," Krimmer said.
</P>
<P>
A major cleanup is underway, involving about 30 fire fighters,
the Environment Protection Authority, the Waterways Authority, the
Sydney Ports Corporation, National Parks and Wildlife Service,
police and the Rural Fire Service, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The area is very sensitive in terms of natural ecology,"
Krimmer said.
</P>
<P>
"There are pelican and penguin colonies in the waterway and
also numerous commercial oysters," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he was not aware of any injured wildlife.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Has No Plan to Go for Nuclear Power: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has no plan for the
time being to opt for nuclear power for the generation of
electricity because of its ample supply of indigenous energy
resources to help sustain its economic growth, a high-ranking
official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We will, however, continue to use nuclear technology for other
peaceful purposes such as in medicine, agriculture, manufacturing
industry, oil and gas industry and for research and development
activities," Law Hieng Ding, the science, technology and
environment minister told reporters after opening the regional
workshop on nuclear safety information here.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia would continue to use its resources such as
hydropower, fossil fuel, coal and gases to produce power.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said in his speech at the workshop that
the application of nuclear technology was tightly regulated by
international regulations and it was always safety first.
</P>
<P>
He said a study conducted by several local universities in 1993
on public preferences on energy supply sources in Malaysia showed
that, while nuclear energy was given third preference after coal
and gas in terms of economic viability, it was the last preference
when the factor of risks and prejudice was taken into account.
</P>
<P>
He said that solar power, perceived to be the least economic,
was given the first preference in terms of its lack of risks, and
hydopower, which was fourth in economic preference, was the first
choice in terms of lack of prejudice.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need to have a clear separation of
nuclear energy from nuclear weapon issues.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop, jointly organized by the Atomic Energy
Licensing Board Malaysia, the Malaysian Institute for Nuclear
Technology Research and the International Atomic Energy Agency,
was attended by 21 participants from six countries -- China,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and the host country
Malaysia.

<P>
HAVANA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Without their British professionals,
the Cayman Islands lost to Cuba 0-4 in their opening CONCACAF
World Cup qualifier here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A last-minute ruling from FIFA dealt the Cayman Islands a fatal
blow as their seven British-based club players were barred from
playing against Cuba in their Caribbean zone, group one first leg
tie.
</P>
<P>
"I was very disappointed. We played this game under protest.
But we felt compelled to abide by the ruling," said Costa Taka,
general secretary of the Cayman Islands Football Association.
</P>
<P>
Striker Luis Marten opened the account in the 38th minute and
Ariel Alvarez made it 2-0 for Cuba in the 56th minute.
</P>

Yet, the Cayman Islanders never looked like fighting back and
Cuba wrapped up the game with two more goals in the last five

<HEADLINE> China Women's Foil Looks Beyond Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIANGMEN, Guangdong, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's women's foil
will have to wait four more years to bloom in the Athens Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal in the Olympics in Sydney this September is to win a
medal, but it won't be easy," said coach Zhang Dongming Monday in
a World Cup Grand A competition here.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Aihua, World Cup winner in Nanjing in March, 1999, took
the runner-up after she lost to Italy's Valentina Vezzali 13-7 in
Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Xiao, sixth in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics women'
s foil competition, is the best medal hope for China in individual
contest in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"Xiao and Meng Jie are two members of the women's team. The
last selection has not be decided yet," coach Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Meng, 24, who had never reached the last 16 in the World Cup,
came back from 6-10, 11-14 down to beat the top-seeded Bau Sabine
of Germany, ranked second in the world, 15-14, in the second round.
</P>
<P>
The diminutive Meng lost to Xiao 15-4 in the quarter-final
after three wins in the competition.
</P>
<P>
Bau said: "If she (Meng) has more competition, she could make
the top 10 in the world."
</P>
<P>
The only Olympic fencing gold for China came from Luan Jujie,
who won in the 1984 Los Angles Olympics.

<P>
JIANGMEN, Guangdong, March 6 (Xinhua) -- For the first time, an
Olympic gold is in the sight of the China men's foil team.
</P>
<P>
The runners-up in the World Team Championships in 1999 were
confident to take Olympic medals, with the gold as the ultimate
goal.
</P>
<P>
"We're capable of top three finishing in the Olympic Games in
Sydney. A gold medal is the best reward," said coach Zhong Ruiming
in a World Cup Grand Prix here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
None of the three-fencer Chinese team is in the world top 10,
but the balanced strength carries the Olympic hope.
</P>
<P>
China's second-seeded Ye Chong, 31, winner of the World Cup
grand A in 1996, was not upset by his 14-15 final loss to France's
Jean-Noel Ferrari on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I was not committed to regular training until six months ago,"
said Ye, who was in a Chinese university since the Eighth National
Games in 1998. "The second-place is not bad for me."
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Wang Haibin, 27, winner of the 1997 World
Championship in Budapest, was surprised in the first round on
Sunday in a fight refereed by a German fencer. "The loss doesn't
mean anything," coach Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Dong Zhaozhi, member of the Olympic team, was
also among the top 16 in the Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
China have not won any men's foil gold in the Olympics. The
only foil gold came from Luan Jujie, who took the women's
individual title in the 1984 Los Angles Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> West China High-tech Belt Reaps 30 Billion Yuan in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Guanzhong high-tech industrial
belt in Shaanxi Province in west China reported a total earning of
30 billion yuan (about 3.6 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999, up 20
percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, a land-locked province and one of China's leading
regions in the science and technology and education, built up the
Guanzhong high-tech belt last year, which consists of Xi'an and
Baoji industrial development zones and the Yangling agricultural
high-tech experimental zone.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an high-tech industrial development zone alone earned 20
billion yuan (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars) last year, up 40
percent than 1998. Now it has become the most prosperous high-tech
zone in west China.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 industrialized high-tech projects were also put into
operation during the period, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Stepping up the high-tech sector growth has been a primary task
of the local government in recent years. This year, the high-tech
industry is expected to make greater achievement in the wake of
west development, China's ambitious strategy to stimulate the
local economy.

<HEADLINE> Thai Election Commission to Review Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Election Commission of
Thailand Monday begins a full review of Saturday's elections and
an in-depth investigation of alleged fraud and irregularities
reported in almost every province, as it prepares to announce the
official results.
</P>
<P>
"The Bangkok Post" quoted Commissioner Yuwarat Kamolvej as
saying that the process would begin at about 2:00 p.m., Monday,
after the results were in from all 76 provinces.
</P>
<P>
The tallies would be submitted in person by provincial
commission staff. As of Sunday night, results from 51 provinces
had been handed over, and the rest were expected Monday.
</P>
<P>
The commission would consider all complaints filed against
individual candidates, who would have a chance to deny the
allegation and clear themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
Successful candidates who had no problems and received a
unanimous vote of endorsement from the commission would be
declared elected to the Senate, Yuwarat said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who don't have problems will be endorsed. But any
candidate who fails to win a unanimous vote from the commissioners,
even if they received the most votes in the poll, will lose out,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Commission secretary-general Vijit Yusuphap was quoted as
saying Sunday that the process was time consuming but should be
completed before the current Senate's term expires on March 21.
</P>
<P>
"But if not, there will be no problem because the current
Senate will act as an interim chamber," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also reminded voters that the general public has 30 days to
contest the official results.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's first democratic Senate election ended Saturday,
with an unexpectedly high voting rate.
</P>
<P>
The election is the first one since Thailand adopted
constitutional rule 68 years ago and is widely seen as the first
test of the country's political reform under its 1997 constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under the new charter, senators will be elected, rather than
hand-picked by the prime minister, and will be entitled with more
substantial power than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
So the competition for the 200 seats in the upper house turned
out to be quite fierce.

<P>
COLOMBO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka's Customs department
has adopted new steps to curb smuggling, drug trafficking and
other forms of illegal transactions, the national news agency
Lankapuvath reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The customs officers have been instructed to be more vigilant
as most smugglers pass through check-points undetected and
smugglers are changing their tactics from time to time to mislead
customs officials, a senior customs official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Customs department plans to introduce modern techniques and
computer data systems to identify culprits, the official said.
</P>

He added that these measures have been adopted following a
recent detection where an attempt had been made to smuggle 11
million rupees (153,000 U.S. dollars) worth of foreign currency.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Launches Third National Sanitation Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar launched its third annual
national sanitation week (NSW) Sunday as a mass movement to push
the country's sanitation work ahead following the achievements
made in the last two events.
</P>
<P>
This year's NSW covers carrying out sanitary work in schools
and government departments, motivating the local populace to be
involved in the activities and raising the overall national
coverage to 100 percent by this year, the official New Light of
Myanmar reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar launched its first NSW in May 1998 and the second in
March-April 1999, making significant progress in bringing about a
sanitary environment to the entire country.
</P>
<P>
Before the campaign was initiated, the sanitation coverage
throughout the nation was only 45.7 percent and it was increased
to 60 percent after the first NSW and to 72 percent after the
second.
</P>
<P>
To achieve such a remarkable increase in sanitation coverage
within such a short period was not possible by routine methods but
through NSW activities, said Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, first secretary
of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council and chairman of
the Myanmar National Health Committee, at the launching ceremony
of the third NSW.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt attributed the success of the last two NSWs to the
joint efforts made at all levels of government ministries and
local officials, non-governmental organizations, private
entrepreneurs and U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt also attributed the success to the spirit of self-
help and self-mobilization and the dissemination of technological
information down to the grass-roots level.

<HEADLINE> Electronic-gun Fired Only by Owner Patented in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A pistol that is based on the use of
a removable micro-chip and can only be used by its owner has been
patented in Italy, Ansa News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An electric charge will replace the traditional mechanical
hammer to trigger the weapon, a technology that improves the
accuracy by eliminating the effect of the pressure applied on the
trigger and the vibration of the hammer hitting the bullet
cartridge.
</P>
<P>
"The safety of the system comes from the fact that it will
require a preventive green light from a special micro-chip which
the owner can always keep safely in his or her possession," the
report said, without quoting a source.
</P>
<P>
"Thus the gun cannot be fired by chance or by someone without
access to the chip," it said.
</P>
<P>
The two inventors of the almost totally electronic weapon are
attorney Luigi Ludovici, a one-time automatic pistol instructor
and Alfonso Bravi, the runner-up of  the 1974 Italian military
championships.
</P>
<P>
The invention has already drawn the attention of the Italian
arms manufacturer Beretta which has asked the two inventors for
cooperation, while the inventors themselves have agreed to work
with Ada, a one-time producer of war missiles.

<HEADLINE> China Women's Foil Looks Beyond Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIANGMEN, Guangdong, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's women's foil
will have to wait four more years to bloom in the Athens Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal in the Olympics in Sydney this September is to win a
medal, but it won't be easy," said coach Zhang Dongming Monday in
a World Cup Grand A competition here.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Aihua, World Cup winner in Nanjing in March, 1999, took
the runner-up after she lost to Italy's Valentina Vezzali 13-7 in
Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Xiao, sixth in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics women'
s foil competition, is the best medal hope for China in individual
contest in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"Xiao and Meng Jie are two members of the women's team. The
last selection has not be decided yet," coach Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Meng, 24, who had never reached the last 16 in the World Cup,
came back from 6-10, 11-14 down to beat the top-seeded Bau Sabine
of Germany, ranked second in the world, 15-14, in the second round.
</P>
<P>
The diminutive Meng lost to Xiao 15-4 in the quarter-final
after three wins in the competition.
</P>
<P>
Bau said: "If she (Meng) has more competition, she could make
the top 10 in the world."
</P>
<P>
The only Olympic fencing gold for China came from Luan Jujie,
who won in the 1984 Los Angles Olympics.

<TEXT>
<P>
JIANGMEN, Guangdong, March 7 (Xinhua) -- For the first time, an
Olympic gold is in the sight of the China men's foil team.
</P>
<P>
The runners-up in the World Team Championships in 1999 were
confident to take Olympic medals, with the gold as the ultimate
goal.
</P>
<P>
"We're capable of top three finishing in the Olympic Games in
Sydney. A gold medal is the best reward," said coach Zhong Ruiming
in a World Cup Grand Prix here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
None of the three-fencer Chinese team is in the world top 10,
but the balanced strength carries the Olympic hope.
</P>
<P>
China's second-seeded Ye Chong, 31, winner of the World Cup
grand A in 1996, was not upset by his 14-15 final loss to France's
Jean-Noel Ferrari on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I was not committed to regular training until six months ago,"
said Ye, who was in a Chinese university since the Eighth National
Games in 1998. "The second-place is not bad for me."
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Wang Haibin, 27, winner of the 1997 World
Championship in Budapest, was surprised in the first round on
Sunday in a fight refereed by a German fencer. "The loss doesn't
mean anything," coach Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Dong Zhaozhi, member of the Olympic team, was
also among the top 16 in the Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
China have not won any men's foil gold in the Olympics. The
only foil gold came from Luan Jujie, who took the women's
individual title in the 1984 Los Angles Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar's Financial Reform Makes Progress  By Duan Tingchang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been making progress in
its financial and banking reforms in line with the new economic
policy since it began adopting the market-oriented economic system
at the end of 1988.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures Myanmar has taken in its financial and
banking reforms is the enactment of financial laws and regulations.
Since 1988, Myanmar has introduced the Central Bank of Myanmar Law,
Financial Institution Law, Agricultural Bank Law and Insurance
Business Law, enabling the country's financial rules and
regulations to gradually improve.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has also streamlined and restructured state-owned banks
by establishing Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank and renaming
the previous Myanma Agricultural Bank as Myanma Agricultural and
Rural Development Bank. Now there are five state-owned banks --
Central Bank of Myanmar, Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, Myanma
Economic Bank, Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank, and Myanma
Agricultural and Rural Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar now permits its citizens to set up private banks. After
Myanmar's independence in 1948, there were many privately-run
banks and a number of foreign bank branches in the country. At the
beginning of the 1960s, the Myanmar government nationalized all
private banks and foreign bank branches.
</P>
<P>
There are now 17 private banks in the whole country and among
them, the Asia Wealth Bank, Yoma Bank and Myanmar Mayflower Bank
are the three largest ones.
</P>
<P>
At present, private banks in Myanmar hold about 45 percent of
saving deposits of the bank sector, while their loans account for
48 percent of the sector's loans to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also allows foreign banks to open representative
offices. Up to now, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Japan, South
Korea and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have set
up a total of 21 such bank offices in the country.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate foreign tourists and tighten the control of
foreign exchange, Myanmar in 1993 introduced Foreign Exchange
Certificate (FEC) which is equivalent to the U.S. dollar in value.
</P>
<P>
It is required by the Myanmar government that foreign tourists
entering into Myanmar must exchange 300 U.S. dollars with Myanmar'
s FEC. Beginning August 1, 1999, Myanmar citizens are also
required to settle their call charges in FEC for international
direct dialing.
</P>
<P>
To expand the channel of collecting capital and tackle the
problem of insufficient capital in economic construction, the
Myanmar government has decided to issue government-guaranteed
security bonds or debentures. This is the first ever such move
made by Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Despite some achievements made in reforms in Myanmar's
financial and banking sector, the sector's present condition is
far from being adapted to the ASEAN Free Trade Area and meeting
the needs of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has slowed down the pace of reform
in Myanmar's financial and banking sector. After the outbreak of
the crisis, several Myanmar private banks closed down one after
another and 22 out of the 43 foreign bank representative offices
in the country also pulled out.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Scripts Found In Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan archaeologists have
discovered ancient scripts dating back to the 5th century B.C. in
the historic city of Anuradhapura in Northern Province of the
country, the official News Daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Anuradhapura, 206 kilometers from Colombo on the north-central
plains, is Sri Lanka's ancient capital dating back 2,500 years and
revives a glorious past of a culture and heritage.
</P>
<P>
An eminent archaeologist was quoted as saying that their
experts engaged in the extensive excavation work in the area of
around 400 acres have found environmental and other evidence to
prove that Anuradhapura was the key city of Sri Lanka's first
civilization.
</P>
<P>
The Archaeologists are carrying out petrologic examinations in
order to unearth artifacts and other objects to prove that the
city of Anuradhapura was an ancient trade center in the Asian
region, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Proactive Fiscal Policy Safe, Effective: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China has solid conditions and
good reason for the go-ahead of its proactive fiscal policy,
finance minister Xiang Huaicheng said here today.
</P>
<P>
"There are necessary conditions for China to continue with the
proactive policy without big risks," he told the on-going Third
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
There has been a considerable increase in deficit and debt due
to the implementation of the proactive fiscal policy, Xiang said.
"This is a price the government has to pay for exercising macro-
control of the economy."
</P>
<P>
Faced with impact of the Asian financial crisis and a lukewarm
domestic demand in 1998, the central government resolutely made a
strategic decision to follow the proactive fiscal policy, which
has so far achieved noticeable results. Not only was investment in
infrastructure development increased, but support was given to
technological upgrading of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the implementation of this policy has
helped ensure social stability, maintain sustained, rapid and
sound development of the national economy and raise the people's
standards of living.
</P>
<P>
Total expenditures exceeded revenue last year, leaving a
deficit of 175.9 billion yuan. And a deficit of 229.9 billion yuan
will be left after setting revenue against expenditures for 2000.
</P>
<P>
"By international standards, there is still some room for China
to issue more bonds. As long as sustained, rapid and sound
economic growth is maintained, economic efficiency is constantly
improved and revenue is rapidly increased, our ability to service
the debt will be continuously enhanced," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Close attention should be paid to the national debt and the
deficit, and efforts intensified to study the ability to collect
revenue and the public risk, closely watch the operation of
finance and work out necessary countermeasures, he said, adding
great attention should also be paid to preventing financial risks,
and efforts made to cut down on unnecessary expenditures and work
hard to bring the deficit under control.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, policy measures should be improved to
strengthen the guiding and stimulating role of budgetary funds.

</P>
<P>

<P>
Substantial steps are expected to be taken this year to carry
out the strategy of large-scale development of the western region,
by accelerating infrastructure development like water conservancy,
communications, transportation, telecommunications, radio and TV
facilities, in a bid to promote the transformation of the region's
resource advantages into economic advantages, he noted. In
addition, he said, ecological development and environmental
protection are an important part of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
In his budget report, Xiang said the central and local budgets
for 1999 were implemented fairly satisfactorily, with the growth
of revenue exceeding that of the economic growth, leaving a
deficit of 179.7 billion yuan, less than the amount approved by
the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Last year, total government bonds in the central budget issued
in 1999 amounted to 401.5 billion yuan, and apart from 30 billion
yuan issued in the name of the local authorities, central revenue

of the readjusted budgetary figure, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>

and by international standards, there is still some room for China
to issue more bonds.

allowances for officers and men in the army as well as
expenditures for troops stationed in Macao, Xiang said. China
started stationing People's Liberation Army troops in Macao in
late December last year after the return of Macao to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The minister explained that since the army, armed police forces
and procuratorial, judicial and public security organs no longer
engage in business or run enterprises, an additional 5.6 billion
yuan will be provided to cover the necessary expenditures for the
performance of their functions.
</P>
<P>
"Our defense expenditure has remained at a low level because
China firmly adheres to a defensive policy in national defense and
has always controlled defense spending strictly," a high-ranking
military official said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 2000 China's defense spending is
expected to account for about 1.37 percent of its GDP and 8.2
percent of its state budgetary expenditures, compared with the
averages of 3 percent and 15 percent respectively for the world's
main countries.

on implementation of central and local budgets for 1999 and on
draft central and local budgets for 2000 delivered at the Third
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress this morning.
</P>
<P>
The priorities are as follows:

advantage of the macro-control function of finance.
</P>
<P>

sustained and steady increase in revenue.
</P>
<P>
-- Tightening budgetary management and steadily promoting the
reform of the budget system.
</P>
<P>
-- Intensifying efforts to readjust the pattern of expenditures
to put more emphasis on key items and ensure that the major
principles and policies of the Party and the government are
implemented.
</P>
<P>
-- Doing better in social security work and accelerating the
improvement of the social security system.
</P>
<P>
-- Vigorously promoting reform of taxes and fees and continuing
to rationalize distribution relations.
</P>
<P>

rectifying financial and economic order.
</P>
<P>
-- Adhering to the principle of hard work, plain living and
building the country through diligence and thrift, practicing
frugality and utilizing funds in an economic manner.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that the year 2000 is the final year of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and is crucial to efforts to tackle
difficult problems in reforms and get state-owned enterprises out
of their plight.
</P>
<P>
"Fulfilling the financial tasks for this year, making good use
of the role of finance and tightening financial management are
crucial to efforts to maintain sustained, rapid and sound
development of the national economy, accelerate the establishment
of a socialist market economy, attain the second-step strategic
objective for the modernization drive and make a good start for
the new century," he said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Scraps Two-tier Overnight Rate Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
is abolishing its two-tier overnight borrowing scheme and
effectively raising the borrowing rate by 25 basis points from a "
blended rate" of 8.5 percent, Business World reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the new rate scheme, effective
Monday, is in line with rising interest rates around the world and
aimed at shoring up the sagging Philippine peso.
</P>
<P>
"We've just gone back to the old system," Rafael Buenaventura,
governor of the central bank, was quoted by the paper as saying
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the central bank's two-tier scheme paid 8.75 percent
for the first 500-million-peso (12.5 million U.S. dollars) deposit
and 8 percent for amounts in excess.
</P>
<P>
Starting Monday, all funds placed in the central bank's
overnight facility will earn 8.75 percent, while borrowings will
cost 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The move is the central bank's first interest rate hike in
eight months, and its first adjustment since it cut the borrowing
rate by 25 basis points last November.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura said the rate adjustment is a signal the market
had been expecting since the peso started to weaken two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the central bank was not aiming to strengthen
the peso with the rate increase. "We just want to keep the peso
rate stable, not necessarily to strengthen it or weaken it, but to
stabilize it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the de facto rise in the central bank's overnight
borrowing rate is seen as effectively halting the fall of the peso,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
At the Philippine Dealing System, the country's currencies
exchange, the peso averaged at 40.896 pesos against the dollar
last Friday, up 5.6 centavos from 40.952 pesos Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Budget Implementation "Satisfactory": Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese finance minister said here
today that China's 1999 central and local budgets were implemented
"fairly satisfactorily," with revenue increase overtaking economic
growth, and deficit less than the amount approved by the National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Xiang made the statement when delivering a report to the on-
going Third Session of the NPC on the implementation of the
central and local budgets for 1999 and on the draft central and
local budgets for 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said that the macro-control measures which focus on the
implementation of a pro-active fiscal policy have produced notable
results. The national economy grew steadily, gross domestic
product (GDP) rose by 7.1 percent over the previous year, and the
quality of the operation and performance of the economy improved
notably. All reforms proceeded smoothly and the living standards
of the people continued to improve.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of steady economic growth, total revenue in the
central budget for 1999 came to 639.6 billion yuan, or 108.7
percent of the budgeted figure. Total expenditures in the central
budget for 1999 amounted to 819.3 billion yuan, or 106.6 percent
of the budgeted figure. Central expenditures exceeded revenue,
leaving a deficit of 179.7 billion yuan, 600 million yuan less
than the amount of 180.3 billion yuan approved by the NPC Standing
Committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
Total government bonds in the central budget issued in 1999
amounted to 401.5 billion yuan. Apart from 30 billion yuan issued
in the name of local authorities, central revenue from generation
of debt in 1999 totaled 371.5 billion yuan, or 100 percent of the
readjusted budgetary figure. This figure includes 191.1 billion
yuan for servicing domestic and foreign debt, 179.7 billion yuan
for offsetting the deficit for 1999 and 700 million yuan for
establishing a central budget debt repayment fund.
</P>
<P>
In addition, total revenue from funds controlled by the central
government came to 134.9 billion yuan and total expenditures of
the central government taken from the above funds amounted to 134.
9 billion yuan, Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
Total revenue in the local budgets in 1999 came to 967.5
billion yuan, or 109.9 percent of the budgeted figure. Total
expenditures in the local budgets amounted to 963.7 billion yuan,
or 109.5 percent of the budgeted figure. Total local revenue
exceeded expenditures, leaving a surplus of 3.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that from the implementation of the central and local
budgets as mentioned above, total revenue for the whole country in
1999 came to 1.1377 trillion yuan, or 105.3 percent of the
budgeted amount. Expenditures for the whole country totaled 1.3136
trillion yuan, or 104.2 percent of the budgeted figure. Total
expenditures exceeded revenue, leaving a deficit of 175.9 billion
yuan.

<HEADLINE> Finance Minister on Major Financial Accomplishments in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- Revenue collection and management was strengthened to ensure
a steady increase of revenue. Total national revenue for 1999
exceeded one trillion yuan, an increase of 150.1 billion yuan over
that of the previous year, or an increase of 15.2 percent. The
ratio of revenue to GDP increased from 11.6 percent in 1997 and 12.
4 percent in 1998 to 13.9 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
-- A pro-active fiscal policy was conscientiously implemented
and the role of state finance in macro-control was utilized. Local
authorities and the departments concerned continued to do a good
job in selecting projects to be funded by government bonds and in
controlling the use of funds.
</P>
<P>
The policy on personal income distribution was revised, and as
a result, more than 84 million employees and residents benefited
from this policy. In addition, some tax policies were modified in
a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
-- Great efforts were made to readjust the pattern of
expenditures to effectively guarantee funding for key projects. In
conformity with the requirements of the development of a socialist
market economy, the pattern of budgetary expenditures was
gradually readjusted and optimized at all levels in 1999 to ensure

financing for key items and guarantee all expenditures which have
a direct bearing on reform, development and stability. Total
expenditures for the whole country in 1999 increased by 21.7
percent over the 1998 figure, with total expenditures in the
central budget up by 27.1 percent, a big increase not seen for
many years.
</P>
<P>
-- Efforts to formulate financial laws and regulations were
stepped up to strengthen supervision and management and promote
the administration of finance in accordance with the law.

Delivering a report on implementation of central and local
budgets for 1999 and on draft central and local budgets for 2000
at the on-going Third Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress, Xiang said "Reviewing implementation of the budget for
1999, we are also fully aware that problems persists in our
financial work and the implementation of the budget which cannot
be neglected."
</P>
<P>
There is disorder in both finance and economy, Xiang said,
adding it is very common that laws already enacted are not fully
observed or enforced and law-breakers are not prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
"Funding cannot be fully guaranteed and budgets at all levels
are under great pressure, especially in some counties and
townships with great financial difficulties," he said. "Some
government departments and institutions fail to pay their
employees on time and funding for some items that should be
guaranteed are not made available."
</P>
<P>
Xiang said efforts to readjust the pattern of expenditures,
though already initiated, are made too slowly and too
ineffectively and government finance is still taking on too many
matters. The problem of providing unnecessary funds to some items
and failing to fund other necessary items has yet to be
fundamentally solved.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of steady economic development, all these
problems must be gradually solved by deepening the reform of
finance and taxation, improving the financial and economic system
and the functions of finance, standardizing the economic order and
tightening financial supervision and management," he said.

<HEADLINE> Finance Minister Spells out Major Tasks for 2000 Central Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese finance minister Xiang
Huaicheng today listed priorities for 2000 central budgets in his
report on implementation of central and local budgets for 1999 and
on draft central and local budgets for 2000 at the on-going 3rd
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The central budget for 2000 focuses on the following aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- Continuing to strengthen infrastructure development.
Investment in capital construction from the central budget will
total 89.3 billion yuan (including subsidies for local authorities)
.
</P>
<P>
-- Intensifying efforts to support the reform and development
of state-owned enterprises. Funds and subsidies on interest
payment from the central budget for technological upgrading of
enterprises will be 16.5 billion yuan (including subsidies for
local authorities).
</P>
<P>
-- Investing more in social security and fully implementing the
policy to readjust income distribution introduced in 1999. Funds
earmarked for this purpose from the central budget for 2000 will
total 70.7 billion yuan, including 3.7 billion yuan to fund
subsistence allowances for workers laid off from enterprises under
the central government, and 53.2 billion yuan as subsidies for
some areas to raise the social security benefits and increase the
wages and salaries of employees in government departments and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
-- Stepping up efforts to increase investment in education,
science, technology and agriculture and ensure that the rate of
increase is higher than that of the regular revenue. The
proportion of expenditures for education in the central budget
will be increased by one percentage point over the level in 1999.
A total of 16.5 billion yuan will be allocated for education, an
increase of 29.7 percent over that of the previous year. Funds for
science and technology will be 11.2 billion yuan, an increase of
14.1 percent over the 1999 figure. Expenditures for agricultural
administration and the support of agricultural production will
come to 7.9 billion yuan, an increase of 14.8 percent over the
1999 figure.
</P>
<P>
-- Appropriately increasing expenditures for state security.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that on the basis of an overall analysis and
assessment of revenue and expenditures in 2000, the State Council
prepared a draft central budget for 2000. Total revenue in the
central budget for 2000 is 690.4 billion yuan, 50.8 billion yuan
more than the actual figure of the previous year, or an increase
of 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
And expenditures in the central budget total 920.3 billion yuan
(including interest on debts), 101 billion yuan more than the
actual figure for 1999 and an increase of 12.3 percent. A deficit
of 229.9 billion yuan will be left after setting revenue against
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
"It is worth noting that the increase in the deficit in the
central budget this year mainly results from reform of the method
of preparing the budget," he said, adding that according to the
method of calculation used last year, the deficit in the central
budget would be 155 billion yuan, 24.7 billion yuan less than the
1999 figure.
</P>
<P>
Total revenue in the local budgets for 2000 amounts to 1.0434
trillion yuan, an increase of 7.8 percent over the actual 1999
figure. And total expenditures in the local budgets amount to 1.
0434 trillion yuan, an increase of 8.3 percent over the actual
figure for 1999. Revenue and expenditures are balanced in the
local budgets.
</P>
<P>
The draft central and local budgets for the year 2000 break
down as follows: revenue totals 1.2338 trillion yuan, an increase
of 96.1 billion yuan, or 8.4 percent over the actual figure for
1999, and expenditures total 1.4637 trillion yuan, an increase of
150 billion yuan, or 11.4 percent over the actual figure for 1999,
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
in southwest China bordering the "Golden Triangle" is on stand by
against potential smugglers entering the country.
</P>
<P>
Customs in the region exposed 75 smuggling cases and retrieved
6.16 million yuan (742,000 U.S. dollars) in undeclared tariffs and
taxes in January this year.
</P>
<P>
On February 15, police in Guangxi foiled a major cigarette
smuggling attempt from Viet Nam. If smugglers were successful,
they would have got away with 1.14 million yuan in undeclared
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smuggling officers were deployed on all land and water
routes along the borderline between October 1998 and May 1999,
with the assistance of various ethnic groups in the region which
has greatly facilitated the anti-smuggling operations.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the anti-smuggling officers cracked 703 smuggling
cases involving cigarettes, rubber and refined oil products worth
143 million yuan. And the Nanning Customs alone recovered
undeclared tariffs and taxes of 1.07 billion yuan, an increase of
43 percent over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Denies to Transfer Beckham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United strongly denied
report Sunday that David Beckham is being put on the transfer list.
</P>
<P>
The club's deputy chief executive Peter Kenyon told BBC Radio 5
Live that Beckham still had a major role to play at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
It followed newspaper reports of a secret board meeting at the
club which it was claimed had decided to sell the player.
</P>
<P>
The reports suggested that Beckham and manager Alex Ferguson
were barely on speaking terms following a series of bust-ups
between the two men.
</P>
<P>
But Kenyon said he was focused on helping the club retain their
Premiership and Champions League titles.
</P>
<P>
"There were no secret meetings. The only meetings that are
taking place are discussing how we're going to get through the
next nine games in 28 days," said Kenyon.
</P>
<P>
"Normal board meetings happen every week and the meeting last
week was a normal board meeting. The discussions as reported are
pure speculation and nonsense.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's focus, including David's, at Manchester United is
on the later stages of the Champions League and Premier League.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously David's a high-profile player and this is something
he's got to live with and we've got to live with.
</P>
<P>
"But the way David's playing, the focus right now is where we'
re going to finish up this year. Any speculation in the papers is
that- it's pure speculation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyon insisted Beckham has a future at United and the club
would be looking to extend the contracts of their star players
when the time was right.
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason why David won't be staying at Manchester
United," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We've got a great squad with great individual players and I'm
sure when it's time for those discussions, they will take place
and we'll all be looking for the right outcome.
</P>
<P>
"That'll happen when we're ready and David's ready and that
time isn't now," he added.

enterprises in the northeast China city of Shenyang that have been
given deadlines to clean up industrial pollution have come up to
the required national pollution standards.
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1,106 enterprises, 835 have complied with the
pollution standards, and all the remaining factories should come
up to the standards by the end of this year, according to the
Environment Protection Bureau of Shenyang, an old industrial base
in northeast China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
If factories cannot comply with national pollution standards by
the end of the year, factories will be forced to close down.
</P>
<P>
Two printing and dyeing mills in Haicheng City have already been
closed down recently for failing to comply with the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province is one of the most heavily polluted cities in
China. The Liaohe River is the most polluted river among China's
seven large rivers.
</P>
<P>
Factories in Liaoning are required to adopt high-technology to
renovate traditional industries and practice "clean production" to
radically resolve environmental problems in the province.

<HEADLINE> Syria Says No Talks Pending Barak's Pledge to Full Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian-Israeli peace talks
will not resume before a clear-cut pledge from Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak to return in full the occupied Golan Heights,
Damascus Radio said Monday in its commentary.
</P>
<P>
The commentary came one day after Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy that Barak opposed withdrawing to the June 4, 1967 borderlines
held by Syria pending the Mideast War although the prime minister
had admitted recently that his predecessors had promised to return
the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Had Barak committed himself to the pledge of his four
predecessors, an agreement with Syria would have been reached, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary accused Barak of blocking the work of the
committee on border demarkation in the January peace talks in the
U.S. in order to know what he called "the kind of peace he was
going to establish with Syria before deciding on withdrawal."
</P>
<P>
"At this point the talks broke down pending a clear-cut pledge
from Barak on Israeli pullout from Golan Heights," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks, resumed last December, stalled
again in January only after two rounds of talks over Israel's
refusal for a promise on the full return of Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the radio urged the U.S., Europe and the
international community at large to play a more active and
effective role to revive the Syrian-Israeli talks and put an end to
the tensions in the Middle East resulting from continued Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Peace must be fair and comprehensive, otherwise the tension will
escalate and the situation in the region will deteriorate further,
the radio added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Underlines Simultaneity of Two Tracks in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
Monday expressed cautious welcome to Israel's plan to withdraw from
south Lebanon and stressed the necessity of pushing forward the
peace process on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said here in an interview with Egyptian radio "Arabic
Sound" his country welcomes Israel's scheduled pullout from its
southern part, which is stipulated in the United Nations Security
Council resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet on Sunday approved Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's plan to withdraw troops from south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has not abandoned the will to take back its occupied
territory, no matter with a peace agreement with Israel or not,
Hoss affirmed.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon and Syria always seek a comprehensive and just peace in
the region. Due to Israel's stubbornness, the peace track went into
an impasse," Hoss, who is also foreign minister, told the Egyptian
radio.
</P>
<P>
Hoss termed as "late and indecisive" Barak's recent
acknowledgement that former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
has planned to pullout from Syria's Golan Heights, which Israel
seized in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hoss expressed his pessimism toward the coming peace
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
"The Jewish country will not change its diehard policy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hoss denied there have been secret contacts between Syria, the
main power-broker in Lebanon, and Israel since their talks were
suspended since January.
</P>
<P>
Hoss also called for more support from Arab countries to the
forthcoming Arab foreign ministers conference to be held in Beirut
on March 11.
</P>
<P>
The local Daily Star newspaper quoted a Foreign Ministry
official as saying the country will submit a document to the
conference, urging Arab support for its position over its conflict
with Israel.

ATHENS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of cancer is now
growing steadily in Greece, particularly among women, Greek
experts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Greek experts attributed the rise in the number of cancer
victims to environmental pollution, inappropriate diet, smoking
and the lack of exercise, the semi-official Athens News Agency (
ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Greek Anti-Cancer Society warned that
the incidence of lung cancer among women would double by 2010
because women in the country now started smoking at a much younger
age.
</P>
<P>
They also complained that Greeks were rather late in getting
cancer treatment and this increased the number of deaths.

<HEADLINE> IMF Says Hong Kong Economic Outlook Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said Monday that Hong Kong's economy has reversed the trend
of slump, posting a 2 percent growth in 1999, and the outlook for
2000 and beyond was generally positive.
</P>
<P>
In an annual review of the Hong Kong economy, the IMF said that
clear signs of recovery emerged in the first half of 1999, helped
by the fast pace of economic growth in the mainland of China and
the sharp rebound in the earlier crisis-hit economies in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"(Executive) directors attributed this successful turnaround of
the economy to the authorities' skillful economic management, the
credibility of policy-making in Hong Kong SAR, and the economy's
flexibility and resilience," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said the supportive and timely fiscal policy, combined
with job creation and retraining programs helped mitigate the
Asian financial crisis' impact on the Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
"While the recovery was not yet broadly based, and much would
depend on external developments, as well as the speed with which
the remaining domestic price adjustment was completed and
corporate profitability improved, directors believed that the
outlook for 2000 and beyond was generally positive," the IMF
report said.
</P>
<P>
Given that the recovery was not yet broadly based, the IMF said
for the fiscal year 2000 a structural tightening of the fiscal
position should be avoided. It also urged the authorities of the
Hong Kong SAR to further strengthen employment and training
programs, especially for the youth unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The IMF backed Hong Kong's currency board, which pegs the Hong
Kong dollar to the U.S. currency and ties cash in circulation to
central bank reserves. It said the system was "the linchpin of the
rules-based approach to economic policy making."
</P>
<P>
The fund also said the financial position of Hong Kong's
banking system remains generally strong, with non-performing loans
stabilizing at about 10 percent of assets in the third quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
The IMF projected that the Hong Kong economy would likely
undergo major structural changes in coming years, due both to
technological advances in key service industries and the evolving
relationship with the mainland, including as a result of China's
accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"Preserving Hong Kong SAR's economic performance in an
increasingly competitive external environment will require a
continuing effort to strengthen the regulatory framework, upgrade
skills, and foster technological innovation," the IMF said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Sees Kosovo Violence "Unacceptable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday described the violence in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo as "unacceptable," and warned that such violence against
vulnerable minorities may spread.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the U.N. Security Council, published here
Monday, Annan said, "the level and nature of violence in Kosovo,
especially against vulnerable minorities, remains unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"The deplorable events in Mitrovica serve to remind us that
ethnic tensions can still trigger dramatic cycle of violence," he
said, referring to the worsened security situation and a series of
violence in the Kosovo town, some 32 kilometers northwest of the
provincial capital of Pristina, since the beginning of February.
</P>
<P>
The security situation "became more tense and volatile owing
to the recent negative developments in Mitrovica," he said.
</P>
<P>
"By its resolution 1244 (1999), the Security Council mandated
the United Nations with an unprecedented challenge in Kosovo," he
said. "As the recent events in Mitrovica indicate, progress made
by UNMIK (the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo) since
June 1999 is not yet irreversible and the potential for further
violence, including a spill-over effect in southern Serbia, remain
a real possibility."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Annan called on Member States "to support the
efforts of UNMIK, KFOR (the international peace-keeping force) and
the moderate Kosovo leadership to make Mitrovica a united city
with a joint administration and security for all," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to cement and build upon the achievement of UNMIK,
Member States must provide the necessary political, material and
financial support to the Mission in a determined manner throughout
this sensitive period," he said.
</P>
<P>
UNMIK and KFOR have been openly accused by Yugoslavia and
other countries of its failure to honor the Security Council
resolution 1244, adopted on June 10 last year, by fully respecting
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and fully
disarming the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).

<HEADLINE> Venezuela to Export "Orimulsion" to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will send in coming
weeks 480,000 metric tons of "orimulsion" to China, an official of
Venezuela Petroleum (PDVSA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A joint investment of PDVSA's Bitor company and China National
Petroleum Company is being studied for the building of a plant of
emulsifying and producing "orimulsion" in Venezuela for about 300
million dollars, said Bitor's public relation manager Marco Angeli.
</P>
<P>
By this project, exports to China will reach 200 million
dollars a year and this means Venezuela has an important trading
reference at a world level, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Orimulsion" is a strategic Venezuelan product which will
penetrate international markets, particularly Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela produces a lot of "orimulsion" which is a kind of
emulsified crude oil (a mixture of bitumen, water and emulsifiers).

In return for bribes, they repeatedly bypassed residency

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Ken Livingstone was suspended from
the Labor Party on Monday after declaring he will run as an
independent candidate for London mayor.
</P>
<P>
Livingstone made his announcement earlier in the day, ending
two weeks of frenzied speculation in the media over whether he
would leave Labor after 31 years of commitment to the party.
</P>
<P>
The Brent East MP declared his intention to stand as an
independent saying the May 4 ballot will become a referendum for
Londoners on their right to self-government.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party general secretary Margaret McDonagh has written to
the MP saying she was using delegated powers under the party's
constitution to suspend his membership pending a full inquiry.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, my decision means that you will not be
allowed to represent the Labor Party at any level nor be in
receipt of the Labour whip," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
Her decision has yet to be ratified by the party's ruling
National Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
But responding to the news, Livingstone predicted he would be
back in the party after the current "crisis".
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier on Monday, Livingstone urged other Labor
members to stay within the party, while he promised to cast his
second preference in the mayoral ballot for Frank Dobson,Labor's
official candidate.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Presidential Candidates Count Down to Super Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the Republican side, Texas Governor George W. Bush and
Arizona Senator John McCain are campaigning in California, where
162 delegates will be awarded.
</P>
<P>
Bush and his staff have become increasingly upbeat as polls
show him positioned to nail down victories in California, Ohio and
possibly New York.
</P>
<P>
At a San Diego park, Bush, fighting off a flu, said the
competition with McCain made him a better candidate and should
satisfy anyone who wondered "about my inner strengthen" and "
whether I can battle back."
</P>
<P>
McCain, who vowed to carry on his campaign, said that there has
not been a primary yet that has met expectations. "It's just too
volatile," he said at a rally in California Monday.
</P>
<P>
If McCain loses votes in California and New York, it could end
his upstart bid, according to political analysts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Democratic Vice President Al Gore and former New
Jersey Senator Bill Bradley are focusing their attention on New
York State Monday.
</P>
<P>
Polls give Gore large lead in all 15 contests he faces with
Bradley. Gore courted New York's Jewish activists, saying in a
Gore administration, the United States would be "a good and
helpful and loyal friend to Israel."
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who so far has three defeats and no wins, said Monday
he would have to win at least a couple of states to stay in the
race.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Bradley is likely to drop out if he fairs poorly
on Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Super Tuesday, thirteen states including California and New
York are holding Republican primaries or caucuses, with 613
delegates to the Republican National Convention at stake. A total
of 1,034 delegates will be needed to obtain the Republican
presidential nomination at the convention in the coming summer.
</P>
<P>
Democrats in 15 states are casting ballots Tuesday. Overall,
over 1,315 delegates to the Democratic convention in Los Angeles
in August will be chosen -- more than half of the 2,170 needed for
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
The biggest prize is the most populous California, where the
winner takes all the delegates. There are 162 delegates up for
grabs in the Republican race and 367 on the Democratic side. New
York is also critical -- 243 Democratic and 101 Republican
delegates at stake.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Insists U.S. Interest Rates Need to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan emphasized Monday that the U.S. central bank had no
choice but to raise short-term interest rates in the months ahead
to prevent the economy from overheating.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a Boston College conference on the "New Economy"
at Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, Greenspan stressed once again
that productivity driven gains in the stock market had helped to
boost demand in the economy to a level where it could no longer be
met by supply. That risked stoking inflation and could kill off
the record expansion prematurely.
</P>
<P>
"Until market forces, assisted by a vigilant Federal Reserve,
effect the necessary alignment of the growth of aggregate demand
with the growth of potential aggregate supply, the full benefits
of innovative productivity acceleration are at risk of being
undermined by financial and economic instability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's speech was likely to strengthen the belief of many
economists that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise
interest rates until it sees greater evidence that the economy is
slowing enough to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
"Overall demand for goods and services cannot chronically
exceed the underlying growth rate of supply," Greenspan said. "The
expansion of demand must moderate."
</P>
<P>
The Fed has already boosted interest rates four times since
June with the latest increase on February 2, a quarter-point boost
that left the federal funds rate at 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists are predicting the Fed will raise rates again when
it next meets March 21 and many are looking for a sixth rate
increase at the following meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the Fed's efforts to slow the economy by raising
the short-term interest rates that it controls are being aided by
increases in long-term interest rates, which are controlled by
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
He said long-term corporate borrowing costs "have risen
significantly over the past two years" because of continued strong
demand for new loans on the part of consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the Fed will be carefully monitoring
developments to bring about the required movements in the economy
to better balance the supply of labor and capital with demand.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Aid to Mozambique Reaches $20 million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has received 20 million
U.S. dollars worth of humanitarian aid to the flood victims of the
southern African country, the National Disasters Management
Institute (INGC) said in a press release on Monday .
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government earlier appealed to the international
 community for 65 million dollars of emergency relief to estimated
one million people displaced by the country's worst flooding in 50
years.
</P>
<P>
The aid includes cash, foodstuffs, tents, blankets, medicine,
fuel and water-purifiers among others.
</P>
<P>
The past weekend saw the country's two major airports, in
Maputo and Beira, accommodating a swarm of foreign aircraft
carrying aid and relief workers in response to the Mozambican
government's call for aid to the victims of the floods.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters, boats, foodstuffs and medicines arrived in planes
from Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Although the INGC points out that the number of aircraft now
available is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the relief
operations, boats are still required.
</P>
<P>
"There is also a great shortage of fuel for planes and boats
involved in the rescue operations", adds the release.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Mostly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell mostly
Monday amid worries about higher interest rates while on profit-
taking.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 196.70 at 10,170.
50. The blue chip index rose 505.08 points last week.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor
's 500 index fell 17.89 at 1,391.28 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite fell 9.94 at 4,904.85.
</P>
<P>
The market fell as Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan
warned again that the more hikes in interest rates would be needed
in his efforts to cool off the U.S. economy. Greenspan told a
Boston College conference that strong productivity gains could
still push corporate profits and stocks higher, which will put
pressure on inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since last June
in efforts to keep off the build-up of inflation. Last Friday, a
government report on moderate job growth in February offered the
first signs of success in the Federal Reserve's efforts and the
report boosted the stock market on the day.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index pulled back on profit taking after rising as
high as 4,980 points around midday. The index rose 324.29 points
last week.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 6.45 at 604.02. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 8.65 at 1,022.36 and The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 3.45 at 601.64.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,916 down, 1,141 up and 438
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 1.026 billion shares from 1.146 billion
in the previous session, according to preliminary calculations.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Says Malta's Entry to EU to Boost Regional Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Malta's entry into the European Union
will benefit all the EU members as well as strengthening the EU in
the Mediterranean, European Commission President Romano Prodi said
in Valetta Monday, the Italian news agency Ansa reported.
</P>
<P>
Prodi told a special session of the Maltese parliament that the
island is in an excellent position to profit from a single market
now totaling 370 million U.S. dollars, but destined to grow
significantly with the addition of new members.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who was in Valetta for 24 hours on a tour of candidate
countries' capitals, also made a veiled criticism of the Maltese
Laborite opposition's proposals for an alternative to EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party would prefer to see an economic and industrial
free-trade zone with the EU rather than full EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Without specifying the Laborite position, Prodi said "other
options" than membership would be "difficult" to achieve.
</P>
<P>
Maltese Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami, who held talks with
Prodi and European Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen
accompanying him, told parliament he is confident of completing
membership negotiations before the end of the next year.
</P>
<P>
The talks start on March 28. Completion of the negotiations
will be followed by a referendum in 2002. This, he said, would
enable Malta to join the EU with the enlargement planned for 2003.

<HEADLINE> International Tourism Exchange Trade Fair to Be Held in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Tourism Exchange
trade fair, ITB, will be held from March 11 to 15 in Berlin. About
9,000 exhibitors, firms and organizations from 177 countries
around the world are expected to take part in the fair.
</P>
<P>
Most of the exhibitors come from abroad. The managing director
of "Messe Berlin"Jochen Martin said that the Berlin trade fair "
reflects the current state of international tourism, an industry
that operates on a global scale".
</P>
<P>
"Tourism there has returned to its previous levels, with the
number of arrivals rising by 7.5 percent to 94 million, compared
to the weaker results of the previous year." said Raimund Hosch,
Messe Berlin's board management chief.
</P>
<P>
The southeastern Asian countries reported high-speed increase
at the tourism development. Singapore rose 11 percent, Malaysia 8
percent and Thailand 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Central America, the Middle East and South America have got a
rapid growth, too, 23 percent,17.5 percent and 10 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
1999 was for Europe only a moderate year for tourism, with
growth of poor one per cent. Only Spain has got 8.8 percent growth,
Greece 5 percent and Portugal 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central and eastern European countries suffered a drop in
tourist levels. In Hungary the number of tourist arrivals reduced
13.8 percent in 1999, Poland down by 4.5 percent and the Czech
Republic down by 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hosch predicted that China would be attracting the largest
number of tourism arrivals by 2020.
</P>
<P>
The ITB Fair takes place at a time when Berlin is enjoying a
tourism boom. 4.17 billion visitors were received last year, 16.3
percent more than one year earlier. Overnight stays increased by a
million to 9.3 million.
</P>
<P>
60,000 trade visitors will take part in the ITB Fair this year.
This year's ITB fair is putting particular emphasis on the growing
travel market.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Crown Corporation Pleads Guilty for Radiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Crown corporation, the
Cape Breton Development Corp., pleaded guilty Monday for leak of
excessive levels of radiation.
</P>
<P>
The Crown, known as Devco in the country's eastern province of
Nova Scotia, pleaded guilty to seven charges under the country's
Atomic Energy Control Act, according to a local press report.
</P>
<P>
The charges include not properly training workers, allowing
unauthorized persons dismantle and service a radiation device and
disobeying the manufacturer's instructions.
</P>
<P>
Devco was originally charged with 11 offenses under the act
after at least 10 Cape Breton mine workers were exposed to
radiation over several years without even being warned of danger.
</P>
<P>
Last July, inspectors from the Atomic Energy Control Board
uncovered a faulty radiation device being used by workers to
identify obstructions in the coal chute at the Phalen mine in New
Waterford of the province.
</P>
<P>
Federal inspectors found that a broken latch on the device's
protective shutter allowed it to emit gamma rays, the local press
report said.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Slave Labor Compensation Talks to Resume in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley told a regular
briefing that it's not useful to set "artificial deadline" for the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has hoped negotiators can work out
an agreed formula during this session on the allocation of the 10
billion deutsche mark (about 4.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Foley said allocation issue will be "the primary focus"of the
session. "And they are considering the various broad categories of
recipients, to include slave laborers, forced laborers, and other
personal injury cases;banking, Aryanization, insurance, the future
fund, and administrative costs."
</P>
<P>
The money is to be divided between some 240,000 slave laborers,
about one million forced laborers, other people who filed personal
injury suits, victims of banking Aryanization and a "future fund"
for education and commemoration of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
"Completion of other details we think will take additional time,
and we do not expect that this will be the last negotiating
session," Foley added.
</P>
<P>
The administration's "fundamental goal in these talks is to see
payments begin as soon as possible, before the end of this year
certainly," he said.

UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi

"We also noted that there has been no date set for the
elections," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Haiti's electoral body announced Friday that it was postponing
national and local elections due to difficulties in organizing the
balloting. It did not give a new date for the poll which has been

ATHENS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The left-wing political parties of
Greece and Germany Monday urged the European Union (EU) and the
United States to end their sanctions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued here Monday, Greece's Coalition
of the Left leader Nikos Constantopoulos and Germany's Party of
Democratic Socialism (PDS) leader Lothar Bisky stated that the
lifting of sanctions on Yugoslavia would contribute to peace and
stability in the region and allow the development of cooperation
between all Balkan countries in the direction of European
integration.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also called for respect for human and minority
rights in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and the territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the need for left-wing parties in Europe to
cooperate and jointly present an alternative proposal to neo-
liberalism on the building of Europe and oppose the spreading of
the American model.
</P>
<P>
The two parties would work on a plan for Balkan development
and reconstruction in opposition to the Euroatlantic-inspired
Stability Pact, they said.

BERLIN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Austrian parliament President
Heinz Fischer came to Berlin Monday and was received by German
Federal President Johannes Rau.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, German parliament President Wolfgang
Thierse had a talk with President Fischer.
</P>
<P>
President Thierse stresses that the ultra-right politician
Joerg Haider doesn't amount to Austria. "I am opposed to
identifying Austria with Haider," he said after his meeting with
Fischer.
</P>
<P>
The friendly talk focused on the political situation in
Austria after the forming of the right and conservative coalition
and the bilateral relations, according to Thierse. President
Fischer also talked about these topics with German President Rau.
</P>
<P>
Fischer belongs to the Austrian Social Party.
</P>
<P>
The members of the German parliament, Bundestag, will go to
Vienna on May 4 to take part in the commemoration for the victims
of the Holocaust during World War II, according to Thierse.
</P>
<P>

joined the Austrian government, Germany froze almost all the
bilateral relations with Austria as other European Union countries.

BRUSSELS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Makeleine
Albright will visit the NATO headquarters in Brussels Friday, NATO
sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
She is expected to meet with NATO chiefs and 19 NATO members'
ambassadors during her visit. Analysts recently said American and
NATO officials believe the European plan for an independent
military force may be a riskier proposition than it seemed just
three month ago when the 15 European Union countries decided to go
ahead with the project at their Helsinki summit.
</P>
<P>
Albright has summed up U.S. concerns with what she calls the "
three D's" -- the European Defense Initiative must not "decouple"
the United States from Europe, it must not "duplicate" NATO
structures and capabilities, and it must not "discriminate"
against NATO members that do not belong to the European Union.
Albright is expected to stress the concern again during her NATO
visit.

<P>
BEIRUT, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri Monday met with Iranian Deputy
Foreign Minister Mohammad Sadr currently on a visit to show his
country's support to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the deputy minister told reporters that he
conveyed a message from Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to
Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Khatami expressed his country's support
for the Lebanese people in resisting the Israeli aggression, and
praised the close ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
To support Lebanese people, Iran has sent an electrician team to
Lebanon to construct a power plant, Sadr said.
</P>
<P>
Sadr also met with Hezbollah Secretary-general Sayyed Hassan
Nasrallah on Sunday. He said the Israeli withdrawal decision is a
victory for Lebanese resistance.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet approved Prime Minister Ehud Barak's plan to
withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a "security zone" in 1985 in southern Lebanon
to protect settlements along its border from attacks by anti-Israel
groups, mainly the Iran-backed Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
The surge of fire exchanges between Israeli occupation troops
and Hezbollah since the beginning of this year has left seven
Israeli soldiers dead.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Canadian International Trade
Minister Pierre Pettigrew will begin a three-nation tour in South
America Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister will discuss the work on the Free Trade Area of
the Americas (FTAA) with officials in Uruguay, Argentina and Chile
during his five-day visits to the three nations, a government
statement said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The FTAA will position Canada on the ground floor of one of
the principal economic areas of the world," the minister said in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The FTAA negotiations, which are expected to conclude in 2005,
will lead to the establishment of the world's largest free trade
region, with a population of 800 million and a combined GDP of
about 10 trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Pettigrew also said he would "demonstrate
Canadian know-how in key sectors such as mining, information
technology and services."
</P>
<P>
In 1999, two-way merchandise trade between Canada and Uruguay,
Argentina and Chile totaled over 1.4 billion Canadian dollars (
about 965 million U.S. dollars). Canada's investment in the three
countries is estimated at 13 billion dollars (about 8.96 billion U.
S. dollars), according to the government statement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Putin's Remarks on NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Putin told the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) Sunday that
Russia remains willing to seek more integration with NATO even by
joining the Atlantic alliance if Moscow was treated as an equal
partner.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the remarks, State Department spokesman James
Foley told reporters that Putin "was not launching a trial balloon
" and the remarks are "positive."
</P>
<P>
"His answer was one we find positive in the sense that it
indicates that there is a renewed willingness in Moscow to improve
relations with NATO, to begin to work again with the alliance,"
Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"So we welcome Acting President Putin's determination to
establish good relations with the West, and we see his statement
in that light," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, reports quoted NATO Secretary-General George
Robertson as saying Russian membership was not on the agenda and
they cited Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov as saying Putin's
answer was hypothetical.
</P>
<P>
Foley said, "I think he also made clear that the question of
membership is not on NATO's -- membership in NATO is not currently
on Russia's agenda."
</P>
<P>
However, he added that "the United States is certainly prepared
to work with Russia and our allies in pursuing closer cooperation"
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We think that this relationship between NATO and Russia is
obviously a cornerstone to security in the wider Europe, and we
want to see that develop," Foley noted.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Russia and NATO were frozen after the
alliance started its air campaign against Yugoslavia last year.
Robertson visited Moscow last month in an effort to repair the
relations.
</P>
<P>
"We think we need to focus on the joint NATO-Russia agenda and
breathe new life into it. One essential step is to resume
substantive consultations in the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint
Council on a broad range of security issues," Foley said.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Gets Biggest Direct Investment in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONDEVIDEO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Common Market (
Mercosur) got last year the biggest direct investment in its
history in spite of the regional crisis, said French Agriculture
Credit Bank representative in Latin America Bernard Brousse on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of Mercosur countries, Brazil heads direct investments with 30
billion U.S. dollars and Argentina with 17, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Latin America obtained 22 percent of the total direct
investment in emerging countries, compared with nine percent in
1990, Brousse said.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur is composed of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay,
and has Chile and Bolivia as associate members.

<HEADLINE> NATO Makes Gesture to Russia For Better Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General George
Robertson said Monday that the NATO-Russia relationship has proved
"durable and strong enough to overcome periods of disagreement."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement when commenting on Acting Russian
President Vladimir Putin's remarks during his interview Sunday
with the British Broadcast Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief welcomed "the positive spirit" shown by Putin on
the BBC program, saying NATO recognizes "the need for partnership
between the Alliance and Russia, and will work hard to build on
our existing links."
</P>
<P>
Robertson said NATO's effort makes for an already challenging
task, but said Russian membership of NATO is not on agenda at
present.
</P>
<P>
Putin's comments underline "the renewal of our partnership, as
did my recent visit to Moscow," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said on the same day that Putin's statement dose not rule out
joining NATO and it is "a hypothetical answer to a hypothetical
question."
</P>
<P>
Putin "set out Russia's fundamental principles for its
relations with the North Atlantic alliance, which means that we
are ready for and interested in being NATO's partner in dealing
with key modern problems, and primarily in creating a new
architecture of European security," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia froze its ties with NATO last March when the military
bloc started air strikes against Yugoslavia. Their relations
thawed last month with Robertson's visit to Moscow. But mistrust
persists in the relationship as Russia remains adamantly opposed
to NATO's further expansion eastward. Brussels' criticism of
Russia's military actions against rebels in its breakaway republic
of Chechnya has also strained their ties.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Survivors of Mass Killing Ask U.S. to Start Compensation Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korean survivors of U.S.
mass killing held a news conference Monday, urging the U.S.
government to speed up its probe and begin negotiating
compensation and an apology.
</P>
<P>
"I implore that this ... be resolved quickly so that my
suffering will come to an end," said Yang Hae Chan, who lost six
family members in the 1950 massacre of civilians by the U.S.
soldiers at the South Korean village of No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
Survivors and their newly hired American lawyers told the news
conference that the U.S. Army investigation into the massacre is
going too slowly.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a complicated situation," said attorney Robert
Swift, who has negotiated compensation for Holocaust survivors in
several high-profile cases.
</P>
<P>
"We know who did the shooting, and we know who was killed ...
and we also know that these were unarmed civilians," he added.
</P>
<P>
Swift noted that while the United States has been pressing
Europeans to resolve Holocaust issues and for compensation, it
shows no urgency to deal with its own problem, which he said is no
less a human rights case than Holocaust-era wrongs.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's one thing for the United States to lecture
Europeans on how to resolve Holocaust issues and another for it to
step up and say it wants to resolve its own problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said President Bill Clinton should appoint someone to begin
negotiating with survivors and their lawyers to confirm the facts
of the case and negotiate compensation and an apology.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Party Leaders Call for All-Party Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Social Democratic and Labor
Party and the Ulster Unionists in Northern Ireland Monday called
for all-party talks to try to revive the ailing peace process.
</P>
<P>
They were speaking after they met for a two-hour meeting at
Stormont in Belfast, describing the discussions as "positive."
</P>
<P>
However, the parties said they shared concerns that the British
and Irish governments did not appear to have a joint strategy in
an attempt to break the political impasse.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been deadlocked since the Northern
Ireland assembly was suspended last month over the impasse over
paramilitary arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Sean Farren of the SDLP said his party thought it would be "
right and proper" that both governments should move to convene a
meeting in order to assess the current situation.
</P>
<P>
There's far too much information and assessments being provided
on an unilateral basis, which doesn't make for clarity as to where
we are," he said.
</P>
<P>
Michael McGimpsey of the UUP said, "I believe we broadly share
with the SDLP what the second step should be after the initial
round-table discussions."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a delegation from the cross-community Alliance Party
led by party leader Sean Neeson held talks with Irish Foreign
Minister Brian Cowen in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The meetings came after a three-week "cooling off period,"
during which the British and Irish governments hoped
recriminations following the assembly suspension would abate.
