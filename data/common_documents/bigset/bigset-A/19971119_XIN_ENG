<HEADLINE> MENA Conference Supports Land-for-Peace Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Attendants at the fourth Middle
East and North Africa (MENA) Economic Conference today expressed
their commitment to the Mideast peace based on the land-for-peace
formula.
</P>
<P>
The stand was contained in the Doha Declaration released at
the closing session of the conference despite strong opposition
from the Israeli delegation.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also called on all parties involved in the
Middle East peace process to keep their commitments to the
already signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The delegates, it said, expressed "grave concern" over the hard
economic situation in the Palestinian self-rule areas caused by
Israeli security closure and called for immediate removal of such
measures.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing ceremony, Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad
Bin Jassim Bin Jabir al-Thani said that "no balanced regional
economic cooperation can be achieved without having a just and
comprehensive peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
On regional economic cooperation, the declaration said some
reform measures like privatization, structural adjustment and
removal of trade barriers have enhanced the region's economic
potentials.
</P>
<P>
The delegates have expressed their desire to encourage the
continuation of the building up of regional institutions like the
Middle East-North Africa Bank for Economic Cooperation and
Development, according to the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of this bank was decided at the previous
conferences, but the initial funding shared by the United States
and other western powers has been delayed.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thani said the conference is a success with some 2,000
people's presence, including 850 foreign business
representatives, from 65 countries.
</P>
<P>
But observers here noted that the actual political
representation is at the lowest level since the MENA conference
was initiated in 1994, because of a massive Arab boycott.
</P>
<P>
A dozen Arab countries, including Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia
and the Palestinians, have refused to send political delegations
to the Arab-Israeli conference in protest against Israeli hardline
policy in the deadlocked peace process. Most of those which did
attend were represented only by senior official.
</P>
<P>
But the adverse atmosphere has been offset a bit by an active
participation of the businessmen. The host Qatar has garnered
investment and trade deals worth 4.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The host of next MENA conference will be decided by the World
Economic Forum, which is the convener of the MENA, in January.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Wants to Keep Chubais in Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will not remove first Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Anatoly Chubais from his post, said Itar-Tass news agency today.
</P>
<P>
"The president considered all the economic, financial and
investment consequences of such a resignation," presidential press
secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a briefing here.
</P>
<P>
Chubais tendered his resignation for alleged involvement in a
scandal over a book about privatization in Russia. It was reported
that each author of the unpublished book received a fee of 90,000
U.S. dollars, which stirred up a major political scandal.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky suggested that the left-wing opposition in the
State Duma "cool down".
</P>
<P>
The book's co-authors were Maxim Boiko, Deputy Prime Minister
and head of the Ministry for the Management of State Property;
Pyotr Mostovoy, head of the Federal Bankrupcy Agency; and
Alexander Kazakov, First Deputy Chief of Staff of the President.
All of them, except Chubais, have been fired by Yeltsin.

<P>
HARARE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and Mozambique should
work together in Malaria control programs to erase the disease in
common border areas, a senior Mozambican health official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Health Director Alexander Manguele said there is need for the two
countries to cooperate in fighting malaria to secure more
success in the anti-malaria campaigns of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
''It is good for the neighbouring countries to engage in technical
discussions involving professionals to map out strategies of how best
we can control the malaria,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Manguele said like Zimbabwe, Mozambique had also embarked on a
veccontrol program in its peri-urban and rural areas as well as
shanty towns which are the malaria high risk areas.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique and Angola have the highest malaria related death rates
in the Southern Africa Development Community region.
</P>
<P>
However, Mozambique is aiming at significantly reducing the
malaria death rate by the end of the century through an effective
malaria awareness campaign which had already been launched,
ther Mozambican official said.
</P>
<P>
Manguele said since the end of the civil war in 1992, the
government had implemented an accelerated reconstruction program
for the health sector which had seen most Mozambicans getting access
to health services.

<HEADLINE> Intel Plans Price-cutting to Boost Chip Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Intel, the world's Largest
maker of computer chips, is planning the third price-cutting of
its products since last summer, analysts and industry sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
The price levels expected to be introduced on Febuary 1 will be
significantly low. The 233-megahertz (MHz) Pentium II, for
example, will be reduced to 300 U.S. dollars each, said Drew Peck,
analyst from Cowen &AMP; amp Co.
</P>
<P>
Such reductions are aimed at attracting customers to buy its
latest Pentium II computer chips, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the trade publication Computer Retail Week reported
in its on-line edition that Intel was preparing to cut the prices
of large-quantity orders for its 233-MHz Pentium II chip by
roughly one-third.
</P>
<P>
Cited unnamed sources, it reported that in February Intel will
cut prices of its 266-MHz Pentium II to 370 dollars from the
current 520 dollars and its 300-MHz Pentium II from 721 dollars to
520 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new 333-MHz Pentium II will be priced at 705 dollars
each. Two faster versions, the 350-MHz at 840 dollars and the
400-MHz at 980 dollars, are due to ship in April, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
This will be Intel's third major price reduction in the
year. The first price cut in last summer ranged from 30 to 50
percent. The second followed at the end of October when the
markdowns were 13 to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Intel, supplying chips for more than 80 percent personal
computers sold worldwide, has tended to reduce prices of at least
some of its products every quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The confrontation between
the government and the judiciary intensified as Pakistan's
Parliament today adopted the amended contempt law, tending to give
protection to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the ongoing case of
contempt against him in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The new law, titled Contempt of Court (Amendment) Act 1997, was
passed by a simple majority in the National Assembly early this
morning and by the Senate later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The law, which provides for an intra-court appeal before a
"larger bench consisting of all the remaining available judges of
the court within the country", has been submitted to President
Farooq Leghari for signing.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic aspect of the law as a provision is that it
would cover the pending cases and shall be applicable even at the
stage of the show-cause notice proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The government's move is seen as an attempt to preempt any
adverse Supreme Court judgment against Prime Minister Sharif and
others in a contempt of court case.
</P>
<P>
The amended law came only one day after Prime Minister Sharif
declined to tender an apology in the Supreme Court in the contempt
of court case against him.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, in an unprecedented move, Nawaz Sharif appeared
personally in the Supreme Court and denied the allegations that he
committed contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in Pakistan's history that an elected
prime minister appeared before the apex court.
</P>
<P>
"I have neither committed contempt of court, nor do I intend to
do that," Sharif said in his written reply to the show-cause
notice issued by the Supreme Court in the contempt of court case.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Pakistan Muslim League (N) led by Sharif and its
allied parties, which came to power in February this year, enjoy a
favorable majority in both the National Assembly and the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Hikes in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's year-on-year
inflation rose to 16 percent in October underpinned by a 2.1
percentage point increase in food inflation, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Last month the Millers Association of Zimbabwe announced a 36
percent increase in meal-mealie, while the Master Bakers
Association hiked the price of bread by between 7.5 and 10
percent which market annalysts said was some of the contributory
factors to the upward move.
</P>
<P>
There was a down surge in inflation from 18 percent in August
to 14.4 percent in September, a drop that surprised most market
watchers who expected the figure to be much higher following a
spate of administered price increases.
</P>
<P>
The Discount Company of Zimbabwe predicted that the
inflation will end the year pegged at around 19 percent because
of a spate of administered price increases and above inflation
wage settlements.

Ahmad Hamam Atiyeh was named as the new head of the State

unsuccessful negotiations with the militant groups, which
eventually cost his job.

At least 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians were killed
after six Islamic militants fired randomly at groups of tourists
in front of the Hatshepsut Temple in Luxor, about 500 kilometers

</P>
<P>
Twenty-four were also injured in the fire and the ensuing
shoot-out between the police and the gunmen who were also killed.

<P>
Mubarak, in an inspection tour of Luxor, also criticized the

JOHANNESBURG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is considering
buying armaments from South Africa, and is interested in the
Rooivalk attack helicopter, the South African Press Association

</P>
<P>
"The possibility is being considered, but there is nothing

</P>
<P>
He said his government was shopping around for armaments for
defensive purposes.

"From the Indonesian side, we are comparing, we are looking at

Rooivalk is the most advanced, compared to helicopters from other
countries," the spokesman added.

Although Indonesian President Soeharto will visit South

<P>
Soeharto will arrive in Cape town on Thursday morning from
Namibia for a two-day visit and is scheduled to hold talks with

<P>
ANKARA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP), a major northern Iraqi party, recaptured most of the
territory lost to its rivals, according to a written statement
issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The KDP forces gained military success in battles with the
pro-Iranian Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), the KDP statement said.
</P>
<P>
The KDP forces captured on Monday the border post of Haji
Omran on the Iranian border, reasserting its control over the
entire strategic Hamilton road linking norther Iraq and Iran, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The KDP, allegedly backed by Ankara and Baghdad, started its
counter offensives against the PUK and PKK militants since
November 8, driving them back to the demarcated cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
The PUK and PKK reportedly joined hands in fighting the KDP
since October 13, capturing some of the territory formerly
controlled by the KDP.

<HEADLINE> KDP Regains Positions From Rival Party in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP), a major northern Iraqi party, recaptured most of the
territory lost to its rivals, according to a written statement
issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The KDP forces gained military success in battles with the
pro-Iranian Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), the KDP statement said.
</P>
<P>
The KDP forces captured on Monday the border post of Haji
Omran on the Iranian border, reasserting its control over the
entire strategic Hamilton road linking norther Iraq and Iran, it
added.
</P>
<P>
It said that the KDP forces, allegedly backed by Ankara
and Baghdad, started its counter offensives against the PUK and
PKK militants since November 8, driving them back to the
demarcated cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
The PUK and PKK reportedly joined hands in fighting the
KDP since October 13, capturing some of the territory formerly
controlled by the KDP.
</P>
<P>
The KDP and PUK have been fighting each other for the
control of northern Iraq following the 1990 Gulf War. Their
clashes intensified since Mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, the United States and Britain had accused the PUK
of provoking the fresh clashes with the KDP, which was denied
by the PUK.
</P>
<P>
The central government of Iraq had been deprived of control
over the northern part of the country since the Gulf war in 1990
by the allied forces led by the United States. A no-fly zone was
set up there and the Iraqi, Iranian and Turkish rebels had been
operating in the area against their respective governments under
the umbrella of the allied forces.

<HEADLINE> UK NHS Waiting List Reaches Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of patients in
Britain waiting to be admitted to a National Health Service (NHS)
hospital reached 1,207,500 at the end of September, an all time
record, according to official figures today.
</P>
<P>
Department of Health figures showed that 818 patients had been
waiting longer than the 18-month Patient's Charter guaranteed
period.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Frank Dobson said that he was setting up a new
task-force to cut waiting lists and the government was committed to
tackling the problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a survey published today by the NHS Confederation
showed that 55 percent of Britain's 120 health authorities predict
they will be in debt by April next year.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of those expecting an overspend are considering
cutting services, and ward closures are likely in one in five
hospitals while almost 60 percent plan to postpone or cancel
routine operations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Central Bank Under Fire Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The move by the Reserve Bank,
Zimbabwe's central bank, to increase the rediscount rate in a bid
to reverse the recent slide in the Zimbabwe Dollar will throw
off the track efforts to achieve macro-economic stability.
</P>
<P>
This was warned today by Zimbabwean economic commentators, who
said Monday's hike of the rediscount rate, the rate at which
banks borrow money from the central bank, did not solve
fundamental macro-economic problems and was only a stop-gap
measure.
</P>
<P>
"All that we have been trying to do to achieve macro-economic
stability will no longer be attainable," Chief Economist of
Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce John Makamure said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to save the Zimbabwe Dollar which plunged to an all
time low last week under the heavy pressure from import demand, the
Reserve Bank increased the rediscount rate by three percent from
25.5 to 28.5 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Dollar was trading between 19 and 25 Dollars to the U.S.
Dollar after speculations that the Reserve Bank did not have
sufficient foreign currency reserves to finance import
obligations.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank quickly intervened and pumped in some 20
million U.S. Dollars to support the Zimbabwe Dollar which is now
trading at between 13 and 14 Dollars to the U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Makamure said while in the short-term the central bank's move
would help arrest the current slide of the local currency, in the
long run the problem might recur.
</P>
<P>
"They are not addressing fundamental problems because they are
only concerned with checking the high import demand," he said,
adding that investor confidence would be further eroded.
</P>
<P>
President of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries Jonee
Blanchfield said, "for as long as the budget deficit and
inflation remain high, the problems of depreciation of the
currency will continue to haunt the economy."

<HEADLINE> European Ministers Approve Measures Addressing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Delegates including transport
and environment ministers from 40 European countries have agreed
on measures addressing environmental problems caused by transport.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued here today by the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE), the delegates
adopted a political Declaration and a Program of Joint Action at
the end of a three-day meeting held last week in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
The declaration and the program provide a comprehensive set of
strategies and measures to cope with the environmental problems
caused by transport.
</P>
<P>
"What makes this conference so special is that transport
ministers and environment ministers have met for the first time at
the international level and come to the same conclusion: it cannot
go on like this," stressed Yves Berthelot, UN/ECE Executive
Secretary.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, a number of UN/ECE member countries
signed two international legally binding instruments in the field
of transport also aimed at improving its environmental
performance.

<HEADLINE> Angola Urges Strengthening of Sanctions on UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Foreign Minister of
Angola Joao Miranda today urged African countries to join
together to implement the United Nations resolution on imposing
sanctions against the opposition UNITA.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while meeting African diplomats based in
Angola here today.
</P>
<P>
Miranda noted that some African countries still feel
resentment at implementing the UN sanctions against the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
He said that such resentment should be criticized and
contained, otherwise the full implementation of the UN resolution
would be out of the question.
</P>
<P>
But Miranda said that imposing sanctions against the
UNITA does not mean to exclude it from the political life of
Angola. The government holds that the UNITA is part of the
national politics system, he added.
</P>
<P>
The UN resolution on sanctions against the UNITA took effect on
October 30.

<HEADLINE> Former S. African President to Be Subpoenaed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president P W Botha will be subpoenaed again to testify at the
next round of hearings on the role of the former State Security
Council, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The subpoena is likely to be delivered this afternoon, SAPA
said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted sources from the Truth and Reconcilidation
Commission as saying that the only thing that is uncertain is
whether the hearings will be held in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Commission spokeswoman Christelle Terreblanche said former
Defense Minister Magnus Malan and former Head of the Intelligence
Service, Neil Barnard, would also appear at the hearings one day
before Botha's supposed testimony on December 5.
</P>
<P>
Botha was subpoenaed at the end of September to appear before
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission at the first round of
hearings in Johannesburg in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
But his testimony was postponed on the grounds of ill health.
TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu then decided to hold the second round
in George, Western Cape, a place close to Botha's retirement
home.
</P>
<P>
But Botha said at the weekend in an interview with an
Afrikaans newspaper that he would rather be taken to court and
charged than appear before the TRC.
</P>
<P>
An angry Tutu said Monday that the hearing will continue and
that if Botha is not willing to attend, the commission's founding
act would come into play.
</P>
<P>
The Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act
provides for a fine, a two-year jail term or both if a person
refuses to obey a subpoena without sufficient causes.
</P>
<P>
Botha said he would not apologize for the role of his
government in the apartheid era and that nor would he apply for
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
He attacked the TRC, a special court set up to heal the wounds
of apartheid, saying that it has gradually been turned into a
revenge camp against the Afrikaner.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is simply that the commission does not bring
reconciliation, but is trying to tear the Afrikaner and the South
African nation apart," he said in the newspaper interview.

<HEADLINE> ECA Observes African Statistics and Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Theme of this year's
African satatistics and information days, which fall on Novemebr
18 and 19, is ''building an inforamtion society'', the United
Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) said today.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here, the ECA said the observation
of the African statistics and information days this year is
centered around strengthening statistical information systems,
promoting information technologies, building geoinformation
systems and dissemination of development information.
</P>
<P>
The ECA said the weak status of national statistical services
was recognized by the ECA conference of ministers responsible for
economic and social development which adopted the Addis Ababa
Plan of Action for statistical development in Africa and the
strategy for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Through the Coordinating Committee on African Statistical
Development (CASD), a task force on connectivety for statistics
was established in May 1997 to ensure that CASD members and
eventually national statistical services are connected through
the Internet, the ECA said. This will enable coordination and
speedier transfer of data between or among countries, ECA and
other international agencies, it added.
</P>
<P>
It said the African focal point for this effort, the ECA's
Development Inforamtion Services Division, is charged with the
responsibility of coordinating and implementating the African
Information Society Initiative (AISI), a framework for putting in
place a development-centered inforamtion society adopted by the
ministers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This year's commemoration of the African statistics and
information days, offers an opportunity for individuals and
organizations within African countries#,international
organizations, donor agencies and the mass media "to assist in
enhancing inforamtion infrastructure, as well as data production
and dissemination for effective socio-economic policy analysis
and management'', the ECA said.

<P>
LUANDA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States ambassador
to Angola Donald Steinberg said here today that he felt
disappointed over the failure to achieve progress in the Angolan
peace process recently.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Angolan parliament Speaker Roberto da Almeida,
Steinberg told reporters that the opposition Nation Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has refused to cooperate with
the Angolan government in re-establishing local government organs
in the areas under its control and transforming its radio station
into a non-partisan commercial one since the UN sanctions against
it took effect on October 30.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the UNITA also suspended the disbandment
of its remaining troops, thus no progress has been made in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the United Nations will hold a informal
meeting this week to discuss the situation in Angola and at the
meeting the UN special representative Blondin Beye will present a
report on the present situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
New sanction measures are likely to be taken at the meeting,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The American envoy urged the UNITA to take concrete measures
to implement the Lusaka peace agreement signed in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Vital to Southern Africa: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The private sector will
play an important part in the future development of southern
Africa, a senior official of Southern African Development
Community (SADC) said in Gaborone, Botswana today.
</P>
<P>
"We are opening up to the private sector and this process is
irreversible," Kaire Mbuende, SADC Executive Secretary, told the
southern African trade and investment summit, which is organized
by the International Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
"This conference illustrates the strong desire of this region
to intensify economic cooperation with the private sector. Our
program of action is geared towards equity and growth, with a
very strong bias towards the private sector as the engine of
growth," Mbuende said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of regional trade, he said, the SADC is the most
integrated and advanced economic bloc in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"For a group of developing countries that have emerged from
civil strife and political instability, this indeed a great
achievement," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Intra-SADC trade is about 22 percent of total SADC trade. Out
of this, it is estimated that seven billion U.S. Dollars worth of
trade is transacted in goods with tariffs ranging between zero to
five percent.
</P>
<P>
"Seventy percent of the trade is taking place under very low
tariff," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that the importance for a SADC free
trade area is not only in the expansion of intra-SADC trade
flows, but also in its potential to stimulate domestic,
cross-border and foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
"The object of SADC is to have balanced trade among its
members states. This can only be achieved if trade in the region
is completely liberalized and the countries produce goods and
services according to their comparative advantages," the SADC
official said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Hopes for Diplomatic Way Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today again expressed
welcome to efforts to seek a diplomatic solution to the present
crisis, but stressed its demands for the United Nations should be
met "in totality."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al Sahhaf told a news
briefing this afternoon that Iraq has presented eight demands to
the U.N., which constitute a plan for solving the standoff over
weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
He said Baghdad asked for the implementation of paragraph 22 of
the U.N. resolution 687 to lift the seven-year-old sanctions
against Iraq and the restructuring of the U.N. arms monitoring
group "in a balanced way."
</P>
<P>
That means the U.N. commission overseeing Iraq's disarmament
would have more members of all nationalities rather than American
citizens who he accused of implementing U.S. hostile policies
against Iraq, and carry out its mission in a "fair, objective and
scientific way," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf challenged the U.S. to accept the formation of a
committee comprises of representatives of five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council and any number of neutral countries
to come to Iraq to check and verify all American allegations that
Iraq is hiding secretive weapons development programs.
</P>

He called the allegations "false" and "baseless" which were
aimed at misinforming and deceiving the world public.
</P>
<P>
He attacked U.S. President Bill Clinton for failing to
recognize that 400 Iraqi children died daily because of
U.N. sanctions and U.S. effort to prevent the Security Council
from fulfilling obligations toward Iraq - lifting sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He brushed aside the reported offer by the U.S. to broaden the
"oil-for-food" program as an incentive for Baghdad to back off,
saying it is irrelevant to a political or diplomatic way out.
</P>
<P>
The program "has nothing to do with it" and therefore can not
be part of a political package, he said. He also pointed out that
the U.S. wants to play up the "temporary measure" for a "diversion
from the real target" of lifting sanctions.
</P>
<P>
However, he softened his tone by saying "We encourage dialogue
between Iraq and the United States."

<HEADLINE> UK Says UN Arms Inspection Composition Could be Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The British government
indicated today that it might agree to change the composition of
the UN arms inspection team, but refuse to discuss the issue with
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The London government rejected Monday an Iraqi compromise
proposal of readmitting American arms inspectors, under which the
Iraqis insisted on equal representation on the arms inspection
teams to all five permanent Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
Britain's stance remains tough today with a government official
reported as saying: "We will not negotiate with Iraq on the
composition of UNSCOM (the UN Special Commission on Iraq)."
</P>
<P>
However, the official gave some indication of making
concessions by saying: "We have no problem if that mix (of the
inspetion teams) were to increase and if an individual country
increased its numbers (within UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
"This would be no problem for Britain as far as United Nations
operations go," he added.
</P>
<P>
A British intelligence assessment was quoted by the Reuters as
saying today that Iraq could make some chemical and biological
weapons "in a matter of months" if the UN arms inspection teams
were removed "for a sustained period".

LUSAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and the Irish Aid will provide Lusaka with a total
of 1.368 million U.S. Dollars to help the capital Lusaka improve
its basic services.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed here today by the UNDP, the Irish
Aid and the Zambian government, the UNDP promises to give 700,000
Dollars, and the Irish Aid 668,000 Dollars while the government
will allocate 172,000 Dollars for the project.
</P>
<P>
Acting Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning Hkonga Mwaba said at the signing ceremony that
there has been a rapid degradation of Zambia's urban environment
due to unsustainable development patterns.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Zambian cities especially Lusaka have failed to cope
with the growing population's demand for basic services such as clean
water supply and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade and more, the population of Lusaka has
increased by at least fourfold, from about half a million to
well over two million.
</P>
<P>
Mwaba called on the Lusaka City Council to include poverty
eradication in the sustainable Lusaka program.
</P>
<P>
He said the high levels of poverty in the city contribute to
environmental degradation and that the two should be addressed at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
UNDP acting resident representative Omoefe Oyaide said the UNDP is
committed to supporting Zambia in its effort to eradicate environment
degradation.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today strongly condemns
the Monday massacre in southern Egypt, in which 77 tourists were
killed, including 73 foreigners, Jordan's official news agency
Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
In a cable of condolence to his Egyptian counterpart Kamal
el-Ganzouri, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali said
today that such a criminal act ran contrary to Arab and Islamic
traditions and should be strongly condemned.
</P>
<P>
Majali called for efforts at regional and international levels
to put an end to terrorist acts wherever they came from and
whoever stood behind them.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries should seek closer cooperation and the
international community should offer more help for the Arab
countries in combating terrorist acts, he added in his cable.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan, who is now in the United States, made a
phone call Monday to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
expressed condolence over the death of Egyptians and foreign
tourists in the massacre.
</P>
<P>
The king expressed Jordan's support for the Egyptian
government and people in face of such acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Jordanian Minister of State for Information
Affairs Samir Mutawe said in an official statement that "our
position on these criminal acts is crystal clear. We condemn such
acts of violence and terrorism regardless of their source and
who stands behind them."
</P>
<P>
"We in Jordan support the Egyptian position vis-a-vis such
acts of violence and express our deep condolences to the
bereaved families and wish those injured a speedy recovery," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mutawe added that these criminal acts, which caused human and
material losses, sabotage the aspirations of the people in the
region towards stability and peace.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayaz Tarawneh called his
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa Monday and condemned the massacre.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been enjoying a friendly relationship with Egypt.
It unilaterally recognized Egypt in September 1984, becoming the
first Arab state to do so after most Arab League members cut
their ties with Cairo in 1979 to protest the Israeli-Egyptian
peace treaty.

LUANDA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Secretary of
State for Energy and Science John Battle today urged more efforts
to be put into cooperation in oil tapping between his country and
Angola.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here at a symposium on deep water
technology held by British Petroleum Corporation (BP).
</P>
<P>
Britain could offer Angola the technology and experience in
deep-water oil tapping, he said.
</P>
<P>
Battle, who arrived here Monday for a three-day visit, also
has an eye for Angola's petroleum and natural gas market, which
he believed would provide great potential for bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Albina Assis, Angolan Minister of Petroleum, said the
country's petroleum industry is now in a new stage which requires
advanced technologies to deal with oil tapping in a complicated
environment.
</P>
<P>
She believed that the British Petroleum Corporation will help
the development of the industry in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Angola has set a goal of daily oil production of one million
barrels by the year 2000. To achieve this, strategic ties

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israeli Nuclear Weapon Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran today condemned the
Israel's secretive nuclear weapon program and the massacre of
tourists in Egypt's historical relic of Luxor, the Iranian
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi was
quoted as saying that the possession by the Israeli government of
atomic weapons betrays their belligerent intentions and their
hatred of peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Perez told the Japanese
daily Yomyuri Shimbon earlier this week that Tel Aviv's
possession of atomic weapons promotes regional peace, and deters
wars.
</P>
<P>
It is ironical that the Middle East countries consider atomic
disarmament as an element contributing to peace while Israel
recognizes peace as the fruit only of its possession of that
destructive weapon, Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was shameful that an Israeli official frankly
admits that Israeli has atomic arsenals while the same regime has
raised a hue and cry intentionally lodging irrelevant claims
against Iran with the idea of leading international conscience
away from its own atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi condemned the massacre of tourists in Egypt Monday
morning, saying that in the Islamic view the ominous phenomenon of
terrorism and killing innocent persons is a condemnable wretched
act.
</P>
<P>
Six gunmen shot randomly at tourists, killing 77 and wounding
at least 24.

NAIROBI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High

Dollars and 2,000 blankets for emergency distribution to flood
victims in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here today, UNHCR said that it is
also preparing to release up to 78 tons of high protein biscuits
from its emergency stockpile to meet immediate food needs of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the record-breaking flooding in southern
Somalia's Juba and Shabelle valley regions had killed more than
2,000 people and displaced 200,000 more.
</P>
<P>
Yvette Stevens, UNHCR representative for Kenya and Somalia
noted that "it will be a great tragedy if, due to a lack of
funds, aid arrives too late to prevent even more massive
population displacements."
</P>
<P>
Relief agencies operating in the country pointed out that
local crop production in southern Somalia had been completely
ruined by floods.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains which started to pour down in southern
Somalia in mid-October have cause the 600-kilometer-long Juba
River to burst its embankments in several locations.

The expected January harvest is to be virtual failure in many
southern areas due to heavy rains and flooding, according to a

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) predicted today
that all SADC member states would have single digit inflation.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that by the turn of the century, all the SADC
member states will have inflation rates below 10 percent provided
present prudent fiscal and monetary discipline is maintained,"
Kaire Mbuende, SADC executive secretary said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the Southern African Trade and
Investment Summit, which is discussing the future of the SADC
region in Gaborone, Botswana. The conference will run till
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Mbuende said, the 14 SADC member countries
would also have their fiscal deficit reduced to below six
percent.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reason for the prediction, Mbuende said,
"fiscal deficits have been reduced to six percent of gross
domestic product in 1995 in most of the SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of present trends, it is expected that for
1996/97 the level of fiscal deficits in SADC member states will
be lower than in 1995/96."
</P>
<P>
On the economic performance of the SADC countries, Mbuende
said there had been a steady rise in the average growth in the
GDP from 3.0 percent in 1994 to 3.7 percent in 1995 and 4.1
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"With this trend, I expect that growth in GDP will rise to 4.5
percent in 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
SADC, established in 1992, is a regional organization to
develop regional economy and to promote free trade within its
framework.

respective permanent secretaries all government property, such as
cars and cellular telephones, Idris was quoted by a Nigerian
Television Authority report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Security has been beefed up substantially at the Federal
Secretariat following the dissolution of the Federal Executive
Council, or cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Armed soldiers and policemen who have taken over the
secretariat security arrangement are seen searching thoroughly
the booths of every car that drove out of the complex.
</P>
<P>
Although the security operatives refused to make comments on
the sudden reinforcement, observers noted that the new
arrangement has something to do with the prevention of possible
removal of government property by either the departing officials
or their numerous agents and aides.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Foils Coup Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone has aborted a coup led by some soldiers aimed at putting an
end to the on-going peace process in that country.
</P>
<P>
About 80 soldiers of the armed forces of Sierra Leone and
fighters of the ex-rebel Revolutionary United Front have been
arrested, Col. Godwin Ugbo, spokesman of Nigeria's defense
headquarters, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The abortive coup, confirmed by a report of the British
Broadcasting Corporation, was led by a group of soldiers,
including Steve Bio, brother of a former defense minister, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the coup which took place on Monday is to
overthrow the rule of Major Johnny Paul Koroma, who came to power
after ousting the legitimate government of President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah in a coup on May 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
The coupists wanted to maintain military rule in the country
because Koroma has promised to hand over power to President
Kabbah in April next year, said Ugbo, who is also director of the
defense information department.
</P>
<P>
The frustration of the fresh coup, according to observers,
will help promote the peace process in Sierra Leone although the
Koroma-led junta differs with west African countries over whether
the national army would be disarmed along with other combatants
in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace accord the junta signed in Conakry,
Guinea last month, all the people with guns across Sierra Leone
should be disarmed and demobilized.
</P>
<P>
But during the talks to work out modalities for implementing
the peace plan earlier this month, the junta refused to do so,
arguing that the armed forces could not be disarmed because it
was set up by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, the junta has begun to disarm child soldiers which
are estimated at about 5,000 throughout the country.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia wasts closer and more
active cooperation with U.S. special services, Russian Security
Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin stated at a meeting today with
visiting FBI Director Louis Freeh, according to the Interfax news
service.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin said that the Russian president encourages cooperation
with foreign law enforcement agencies in fighting crime. Working
contacts between Russian and U.S. special services will show that
the relations between the two countries have matured, the secretary
said.
</P>
<P>
Freeh, in his part, said that the level of cooperation between
U.S. and Russian law enforcement agencies in fighting crime and
money laundering and in training personnel that has been
established since his first visit to Moscow three years ago is not
bad.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also focused on fighting against international
terrorism, the Security Council press service said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) Director Nikolai
Kovalyov and Freeh today also discussed cooperation in fighting
international organized crime, international terrorism and drug
trafficking at a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two men agreed that their agencies had reached a high level
of mutual understanding and cooperation but could do more in this
field.
</P>
<P>
The FBI director arrived in Moscow on Tuesday for a four-day
visit. He is expected to have serious talks with Russian
Vice-Premier and Minister of Interior Anatoly Kulikov.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone to Disarm Child Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's military junta
has started identifying and registering the country's estimated
5,000 child soldiers as a preparation to disarm them in December.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted the junta's Social Welfare
Minister Major Kula Samba as saying that identification and
registration work started Monday in regional capitals including
Bo, Kenema, Makeni and other towns.
</P>
<P>
The move was in the spirit of the Conakry agreement signed
last Month in Guinea between the junta and the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provided that all soldiers in Sierra Leone, no
matter which faction they belong to, will be disarmed starting
from December, as the first step toward the restoration of
elected civilian President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah and his government were overthrown by a sector of the
country's armed forces on May 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Samba, child soldiers were employed by the
country's army, the Revolutionary United Front rebels, the
Kamajors traditional hunters and other militia groups.
</P>
<P>
To implement the Conakry agreement, the ECOWAS peace-keeping
force (ECOMOG) has held several talks with the Sierra Leonean
junta led by Major Paul Johnny Koroma.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the junta has agreed to disarm all the
militia groups but insisted the army could not be disarmed,
because it is the national army.

<HEADLINE> EU to Create More Jobs Via Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
pronounced that environmental protection can contribute to job
creation among European Union member states.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the European summit on employment, the
commission, the executive body of the 15-nation union, adopted a
communication on environment and employment.
</P>
<P>
The communication was jointly presented by commissioners Ritt
Bjerregaard and Padraig Flynn, in charge of environment and
employment respectively.
</P>
<P>
The commission document announces a concrete agenda for
building a sustainable Europe by achieving a competitive economy
combined with less environmental degradation, improved resource
efficiency of energy and raw materials, and higher employment
rates.
</P>
<P>
Upon adoption, Commissioner Bjerregaard said: "It is now clear
that environment and employment are mutually compatible and if the
two policy areas give more attention to each other, we will obtain
greater results."
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.5 million people in the union now work in
environment-related jobs, according to the Employment Europe
Report 1997. Of the total, about 2 million deal with clean
technologies, renewable energy, waste recycling, nature and
landscape protection and ecological renovation of urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The rest is found in the so-called eco-businesses which produce
technologies, goods and services to measure, prevent, limit or
correct environmental damage to water, air and soil, as well as
problems related to waste, noise and eco-system.
</P>
<P>
"A greater use of renewable energy could generate half a
million of jobs by 2010 while in urban areas thousands of jobs can
be created through investments in renovation of houses and in
public transport, improving considerably the quality of life and
of the environment," added Bjerregaard.
</P>
<P>
High levels of unemployment now go together with environmental
degradation caused by specific sectors such as industry,
transport, energy, agriculture and consumption pattern.
</P>
<P>
The "underuse" of labor resources and the "overuse" of
environmental resources must be reversed, said the communication.
</P>
<P>
European Union-wide, unemployment rate now stands at 10.6
percent while Luxembourg, now serving the six-month rotating
presidency of the union, aspires to cope with the unemployment
issue within its tenure.
</P>
<P>
The two-day employment summit is slated for Thursday and Friday
in Luxembourg.

ADDIS ABABA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Somalia today appealed to
the international community, U.N. agencies, donor countries and
non-governmental organizations to provide emergency relief to the
flood affected Somalis in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here by the National Salvation Council
of Somalia (NSC) said the unprecedented torrential rains followed
by floods have killed hundreds of Somalia in addition to
destroying crops and harvest stores.
</P>
<P>
But U.N. agencies said over 2,000 have died because of the
floods resulting from heavy rains since mid-October in Southern
Somalia. Two major rivers have burst their banks and hundreds of
villages were submerged in flood waters.
</P>
<P>
The press release said, many more death tolls are expected as
a result of malaria, diarrhea and other epidemic diseases
triggered by the reported natural calamities.
</P>
<P>
The NSC which comprises 25 Somali factions now meeting in
Addis, said, ''the valleys of Shabelle and Juba are the areas
most affected with more than one million people left homeless.''

<HEADLINE> Turkey's RP Leader Defends against Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Islamist Welfare Party
(RP) Chairman Necmettin Erbakan said here today that the attempt
to close his party opposed procedural law.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while delivering a verbal defense in the
case filed by High Appeals Court Chief Prosecutor Vural Savas for
closure of his party.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan believed that Savas' filing the case on grounds of RP's
violation of articles 68 and 69 of the Constitution while failing
to pinpointing any breach of the Political Parties Law was
against procedural law.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Erbakan repeated his opinion that the case must be
dismissed from the point of view of procedure.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan's submission of his verbal defense was done at a
hearing here, which was closed to press.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan was expected to deliver the verbal defense on November
11. He requested an additional period of 20 days to prepare his
verbal defense in the closure case, but was granted only a week.
</P>
<P>
Savas filed the case with the Constitutional Court in May
demanding the RP be shut down on the grounds of its support for
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkey's Party Law, Erbakan and other senior RP
officials will be banned from engaging in politics for at least
five years if the party is outlawed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Pick Up Slightly in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer prices
moved up a modest 0.2 percent in October, continuing the steady
trend of inflation rate of the previous three months, the Labor
Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months of 1997, Consumer Price Index filed by
the Department has risen at an annual rate of just 1.8 percent as
compared to a 3.3 percent increase during 1996.
</P>
<P>
While the inflation figures were in line with expectations, a
separate report on business inventories was a bit stronger than
anticipated, pushing bond market yields higher from nearly a
two-year low. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, a barometer for
long-term borrowing costs, rose to 6.07 percent this morning from
late Monday's level of 6.06 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said business inventories grew 0.7
percent in September after much smaller gains of 0.2 percent in
July and 0.1 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
But the growth was outpaced by sales, which jumped 1.3 percent
after a drop of 0.6 percent a month earlier. That resulted in an
inventory-to-sales ratio of just 1.36.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices fell across the board, except for a 2.4 percent
increase for natural gas. The 0.1 percent overall increase was the
smallest since a 0.1 percent dip in July. Prices had risen 1.7
percent in August and 1.3 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline costs, which had jumped 5.4 percent in August and 1.8
percent in September, were down 0.6 percent. Prices for
electricity and fuel oil both declined 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Food costs also remained contained, advancing 0.2 percent after
a 0.1 percent gain a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Price increases in most other categories also remained modest.
</P>
<P>
Although housing costs rose 0.3 percent, clothing, medical care
and transportation costs each inched up just 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prices of new cars actually fell 0.3 percent despite the
beginning of the new model year. Auto finance charges were down
0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percent increase in food prices was due largely to a
1.5 percent jump in the cost of dairy products, steepest since a
1.8 percent advance a year ago.
</P>
<P>
But prices for beef were down 0.6 percent; for pork, down 0.4
percent, and for poultry, down 0.8 percent. Fresh vegetable costs
were unchanged, but fruit prices rose 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Coffee prices, which had risen during much of the year, were
down 1.8 percent. It was the biggest drop since they fell 2.1
percent in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Airline fares shot up 3.8 percent on top of a 2.1 percent jump
in September.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders More Warplanes to Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
today ordered additional U.S. warplanes to the Gulf as a beefing
up of American forces in the region in an attempt to pressure Iraq
to reverse its decision of expulsion of U.S. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by National Security adviser Samuel
Berger right after Clinton's meeting with his senior military and
diplomatic advisors at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said Clinton had been asked by the
Pentagon to send bombers and F-117 stealth fighters to the Gulf
after receiving diplomatic permission from some Arab states in the
region to increase pressure on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate indication where the additional Air Force
planes would be based, but the U.S. military already has a potent
force of more than 250 Air Force and Navy airplanes and 22
warships in the Gulf and Red Sea within striking distance of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
About 150 of the planes are in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and
another 100 on the aircraft carriers Nimitz and George Washington.
</P>
<P>
The George Washington, ordered by Clinton to move to the Gulf
from the Mediterranean last week, is currently moving south in the
Red Sea and will enter the Gulf later this week to join the
Nimitz.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Pentagon said a U-2 spy plane flew over Iraq on
order from the United Nations for weapons inspections. It was the
second flight by the plane in eight days.
</P>
<P>
Iraq did not interfere with the flight as it once vowed to do
so, and the U-2 flew back safely to its air base in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Berger said the beefing up of the American forces in the region
was under consideration for about a week and was not directly
related to the resumption of the U-2 flight today.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Take New Security Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today gave instructions forming a committee entrusted with mapping
out a "water-tight" plan for securing the major tourist cities in
the country, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said to newspapers' chief editors accompanying him from
Luxor to Cairo today that the committee will comprise the prime
minister, the defense and interior ministers and the governors of
Aswan, Luxor, Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghda, Egypt's major tourist
cities, to finalize a plan within 48 to 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
The president visited the latter three cities today, a day
after the country's most deadly terrorist attack took place in
Luxor, about 500 kilometers south of Cairo on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Six Islamic militants fired randomly at groups of tourists in
front of the Hatshepsut Temple in Luxor, killing 77 tourists,
including 73 foreigners. Mubarak criticized the "laxity of
security" at the site.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also issued directives today to join the tourism and
antiquities police together under one administration and under one
leadership, to realize efficiency and discipline.
</P>
<P>
The directive came about three months after ex-Minister of
Interior Hassan el-Alfy decided to separate the two departments.
</P>
<P>
In a decree issued earlier today, Mubarak decided to replace
el-Alfy with Major General Habib Ibrabim el-Adli, head of the
State Security.
</P>
<P>
El-Alfy, 61, in the post of the interior minister since 1993,
was reputed for his heavy-handed dealing with the Islamic
militants that have been fighting a five-year war against
Mubarak's secular government.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Group, Egypt's most powerful militant group,
claimed responsibility for Monday's attack.

PARIS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- France will sell to the United

older Mirage fighters for UAE with an expected 3.5 billion U.S.
dollars of expense from the UAE, reported the daily Le Monde
today.
</P>
<P>
The contract will be signed during a visit by President Jacques
Chirac and French Defense Minister Alain Richard to Abu Dhabi next

</P>
<P>
This report was confirmed by Colonel Khaled bin Abdallah
Mubarek, leader of evaluation of arms acquisition of the UAE air
force, who told a UAE daily that the Gulf emirates will order 20
to 30 such fighters within two months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UAE will ask France to help modernize two
squadrons of 33 Mirage 2000 fighters it bought from France 11
years ago to make them capable of launching air-to-air and
air-to-ground missiles and equipped with electronic war means,
said Mubarek.
</P>
<P>
French companies, including the Dassault Aviation group which
makes Mirage fighters, are strongly present at the International
Aeronautics and Armament Saloon being held in Dubai, one of the

<HEADLINE> WEU Agrees on Closer Link with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Members of the European defense
group Western European Union (WEU) agreed today to forge a closer
link with the European Union (EU) in a bid to enhance its role as
an instrument of European crisis management and as the security
arm of the EU.
</P>
<P>
As the most important step to link the WEU with the EU, WEU
members decided that up from 1999, a country which holds the
rotating presidency of the EU should also take over the presidency
of the WEU provided that it is also a full member of the defense
group.
</P>
<P>
Under such an arrangement, Germany is due to assume the first
double presidency of the two organizations in the first half of
1999.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the two-day WEU meeting at the eastern
German city of Erfurt, which was attended by foreign and defense
ministers from 28 European states.
</P>
<P>
According to German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, the WEU
meeting also agreed on measures to intensify cooperation with the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), including the
installation of a consultation mechanism in case of a crisis
situation.
</P>
<P>
In Erfurt, ministers also finalized details of setting up a
military committee within the WEU which is to become the
alliance's supreme military authority. A proposal to give the
European Parliament direct control over the WEU had failed to
achieve consensus.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, ministers also decided to expand a WEU mission that
trains police in Albania and to extend its mandate to next spring.
</P>

WEU General Secretary Jose Cutileiro told reporters today that
the Erfurt meeting had made the WEU politically more reliable and
well prepared for peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted in an interview with the German Thuringer
Allgemeine newspaper that there was still a lack of common defense
policy in Europe. "A common policy in this regard is still far
from being formulated as we wish," he said.
</P>
<P>
The WEU, founded in 1948, now groups almost all EU members
except Austria, Denmark, Finland, Ireland and Sweden, which only
have observer status in the organization.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it has three associated members -- Iceland, Norway
and Turkey -- along with 10 associated partner states in central
and eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Khatami: Iran to Reform Economic System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has said hat he has assigned a team to work out a
favorable economic system for the country, local media reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In a TV interview Tuesday night on the occasion of 100 days in
office, Khatami said that the most important task for his
government was to improve the country's economic structure in the
fields of production, consumption and distribution.
</P>
<P>
A long term plan to eradicate poverty must include measures
to bring about a proper production trend, Khatami said, adding
that the country has its disposal of both manpower and materials
needed to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the role of private sector in the country's
economic life, the president said that the private sector should
be encouraged to invest its capital and at the same time taxes
should be levied on their activities.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the country was facing some serious economic
problems such as high inflation, Khatami said that the country
had gained outstanding achievements during the past years.
</P>
<P>
However, the English-language daily Iran News said today that
high prices of consumer goods, inflation, unemployment,
disinformation about high officials have been a serious source of
concern for ordinary citizens in the country.
</P>
<P>
The paper said in an editorial that after 100 days in office
the president was expected to give at least a small list of the
steps his government has taken so far.
</P>
<P>
From the very first day of his election campaign, Khatami has
been talking about the rule of law, guarantees for freedom,
liberty and security, the daily said, but the people are getting
disappointed as more and more people are joining the ranks of
the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that people feel helpless in the face of their
diminishing purchasing power and gloomy future, adding that "it
is really a shame to see our educated youth become free-lane taxi
drivers in the city in order to meet their families' day-to-day
needs."
</P>
<P>
The people expect the president to inject a new life into
the nation's economy through his dynamic plans by taking strict
measures against profiteers and economic saboteurs, the paper
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Inland-HK Tourism Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The long-term strategy of the
Hong Kong Tourist Administration (HKTA) is to promote cooperation
in tourism between Hong Kong and inland areas.
</P>
<P>
B.Y. Wong, chief Beijing representative for HKTA, said the HK
government organization has introduced a program to promote
cooperation with its counterparts in Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an and
Guilin. The goal of the program, introduced earlier this month, is
to develop tourism sources in the North American market.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is a pillar industry in the Hong Kong economy, and the
region has accumulated vast marketing experience. Nonetheless,
limited tourism resources require that we expand cooperation with
inland areas to promote tourism," said Wong.
</P>
<P>
He said various factors will contribute to a projected 10
percent drop in the number of tourists visiting Hong Kong during
1997. However, the industry is expected to regain momentum next
year with a projected growth of some six percent, according to
Wong. "We are fully optimistic about next year," said Wong.
</P>
<P>
He noted that over 1.69 million tourists from inland areas
visited Hong Kong between January-September, with related areas
for the first time emerging as the region's largest source
market. He predicted that a total of 2.4 million inland tourists
will visit Hong Kong during 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The central government has further relaxed its policies, and
we anticipate steady growth in the number of inland visitors
during 1998," said Wong.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA has also introduced a winter tour package offering
preferential terms for inland visitors, including cash vouchers
valued at 7,600 HK dollars for each person.

WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Russia and Iraq have drafted a proposal to end the standoff
between the United States and Saddam Hussein, said Russia's
Foreign Minister, Yevgeny Primakov. He said the plan would allow
the United Nations to carry out weapons inspections, presumably
with the participation of Americans, but that the open-ended
search should be brought to a speedy end.
</P>
<P>
-- The Pentagon offered President Kennedy an extraordinary
variety of dirty tricks designed to sabotage Fidel Castro, newly
declassified documents show. These plans included sophomoric
pranks, such as faking a picture of a fat and debauched Castro to
destroy his image, and murderous plots.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton pressed forward yesterday with
his diplomatic drive to cultivate closer ties with oil-rich former
Soviet republics in Central Asia while trying to prevent Iran from
profiting from the development of the region's vast energy
resources.
</P>
<P>
--The Federal Bureau of Investigation said today that a
16-month probe into the TWA 800 crash had turned up no evidence
that a criminal act brought down the jumbo jet, leaving mechanical
failure as the most likely cause of the 1996 disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton ordered six F-117 stealth fighters to
Kuwait and six B-52 bombers to a British-controlled island in the
Indian Ocean, and authorized 30 additional aircraft if needed.
Iraq's Tariq Aziz met unexpectedly in Moscow with Yeltsin and
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who said they have
negotiated a plan to end the standoff peacefully. U.S. officials
were non-commital, however.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Ambassadors to Return to European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced today to
return its ambassadors to the member states of the European
Union (EU) as of today, but saying that ties with the EU
countries would not be at the same level.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Iranian
deputy foreign minister for Euro-American affairs Morteza Sarmadi
said that the first group of Iranian ambassadors would leave
here today for their missions in the EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran's ambassador to Rome, Italy Majid Hedayatzadeh is to be
the first Iranian ambassador to leave for his assignment today,
the IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
However, Sarmadi noted that grounds for joint cooperation and
the understanding of the EU countries about the realities in
Iran especially after coming into office of the new Iranian
government determine the level of Iran's ties with them.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the bad performance of certain countries, Iran
has developed a negative mentality about them and about
continuation of long-term relations with them, he said, adding
that they must strive in the future to correct their picture.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the EU countries were cooled down
with the EU envoys to Tehran recalled after the Berlin court
ruled that Iranian leaders were behind the 1992 assassination of
four Iranian rebel Kurdish leaders in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Most of the EU envoys returned to Tehran Friday morning after
the two sides reached an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Referring to future relations between Iran and the EU,
Sarmadi stated that Iran would regard cooperation with Europe as
a principled policy provided that they guarantee reciprocal
respect and interests.
</P>
<P>
The level of Tehran-EU cooperation in future depends on the
role Europe will play at the international fora, he said, adding
that Europe cannot ignore Iran's strategic location in the
region and its role and influence in the world of Islam.
</P>
<P>
An "independent Europe" is of importance to Iran, he
stressed, in case Europe favors an independent role and not a
subordinate one, new areas will emerge for their cooperation
with Iran.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has collected more
than 80 million Zimbabwe Dollars (six million U.S. Dollars) in
additional revenue in a major operation to swoop on traders
attempting to evade payment of duty, a local paper said today.
</P>
<P>
According to "The Herald" daily, the Depart of Customs and
Excise is also holding a further 277 cargo containers in the
operation started recently, in which at least half of all
containers are now being thoroughly examined by customs officers,
instead of just the one percent sample as was done in the past.
</P>
<P>
Director of Customs and Excise Ranga Munyaradzi said yesterday
that the 80 million Zimbabwe Dollars was collected in the first
two weeks of the operation while the 277 cargo containers were
netted in Harare alone.
</P>
<P>
The indefinite countrywide operation was started on october 13
and came hot on the heels of another successful operation by the
Income Tax Department.
</P>
<P>
More goods, which are still to have a direct contribution to
revenue, have been seized for mis-description, non-declaration,
undervaluation or just a bold attempt to smuggle, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said days of smuggling were now numbered and the department
was fast catching up with offenders. The sweeping exercise was
launched to curb rampant smuggling at points of entry.
</P>
<P>
The results of the exercise have by far surpassed
expectations. The Customs and Excise Department was looking at
raising 100 million Zimbabwe Dollars (70 million U.S. Dollars),
he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's Ericsson opened an
academy in Beijing on Tuesday to provide training for both
employees and customers as part of its strategy to increase
localization in China and technology transfers to China.
</P>
<P>
The Ericsson China Academy was built at a cost of nearly 10
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
It co-operates with the Fudan School of Management and the
Center for Nordic Studies at Shanghai's Fudan University, the
Norwegian School of Management, and Sweden's Lund University in a
program in management studies in information.
</P>
<P>
It leads to a Master of Management Studies degree granted by
the Norwegian School of Management. Ericsson has already set up
similar academies in Sweden, Malaysia, Australia and Ireland, but
the one in China is the first to grant the Master of Management
Studies degree.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, China is expected to need about
300,000 MBA grads for management personnel, who will be especially
needed in state-owned enterprises. In the past five years, China
has only graduated about 1,200 MBAs each year. The country now has
more than 50 colleges and universities with MBA programs.

<HEADLINE> Land Auction Generates 64M US Dollars to HK Coffers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The first land auction after
 the stock market and currency turmoil saw two small lots sold for
 a satisfactory 497 million HK dollars (63.7 million U.S. dollars)
 here today.
</P>
<P>
The first lot, a 3,189-square-meter residential site at Chung
Hom Kok on the south side of Hong Kong Island, was sold for 221
million (28.3 million U.S. dollars), with bidding opened at 100
million HK dollars (12.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The second one, a 693-square-meter site located at Hung Hom on
the southern tip of the Kowloon Peninsula, was sold for 276
million HK dollars (35.4 million U.S. dollars), with bidding
opened at 115 million HK dollars (14.7 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two lots went to a single successful bidder, Yu Tai Hing
property company, after nearly 50 minutes' intense bidding among a
 couple of small and medium-sized property developers.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the property sector filled the auction
venue this afternoon, indicative of how the property market has
corrected after the recent financial turbulence.
</P>
<P>
The lots had been previously estimated to generate 150-230
million HK dollars (19.2-29.5 million U.S. dollars) and 185-265
million HK dollars (23.7-34.0 million U.S. dollars) respectively
to the coffers.
</P>
<P>
Lo Siu Tong, head of Yu Tai Hing, told reporters that the two
lots are a "good buy".
</P>
<P>
A smiling Lo said he is optimistic about the long-term prospect
 of the property market. "Tomorrow will be better," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first lot is intended for residential uses while the second
 for commercial-residential purposes.
</P>
<P>
The company has to complete a gross floor area of not less than
 1,400 square meters by June 30, 2001 for the first lot and not
less than 3,743 square meters by December 31, 2000 for the second.
</P>
<P>
Tony Chan, a chartered surveyor from Ricacorp Properties Group,
 commented that the small and medium-sized companies showed keen
interest in the bidding.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the satisfactory results didn't necessarily
mean that the property market will recover immediately. Instead
they indicated the fine prospects two and three years away.
</P>
<P>
The property price has fallen 10 to 20 percent as a result of
the recent financial turmoil, with the luxury sector hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong shares reacted immediately to the auction results,
with the benchmark Hang Seng Index recouping over half of its
morning session loss to close the whole day at 10,154 points, 0.89
 percent lower compared with Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> PUK Suffers Losses in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) suffered heavy losses in clashes with rival
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in northern Iraq, the Turkish
Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The KDP launched a major offensive to drive the PUK out of the
village of Muhacir near the Iranian border and the two sides were
embroiled in fierce fightings, a KDP radio said.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here Tuesday by the KDP claimed the group
recaptured most of the territories lost to its rival.
</P>
<P>
The PUK reportedly had joined hands with Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in fighting the KDP since October 13,
taking over some of the territories controlled by the KDP,
allegedly supported by Ankara and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia said 23 PUK militants were killed during clashes with
the KDP in the regions of Sideka, Coman and Dolabanisan in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The two Kurdish factions have been fighting each other for the
control of northern Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War, when Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein was rendered ineffective by allied forces
to exert influence in the region.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A motion expressing full
support for Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was tabled
in Parliament here today.
</P>
<P>
The motion tabled by Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim also
voiced objection to the United States' investigations into the
country's national oil corporation Petronas' investment in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The motion was tabled in the House of Representatives here
following a draft resolution by some U.S. congressmen demanding
Mahathir to publicly apologize or resign over his alleged
statement of a Jewish conspiracy in recent Southeast Asian
currency speculation.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir has repeatedly clarified that his remarks were
misinterpreted and that he is not anti-Jew.
</P>
<P>
The motion states that Malaysia is a sovereign and independent
nation whose development is based on democracy and consensus, that
the relations with other countries must adhere to the principle of
justice, freedom, equality and respect for one another.
</P>
<P>
It also states that Malaysia gives its citizens the freedom to
choose their own leader and government through the process of a
free and democratic election and that Malaysia practices the
principle of free trade.
</P>
<P>
The motion regrets the effort made by the U.S. government to
use the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act on Petronas for investing in the
gas industry in Iran.
</P>
<P>
It says that Malaysia will uphold the principle of harmonious
living of the various races and religions and it will continue
under the leadership of Mahathir. And in accordance with the fair,
just and open policy that is being practiced, it refutes the
statement that the national leaders of the country are
anti-Semitic or against any other races.
</P>
<P>
It objects the motion by several U.S. congressmen for their
baseless allegation and their dispute on the sovereignty and the
right of the people and asks the international community to
respect the rights of the people of any nation to determine their
own leadership and national policies through the process of
democracy and consensus.
</P>
<P>
The motion says Malaysia strives to ensure the continuity of
good relations with the U.S. in all aspects and to enhance such
relations.

This is the second time that Sharif canceled his planned

On Tuesday, Sharif announced that he would address the nation

<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), met today with
Raul Castro, first vice-president of the Council of State and
Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, recalled his visit to Cuba in January this year, and

and the fact that the Cuban people strictly adhere to the socialist
road and harbor deep feelings of friendship for the CPC and
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed delight at once again meeting Castro, and the
two leaders exchanged views on issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
He said the Communist Party of Cuba and the Cuban people have
stood the severe test of time and overcome various difficulties
despite the rapidly changing and increasingly complicated
international situation since the end of the 1980s. He also pointed
out that the Cuban people have recorded satisfactory achievements in
building their motherland and promoting the socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
"China admires the nation's success," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPC treasures the friendship and cooperative ties
between the two countries and two parties, and noted that China
will continue to support the just cause of the Communist Party of
Cuba and the efforts of the Cuban people to safeguard state
sovereignty and national independence, and adhere to socialism.
</P>
<P>
China is fully prepared to strengthen friendship and
cooperative ties in order to promote the comprehensive development
of relations between the two countries, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
Hu also briefed Castro on the highly successful 15th National
Congress of the CPC and efforts to build the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Castro noted that in-depth exchange of views on Sino-Cuban ties
and other issues of common concern has been highly beneficial.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cuban delegation will visit a number of cities to
survey China's success in reform, opening up and economic
construction, and expressed the hope to learn more about the
country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that his visit will further advance
friendship and cooperative relations between the two nations and
two parties. He added that the visit will also promote the
development of mutually beneficial trade and economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Leaders Support Kabila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Southern African leaders
attending a trade and investment summit in Gaborone, Botswana
today repeated their support for President Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
President Kabila is currently facing a United Nations probe
over alleged massacres of Rwandan refugees by his army, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions at the International Herald
Tribune-organized summit, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano rallied to Kabila's cause,
saying the former guerrilla leader needed the support of the
international community to stabilize the situation in the former
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that there has been this campaign to unseat the
former president Mobutu Sese Seko. Several of our countries in
the region gave support to that campaign," Mugabe said referring
to the seven-month military push that forced Mobutu into exile in
Morocco where he died of cancer two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe accused the international community of seeking to
"demonize" Kabila without taking into cognizance the immense
challenges that he faces in stabilizing the situation in his
country.
</P>
<P>
He said while the probe into the alleged massacres of the
Rwandan refugees should go on, sight should not be lost of the
fact that Kabila needs support to stabilize the country and steer
it towards a democratic process.
</P>
<P>
President Chissano also stressed the urgency of stabilizing
the situation in the former Zaire, saying the new authorities
there might even make mistakes, but they should be helped to
eliminate those mistakes.

<HEADLINE> Khatami: Iran to Reform Economic System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has said that he has assigned a team to work out a
favorable economic system for the country, local media reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the state television Tuesday on the
occasion of 100 days in office, Khatami said that the most
important task for his government was to improve the country's
economic structure in the fields of production, consumption and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
A long term plan to eradicate poverty must include measures
to bring about a proper production trend, Khatami said, adding
that the country has its disposal of both manpower and materials
needed to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the role of the private sector in the country's
economic life, the president said that the private sector should
be encouraged to invest its capital and at the same time taxes
should be levied on their activities.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the country was facing some serious economic
problems such as high inflation, Khatami said that the country
had gained outstanding achievements during the past years.
</P>
<P>
However, the English-language daily Iran News said today that
high prices of consumer goods, inflation, unemployment,
disinformation about high officials' power and authority in the
government have been a serious source of concern for ordinary
citizens in the country.
</P>
<P>
The paper said in an editorial that after Khatami's 100 days in
office, the people were expecting him to give at least a small
list of the steps his government has taken so far.
</P>
<P>
From the very first day of his election campaign, Khatami has
been talking about the rule of law, guarantees for freedom,
liberty and security, the daily said, but the people are getting
disappointed as more and more people are joining the ranks of
the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that people feel helpless in the face of their
diminishing purchasing power and gloomy future, adding that "it
is really a shame to see our educated youth become free-lane taxi
drivers in the city in order to meet their families' day-to-day
needs."
</P>
<P>
The people expect the president to inject a new life into
the nation's economy through his dynamic plans by taking strict
measures against profiteers and economic saboteurs, the paper
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: African Ministers to Meet on Energy, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Chen Cailin)
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- African ministers
responsible for the development and utilization of mineral and
energy resources are to meet in Durban of South Africa later this
week to discuss development strategies in mineral and energy
industries, according to officials from the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA).
</P>
<P>
The immediate objective of the ministerial meeting, which is
organized by the ECA in collaboration with the South African
government, is to provide a forum for dialogue between
governments and energy and minerals development actors, while its
longer-term goal is to facilitate the adoption of sound
development policies and programs, provide a blueprint for future
action on a common denominator of interest between all secotrs,
the ECA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Before the ministerial meeting, there is a meeting of mining
and energy experts, private development operators and investors,
mineral-based products industrialists, minerals and energy
consumer associations, chambers of mines, research institutions,
and inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Africa is known of its rich mineral and energy resources. As
for proven mineral deposits in South Africa alone, gold accounts
for 39 percent of the world reserve, platinum 88 percent,
manganese 83 percent, while vanadium 45 percent, chromiu 72
percent, alumo-silicate 37 percent, vermiculite 40 percent, and
coal 11 percent. South Africa has been the largest producer and
exporter of minerals in the world.
</P>
<P>
Rich natural resources are bases for economic development in
Africa. However, statistics show that Africa's share of world
mineral production has consistently fallen since 1960 except of
bauxite, uranium and rutile. Mining production in Sub-Saharan
Africa accounts for only 8 percent of world mineral production,
so Africa now lags far behind latin america and asia in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa also lags far behind Latin America and Asia
in electricity production. Electricity supply is key to national
economic development and the raising of living standard. But, the
statistics show that some 77 percent of primary energy
consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa is of traditional and renewable
energy. Firewood accounts for 58.5 percent, charcoal for 18.1
percent, petroleum products for 15.5 percent, and coal,gas and
hydro-electricity account for 2.6 percent, 2.7 percent and 1.9
percent respectively. In 1993, the region produced only 49 kwh
per person of electricity, in comparision with 170 kwh for Asia
and 558 kwh for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless,in the past few years, African countries have
attached great importance to the mineral and energy development.
The first minerals and energy conference organized by the ECA,
was held in Accra, Ghana in 1995. The confernece stressed that
African governments, the private sector, and non-governmental and
other actors were indispensable in the process of sustainable
development. It underlined the importance of economic reforms
which was under way in the region to facilitate the role of these
actors.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECA officials, mining now is dominated by the
private sector, with state-controlled operations
characteristically failing to keep up with the competition in an
increasingly globalized minerals industry. Policy reforms in a
number of African countries have focused on putting in place
enabling environments for foreign investment, seen as the best
option for maximising outputs in the under-exploited mining
sector. This policy shift are beginning to show positive results.
Africa's share in world private direct investment exceeded 12
percent in 1996, rising to 418 million U.S.Dollars in the year.
</P>
<P>
It is convinced that mineral and energy sectors in Africa will
be developed at the second ministerial meeting in Durban, the
African ministers will adopt a blue-print for future action which
will certainly promote the development of the minerals and
energy, thus raising the hope for the reduction of poverty in the
continent.

<HEADLINE> Processing Industry Grows in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The production of Angola's
processing industry increased by 16.1 percent from 1995 to 1996,
according to figures released today by the National Bureau of
Statistics of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Two years after the ceasefire was realized in war-torn Angola
in 1994, the production capacity of its processing industry
began to recover from a standstill caused by the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The growth from 1995 to 1996 was mainly attributed to the
increased production of drinks, especially beer, petroleum
products and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, oil refining, chemicals, machinery and
equipment have recorded fastest growths in the field of
processing industry.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that oil refining sector, chemicals
production and machinery and equipment sector have grown by 24.5
percent, 298.1 percent and 321 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
This has contributed to the whole processing industry's 13
percent of the total industrial production in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The mining is the biggest sector in Angola's industry,
accounting for 86.2 percent of the industrial production in the
country.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Leads in Saving Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- China's Shandong province has
saved 13.3 billion yuan (1.6 billion US dollars) through its
energy saving projects since 1991.
</P>
<P>
This amount is equal to 50 percent of the profits of industrial
enterprises in the province in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, which is rich in energy resources, was one of the
first provinces to set different rates for electricity depending
on the period of use and popularized the use of energy-saving
lightbulbs. These two measures can save 5 billion kwh of
electricity annually, accounting for around seven percent of the
total amount of electricity generated by the province last year.
</P>
<P>
Improved technology for fans and water pumps used in industry
has helped save 566 million kwh of electricity. A move to make the
public more energy-conscious has resulted in saving 2.2 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province has also strengthened legislature in the field of
energy saving. Since 1991, it has enacted 50 decrees, rule and
regulations in this regard.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Achieve Zero Population Growth Rate by 2030 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- China plans to achieve a zero
population growth rate prior to the year 2030, with the population
standing at between 1.5 billion and 1.6 billion, according to
State Councillor Song Jian.
</P>
<P>
Song made the statement today at the ongoing '97 China
Environmental Forum. He noted that the first several decades of
the next century will be a crucial period for China's further
development.
</P>
<P>
Song noted that fulfilling the important task will enable
China, a densely populated and underdeveloped country with a weak
infrastructure, to achieve continued economic development and
further improve the living standards of its people.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth is crucial, and must be achieved in
coordination with social and resource development and
environmental improvements," said Song, adding that China's goal
is to achieve sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Song said China will persist in regarding environmental
protection as a basic state policy and sustainable development as
the overall strategy guiding China's social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Song expressed his firm belief that reaching the goal of a zero
population growth rate by 2030 will enable China to achieve
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
China's population hit 1.223 billion by the end of last year,
with the massive population exerting great pressure on the
nation's resources, economic development and environmental
protection efforts.
</P>
<P>
China's introduction of the "One Child Policy" in 1980 has
effectively reduced the actual population growth by some 300
million. Extensive efforts by the Chinese government have reduced
the natural population growth rate to 10.42 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
China's current efforts to solve population problems center on
the introduction of comprehensive measures to improve education
and social security.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israeli Likud Mired in Deep Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli ruling Likud group
has been facing a crisis since last Wednesday's party convention
pushed through a proposal on abolishing primaries to give the
central committee the power to select candidates for Knesset
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
The struggle in the Likud over the primaries is essentially a
battle between the party's central committee stacked with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's loyalists and its Knesset elite for
power and control of the party.
</P>
<P>
The party's 2,750 central committee members, who had charged
that the primaries cut the contact between the committee and the
party Knesset members, wanted to retain power over choice of the
party's candidates for the Knesset in its own hands and to take
part in significant policy decisions more actively.
</P>
<P>
While the Likud cabinet ministers fiercely oppose any change
in the party rules which would affect the primaries, since the
existing system confers considerable advantage upon the
incumbents in the choice of candidates for the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Some Likud members alleged that Prime Minister's office
Director-General Avidor Lieberman, widely considered Netanyahu's
right-hand man, had managed the last week's Likud convention via
remote control.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Science Minister Michael Eitan, one of Netanyahu's
most outspoken critics in recent days, accused the central
committee members of trying to boost their standing by acting on
Lieberman's behalf. He alleged there was "a large, planned
fraudulent network which started before the party institutions
and branches' elections."
</P>
<P>
With Netanyahu currently in London, his opponents have begun to
seek ways of replacing him.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv Mayor Ronni Milo, who resigned from parliament when
he assumed the mayor post, unveiled a plan Monday to steal the
Likud from beneath Netanyahu. He said that top Likud politicians
are cooperating in his plan to get 12 of the Likud's 22 Knesset
members to split the Likud Knesset faction.
</P>
<P>
The group of 12 would have the right to take the Likud name
and retain party financing. This would leave Netanyahu
effectively out of the party and unable to run for the prime
minister again on its ticket.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims to leave Netanyahu isolated without necessarily
forcing a change in the government, while assuring that the party,
in its new form, would field a new candidate in the next elections.
</P>
<P>
Milo, who has spared no effort in the last year-and-a-half to
undermine Netanyahu, said that "we are out to make sure that in
the next elections the Likud will no longer be under Netanyahu's
command, that he will not lead it and that the Likud will have a
fighting chance at winning power again."
</P>
<P>
In the campaign against Netanyahu, getting at least 12 Knesset
members to split the Likud faction is easier said than
done. However, finding enough Likud Knesset members to join a
Labor no-confidence motion against Netanyahu would appear a
simpler route to take.
</P>
<P>
During a secret meeting between Foreign Minister David Levy of
the ruling coalition and opposition Labor leader Ehud Barak last
Thursday, they reportedly discussed the option of bringing down
the government and holding early election over the government's
failure to move the peace process with the Palestinians forward.
</P>
<P>
Facing the crisis in the party, Netanyahu said in the
U.S. Monday that he would deal with the matter as soon as he
returned to Israel, noting that he would "fix what must be fixed
immediately" upon his return.
</P>
<P>
But as the primary issue has caused a deep rift between the
party's central committee members and its leadership, and
deepened crisis of mutual confidence between Netanyahu and some
ministers, no predictions about Netanyahu's ability to survive
can be taken seriously.

<HEADLINE> China's PLA Playing Role In Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army
(PLA) is playing an increasing role in China's environmental
protection endeavour, according to the 1997 China Environment
Forum in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The PLA has put a large amount of funds into environmental
protection, and many of the Army's officers and enlisted personnel
are involved in environmental protection, Zhou Youliang, deputy
director of the PLA's General Logistics Department, told the forum.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, the PLA has drafted many regulations on
environmental protection and its factories have made an effort to
save energy, reduce costs and deal with pollution, he said. They
have also increased research on environmental protection and
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the PLA to speak about its
environmental protection efforts at an international gathering,
and the PLA is important in both social construction and
environmental protection, Zhou noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese armed forces have also been involved in
afforestation, desert control, forest protection and wildlife
protection efforts. Millions of military personnel across the
country voluntarily plant trees each year. The Army's air wing has
scattered tree and grass seeds from the air over a
4.7-million-hectare area, and has had good results in waste water
and dust treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Army has established an environmental protection scientific
research center, an environment monitoring center, and an
environmental monitoring network, Zhou said.

<HEADLINE> Dkaha Urged to Privatize Gas, Power Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Chamber of
Industries (BCI) has suggested that the government privatize the
gas and power sectors, BCI sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
This suggestion was made by BCI President Sharif Afzal Hossain
when a 41-member delegation headed by him called on Power, Energy
and Mineral Resources Minister Mohammad Nooruddin Khan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although there is a clear policy for privatization of these
sectors, privatization is being delayed due to administrative
complacence and lack of proper rules and regulations, the BCI
chief said, adding that as a result, domestic and foreign
investors feel discouraged to invest in these sectors.
</P>
<P>
The industrial and business sectors are the main users of
electricity and gas, he stated, "but production and business are
being seriously hampered due to load shedding and other problems."
</P>
<P>
Appreciating the government initiative for privatization, the
BCI chief said that the government should not only privatize the
industrial units but also play the role of watchdog in the
formulation of proper policies and their implementation.
</P>
<P>
The development of infrastructure is a must for the development
of energy, electricity and mineral resources sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister thanked the chamber leaders, saying that the
government was giving priority to the creation of suitable
infrastructure for gas and electricity sectors and that his
ministry is "a service-oriented institution which is always ready
to serve and improve the quality of service".
</P>
<P>
According to the directives of the prime minister, the whole of
Bangladesh has been divided into 23 blocks and gas exploration is
going on in these blocks to solve the problems in gas and
electricity sectors, the minister stated.
</P>
<P>
The minister also mentioned that the government had already
formulated a policy for electricity production in the private
sector and had started work in that direction.

<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia's former Prime
Minister Paul Keating spoke to the 1997 China Environment Forum
today about China's efforts to deal with its pressing
environmental problems, saying that the Chinese government has
given it high priority, and called on the rest of the world to
join the battle.
</P>
<P>
Keating told those present that the conference and China's
Agenda 21 strategy is evidence of its significant and sustained
efforts at cleaning up environmental problems and preventing new
ones.
</P>
<P>
China has been increasing its expenditures on environmental
protection, he said, and equally important, improving its
legislative, administrative, and policy framework for dealing with
the environment, but that it is essential that the rest of the
world understand the scale of China's environmental problem and
the challenge the Chinese authorities face.
</P>
<P>
"All the evidence suggests that the environmental
difficulties we face in the Asia Pacific over the next 25 years
will become more difficult to manage," he pointed out, noting that
if "we can help China resolve its problems, we are also helping
to resolve our own."

<P>
He added that the environmental problems faced by large
developing countries like China, or by industrialized countries
like the U.S. and Japan, or resource producers like Australia and
Canada, and small island states of the Pacific are very different,
but that in developing countries in Asia, problems tend to be
similar to China's.
</P>
<P>
This means poor and limited water supplies, polluted air, waste
disposal problems, chaotic urban planning, and land degradation,
and that many of these stem from rapid economic growth, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Asia's energy demands double every 12 years, with bad
consequences for air quality and global warming, and now, five of
the seven cities in the world with the worst air pollution are in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, around 500 million East Asians lived in
towns, he noted, but by 2020 this figure will have trebled to 1.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
But, he pointed out, protection of the environment need not be
a constraint on economic growth, and it is the only way of
ensuring that such growth continues, and it is important to see
that the converse is true, that economic growth is essential to
solving environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
"For the countries of Asia, and for most of the developing
world, the option of limiting growth does not exist," he
concluded.

<HEADLINE> AFC Rebut Australia Soccer Chief's Complaints On Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Soccer Australia Chairman
David Hill laid himself open to the rebuke from the Asian Football
Confederation (AFC) for his" illogical" complaints on living
conditions in Teheran on the eve of an Australia-Iran World Cup
playoff.
</P>
<P>
The chairman claimed on Saturday that Iranian living conditions
were so tough that the Australian team had to bring their own food
and water supply.
</P>
<P>
AFC general-secretary Peter Velappan made light of Hill's
allegations, saying that Iran has a fairly high standard of living
conditons and a tradition for hospitality.
</P>
<P>
It is illogical and totally out of perspective and against the
porpose of World Cup matches to build closer relationships and
better understanding, added the AFC official.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Shares Fall Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong share prices shed
modestly today by 0.89 percent to close at 10,154.36 points.
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng Index fell 142 points in the first minute of
the opening today, and then slumped to 9,900 points before holding
its foot narrowly above the 10,000-point level at the midday
close.
</P>
<P>
Fear of rising interest rates cast a shadow over the market
sentiment, securities analysts said. The primary three-month
interbank lending rates climbed up 0.75 percent Tuesday to 11.5
percent amid concerns that the collapse of the South Korean
currency might put new pressure on the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, the blue-chip index recouped some of its lost
ground to close at the highest of the day, 10,154.36 points.
</P>
<P>
Property, bank, commerce and industry shares fell modestly
today, while utilities counters, H shares and red-chips went up
slightly.
</P>
<P>
Turnover continued to be slim, at about 8.2 billion HK dollars
(one billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Children Should Keep Away From Tobacco: HK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior health official of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) today called for
joint efforts to protect children from becoming smokers.
</P>
<P>
Katherine Fok, Secretary for Health and Welfare, said here
today at a luncheon meeting: "It is everybody's business to save
children from the harm of tobacco."
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and
Health (COSH) shows that many primary school students in Hong Kong
had the experience of smoking, and the situation was even more
serious in secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
She noted that many factors may induce children to smoke, such
as smoking in the home, movie characters who glamorize smoking,
peer pressure at school, and tobacco advertisements.
</P>
<P>
"It therefore becomes apparent that people in every sector of
the community -- parents, teachers, celebrities, private firms,
medical professionals -- need to collaborate in educating Hong
Kong's children, with the common goal of protecting them from
becoming smokers and being harmed by tobacco," said the official.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks at the meeting "Saving Children from the
Harm of Tobacco: Everybody's business", organized by the COSH,
which has launched a series of anti-smoking campaigns in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has introduced a law to prohibit the sale of tobacco
products to persons under the age of 18, but enforcement is no
easy task, according to Fok.

</P>
<P>
"As a result of those conversations, she is cutting short her
trip to India and fly to Geneva where she will be meeting with the
foreign ministers of Russia, Britain and France," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state, who arrived here last evening from

<HEADLINE> Rich Milk Content Helps Baby Brain Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Medical researchers found
that Hong Kong women produce much more fatty acid Omega 3 in their
milk that is essential to brain growth of babies than Western
women do.
</P>
<P>
A medical study concluded that the total fat content of milk
from Hong Kong women contains 0.56 percent of Omega 3, compared
with 0.14 percent in Canadians and 0.54 percent in women of
Chongqing, a city in Southwest China, South China Morning Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Biochemistry Associate Professor Chen Zhenyu of the Hong Kong
Chinese University, who led the study, said the difference is
mainly in the diet.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong residents eat a lot of fish while Chongqing people
eat many eggs and both foods are rich in Omega 3, said Chen. The
study sampled the milk of 282 mothers from Canada and the two
Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Omega 3 can enhance brain development in children because it is
a key building block for nerve membranes in the brain, according
to experts. The substance can also reduce the chances of coronary
heart disease in adults.
</P>
<P>
But doctors noted that few Hong Kong babies benefit from the
high rate of Omega 3 in their mothers' milk because breast-feeding
is not popular here.
</P>
<P>
The breast-feeding rate is only 40 percent among Hong Kong
women, compared with more than 80 and 90 percent in Canada and
China's mainland respectively.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Relations Entering New Phase of Development: Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, in a
report to officials here today, said that Sino-U.S. relations
entered a new phase of development after President Jiang Zemin's
visit to the United States, but improving and developing bilateral
ties is still a long and complicated process.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also foreign minister, spoke to a meeting of departments
directly under the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and
units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) in the Great
Hall of the People, which was presided over by Ding Guangen, a
member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's state visit to the US was the first by a Chinese
president in 12 years and achieved its goal of increasing mutual
understanding, common ground, and co-operation for the future, Qi
said, and had immediate and far-reaching significance for the
world.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents discussed bilateral relations and major
international and regional issues and Jiang was able to talk
extensively with many people in the U.S. He made several important
speeches and held interviews with the American press.
</P>
<P>
The two president discussed the framework and orientation of
Sino-U.S. relations in the 21st century, and in spite of some
major differences, the two leaders found much in common, and
should have a long-term view of bilateral relations on the basis
of the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques to promote world peace
and development through increased co-operation and build a
constructive strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
These are normal state-to-state relations, and should be
characterized by equality, mutual respect, and non-exclusion of
others to maintain world peace and promote common development and
the progress of the mankind.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the Taiwan issue is the most important and most
sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. relations, and that the key to the
stable and healthy development of bilateral relations lies in
strictly abiding by the principles of the three Sino-U.S. Joint
Communiques.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. reiterated its one-China policy, and President Clinton
and senior U.S. officials have explicitly stated time and again
that the U.S. government does not support "two Chinas" or "One
China, One Taiwan", nor does it support Taiwan independence or
Taiwan's re-entry into the UN. The U.S. will also handle arms sale
to Taiwan in line with the "August 17 Communique".
</P>
<P>
Much work remains to be done in Sino-U.S. relations, and the
Chinese side wish to increase consultations and co-operation with
the U.S. to properly deal with differences and China is resolved
to push ahead with bilateral relations, Qian concluded.

<HEADLINE> New Asian Cooperation Framework Replaces Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Senior financial officials from
the Asia-Pacific region today agreed to replace a proposed
independent regional fund with a new framework for enhanced
regional cooperation to promote financial stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of a two-day meeting here, the
officials said that they "agree on the need and desirability of a
framework for regional cooperation to enhance the prosperity for
financial stability" in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The framework, which recognizes the central role of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the international monetary
system, has replaced a so-called "Asian Fund" proposed earlier by
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The new framework includes the following initiatives:
</P>
<P>
-- a mechanism for regional surveillance to complement global
surveillance by the IMF;
</P>
<P>
-- enhanced economic and technical cooperation particularly in
strengthening domestic financial systems and regulatory
capacities;
</P>
<P>
-- measures to strengthen the IMF's capacity to respond to
financial crises; and
</P>
<P>
-- a cooperative financing arrangement that would supplement
IMF resources.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the participants agreed on the need to
develop a cooperative financing arrangement for the region that
would supplement IMF and other international financial
institutions' resources.
</P>
<P>
"Under this arrangement participants could provide, in
consultation with the IMF and on a case by case basis,
supplemental financial resources for IMF-supported programs," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the participants also agreed on the
need to establish a new mechanism for regional surveillance.
</P>
<P>
"This mechanism would provide a basis for a more intensive and
high-level process of surveillance and dialogue among
participating finance ministers and central banks with support
from the IMF, the World Bank and the ADB (Asian Development
Bank)," it said.
</P>
<P>
"It will also help identify potential risks to growth and
financial stability and advise on appropriate policy responses to
reduce those risks," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that meetings for this purpose would be held twice a
year, with additional ones as warranted.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the officials stressed the importance of
economic and technical cooperation to strengthen banking and
financial systems.
</P>
<P>
They urged the IMF to constructively examine the establishment
of a new mechanism to provide short-term financing to augment an
exceptional standby or extended arrangement in the light of the
globalization of financial markets and the increased scale of
private capital flows.
</P>
<P>
At the joint IMF-World Bank annual meeting in Hong Kong in
September, Japan proposed the establishment of an "Asian Fund" to
help Southeast Asian countries to solve the on-going currency
crisis, but the United States gave a lukewarm response.
</P>
<P>
Other industrialized nations and the IMF have also resisted
Japan's idea of an independent "Asian Fund," as they fear that an
independent fund would undermine the IMF conditions attached to
its economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the Manila meeting is "a compromise" made by
Japan and the United States and the IMF, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The framework proposed at the Manila meeting would be discussed
at the informal ASEAN finance ministers' meeting in Kuala Lumpur
next month. If agreed by the ministers, such framework could be
presented to the ASEAN leaders' meeting in Kuala Lumpur on
December 15-16 for their approval.
</P>
<P>
Finance and central bank deputies from the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the United States, Japan, China,
South Korea, Australia and other Asian and Pacific economies
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank were also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Japan agreed to host the next meeting of this forum early next
year to "carry forward the initiatives under the cooperation
framework."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria: 98,000 Children HIV Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- About 98,000 children in
Nigeria are estimated to be infected with the human
immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) which causes AIDS, according to the
United Nations Program on AIDS (UNAIDS).
</P>
<P>
The agency also warned that the number will rise to 169,000 by
the year 2000 if the trend continues, the Midweek Concord
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenneth Ofosu-Baku, UNAIDS country program
adviser, most of these children are made vulnerable to HIV
infection by exceptionally difficult conditions such as early
marriage and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS now estimates 8,500 new infections every day, out of
which 1,000 infections occur in children under the age of 15, he
said at a symposium here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by Nigeria's National AIDS Control Program
(NASCP) in 1996 shows that the average age of first sexual
exposure was 16 years for boys and 14.8 years for girls in the
country.
</P>
<P>
There were also instances where the age of first exposure was
eight years, said NASCP Coordinator N. Sani-Gwarzo.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Nigeria has recorded more than
10,000 reported cases of AIDS since the inception of the disease
in 1982 and over four million Nigerians are infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
NASCP study shows that by the 1991-1992 period, there was only
about 1.5 percent infection among the population. But by the end
of last year, it had increased to about 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's population is estimated at about 100 million
currently.
</P>
<P>
It also reveals that the distribution of the infection among
the patients recorded 70 percent in the married couples, 22.7
percent in single persons, 9.1 percent in divorcees, eight
percent in students and below one percent among clergymen.
</P>
<P>
The prevalence rate through sexual intercourse is put at 56.74
percent in males and 43.26 percent in females, while 34 percent
is in prostitutes commonly known as commercial sex workers.

<HEADLINE> Pak Supreme Court Frames Contempt Charges Against PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A five-member bench of the
Supreme Court today formally framed charges in contempt case
against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, six parliamentarians, three
newspapers and Pakistan television.
</P>
<P>
The charge sheet against the prime minister was mainly based on
his reported press talk in parliament house on October 29 and his
address at Iqbal House in Lahore reported in the press on October
30.
</P>
<P>
The apex court asked Sharif and eleven other respondents
separately whether they plead guilty and have anything else to
say.
</P>
<P>
The other persons against whom charges were framed also include
Law Minister Khalid Anwar.
</P>
<P>
According to the charge sheet, Sharif reportedly told the press
that the chief justice has suspended 14th Amendment of the
Constitution without any authority in just one and a half days and
is responsible for bringing the country to unfortunate and
undemocratic situation.
</P>
<P>
The charge sheet quoted the prime minister as saying that the
chief justice had threatened to strike down the law passed by the
parliament regarding the strength of the Supreme Court judges if
it ran counter to the wishes of the apex court.
</P>
<P>
During the press talk, Sharif reportedly said that in spite of
his best efforts to resolve the crisis, "the Chief Justice struck
down the 14th Amendment to the Constitution which is illegal and
unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the speech at Iqbal House, the charge sheet stated
that Sharif made the statement that he respected the judiciary in
an "ironical manner" which resulted in a burst of laughter in the
audience."

<HEADLINE> China to Coordinate Economic Growth, Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- China will coordinate economic
development and environmental protection through better policies
and regional economic planning, said Hao Jianxiu, Vice-Minister in
charge of the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Hao offered her remarks here today at the '97 China
Environmental Forum.
</P>
<P>
She said that when making investment decisions more preferences
will be given to enterprises that help protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to increase investments in environmental
protection and improve the development of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Hao said great achievements have been made in coordinating
economic development and environmental protection since 1978, when
China began to implement a reform and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1996, China's Gross National Product more than
quadrupled, with an average annual growth rate of 9.9 percent, but
the increase in pollutants during the period remained much lower
than the economic growth rate, she said.
</P>
<P>
"For an economically weak country like China, this achievement
is really significant," she said.
</P>
<P>
Experience from some developed countries has shown that the
goal of sustainable economic development and a healthy environment
could be realized if effective measures were taken, Hao said.
</P>
<P>
She added that those cities with relatively better
environmental conditions in China were usually economically
developed ones, such as Zhuhai in Guangdong Province, Xiamen in
Fujian Province and Dalian in Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Governmental officials, representatives from international
organizations for environmental protection, experts
and entrepreneurs from more than 20 countries attended the four-day
forum.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Not to Reschedule Payment of Foreign Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia said it has no plan
of rescheduling the payment of its foreign debts which at present
amount to 117.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"A rescheduling is a bad signal to the public," Finance
Minister Mar'ie Muhammad told the Parliament today.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia's foreign debts reached 117.3 billion U.S. dollars
as of September this year as the government struggled to emerge
from its worst financial crisis in more than 30 years," Mar'ie
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign debts consist of 52.3 billion dollars in
government loans and 65 billion dollars in private loans, while
the debt service ratio is expected to reach 34.5 percent in the
fiscal year 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The September figure shows a 7.3 percent increase from the
total foreign debt last March which was 109.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie pointed out that the sharp depreciation of the rupiah
(the national currency) against the U.S. dollar would increase the
burden on the current state budget.
</P>
<P>
"every drop in value of the 100 rupiah against the dollar would
increase the government's debt service burden by 500 billion
rupiah (about 145 million U.S. dollars)," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that the government would continue its
debt prepayment if financial condition allows. "Such a move is
very useful to revive the country's self-confidence."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has seen the rupiah drop by about 40 percent in value
against the dollar since early July. The fall was in line with the
monetary crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the monetary crisis, the worst in more than 30
years, the government asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
for help. Indonesia and the IMF reached an agreement in October on
a 23 billion U.S. dollar assistance and economic reform package
aimed to restore investors' confidence in the country's financial
system.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the debt-to-service ratio, the government agreed to
impose stricter requirements on the private sector's foreign loans
and step up efforts to increase exports.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that whatever the condition is, the
government will not make any bailout to private foreign debts.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Fall Lower on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
fall on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index declined by another 8.04 points to close at
1680.97 points today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the share prices fell because investors were
pessimistic about prospects for the near term as regional economic
gloom shrouded the market.
</P>
<P>
"Bearish sentiment all around the region is keeping us down and
the outlook is poor," said one local broker.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume increased to 212.61 million units, valued
at 415.34 million Singapore dollars (259.59 million US dollars).
Declines overwhelmed advances by 291 to 68, while 252 other
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Sime Dar was the most actively traded counter as it registered
a turnover of 10.36 million units. It was followed by DBS
(Development Bank of Singapore) Land which had 8.47 million shares
traded. RHB Capital Warrant99 was next with 7.65 million units
changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Roth M. led the gainers of the day as it rose by 80 cents to
end at 13.5 Singapore dollars. Roth M. 200 increased by 60 cents
to close at 14 Singapore dollars, while NBT gained 30 cents to
finish at 22.3 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Renewed weakness on some
Asian share markets and a plunging South Korean currency put a
damper on the Australian dollar today, pushing the local unit
down by almost half a U.S. cent.
</P>
<P>
However, the same factors gave the local bond market a boost,
with the day dominated by flight-to-quality buying.
</P>
<P>
The local unit settled at 69.35 U.S. cents, down from Tuesday's
close of 69.78.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Moore, St. George Bank manager of foreign exchange
trading, said a substantial fall on the Japanese share market and
a plunging South Korean currency gave the local forex market the
jitters.
</P>
<P>
"That's putting all the emphasis back on Asia and what is in
store for Australia," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean won was sharply lower today, despite a
dollar-selling intervention by the Bank of Korea right after the
won plunged to its limit low for the third consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 closed down 884.11 points at 15842.46,
pressured by sustained futures-led selling following the flip-flop
of statements by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on whether the
government would use public funds to assist troubled financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The weak Nikkei resulted in a stronger Australian dollar
against the Japanese yen at 87.98, from Tuesday's 87.66, but the
local unit was softer against the German mark at 1.1201 from
Tuesday's 1.2063.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
dived more than one percent today on further falls in Asian
markets and poor commodity prices which dragged down resources
stock values.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index fell 26 points to 2442.3 as the
Japanese and Hong Kong markets slipped further down.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications giant Telstra improved four cents to 2.57
Australian dollars on a volume of 119.3 million at a value of
212.9 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of Telstra cast a pall over resources giant BHP,
with brokers saying the company was no longer seen as a must-have
stock following Telstra's listing and the continued rise of
National Australia Bank.
</P>
<P>
Overnight falls in the world commodities markets also hurt BHP,
which fell 41.5 cents to close at 13.054 Australian dollars on
turnover of 14 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The gold index lost 20.1 points to 930.6.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index fell 18.2 points to 1076.1 while the
all industrials closed 36.9 points lower at 4158.7.
</P>
<P>
ANZ Bank was the principal mover in industrial stocks, falling
33.8 cents to 9.94 Australian dollars after announcing an eight
percent drop in net profit to 706 million U.S. dollars for the
financial year of 1996-1997 which ended on June 30, 1997, below
most expectations.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank also suffered, falling 35 cents to 16.55
Australian dollars, with brokers attributing part of the fall to
concerns about the share buyback.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in banks, National Australia Bank fell 15 cents to
20.13 Australian dollars and Westpac shed 11 cents to 8.89
Australian dollars.

National turnover for the day was 422.06 million shares at a

<HEADLINE> EU Plans 1998 Tuna, Swordfish Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
called, for the second year running, for annual quotas on Atlantic
tuna and swordfish and on Mediterranean tuna stocks.
</P>
<P>
The commission's proposal sets the European Union's total
allowable catch (TAC) for bluefin tuna at 4,492 tons for the
Atlantic Ocean with 85 percent going to Spain and 11,621 tons for
the Mediterranean Sea with 17 percent going to Spain, 42 percent
to France and 36 percent to Italy.
</P>
<P>
The quota plan was published in today's issue of European
Report, a bi-weekly journal specializing in European Union-related
matters.
</P>
<P>
For swordfish, the European Union's TAC is 5,462.5 tons with 83
percent going to Spain.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive agency of the 15-nation union,
said that it wants the quota proposal for tuna and swordfish to be
part of a specific regulation distinct from the European Union's
general legislation on TACs and quotas.
</P>
<P>
Yet the European Union's Council of Ministers ignored the tuna
and swordfish quota proposals last year, arguing that it was not
an EU issue.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is not a contracting party of the
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas,
the body in charge of coordinating action to manage fisheries in
the Atlantic and Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, however, has applied for membership and is
expected to be admitted shortly.

<HEADLINE> Tottenham Coach Replacement Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Swiss coach Christian Gross
will replace Gerry Francis, announced the struggling English
premier league Tottenham on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Swiss club Grasshoppers had given Gross green light to
his takeover at Spurs.
</P>
<P>
Gross had helped Grasshoppers win two Swiss championships and
a Swiss Cup since he took charge of the club in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Francis had to end his three-year coaching at Spurs because he
could not bring about success for the north London club.

<HEADLINE> Employment Taxes Continue to Rise in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Employment taxes are on the
rise in the European Union (EU), totaling 42.1 percent of wages in
1995 as against 28.7 percent in 1970, according to today's issue
of European Report.
</P>
<P>
The bi-weekly journal quoted a Eurostat survey as saying that
taxes on employed labor are highest in Sweden and Finland and
lowest in Britain and Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Between 1985-1995, the largest increases of taxes on employed
labor were seen in Germany, from 39.5 percent to 44.1 percent, in
Spain, from 32.3 percent to 38 percent, in Italy, from 36.6
percent to 44 percent, in Portugal, from 21.4 percent to 36.7
percent, and in Finland, from 42.9 percent to 53.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Decreases were seen during the same period in Luxembourg, from
32.5 percent to 29.6 percent, in the Netherlands, from 50.9
percent to 48.8 percent, and in Ireland, from 30.2 percent to 30.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat survey found that taxes on employed labor as a
percentage of employee wages have risen sharply over the past 25
years while total tax receipts on employed labor increased from
43.2 percent to 51.4 percent between 1970-1995 in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The share of taxes on employed labor in gross domestic product
also rose from 14.5 percent to 21.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
union, submitted to the Council of Ministers last month its set of
guidelines for promoting employment to stress the dire need to
reform the existing systems of taxation on employed labor.

<HEADLINE> System Of Shareholders Benefits State-Owned Sector In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese economist said
here today that the system of shareholders will greatly help
state-owned enterprises and the state-owned sector as a whole,
making their overall performance better than that of other
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Gao Shangquan, vice-president of the Chinese Society for
Research on the Restructuring of the Economic System, told a
recent international seminar here that, since the 1980s, the
system of shareholders has shown that it has a role to play in
the Chinese economy and, together with the securities and capital
markets, will have a profound impact on the well-being of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gao noted, there are still some problems around in
developing the system in China, like a lack of protection of
individual interests and the loss of state assets.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party officially endorsed the system as a viable
means of revitalizing the state-owned enterprises at the 15th
Party Congress held in September.
</P>
<P>
In addition to representatives of the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy and the Development and Research Center
of the State Council, the seminar attracted representatives from
the World Bank, the IMF, the United States, Germany, Japan, France
and Poland.

<P>
CAIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Tuesday met with
Egyptian Ambassador in Tel Aviv Mohamed Bassiouny on the peace
talks between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>

understanding, halting Israeli settlement activities and resuming
final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- An Egyptian delegation headed by Minister of Petroleum Hamdi
Al-Banbi left for Libya Tuesday to discuss ways of boosting oil
cooperation between the two countries and the implementation of
joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The talks would focus on the operation of two pipelines. One

</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Officials Agree on Cooperation Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Asian and Pacific financial
officials ended their two-day meeting here today with an agreement
on the need of a new framework for regional cooperation, instead
of an independent "Asia Fund" proposed earlier to promote
financial stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the meeting, the delegates
said that they "agree on the need and desirability of a framework
for regional cooperation to enhance the prosperity for financial
stability" in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The framework recognizes the central role of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in the international monetary system, they
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the framework, a cooperative financing arrangement
would supplement IMF and other international financial
institutions' resources.
</P>
<P>
"Under this arrangement participants could provide, in
consultation with the IMF and on a case-by-case basis,
supplemental financial resources for IMF-supported programs," the
participants said.
</P>
<P>
The participants also agreed on the need to establish a new
mechanism for regional surveillance.
</P>
<P>
At the joint IMF-World Bank annual meeting in Hong Kong in
September, Japan proposed the establishment of an "Asian Fund" to
help Southeast Asian countries to solve the on-going currency
crisis, but the United States gave a lukewarm response.
</P>
<P>
Other industrialized nations and the IMF have also resisted
Japan's idea of an independent "Asian Fund," as they fear that an
independent fund would undermine IMF conditions attached to its
economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
Bowing to pressure from the United States and the IMF, Japan
scaled back its proposal.
</P>
<P>
The framework proposed at the Manila meeting would be discussed
at the informal ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
finance ministers' meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, next month.
If agreed by the ministers, such a framework could be presented to
the ASEAN Leaders' meeting in Kuala Lumpur on December 15-16 for
their approval.
</P>
<P>
Finance and central bank deputies from ASEAN, the United
States, Japan, China, South Korea, Australia and other Asian and
Pacific economies attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank were also present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: South Korean Government Economy Team Reshuffled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam Wednesday dismissed two top economic officials -- Deputy
Prime Minister and Finance and Economy Minister Kang Kyong-shik
and Senior Presidential Secretary for Economic Affairs Kim In-ho,
just three months before the end of his five-year presidential
term.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle came after a financial-reform bill, proposed by
the government led by Deputy Prime Minister Kang, failed to be
passed at the National Assembly session Tuesday because of the
parties' different attitudes on it.
</P>
<P>
The session decided to postpone the reform package, which is
considered as Kang's last effort to stablize the nation's shaky
financial market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Kang also felt strong pressure to step down
because of the recent economic turmoil in the country. Critics
blame it was stemmed from the government's unrealistic policies.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in early March, the prime minister has
devoted a lot to reform the country's defective economic systems,
including the primitive financial sector.
</P>
<P>
But in this process, he has been constantly criticized for
lacking a sense of reality and failing to put financing touches on
what was started recklessly.
</P>
<P>
Critics blame most recent economic setbacks on Kang's
incompetence -- failure to produce timely policies -- as was seen
in the case of the Kia Group, to which most experts attributed the
current financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
As the near-collapse of the Kia Group was throwing the economy
into turmoil by increasing uncertainty in the financial markets,
Kang was criticized to have folded his arms, reiterating that the
government would not meddle in private business.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the bank's bad-debt problems went from bad to
worse, bringing the country's overseas funding to a virtual halt.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is now facing a serious shortage of foreign
currency with the local currency won racing to renew its record
lows against the dollar day after day and stock prices plunging.
</P>
<P>
South Korean banks as well as merchant banks, suffering from
their declining credit ratings originated from the huge
non-performing loans to businesses, found it impossible to borrow
from abroad and have difficulties in lending foreign currency to
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Kang had announced a series of measures to stablize the
financial markets as well as promote the inflow of foreign
exchange, but failed to achieve any results.
</P>
<P>
There was even rumors spread recently that South Korea is
seeking an International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue fund which the
Ministry of Finance and Economy firmly denied.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say Kang seems inappropriate for the post of top
economic policy maker of an administration whose days are numbered.
</P>
<P>
"If he had been the top policy maker at the start of an
administration, he would have been remembered as a successful
deputy prime minister by tackling the country's structural
problems," an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the reshuffle conducted three months before the
end of term indicated president Kim's determination to overcome
the economic difficulties facing the country.
</P>
<P>
The financial circles welcomed Lim Chang-yuel, Trade, Industry
and Energy Minister and also a financial expert with decades-long
experience at the ministry to succeed as the top economic
policy-maker and hopes the new administration will take realistic
steps to work out the difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Discounts for Air Travelers within China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Both overseas and domestic
travelers who take flights within China, including domestic
sections of international flights, will have a chance at price
discounts ranging from 5 to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Individual travelers can get reductions from 5 to 20 percent,
while 40 percent discounts will be available for teachers and
students during summer and winter holidays, the elderly and group
travelers.
</P>
<P>
Airlines will have the final say on the amount of discounts
based on market conditions, air routes and other factors.
</P>
<P>
This preferential treatment will cover early-morning and night
flights, maiden flights, return flights, and frequent flyers'
programs, said Hai Liancheng, director of the Financial Affairs
Department of the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
</P>
<P>
He said there are still some restrictions for the preferential
policies. Men must be 60 or older and women must be 55 to
qualify for the elderly fare. Teachers and students, soldiers and
the disabled must provide corroborating documentations.
</P>
<P>
Preferential tickets cannot be returned and their holders are
not allowed to transfer to another place, and seats cannot be
booked in advance, Hai said.
</P>
<P>
Airlines will make public the different kinds of discount
tickets, the restrictions, and appropriate telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
Hai said the effort is to satisfy various consumer demands and
provide more choices for travelers, taking full advantage of the
potential of civil aviation and making air travel more competitive
in the transport market.
</P>
<P>
A number of airlines have already implemented the discount
system, but their offerings are temporary. The measure has been
adopted on international flights managed by CAAC.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects Bonn's Spying Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador Sergie Krylov
has rejected German media reports that as many as 165 spies were
operating out of the Russian embassy and consulates in Germany,
describing such an idea as "absurd," said reports published today.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is there are only 50 Russian diplomats here at the
Bonn embassy. That means that members of their families -- their
wives and children -- and even the cleaning ladies would have to
work as spies," Krylov told the daily newspaper Bild.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of weekly news magazine Der Spiegal claimed
that Russia's espionage activities had increased over recent years.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, German security authorities identified 165
Russian spies in Germany, 60 in Bonn and 56 in Berlin, it reported.
</P>
<P>
It said Bonn was pressing for Moscow to withdraw its spies no
later than moving its diplomatic bodies to capital Berlin.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was to discuss the issue with
Russian leadership when he visited the country in the end of
November, it added.

<HEADLINE> Lure of Gold Attracts Prospectors to Southwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The lure of gold has attracted
both overseas firms and domestic enterprises to the Qianxinan
Bouyei-Miao Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's Guizhou
Province.
</P>
<P>
Overseas companies and domestic enterprises both are vying for
a chance to prospect in the region, which reportedly has proven
gold reserves of 136 tons.
</P>
<P>
During the last few years, government surveyors have found four
big mines, including Lannigou Gold Mine.
</P>
<P>
Lannigou Gold Mine, which is reported to have verified gold
reserves of 60.5 tons, has been listed by the state as a major
site for overseas cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A dozen overseas delegations from the United States, Canada and
other countries have made investigation tours of Lannigou.
</P>
<P>
At present, the state and concerned enterprises have been
operating more than 100 mines, which are required to sell
their gold to the government at state-set prices.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture produced 2,200 kilograms of gold last year, said
Huang Kangsheng, head of the prefecture government.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that mining in the prefecture has bright
prospects as gold ores there are comparatively concentrated and
convenient for exploitation.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped more overseas investors would be attracted to
the region.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure in the region is also improving, he said, citing
examples of the Nanning-Kunming Railway that will begin service
early next month and construction of a hydropower station with an
installed capacity of 2.52 million kilowatts.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Build Less Golf Courses Due to El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- All applications for conversion
of land into golf courses were held in abeyance due to the El Nino
abnormal weather phenomenon, a government official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Agrarian Reform Undersecretary Artemio Adasa said that in light
of El Nino, all golf courses are now banned in environmentally
critical areas such as wetland, national parks, prime agricultural
land and places with water shortage.
</P>
<P>
"No golf zones would be issued on said areas and at the same
time should not encroach on areas already covered by the country's
comprehensive agrarian reform program," Adasa quoted a resolution
issued by the Golf Course Construction Committee as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that a total of 410 hectares of land recently applied
for conversion in two provinces will be affected by the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution identified degraded places such as landfill
sites and mines areas as the most suitable areas for developers to
build golf courses, he said.
</P>
<P>
To battle the drought brought about by El Nino, the Philippine
government is taking various measures to conserve and recycle
water.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz has urged to set up a dialogue and cooperation mechanism to
solve social problems, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not do that, we are bound to lag behind the
contemporary world," Yilmaz warned in an article published in the
latest issue of a publication of Turkey's Metal Industrialists
Union, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
He said that modern industry not only offers opportunities to
the society, but also brings problems of unemployment, poverty as
well as violence.
</P>
<P>
All these problems will not be settled without a dialogue and
understanding mechanism among all sectors of the society, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz suggested carrying out political reforms, reorganizing
political structures of Turkey in a bid to promote participation
of all citizens.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Economic and Social Council as an example, he called
for establishing similar organizations which can create the
atmosphere of social consensus, cooperation and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
These groups will contribute to the protection and extension
of individual rights and freedom in Turkey, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long been criticized by its Western allies for the
human rights record, which is a major obstacle to its bid for
European Union membership.

<HEADLINE> Advance Party to Prepare For Peace Monitoring in PNG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- An advance party of
Australian and New Zealand defense personnel will meet in Papua
New Guinea (PNG) tomorrow, before heading to PNG's rebel island of
Bougainville to pave the way for a truce monitoring group, the
Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported here today.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF) Spokeswoman Major Fiona
Cassidy said 17 or 18 unarmed members of the NZDF would leave New
Zealand early tomorrow morning for Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of peace monitors in PNG will coincide with the
start of fresh peace talks in Cairns, North Queensland of
Australia, between officials from all parties of the Bougainville
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer earlier announced
14 members of the Australian Defense Force would be in
Bougainville by Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It's one group, they're going to be marrying up," Major
Cassidy told AAP.
</P>
<P>
"The whole contingent is getting together in (Port) Moresby,
and sorting out exactly who's doing what and where they're going
and then they'll go on to Bougainville."
</P>
<P>
After joining together in PNG, Major Cassidy said the advance
party would then head to Bougainville to begin scouting the four
locations for the Truce Monitoring Group which would begin
arriving later this month.
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting for a date which is anywhere between the 26th
and 27th for the main advance party to head for Bougainville,"
Major Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Truce Monitoring Group members would not act as
peacekeepers, and would only observe any possible breaches of the
ceasefire between the secessionist Bougainville Revolutionary Army
and the PNG defense force.
</P>
<P>
Major Cassidy said New Zealand would contribute 136 personnel
to the group, in addition to the frigate of Canterbury, which
leaves for Bougainville tomorrow, tanker Endeavor and air support.
</P>
<P>
She said Australia would be contributing 90 to 92 people to the
group.

<P>
Beijing, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of cases of
HIV/AIDS reported in China had risen to 8,277 by the end of
September, the Ministry of Health disclosed here today.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 168 of the patients had AIDS and 77.5 percent were
drug users. From January to September, 2,237 new HIV positive
cases have been found, according to Wang Zhao, director of the
Ministry of Health's Disease Control Department, who spoke here
today at an AIDS conference sponsored by the Health Ministry and
UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
Based on 1996 figures, it is estimated that China may already
have 150,000 to 200,000 people infected. AIDS in China has entered
a third stage since 1994. It started among the transient
population and paid blood donors in central parts of China, and
spread among drug users in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
and Sichuan Province last year.
</P>
<P>
The HIV virus began to spread in the 1980s, and today 30
million people in the world have been infected with the deadly
disease, 90 percent of them in developing countries, 40 percent,
women, and ten percent, children. The disease was first discovered
in China in 1985, and the number of cases of HIV/AIDS caused by
sexual contacts continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS and Children" will be the theme of the '97 World AIDS Day
on December 1, which will focus on protecting children from
HIV/AIDS, said Emile Fox, an official with the United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).
</P>
<P>
China will hold a campaign on HIV/AIDS prevention in Beijing,
Hong Kong, and areas along the Beijing-Kowloon Railway in December
for World AIDS Day, Wang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa could look
forward to a better economic performance in 1998 after a
successful consolidation period in 1997, Reserve Bank Governor
Chris Stals said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Citizen newspaper quoted Stals as telling an investment
conference that a host of factors supported his view that the
consolidation process in the country's business cycle had been
completed.
</P>
<P>
These included improved equilibrium between real total
domestic production and real total demand, a surplus on the
overall balance of payments, a slowdown in money supply and bank
credit extension growth, higher gold and foreign exchange
reserves, falling inflation and a stable nominal effective
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"Not everything is, however, favorable for an expected
economic recovery in South Africa next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the possible adverse effects of current turbulence in
Asian markets, the lower gold price and the impact of the El Nino
weather phenomenon would have to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
"On balance, South Africa can with justification look forward
to a better economic performance in 1998 after the successful
consolidation period of 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stals reiterated that the central bank would continue
gradually easing its monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to be guided by financial aggregates," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that after peaking at 23.6 percent in the first
quarter of this year, rate of growth in total bank credit
extension had declined to 6.2 percent in the third quarter.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Advances on McCarthy's Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Dutch big-serving Brenda
Schultz-McCarthy failed to block top seed Martina Hingis for her
13th title this year, pulling out for toe injury in the second set
of a first-round match in the Chase Championships here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who has a record 75-4 running in 1997, ousted McCarthy
7-6 (7-3), 5-2 to advance into the quarter-finals, setting up a
meeting with French Mary Pierce who beat Sabine Appelmans of
Belgium on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Schultz-McCarthy, who blasted the hardest serves in women's
tennis, stormed eight aces and broke once in the first set, making
a stunning challenge to the world No. 1 player, before the Swiss
teenager came back from 2-1 in the tiebreaker and struggled
through the opening set.
</P>
<P>
But the Dutch tore off the nail on her right toe while she
casted herself on a volley in the first game of second set. After
that, she could not keep up with Hingis' pace and retired at 5-2.
</P>
<P>
"The nail completely went off the toe," said
Schultz-McCarthy. "I can hardly walk. I guess it's just bad
luck. I played seven weeks in a row, so I guess my body is
exhausted."
</P>
<P>
Hingis has won 12 tournaments this year, including the
Wimbledon, Australian and U.S. Open, with the French Open going to
Iva Majoli of Croatia, a step away to sweep the Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's earlier match, Majoli took a revenge by beating
Anke Huber of Germany 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-2) and ran their
head-to-head contest to 3-5.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that the cooperation between China and the United
States on economic, trade, science and technology issues has a
promising future.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with John Gibbons, assistant to U.S. president
Bill Clinton for science and technology policy, Jiang said the
level of such cooperation is still low in comparison to both
countries' needs for economic growth, and that the potential of
such cooperation is yet to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are faced with an "unprecedented opportunity"
to further economic, trade, scientific and technological
cooperation, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes both sides will continue efforts to promote
such cooperation, thus benefiting the people of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the ever-developing science and technology fields
are producing a profound impact on the pattern of world politics
and economy.
</P>
<P>
He said China, which is opening wider to the outside world and
striving for modernization, needs to learn from all the
outstanding scientific results from all over the world, including
the American people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said his recent state visit to the United States has
turned out to be a successful one.
</P>
<P>
He and President Clinton reached a consensus on the framework
of developing Sino-U.S. relations oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
This is not only in the fundamental interests of the Chinese
and American people, but also will benefit world peace and
development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons said the United States holds that Jiang's visit not
only added fuel to the development of Sino-U.S. relations but also
opened up broad prospects for scientific and technological
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the consensus reached by Clinton and Jiang
on expanding Sino-U.S. cooperation in science and technology,
Gibbons said the eighth China-U.S. Joint Committee meeting on
science and technology cooperation has produced progress in many
areas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side is to work with the Chinese to promote
scientific and technological cooperation between the two
countries, Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons and his party are here at the commission meeting at the
invitation of Song Jian, China's State Councillor and Minister in
charge of State Science and Technology Commission.

<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The late Chinese leader Mao
Zedong's saying "women holding up half the sky" highlights the
important role Chinese women play in politics, the economy and
society, as well as in the increasingly pressing tasks of
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
At the ongoing '97 China Environment Forum, Huang Qizao,
vice-president of the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF), said
that since 1990 more than 120 million Chinese women have
participated in afforestation every year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women also play an important role in environmental
research, pollution control, population control, protection of
nature and environmental education, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
During the past seven years, the forum was told, Chinese women
have built more than 100,000 greenbelts that include
shelter-forests, orchards, mulberry fields and nurseries of young
plants.
</P>
<P>
According the Ministry of Forestry, the survival rate of trees
planted by women has reached 85 percent. In addition, the ministry
allocated 800,000 yuan (97,000 U.S. dollars) annually to support
the building of 25 model greenbelts by ACWF in 18 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central
government.
</P>

NAIROBI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 2,000 families
are feared trapped in their homes in Nyando and parts of Nyakach,
Kisumu District in eastern Kenya, after raging floods partly
submerged their homes, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government will provide food and medicines to the victims
and plans to evacuate them if the rains persist in the region,
Kisumu District Commissioner Ali Korane was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Overnight rains on Monday caused flooding on Tuesday and
forced residents to flee their homes. Property estimated at
thousands of Shillings, including livestock, household goods and
crops, are also feared to have been washed away by the floods.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as the meteorological department forecast that the
torrential rains may extend into next year, it seems rain havoc
rises all round the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in north-western Kenya's Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu
districts, the hub of the country's food supply, stand to lose
their entire crop as maize continue to rot in the farms.
</P>
<P>
Western and central districts are the leading areas suffering
from high rainfall, with Lodwar and Meru stations registering the
highest of over 75 millimeters by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Coastal areas will also continue experiencing heavy
downpour this month, according to the meteorological department
here. About 15,000 slum dwellers in Mombasa, the coastal capital,
are threatened with landslides.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi, Kisumu and Nakuru received more than 60 millimeters
of rainfall respectively on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains have so far claimed over 20 lives, with most
deaths occurring in central, northern and coastal provinces.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian President Goes to U.S. Over Chernobyl Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
today said the potential danger of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor
is more than his country's internal affair.
</P>
<P>
It is "an international concern," Kuchma was quoted by a
Ukrainian Inter-fax news agency report as saying here at the
airport before leaving for the United States.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, he would discuss the financial needs for
rebuilding the so-called "sarcophagus" on the fourth generating
set at the Chernobyl reactor.
</P>
<P>
The "sarcophagus" was hastily built up to cover the reactor
damaged in an explosion on April 26, 1986, which so far has led to
the deaths of 4,300 people.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, said the report, Foreign experts began to
throw doubts over the safety of the shelter at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
The shelter was built "under tremendously trying conditions" as
a temporary solution, said John Holum, director of the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction of the shelter is estimated to cost 750
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrialized nations has
agreed to contribute 300 million dollars, while the European Union
(EU) will provide 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian government has decided to contribute 50 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The funding of the undecided 300 million dollars will be
discussed during a meeting with representatives from some 50
countries in New York on November 20, which Kuchma is expected to
attend, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma did not rule out the possibility of holding talks with
U.S. Vice President Al Gore over Ukraine's participation in the
construction of a nuclear power plant in Iran with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent unofficial meeting with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, Kuchma said there was not suspending
issues between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Scholars To Help China Retrieve Dunhuang Relics (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Dunhuang scholars are
going to assist a campaign to try to get back some lost relics of
the Dunhuang Grottos in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Professors, scholars, and researchers from Beijing University,
People's University, and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
have decided to look into the question of how priceless relics
fell into the hands of foreigners. The results of the study will
be used as evidence in a campaign to recover Dunhuang relics that
have been brought out of China.
</P>
<P>
"It's been about a hundred years since relics were discovered
in the Dunhuang Grottos and Chinese academics are really concerned
about whether the relics can be brought back to China," says Ma
Shichang, an archaeologist at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
In 1900, a Chinese Taoist priest found the entrance to a cave
in the Dunhuang Grottos that contained more than 50,000 ancient
books, sculptures, frescoes and documents on religion, ancient
science and technology, art, and literature.
</P>
<P>
In subsequent years, adventurers from Britain, France, Japan,
the United States, and Russia came to Dunhuang and acquired most
of the relics for next to nothing. Some people simply looted the
caves, and the relics can be seen in many Western museums and in
private collections.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Xiehe Group, a pharmaceutical company in Shenyang that
has donated money for Dunhuang research projects, has started a
campaign to recover the lost treasures.
</P>
<P>
"The relics can be best appreciated only when they are returned
to the grottos and kept together with the murals and frescoes,"
Prof. Ma told a forum sponsored by Xiehe Group last week at
Beijing University.

<P>
Scholars attending the forum agreed that it will be no easy job
getting the relics back because it would involve complicated legal
and scholarly questions.
</P>
<P>
First, however, they will establish the true identity of the
"explorers" who removed the relics, how the relics were traded
away, and what the attitude of the Qing government at that time
was.
</P>
<P>
They also suggest that the government should support and even
lead the relics-retrieval campaign. They propose to first get in
contact with and negotiate with the relics' owners. Litigation

<HEADLINE> Food Marts Closed Down for Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique government has
closed down sub-standard food markets to curb the spreading of
cholera, which has claimed 120 lives in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
The move, started Tuesday, was announced by Aurelio Zilhao,
Mozambique's Health Minister, according to local daily Naticias
today.
</P>
<P>
The sub-standard food marts are said to be the main cause for
the spread of the epidemic disease in the worse-hit Maputo and
Gaza provinces in the country, Zilhao said.
</P>
<P>
He said the disease this time is more dangerous than in 1992
eruption, in that people suffering from it are getting dehydrated
in six hours comparing with the 24 hours five years ago.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 people have been admitted into the central
hospital of Maputo ever since the first case was reported in
August, he said.
</P>
<P>
The infectious disease is seen by local health officials as
caused by refugees from Tanzania and the Great Lakes Region,
Zilhao said, adding that the rubbish piles scattering around the
cities are also part of the reasons for the spreading of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The government is closing down the food markets, because they
are yet another cause for cholera, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the media and any other sector of the society to move
up for the end of the plague.

<HEADLINE> Vancouver Embraces APEC Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, November 18 (Xinhua) -- With the opening of the
media center here today, Vancouver is finishing the final touches
of its preparation for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) meetings scheduled to begin tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The media center, located at the Vancouver Trade and Convention
Center, will provide "working newsroom" facilities to the 3,000
journalists expected to cover the week-long event.
</P>
<P>
"Our commitment to ensuring that media have a first rate
facility from which to report on APEC meetings equals our
commitment to APEC delegates who will participate in the
meetings," said Robert Vandeloo, executive director of the APEC
97' Canadian Coordinating Office.
</P>
<P>
The media will have 24-hour access to electronic and print work
areas, briefing rooms, delegation press offices, translation and
interpretation services, telephone and facsimile services, and
computer support service in the 70,000 square feet center.
</P>
<P>
Colorful flags are flying high along main streets in the
bustling downtown areas, where hotels are packed, and restaurants
are more crowded and noisier than ever before.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, more temporary "No Stop" signs have sprung up
on the sides of streets, making it difficult to find parking space.
</P>
<P>
The event, which is expected to attract a total of 8,000
government leaders, business and media representatives, will
surely cause traffic jams and delays to the Vancouverites.
</P>
<P>
This is "frustrating for driving people," yet, the general mood
here is "quite positive," said a Canadian media co-ordinator.
</P>
<P>
"It is a wonderful event, helpful to open new markets and
reduce barriers," he said. "Hopefully, it will be beneficial to
everybody."
</P>
<P>
But the political and business leaders here seem more convinced
that the event will be a plus to Vancouver, and Canada as a whole.
</P>
<P>
They see the APEC "as a sign that Vancouver is reaching its
promise on the Pacific Rim", said a report in a newspaper here.
</P>
<P>
It is generally considered here that the APEC will be more
significant an event than Expo 86, which is widely viewed as a
turning point that sparked international investment interests in
the city.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the event's success, leaders' safety in particular,
the city of Vancouver has mounted the greatest security efforts
that ever staged in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 police around the country are helping patrol the
city's downtown area. And, the Canadian military is also lending
its hand.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan University in southwest
China's Yunnan province, which is known for its research on the
Chinese history, has established a Humanities College to improve
research in that area.
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old university, a major research center for ethnic
groups in China, did a study of ethnic groups in Yunnan in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
The college has five departments, namely Chinese literature,
news, history, anthropology, and archives, and has doctorate and
post-graduate programs.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chaomin, president of the college, says that they have two
advantages in humanities research: Yunnan has 24 ethnic groups
each with a population of more than 4,000, and 15 ethnic groups
that are unique in the country; and the province borders on some
Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that his college will begin a large-scale survey of
Yunnan's ethnic groups in near future.

<HEADLINE> Referendum Outcome Good For Hungary: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister
Gyula Horn said Tuesday that the outcome of the referendum held
last Sunday will do good to the country's future.
</P>
<P>
Horn made the remarks while meeting with former U.S. Senate
Speaker Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
The result, with 85 percent in favor of joining the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), will not only pave the way
for the country to join the Western military alliance, but will
also help its bid for a European Union (EU) membership, Horn said.
</P>
<P>
Hungary is expected to meet the EU's lowest criteria for
economic development by the year 2000 or 2001, he said, adding
that there should be no reason for further postponing Hungary's
entry into the EU.
</P>
<P>
Hungary was the only one among the three invitees to join NATO
that chose to hold a referendum, in which 49 percent of the
country's eight million eligible voters took part.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic and Poland, the other two invitees, also
welcomed the results, Horn added.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Hungary's relations with Russia, Horn said the
bilateral ties had developed positively instead of going backward
after the East European country sought to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
Dole said the outcome of the referendum will help the
U.S. Senate ratify the eastward enlargement of NATO.

<P>
ROME, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Separation and divorce rates are
rising in Italy and the majority of separation requests are made
by women, the National Statistics Institute(ISTAT) said today.
</P>
<P>
The number of separations in Italy rose from 35,163 in 1985 to
52,323 in 1995 and the number of divorces from 15,650 in 1985 to
27,038 in 1995, the figures released by ISTAT said.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total official separations granted in 1995, 67.1
percent were requested by the wife and 63 percent involved couples
with children. Only 14.4 percent of separations were contested by
one of the partners.
</P>
<P>
The number of separations leading to divorce was, however,
relatively low, ISTAT added. By 1995, only 27 percent of legal
separations in 1991 had resulted in divorce, and 9.2 percent in
1992.
</P>
<P>
There would also appears to be a north-south divide, with more
marital break-ups in northern regions than in southern regions.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Invites Foreign Funds To Develop Water Conservancy Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Gansu Province in northwestern
China has attracted 338 million U.S. dollars in foreign investment
to build 14 key water conservation projects since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The province took the lead in attracting foreign investment for
building water conservation projects in the early 1980s, receiving
68 million U.S. dollars in assistance since then to develop
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The province long has been suffering from water shortages, but
officials say it has great potential for developing water
conservation facilities. The province's hydro-power capacity ranks
forth in the country, and it has used 21 percent of its total
water resources reserve.
</P>
<P>
With World Bank loans of 123 million U.S. dollars and a total
investment of 1.57 billion yuan (about 200 million U.S. dollars),
the project "Yingdaruqing" will divert water from the Datong River
to irrigate the arid land of Qingwangchuan. After the project is
completed in two years, 280,000 farmers in the region would be
able to rise above the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
The Jingtaichuan project to provide power and irrigation has
been partly funded by the World Bank and World Food Program of the
United Nations. The project has built 43 pump houses, irrigated
42,000 hectares of farmland, and attracted 280,000 new farmers who
chose to move to the region from other poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Guo Kun, vice-governor of Gansu, said the province will try to
attract more foreign investment to improve its water conservation
facilities and protect against natural calamities.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, IMF Conclude Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) team which has just completed two weeks of discussions
with the Zimbabwe government on the country's macro-economic
policies said on Tuesday it had been impressed by the
government's determination to solve present economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said in a statement that it hoped the strong and
comprehensive measures adopted by the government would be a major
step in stabilising the economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that the stabilisation measures will facilitate
the release of balance of payments in the region of 100 million
U.S. dollars from the world bank and other donors," the fund
said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, the World Bank and other donors had suspended balance
of payments support to Zimbabwe's economic reforms after the
government, under pressure from the freedom fighters, bowed to
their demands to be paid pensions and gratuities.
</P>
<P>
The western donors said they wanted assurance that the payouts
would not further increase an already high budget deficit,
inflation and cause other macro-economic instabilities.
</P>
<P>
The discussions were centred on the need to stem the serious
foreign exchange pressures which Zimbabwe had been facing and
stabilise the economy in the face of large payments in pensions
and gratuities to former war veterans.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe government finally announced on Monday that it
would seek about two billion Zimbabwe dollars (140 million U.S.
dollars) on the market and freeze some recurrent and capital
expenditures in various ministries to raise about four billion
Zimbabwe dollars (280 million U.S. dollars) needed to pay the war
veterans pensions and gratuities.
</P>
<P>
On the same day the reserve bank increased the rediscount rate
by three percent from 25.5 to 28.5 percent and directed all
corporate foreign currency account balances to be offloaded onto
the foreign exchange market in tough measures to support the
Zimbabwe dollar which had plummeted alarmingly against major
currencies last week.

are optimistic about the future after the project is completed.
</P>
<P>
One such farmer recalled the disastrous summer flood of 1996,
which destroyed their dykes and inundated their houses and
fields. The flood overnight deprived them of almost everything and
caused damages of more than 30 billion yuan (about 3.7 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Once the Three Gorges Project is put into operation in 2003,
we will probably have little chance of suffering from flooding,"
the farmer said.
</P>
<P>
Dongting Lake, with an area of more than 2,000 square
kilometers, sustains 30 to 40 percent of the annual flooding of
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The river also deposits about 100 million cubic meters of sand
into the lake each year. In the past 46 years, the bed of the lake
has risen by 1.7 meters.
</P>
<P>
Through publicity of the local government, farmers also know
that the project is able to not only control flooding and
siltation, but also will provide water for irrigation in dry
seasons.

<HEADLINE> Central Province Takes Water Projects Key in Bumper Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province in central
China plans to build water conservation projects in time to ensure
a disaster-free year, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
Hunan's harvest this year topped 28.7 billion kilograms of
grain, up 1.8 billion kg over last year. The good harvest was
attributed to favorable weather conditions by local officials.
</P>
<P>
The province had experienced serious flooding in the last two
years. Water conservation work has focused on fortifying
endangered dikes.
</P>
<P>
This year, the provincial government called on localities to
make water conservation projects a top priority. After the autumn
grain harvest, five million people have been mobilized to complete
600,000 water projects.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is pooling three billion yuan (361
million U.S. dollars) to finish 600 million cubic meters of
construction on dikes, dams, reservoirs and related projects by
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, work has been completed on 219 million cubic meters
of such projects at a cost of 970 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Hunan expects long-term benefits from the present water
conservation work.

CHONGQING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have been
increasing protection of relics in the Three Gorges area after the
Yangtze River was blocked earlier this month for construction of a

<HEADLINE> China Has Potential to Produce More Grain: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- China has virtually unlimited
potential to produce grain, said Yao Jianfu, an official from the
Ministry of Agriculture at a recent forum on the country's
agricultural development held in Changsha, capital of central
China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
A famine caused by grain shortages won't take place in China,
Yao said.
</P>
<P>
The actual acreage devoted to farming is 40 percent more than
the statistical figure, he said. Per capita grain production
reached 393 kilograms in 1990. Improvements in agricultural
technologies will also increase the grain output, Yao said. Though
some agricultural provinces, for example Hunan province, suffered
recent flooding, they still had a grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country could face a shortage of feed. Eating
patterns of people have gradually shifted to meat, eggs, milk and
fish because their income has been rising.
</P>
<P>
Grain imports won't lead to increases in grain prices, Yao said.
</P>
<P>
Annual grain imports won't exceed 60 million tons by 2020, and
it would be easy for the world market to supply such an amount of
grain, said an economist from the World Bank.

ROME, November 18 (Xinhua) -- An estimated number of 165 million
visitors to visit Italy during the Jubilee 2000 will stretch the
country's transport system to breaking point, the government's
official Jubilee agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the mass of tourists would need extra 20,000
coaches, 2,400 trains and 22,000 planes, Tourism Department head
Stefano Landi said the additional demand for transport would make
Italy's transport network look more burdensome.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he promised, efforts would be made to see that
transport problems do not become a disaster in 2000.
</P>
<P>
If the 165 million visitors do come in the year 2000, the
figure would be 28 million more than the total for 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Jubilee agency, set up by the Department of Tourism to
coordinate preparations for the Jubilee Year, predicted Rome would
be the most-attractive destination in Italy, which would attract
14 million tourist, staying for 53 million nights.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Xishan, a city in
east China's Jiangsu Province, have created a new kind of silk --
color-weaving silk -- to overcome its fading and wrinkling nature.
</P>
<P>
The farmers who live in Caihuang village of Xing'an Town treat
the silk by a special process which allows the dye to penetrate
into the fabric and weave it into cloth, which improves its
resistance to sunlight, improves durability and resists damage
from washing and ironing.
</P>
<P>
The quality inspection center for state silk products conducted
a one-month examination of the color-weaving silk in July and
reported that the silk exceeds international standards.
</P>
<P>
China is considered to be a country of origin for silk and uses
the centuries-old method of weaving silk into cloth and then dying
it.

KIEV, November 18 (Xinhua) -- An association of joint ventures
in Ukraine will petition the Constitutional Court to repeal a
recent law suspending tax breaks granted to them, an official of
the association said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The association has already drawn up the petition and has been
collecting signatures, said Olga Revina, director of the Ukrainian
League of Companies funded partially by Foreign Investors.
</P>
<P>
"Canceling tax benefits to companies with foreign capital is a
breach of the principle of supremacy of law, and causes serious
damage to the image of the state," the petition says.
</P>
<P>
By approving amendments to the corporate income tax law on
October 23, the Ukrainian parliament finally stripped away foreign
joint venture's rights to tax breaks, which had been suspended
since spring.
</P>

The legislature made the amendments despite repeated requests
from President Leonid Kuchma that tax relief to manufacturing
joint ventures be restored.

DHAKA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has an estimated
fatality rate of 58 per year per 10,000 registered motorized
vehicles, a rate some 25 times those of most industrialized
countries, according to an official report.

Moreover, this figure can only be an under-estimate as road

1 percent of this least-developed country's gross domestic
product, namely 250 million U.S. dollars.

Statistics show that the annual number of reported accidents
has been multiplied since 1987 when a total of 1,521 road
accidents were recorded, in which 1,156 people died and 1,988
others were injured.
</P>
<P>
But in 1996, only eight years later, the number of reported

<HEADLINE> OPEC to Continue Role as Oil Price Stabilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) will continue to play a crucial role in
stabilizing the world oil price as competition among oil producers
becomes fiercer, former OPEC Secretary General Subroto said.
</P>
<P>
If OPEC was dissolved, a similar organization would undoubtedly
emerge because tight competition in the world oil market would
cause oil prices to drop, he told a discussion here Tuesday, the
Antara News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The discussion was held ahead of an OPEC conference scheduled
to take place from November 26 to December 1 in Jakarta. The
meeting will discuss the restructuring of OPEC, production quotas
and the selection of a new OPEC secretary general.
</P>
<P>
Subroto, Indonesia's former mines and energy minister, said
lower production cost of crude oil would reduce oil price because
oil producers would compete with one another for markets.
</P>
<P>
The condition would undoubtedly have an adverse impact on oil
producers, most of which depend on crude oil exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, OPEC would continue to play a crucial role because it
would set oil output in proportion to demand to prevent a decline
in the oil price, he said.
</P>
<P>
Oil price now stands at less than 20 U.S. dollars per barrel
against 34 dollars per barrel in the 1970s. The price dropped to a
record low of 10 dollars in 1986 because OPEC no longer functioned
as a "price leader."
</P>
<P>
OPEC members now supply nearly 40 percent of the world's oil
demand which has reached 73.7 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Subroto said there is no need for OPEC to push the world oil
price to 30 dollars per barrel but to stabilize it at 17 to 19
dollars per barrel.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Petroleum Dealers Protest Against VAT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Vehicles still have to queue
up before the gas stations in the Kathmandu Valley today as
dealers refused to buy petroleum products from a state-run
supplier in protest against the newly-implemented value-added tax
(VAT).
</P>
<P>
Long queues were seen early in the morning as the result of a
sudden upsurge in demand due to the dealers' refusal to purchase
petroleum products from the state-run Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC)
since Monday, one day after the VAT took effect in the country.
</P>
<P>
The business community has been opposing the VAT, saying it
will cause more anomalies to the economy.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers quoted the Petroleum Dealers Association of Nepal as
saying the VAT has caused a 10-percent fall in the commission the
dealers are receiving from the NOC.
</P>
<P>
More turmoil is believed to follow as the business community
has threatened to stage more protests against the VAT.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bans Belgian Cattle, Sheep Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
banned cattle, sheep, their meat and many related products
imported from Belgium, fearing of mad cow disease found in the
European country last month.
</P>
<P>
"This emergency measure was taken to protect animal and public
health," said Joan M. Arnoldi, deputy administrator for veterinary
services at the Agriculture Department's animal inspection agency.
</P>
<P>
The mad cow crisis erupted in March 1996 when the European
Union slapped a worldwide ban on British beef after scientists
discovered evidence that a fatal brain-wasting disease could be
transmitted to humans from cattle.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is not a major meat exporter to the United States, but
the U.S. saw a 600 percent increase in exports of Belgian live
animals including cattle and sheep in the first half of this year
over 1996 levels, according to the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
The United States has banned imports of live animals and animal
products from Britain, France, Ireland, Oman, Portugal,
Switzerland and the Netherlands since 1989.

<HEADLINE> Bus Tragedy Toll Rises to 30 in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 30 school children
died and more than 60 were injured when an overcrowded school bus
plunged into the Yamuna River in north New Delhi early on Tuesday,
the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports had put the toll at 20.
</P>
<P>
The disaster occurred when the bus, which was reportedly
speeding, skidded on a mound of sand lying in one lane of a bridge
over the river and crashed into the railings of the bridge before
plunging into the Yamuna.
</P>
<P>
Bodies of at least 30 children had been fished out by Tuesday
night and some of them were found even several kilometers away
from the site where the bus fell into the river.
</P>
<P>
There were at least 113 persons on aboard the bus. The death
toll is expected to rise further as search is on for the missing
children.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi state government on Tuesday declared a two-day
morning in the wake of the tragedy.

<HEADLINE>   U.S. Capital Losing Singles and Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Many single and poorer
residents are leaving Washington D.C. or consolidating households
to save money, according to a study.
</P>
<P>
The United States capital is experiencing its first decrease in
single-person households and households with annual incomes of
less than 15,000 dollars, according to the study released to the
District of Columbia Tax Commission today.
</P>
<P>
Demographer George Grier based his study on 8,537 interviews
conducted since 1994, and found that from 1990 to 1996, one-person
households decreased from 102,947 to 92,800 and two-persons'
increased from 66,926 to 70,900.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the district's population has declined steadily
from about 606,900 in 1990 to 543,000 in 1996, due to worsening
incomes, schools and crime, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Previously those leaving the city were mostly middle-class
families moving to the suburbs, but Grier said that's not the case
with poor people.
</P>
<P>
"They are not moving to the suburbs, that's for sure." Grier
told The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
A separate study on the city's homeless problem found that one
in every 200 district households requested shelter from May 1996
to June 1997.
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by the Fannie Mae Foundation, said a
preventive approach is needed to help families avoid a shelter
stay and to reserve that space for more acute housing emergencies.
</P>
<P>
One option would be emergency centers where families can go for
loans to pay back rent, the study said.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Proposes Single Currency for Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank
President of Argentina, Pedro Pou, said the Southern Common Market
(Mercosur) countries should adopt a single currency to lower risks
posed by speculative moves in international markets.
</P>
<P>
Pou made the proposal today during a seminar on financial
matters of Mercosur. The meeting was organized by the Foundation
for Latin American Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of a single currency "is a long-term
goal and would represent the last stage of the integration
process."
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation for Mercosur's achievements, saying
that regional trade rose from four billion to 17 billion dollars
since its foundation.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, established in December 1994 to promote free trade in
the region, is the biggest commercial bloc in South America. It
groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Chile and Bolivia
are associate members.

<HEADLINE> Date Set for Paraguay's General Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay's Supreme
Electoral Court ruled today the country's general elections be
held on May 10, despite controversy over the presidential
candidate of the ruling Red Party, according to news reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The decision, said Vice President of the Court Alberto Ramirez
Zambonini, is based on a timetable approved by all political
parties of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramirez, all the political forces still have
enough time to solve their differences and register their
candidates, adding the deadline for the elections will "be as
scheduled."
</P>
<P>
The controversy within the ruling party arose when Lino Oviedo,
former chief of the Paraguayan army, was nominated presidential
candidate of the Red Party in the inner elections on September 7.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo's candidacy met with opposition from former Foreign
Minister Luis Maria Argana, who brought the case before the
Supreme Electoral Court by presenting an appeal for the annulment
of Oviedo's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
It was reported Argana alleged Oviedo was accused of complicity
in the attempted coup against President Juan Carlos Wasmosy on
April 3, 1996.
</P>
<P>
After the coup, Wasmosy had issued an arrest warrant for
Oviedo, but Oviedo evaded it by fleeing away.
</P>
<P>
In his defense, Oviedo denounced the plot that Wasmosy and
Argana concocted to prevent him from reaching the presidency of
Paraguay.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Agree on Justice Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Justice officials from both
China and the United States agreed here today that it is important
to strengthen cooperation in the battle against organized
international crime and illegal drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that cooperation and exchanges between legal
and judicial circles of the two countries would be beneficial and
necessary to both, Xiao Yang, the Chinese justice minister, said
after discussions with his U.S. counterpart, Janet Reno, and other
senior officials.
</P>
<P>
He said bilateral cooperation will also play an important role
in maintaining peace, stability and development in the world as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Xiao headed a delegation from the Chinese Ministry of Justice
which concluded a three-day visit to the U.S. capital today. It
discussed in detail with the U.S. officials issues ranging from
fighting organized international crime, drug trafficking and money
laundering to cooperation in judicial research and the training of
lawyers and judicial officials.
</P>
<P>
"As the biggest developing country and the biggest developed
country in the world, China and the United States have better
opportunities and broad prospects for exchanges and cooperation in
the legal and judicial fields, despite their different concepts on
the rule of law and the legal culture," said Xiao.
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation would play a positive role in setting up a
Sino-U.S. constructive, strategic partnership facing the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation arrived in Hawaii last Friday and left
here for New York City today. It is expected to leave the United
States for Canada on Thursday.

COLOMBO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Army advanced
into an area held by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
along the Mankulam-Mullaitivu road in the north amid heavy rebel
artillery and mortar fire Tuesday, military sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said there was fierce fighting in the area as
hundreds of troops pressed on.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force bombed several rebel positions while the troops
backed by armor and artillery inched forward.
</P>
<P>
Casualties of the fighting are not available yet.
</P>
<P>
The government forces are now engaged in the third phase of
their operation "Jayasikuru" (Certain Victory), which began in
mid-May to open a land route to the north through rebel-held
territories.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday the forces were able to capture a major junction in
Puliyankulam, a key strategic town on the main highway. Their
immediate task at present is to link the town with Kilinochchi,
which is situated further north.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting with government troops in the north

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Further Cut Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will
further cut the budget for the 1998 fiscal year, new Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan revealed the plan to further slash the budget at a
briefing on the general military situation at the Defense Ministry
on Tuesday, local newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said the cut was necessary because of an expected fall in
state revenues from taxes due to the current economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
All state agencies, including the military, will have their
expenditures trimmed in this round of cut, said Chuan, who also
holds the defense portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's government budget for the 1998 fiscal year, which
starts in October this year, stands at 823 billion baht (about 8.4
billion U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate), after the
previous government of Chavalit Yongchaiyudh made two radical cuts
totaling 159 billion baht (4.1 billion dollars) earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Thai Budget Bureau chief Seri Sathaporn said the government
anticipated a 22 billion baht (564.1 million dollars) fall in
revenues.
!! To keep the budget deficit at 1 percent of the country's gross
domestic product as set by the International Monetary Fund, the
government has to either raise taxes or further cut the budget to
make up for the expected shortfall, Seri said.
</P>
<P>
Since the government does not want to add any more burden to
the public, budget cut appears to be the only choice, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's state agencies this time are expected to be further
affected by the cut and they have to postpone or cancel more
projects.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Promotes Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The immediate objectives of
the Kazakh government are the settlement of unpaid pensions and
workers' wages, and reform of the pension system, Akhas Tajutov,
the prime minister's press secretary, said today.
</P>
<P>
Main tasks are to put the state economy on the track of stable
development, and to deepen social reform, especially in the fight
against poverty and unemployment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tajutov said the government is in great need of cash to promote
reform, to buttress the development of small and medium-sized
businesses, to propel forward fundamental education and to settle
the default on pensions.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of this year only 86 percent of
state budgetary receipts were accomplished. The Kazakh government
has ordered tax bureaux and customs to improve tax-collecting work
and stop the defaulting on tax payments.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh economy maintained the momentum of picking up this
year with the gross domestic product, gross industrial product and
agricultural product increased by two percent, 3.6 percent and 1.5
percent respectively compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increases to rising oil, ferrous and
nonferrous metal outputs.
</P>
<P>
The new Kazakh government, headed by Prime Minister Nurlan
Utebovich Balgimbeav, started working last month.

<HEADLINE> World Crude Oil Demand to Rise in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- World crude oil demand in 1998
is estimated to rise by 1.7 million barrels per day (BPD), with
developing countries accounting for the lion's share of the
increase, an Indonesian oil official said.
</P>
<P>
"I see demand rising by 1.7 million barrels per day in 1998...
and from this total, 1 million barrels per day will come from
developing countries," Indonesia's Governor for the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Purnomo Yuswantoro said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the projected rise in crude oil demand from
developing countries to the fact that these countries are
experiencing strong economic growth, citing China as an example.
</P>
<P>
The current world demand for crude oil is estimated at around
73.5 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The increase in demand next year may not necessarily be met by
OPEC, but by non-OPEC producers, local press reports today quoted
Yuswantoro as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 103rd OPEC ministerial meeting will be held here from
November 26 to December 1. A rise in both quota and price of crude
oil is likely to be a crucial topic of discussions at the meeting.

KATHMANDU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali currency, the
rupee, was devalued today for the fourth time within three months
following the fall of the Indian rupee.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Rastra Bank today refixed the buying and selling
rates of the greenback at 59.75 and 60.35 rupees respectively from
Tuesday's 58.50 and 59.05 rupees.

The central bank of Nepal tried to prop up the currency Tuesday
by floating 13.5 million U.S. dollars at a rate of 1:60 as demand
for the dollar soared amid fears of imminent depreciation of the
Nepali currency.

<P>
As the Indian rupee fell to a 20-month low against the dollar
Monday, the Nepali rupee, pegged to the Indian currency at a fixed
rate of 1:1.6, has no other way but to follow suit.

JAKARTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's trade surplus is
expected to stand at 4.3 billion U.S. dollars in the second half
of the 1997-98 fiscal year ending March 31 next year, a cabinet
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad, in a written statement issued
Tuesday, said exports in the second half of the year would reach
25.788 billion dollars, including 21.354 billion dollars in
non-oil exports and 4.434 billion dollars in oil exports.
</P>
<P>
He said imports are expected to reach 21.479 billion dollars,
with non-oil imports amounting to 20.049 billion dollars and oil
imports 1.385 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that if the forecast is met, the total trade
surplus would exceed 9 billion dollars in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The country posted a trade surplus of 7.046 billion dollars in
the 1996-97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The minister said there are indications that demand for some of
Indonesia's export commodities has declined due to a drop in
demand in Indonesia's exports destinations as well as the failure
of the export products to meet standards set by destination
countries.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the problem, he said, the government will continue
to encourage the business community and exporters to improve their
efficiency and productivity while providing various facilities
needed to stimulate exports including fiscal and monetary
incentives.

<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen production lines
seized by Chinese officials for manufacturing unauthorized
CDs are now producing legal products, the Press and Publications
Administration announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Since last year China has seized 49 underground CD production
lines, mainly in the southern province of Guangdong, an official
from the administration said. The crackdowns have curbed rampant
copyright infringement, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the official cited a lack of authorized video and
audio products on the domestic market. To ensure that there will
be a flourishing market that can meet people's demands, the
administration decided to re-open some confiscated production
lines.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that one of the reasons for copyright violations
is that lawful producers cannot meet the demand for CDs.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said all seized productions lines will be sold
to lawful video and audio producers to turn out products which
conform with China's copyright law.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Rare Cranes Thrive in Nature Reserve(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Yu Zheng and Fang Fang
</P>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Half of the world's rare
black-necked cranes are wintering in China's poorest province.
</P>
<P>
Caohai Nature Reserve in Guizhou Province is their yearly home
during the chilly winter months.
</P>
<P>
At least 450 black-necked cranes leave their usual homes on the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to wade through the grass and marshes of
Caohai, a 25-square-kilometer wetland, said an official from the
nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
According to World Wildlife Fund (WWF) sources, China has more
than 700 of the world's 1,000 black-necked cranes. The temperature
and environment around Caohai are suitable for migrant birds.
</P>
<P>
Tourists have been flocking to the reserve to take pictures of
the birds. Many rent small boats from local farmers to get closer
to the wading and swimming birds, especially the rare cranes.
</P>
<P>
"A great number of crane-lovers came here to see the endangered
bird, and some even took photos seven or eight meters from the
cranes," said Huang Mingjie, a program official with the Guizhou
Environmental Protection Bureau (GEPB).
</P>
<P>
"The work of farmers now would not disturb surrounding cranes,"
Huang said. "It is a very rare scene in any other place."
</P>
<P>
Caohai is a far cry from that years ago, Huang said. The
reserve had been nearly drained in 1972 to make way for more
farmland. Soil erosion, bad farming practices and outbreaks of
crop pests led to a decision by the provincial government to
restore the lake in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Black-necked cranes had dwindled to 35 birds, Huang said, but
the population increased rapidly after the wetland expansion.

By Yu Zheng and Fang Fang
</P>
<P>
Three years after the lake's restoration, a nature reserve was
established under the leadership of the environmental protection
bureau.
</P>
<P>
"Local farmers showed their resentment at the beginning,
particularly against the fishing ban there during the spring
breeding season," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20,000 farmers lived in the 96-square-kilometer reserve,
adjacent to the county seat of Weining, one of the most
poverty-stricken areas in the inland province. They survived on
farming and primitive handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
"We must care about the daily lives of the neighboring poor
people while running the nature reserve," said He Shicheng, GEPB's
deputy director. "We should help people there as well as those
lovely cranes."
</P>
<P>
The International Crane Foundation (ICF), Guizhou Environmental
Protection Bureau and the Trickle-Up Program (TUP), a non-profit
organization concerned with alleviating poverty, supported 412 of
the poorest farming families with grants and community trust funds of
100 U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have been encouraged to undertake projects that do not
damage the nature reserve or natural resources of the wetland.
</P>
<P>
Caohai Nature Reserve also chose 13 voluntary environmental
watchdogs among the farmers.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the farmers recognized that we care about them the
same as those cranes, they understand our work and the aim of the
nature reserve," He said.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is the most dangerous threat to environment, thus we
must find other alternatives to random exploitation of natural
resources."
</P>
<P>
Local farmers came to know that the wetland and birds would
also bring them profit. Expenditures from tourists to Caohai have
become the major source of income for the farmers.
</P>
<P>
In the slack season, 53-year-old farmer Wang Weide said he
could get more than 2,000 yuan (240 U.S. dollars) by renting his
boat to tourists, a huge income around Caohai. More than 40
boatmen like Wang benefit from tourism.
</P>
<P>
The ICF regards the reserve as a successful combination of
safeguarding cranes and human beings. The picturesque reserve will
be the host for an international conference near Caohai sponsored
by the ICF in December.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Myanmar to Meet on Drug Suppression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai and Myanmar authorities
will work out drugs suppression measures when they meet in Chiang
Rai, northern Thailand, next month, according to the Narcotics
Control Board (ONCB) of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thai government representatives and their counterparts from
Myanmar will meet on December 12 to discuss the problem of drugs
and precursor smuggling for the second time this year.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
An ONCB official was quoted today by the local press as saying
Thailand has been successful in suppressing drugs at a certain
level with support from UNDCP experts and cooperation from Myanmar
and Laos, but he conceded that the more serious drug suppression
measures are, the harder drug dealers would seek new methods of
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a policeman and two drug traffickers were killed in
northern Thailand in a shoot-out at a checkpoint on a road between
Chiang Mai's Mae Ai District and Chinagrai's Mae Chan Tuesday,
according to a report reaching here today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> "El Nino" to Cause Heavy Drought in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The climatic phenomenon
of "El Nino" will make Brazil suffer the worst drought in the past
34 years from the end of 1997 to the first quarter of 1998, local
press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Director of the National Weather Institute
Expedito Rebello as saying that the level of the rivers in the
Amazonian region as well as the northeastern region will be
significantly lower than normal times due to shortage of rain.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last week, the Black River, one of the major
rivers in Brazil, lowered some 8.6 meters or more below the normal
level.
</P>
<P>
In the northwestern region, rainfall through the end of this
year to the first three months next year is expected to diminish
nearly 30 percent against the same period one year earlier, when
precipitation was registered at 183 to 216 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
However, in southern Brazil, especially the state of Rio Grande
du Sul, is dashed by heavy rains, which have caused losses of 13
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 90,000 tons of corn crops in the region
will be lost.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Car Fair to Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 100
exhibitors will participate in the 5th International Automobile
Fair, on November 21 to 30 in Santa Fe de Bogota.
</P>
<P>
The Fair will host almost all transnational car makers in the
Colombian market, one of the most attractive markets in Latin
America, according to the Fairs Corporation (Corferias), the
organizer of the event.
</P>
<P>
The automobile sector is one of the few that have enjoyed
remarkable growth this year in Colombia. So visitors will see a
wide range of models and brands, Corferias said.
</P>
<P>
The car industry in Colombia has grown by nearly 30 percent so
far this year. Corferias said the reason might lie in the falling
interest rate, which is good for car sales because many vehicles
are sold under credit. The interest rate has fallen 20 to 24
percent, the lowest in decades.
</P>
<P>
Corferias said the good situation of the industry had brought
to Colombia sophisticated and high-tech car models, with features
Colombians had never seen before.
</P>
<P>
About 90.000 people are expected to visit the Fair.

scheme to convert 2 percent of Australia's electricity generation

<HEADLINE> Few of Congress' Bills Pass This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Members of the U.S. House
of Representatives introduced 3,036 bills in the congressional
session beginning in January and ending last week, of which 59 so
far have become law, according to the Congressional Record.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Senate got the president's signature for 19 of
the 1,568 bills senators introduced during the year.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-led Congress this session once again showed
unfruitful enthusiasm for amending the Constitution. The House
proposed 77 amendments, and the Senate 17, with many overlapping
on such subjects as a balanced budget, term limits, school prayer
and abortion. Not one got the necessary two-thirds majority in
both chambers.
</P>
<P>
Introducing bills that don't have a chance of ever becoming law
is hardly new to Congress. "It goes on all the time, allowing
people to take positions on a variety of issues," said professor
Roger Davidson of the University of Maryland, an authority on
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Davidson anticipated the next session beginning in January
would be more productive.
</P>
<P>
Congress did pass several dozen bills in the final days of the
session that the president has yet to sign into law.
</P>
<P>
The White House said on Tuesday that 35 bills are on the
president's desk, awaiting his signature, and another three dozen
or so have passed Congress but have yet to be delivered. Clinton
is likely to sign these into law, although he does have his veto
power, which he exercised three times this year.
</P>
<P>
Most of these late-hour bills were minor, although some will
affect millions of Americans, including three fiscal 1998 spending
bills, bills to overhaul the Food and Drug Administration and
Amtrak, and a bill authorizing a new gold-colored dollar coin and
50 newly designed quarters, one for each state.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, many of the bills that Congress never finished
this year will eventually become law before the 105th Congress
closes next fall prior to national elections.
</P>
<P>
Major achievements of this session included the balanced-budget
and tax-cut acts and the Senate's confirmation of the Chemical
Weapons Convention.
</P>
<P>
But of the first 10 House bills this year, which involved some
top Republican priorities on labor, public housing, youth crime,
education, banking and immigration issues, only one -- changing
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act -- became law.

NEW YORK, November 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) today announced that the explosion of TWA
Flight 800 in July 1996 was not caused by any criminal act.
</P>
<P>
"Following 16 months of unprecedented investigation...we must
now report that no evidence has been found which would indicate
that a criminal act was the cause," FBI's Assistant Director James
Kallstrom told a press conference with families of victims looking

The TWA's jumbo jet exploded in midair off the Long Island
coast, New York, on its way to Paris on July 17, 1996. All of its

to be one of the largest criminal investigations in the U.S.
history.

The FBI's conclusion leaves the investigation in the hands of
the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board., which has
scheduled public hearings next month.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends More Warplanes to Gulf Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States will send
six B-52 bombers and six F-117 stealth fighters to the Gulf region
in an attempt to pressurize Iraq to reverse its decision of
expelling U.S. weapons inspectors, The Pentagon said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton also authorized Gen. Anthony Zinni,
commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East to deploy an air
expeditionary force of about 30 additional fighters and B-1
bombers to the region if necessary, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the B-52 bombers and Stealth fighters would be
accompanied by four KC-136 aerial refueling tankers and other
support aircraft. The armada would join some 300 U.S. warplanes
already in the region, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the Clinton administration decided to build up its
air force in the region because of Iraq's recent offensive
posture that threatened allied flights.
</P>
<P>
"We are reacting in part to a grave threat we spot in the
area," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
"What we have seen is extremely active activity by (Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's) air defense system, more active today
than before he invaded Kuwait (in 1990)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said there was a lot of movement of Iraq's
anti-aircraft missile batteries on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"The offensive efforts, we say, are primarily directed at our
aircraft and that's what concerns us most," he added.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the warplanes in the Gulf was decided by
Clinton during his meeting with his military and diplomatic
advisors on Tuesday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Berger, Clinton's national security advisor, said
after the meeting that the beefing up of the American forces in
the Gulf region was "deemed necessary by the president."
</P>
<P>
He said the increase of the aircraft was a precautionary step,
not a signal that a military clash was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military already has a potent force of more than 250
Air force and Navy airplanes and 22 warships in the Gulf and Red
Sea within striking distance of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
About 150 of the planes are in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and
another 100 on the aircraft carriers Nimitz and George
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The George Washington, ordered by Clinton to move to the Gulf
from the Mediterranean last week, is currently moving south in
the Red Sea and will enter the Gulf later this week to join the
Nimitz.
</P>
<P>
The F-117 stealth fighters are little bat-wing planes that
fly at night and avoid radar detection. They dropped
laser-guided bombs with devastating effect against targets in
Baghdad and around Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
B-52 bombers were used during the 1996 strikes on Iraq to
fire low-flying Tomahawks missiles guided by computer chips and

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Greece Favors Gradual Rapprochement With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece was in favor of
gradually improving its relations with neighboring Turkey, Greek
Prime Minister Costas Simitis said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a foreign press association luncheon, Simitis
outlined the initial steps which he said needed to be taken by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
First, he said, Turkey must withdraw its claims to the
uninhabited islet of Imia and refer any claims it might have to
the International Court of Justice in the Hague. In return, Greece
would okay the release of the European Union (EU) financial
protocol, he added.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the question of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea could also be referred to the International Court of Justice
in the Hague, he said.
</P>
<P>
Greece backed Turkey's European orientation, he said, adding
that the condition was Turkey should respect European principles
and values.
</P>
<P>
He said that given the opportunity he would meet with his
Turkish counterpart, Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
During the first Balkan summit meeting in Crete early this
month, Yilmaz invited Simitis to visit Turkey and the latter
accepted the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Greek-Turkish relations have been strained for decades over
their disputes in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Currently, both sides are trying hard to improve their
bilateral ties, but no substantial progress has been made.
