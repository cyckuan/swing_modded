BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The 2.10-meter tall Bateer
scored 22 points and grabbed 15 rebounds to lead Beijing Ducks to
a 96-74 win over the visiting Sichuan Pandas in the sixth round of
Chinese Basketball Division one League here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, who finished third last season, had only two victories
so far this season and remained winnless on the road, slipping to
the seventh place in the league standings.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Dong, 21, was Sichuan's top scorer with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
"They played smartly as a team," Sichuan's head coach Yang Ming
said. "We made two many errors and fouls. Above all, our center
cannot match Bateer."
</P>
<P>
In Jinan, defending champion Bayi Rockets maintained their
unbeaten record after overwhelming hosts Jinan Amry 127-90.
</P>
<P>
Last season's fifth placer Shandong Flaming Bulls fought back

wins and one loss.
</P>
<P>

difficult situation before the game since we have lost four
matches in the last five rounds. So we went all out."
</P>
<P>
Shenyang's coach Xuan Chengbin said it was the failure in
rebounds that costed their win. "Anyway, we have tried our best,"
Xuan added.
</P>
<P>
In Shenyang, Liaoning Hunters scored a comfortable 85-67 win
over Jiangsu Nangang, who was led by last season's MVP Hu Weidong.

<HEADLINE> Private Airline Companies in Greece Burdened by Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The entire scene surrounding
Greece's privately-owned airline companies is changing, with
companies burdened heavily by debt and many heading towards
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
According to local Greek daily "To Vima" (The Tribune) today,
Venus airline has become the latest entry on the casualty list,
following the transport and communication ministry's decision to
revoke the company's operating licence.
</P>
<P>
The decision to revoke Venus Airline's licence was based on the
financial woes faced by the company. The airline has reportedly
been unable to pay its dues to the Civil Aviation Authority (YPA)
and national carrier Olympic Airways. Furthermore, the airline's
personnel is said to have laid charges to state labour authorities
seeking unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
As a result of Venus Airline's debt, estimated at seven billion
drachmas (about 300 million U.S. dollars), company officials have
been banned from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
Another private airline company Apollo Airlines is also in deep
financial problem and has been forced to cancel flights and
reorganize flight schedules.
</P>
<P>
Problems surfaced at Apollo following the company's inability
to pay France's Sogerma 70 million drachmas (290,000 U.S. dollars)
for technical maintenance services rendered. The French company
has since stopped providing its services, and as a result Apollo's
fleet has been grounded.
</P>
<P>
Air Greece, also in narrow financial straits, has been placed
under the supervision of YPA, following its failure to increase
its equity capital.
</P>
<P>
The problems dragging down Greece's small privately-owned
airlines seem to be the result of bad choices of executive staff,
fleet and inadequate feasibility studies prior to the firms'
launching. Furthermore, intense competition and the subsequent
price war which has narrowed profit margins to a bare minimum, is
also adding to the problems confronted.

<HEADLINE> Factional Fighting in Medina Kills 23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between followers of
Hussein Mohamed Aidid and militiamen of Osman Hassan Ali Atto in
Medina and Bosnia neighborhoods here has raged into the fourth day
today.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses in Medina district told Xinhua that more than 23
unidentified bodies were seen in the main market area where the
heaviest clash was fought in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
However, other sources said at least 40 people were killed
yesterday and nearly 100 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
As fighting is escalating today, the death toll is rising
incredbly. Three mortar rounds have landed in three different
locations in the supermarket of Bakara, killing over 30 people,
including nine men.
</P>
<P>
At first Aidid's forces beat those of Ali Atto, using dozens of
bbattle wagons to occupy about 70 percent of the territory, but later
Atto's militiamen curbed the attacks with fresh reinforcement who
used heavy wagons and anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
The nightmare is going on with an exchange of heavy shellings
between the rival sides in Medina in a bid to gain new territories.
</P>
<P>
Observers here predict it is possible that the faction of Ali Mahdi
Mohamed from North Mogadishu might deploy his militiamen
along the green line dividing the war-torn capital. enditem

<HEADLINE> Blair Pledges to Resist Franco-German Domination of EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Labor
Party leader Tony Blair has rejected Tory claims that he would be
a "soft touch" in Europe, declaring a Labor government would
resist Franco-German domination of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
He told the Observer newspaper Saturday that he wanted Britain
to head a group of EU countries wishing to make the union a
genuine partnership.
</P>
<P>
"We will not give up any veto on tax, defense, social security
and a range of other issues," he insisted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC radio today, he also vowed to keep the veto on
immigration and border controls.
</P>
<P>
As the EU leaders' two-day summit ended Saturday in Dublin,
Prime Minister John Major claimed that Labor would surrender
Britain's power to veto Brussels laws "in a large number of areas"
and "keep the veto, if anywhere, in very tiny areas".
</P>
<P>
But Blair hit back, saying that EU leaders "find it difficult
to negotiate with Britain now because its government is so worried
by its internal divisions".
</P>
<P>
A Labor government committed to Europe could slow the excessive
Franco-German drive to greater integration, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair also stressed his opposition to Franco-German efforts to
impose their vision of an inner and outer core for Europe.
</P>
<P>
"What must not happen is a few large countries trying to direct
the whole agenda of Europe at the expense of the rights and
concerns of others," Blair added.

smashed a marijuana ring in southern United States and arrested 79
people, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The drug ring operating along the U.S. Mexican border smuggled
more than 100 tons of marijuana across the boder over the last
decade and sent it to at least nine U.S. states, the report said.

<P>
The federal officials said that they broke up the drug ring and

smuggling show that the increasing importance of the Mexican
border as a means of trafficking all kinds of drugs into the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Leaders Reiterate Determination To Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- In a counter-reaction to
the Palestinian leaders' call for fight against Jewish
settlements, Israeli leaders today reiterated their determination
to expand the settlements.
</P>
<P>
Following the Israeli cabinet's decision Friday to grant
priority to expanding Jewish settlements, the Palestinian
Authority (PA) strongly condemned the move as "a declaration of
war against" the peace process. The PA leadership Saturday called
on Palestinians everywhere to confront settlement activities to
defend their own land.
</P>
<P>
But some media reports quoted Israeli officials as saying that
the cabinet's settlement decision, made after the Wednesday
militants' attack near Ramallah that killed a Jewish mother and
her son, was no more than a gesture and would not be carried out
in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reports, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu today flatly denied he had sent messages to the
U.S. and the European Union pledging that Friday's decision was
only a declaration.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Israel Radio, Netanyahu also
charged the PA for having been planning violence for weeks before
the Wednesday attack. His remarks echoed the intelligence
assessment presented at the security meeting that Netanyahu
convened after the Wednesday attack.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai repeated
the government's resolve to push forward its policy of expanding
Jewish settlements in the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
After holding a meeting with Jewish settlers, including Yoel
Tzur, the husband and father of the victims of the Wednesday
attack, Mordechai said today that the government would allow the
building of new houses in the existing settlements.
</P>
<P>
The minister claimed that such moves should not affect the
peace negotiations with the Palestinians. "In the same time, we
are going to negotiate," said Mordechai, adding that Israeli
government is asking PA President Yasser Arafat to continue
peace talks to seek peace and agreement between Palestinians and
Jews living in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The tension between the two sides has been on the rise
following the Wednesday drive-by attack, fueling the fear about
the outbreak of new Israeli-Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's attack was carried by the Popular Front for the
Leberation of Palestine, a Damascus-based radical Palestinian
group opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. It has
carried out five other similar extremist attacks in Israel
before.
</P>
<P>
Recent developments have also cast further shadow over the
already deadlocked peace negotiations over Israeli troop pullback
from the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in the Hebron talks have
not even met in the past week, dashing the hope that a deal
could be wrapped up before the upcoming Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Announce Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co. and McDonnell
Douglas, the two aerospace giants of the United States, announced
a big merger here today, creating the world's largest aeropsace
company.
</P>
<P>
The deal in a stock swap could reach 11 billion U.S. dollars,
and the combined giant would have annual sales of 48 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The combined company under Boeing's name would be headquartered
in Seattle and McDonnell Douglas would continue to operate under
its own name as a major division of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in a news conference this noon and
comes two weeks after the two rival companies said they would join
hands on next generation wide-body commercial airplane projects.
It also follows a key Pentagon decision that excluded McDonnell
Douglas from the competition to build the new Joint Strike
Fighter. Boeing, one of two finalists for the fighter, could be
seeking to tap McDonnell Douglas' expertise with such aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Seattle-based Boeing Co. is the world's largest commercial
airplane producer. Last year, the company, with a total employment
of 105,000, earned the annual revenues totaling 19.5 billion U.S.
dollars and a profit of some 393 million dollars. Meanwhile, St.
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, the world's third largest commercial
airplane maker following Boeing and Europe's Airbus has a working
force of 63,600, earned sale revenues amounting to 14.3 billion
dollars and a profit of some 416 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Such a big merger would require federal government approval.

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary Visits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind arrived here this afternoon for a two-day
official visit to discuss the Cyprus problem with the two
communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
He was met at Larnaca International Airport by his Cypriot
counterpart Alecos Michaelides, who returned to Cyprus in the
afternoon from Dublin, where he represented Cyprus in meetings
of the European Union summit.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind will have a working breakfast Monday with Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides at the Presidential Palace in
Nicosia, and later on he will cross into the Turkish-controlled
northern part of the island to meet Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cyprus News Agency Saturday, Rifkind
said he came to Cyprus to "demonstrate at a political level the
UK's determination to support the UN's efforts to achieve an
early settlement to explore the positions of both sides and to
form my own assessment of how best the UK can contribute to
progress".
</P>
<P>
He also said that Britain will make efforts to find a
solution to the Cyprus problem before the start of membership
talks between the European Union and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind's visit is the first by a British foreign secretary
since 1960 when the island, a former British colony, became an
independent republic, apart from a visit by his predecessor
Douglas Hurd during a Commonwealth meeting in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Greece and Turkey were the guarantors of Cyprus'
independence under the 1960 treaty of establishment of the
Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
and took control of the northern part of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state have been held on

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- South African Police
Commissioner George Fivaz said in Pretoria today that he intended to
double the number of detectives working to expose crime within the
police force and criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
The fact-finding team will be headed by Transvaal
Attorney-General Jan D'oliviera in Pretoria, fivaz said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a report which said three senior police officials
were arrested on Fridaty for murder, Fivza said a sequence of
reports about purge in police force identified improvement of
anti-corruption efforts by police.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that to make punishment of dishonest officials
will not only protect the reputation of innocent policemen, but also
change a mistaken idea that the South Arican police Services or the
entire criminal justice system are inherently corrupt.
</P>
<P>
However, Fivaz warned that the latest exposure of police
corruption is only the tip of the iceberg, and numerous probes of
criminal cases among policemen are still under way throughout the
country.

<HEADLINE> Flexible Workforce Fails to Boost Job Market, Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Reforming employment law so
that firms have more freedom to hire and fire may not be the way
to tackle Europe's unemployment problem, according to a new
research by a top economic think-tank.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, job protection led to more employment, not
less, said the study released here today, by the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research.
</P>
<P>
Julian Morgan, who conducted the research, said firms having
more freedom to hire and fire could even make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
The survey asked firms in Germany, France, Italy, the UK, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Greece for their opinions of the
employment restrictions they faced.
</P>
<P>
These included rules covering minimum notice, severance pay,
unfair dismissal and statutory requirements to negotiate
redundancies with unions.
</P>
<P>
The study found that restrictions on firms' ability to fire
workers tended to discourage them from taking on staff in a
recovery. But job protection also acted as a deterrent to firms
firing people during a recession.
</P>
<P>
"We also found evidence that employment protection can affect
the long-run level of employment, with higher levels of protection
being associated with higher employment," said Morgan.
</P>
<P>
"This suggests that the role of job protection in reducing
firing is more important than its deterrent effect on hiring," he
added.
</P>
<P>
But Morgan cautioned against concluding that employment
protection was necessarily economically beneficial.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Celebrates First Shipment of Oil Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today held a ceremony in
southern city of Basrah celebrating the export of the first
shipment of Iraqi oil to the world market since more than six
years of embargo.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice-President Taha Yassin Ramadan attended the ceremony
on behalf of President Saddam Hussein and pressed the button
turning on the pumping station at the Rumaylah oil field at 11:00
a.m. (0800 GMT).
</P>
<P>
It marks the flow of the first shipment of Iraqi oil to the
Bahamas-registered Star Africa oil tanker docked at al Bakr
terminal since the U.N. imposed crippling sanctions on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
It is said a second tanker will be loading oil Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid identified the buyers
of the oil loaded on the tankers as two U.S.-based oil
companies, Coastal Petroleum and Bay Oil.
</P>
<P>
Most oil exports from Iraq are carried by a pipeline to Turkey
that was opened in the northern city of Kirkuk last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal signed between Iraq and the
U.N. in May this year, Iraq is allowed to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil in six months, or 700,000 to 800,000
barrels of oil each day.
</P>
<P>
The revenue will be used to compensate war victims, pay for
U.N. weapons monitoring and import badly needed food, medicine
and other humanitarian items for its sanction-hit population.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the oil pact is considered helpful to
alleviate hardships of Iraqi suffering from more than six years
of U.N. embargo.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, US to Discuss Arrangement for New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish and U.S. military
officials are expected to meet in Ankara Tuesday to discuss new
arrangements to replace the Operation Provide Comfort (OPC),
which will expire on December 31, a high-ranking Turkish official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted the official,
who asked not to be named, as saying that the Turkish side
would propose that a new air reconnaissance force, including
U.S., French, British and Turkish forces, would be set up to
monitor northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish military delegation headed by Deputy Chief of General
Staff Cevik Bir and diplomats of the U.S. embassy in Ankara will
hold talks on the establishment of the new force.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the monitoring force would include only
aircraft, without ground forces. He added that the number of the
aircraft involved should be as small as possible.
</P>
<P>
The OPC force, made up of the four countries'
forces, was established in line with a Turkish parliamentary
decision made on January 17, 1991, and deployed at the Incirlik
air base of Adana, southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It was designed to provide air protection to the Kurds
living in northern Iraq against any possible action by the
Iraqi government in the wake of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has voiced his
opposition to the extension of the OPC mandate in view of the
recent developments in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China-Made Household Electrical Appliances Still Dominate Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese brand household
electrical appliances are dominating the country's market, a
survey revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign brands have mostly conquered the film, soft drink, and
coffee markets, according to a survey jointly conducted by the
State Statistics Bureau and the Central Viewer Survey &AMP; Consulting
Center of China Central Television (CCTV).
</P>
<P>
The survey questioned 5,170 households in Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and 29 other major and medium-sized cities about their
spending habits this summer and autumn.
</P>
<P>
The results show that 90 percent of Chinese households have a
ready store of instant noodles, suggesting that fast food has
become popular as a result of more hectic lifestyles. More than 70
percent of the households questioned often buy soda water, soft
drinks and bottled water. Last year, only 40 percent of the
respondents said they bought these drinks.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that China has 213 domestic brands of each
type of consumption goods this year, 181 more than the figure
reported in 1995.
</P>
<P>
There are 495 brands of shirts in China, the largest total of a
single type of goods, and 13 brands of film, the smallest.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that markets for soft drinks, soda
water, sausages, diet and health food and noodles have reached a
stage where a few brands are dominant.
</P>
<P>
Coca Cola controls 75.18 percent of the Chinese soft drink
market, while Master Kang instant noodles, produced with
investment from Taiwan, take 58.17 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 90 percent of the households questioned own
color TVs, refrigerators and washing machines; about six percent
of the respondents expressed their intention to buy the goods
within a year.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than two percent of the households will buy microwave
ovens and motor bikes. Less than a quarter have bought air
conditioners, and nearly one-fifth have purchased stereos and
motor bikes.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Media Praises China's Efforts to Cool down Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China's recent efforts to
caution zealous stock buyers of the risks involved in investing in
the market have been widely covered by overseas media --
especially organizations in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Major Hong Kong newspapers today carried the main ideas of a
"People's Daily" commentary calling for a correct understanding of
the market, and reported the total sum of new shares listed in
1996 as designated by the State Planning Commission and the
Securities Committee of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Associated Press said China's securities
watchdog has taken measures to check the recent frenzied
speculation on the market, since "the bull run...has worried
market officials who fear some investors are leaping in blind to
the risks of trading. They also have voiced concerns about market
manipulation and other irregular activities."
</P>
<P>
The "Oriental Daily" said that the article will cool
over-speculation. Calling the rhetoric of the commentary harsh,
the paper said that it will help reduce the long-term risks
involved in playing the market.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong Business Times" said the commentary showed that
China's securities watchdogs are closely watching the abnormal
market phenomenon, and are determined to reorganize the market,
which will be advantageous in the long run.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong Economic Daily" noted that the State Planning
Commission and the Securities Committee, in a move to avoid a
market crash, announced the sum of new shares issued in 1996 --
which is double last year's figure -- just as the market began to
drop.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The chief of Pakistan's
Election Commission today announced the schedule for the February
3, 1997 elections of the country's national and provincial
assemblies.
</P>
<P>
In a radio and televised statement, Fakhar-e Alam said that
candidates should file their nomination papers by December 21,
1996, and, if any, withdraw the candidature by January 8, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that the commission would make fool-proof arrangements
for free, fair and transparent elections.
</P>
<P>
Considering that 28 out of the 32 political parties in the
country had suggested holding elections to the national and
provincial assemblies on the same day, the commission has agreed
to do so, which would also reduce the costs of the elections, said
Alam.
</P>
<P>
He urged eligible voters to respect their right and vote for
clean and honest candidates in a joint effort to promote
democracy, prosperity and solidarity of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
On November 5, President Farooq Leghari dismissed the
government of Benazir Bhutto and dissolved the National Assembly.
He then promised to hold fresh elections on February 3.
</P>
<P>
All four provincial assemblies were dissolved and provincial
governments dismissed by their respective governors following the
president's decision.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Outlines Russia's Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said that Russia must pursue an "active" foreign
policy of "a great power" and continue to oppose the expansion of
NATO, the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the news agency to be published in the
Tuesday issue of the newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta, Primakov said
Russia's foreign policy "cannot be that of a second-class state."
</P>
<P>
"We must pursue the foreign policy of a great state. This is
not only because we have the needed traditions and the still
active force of inertia, but because such a policy is optimal for
resolving the problems in Russia," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He has no doubts that Russia will continue to be a great power
due to its huge potential. "Our policy must fully correspond to
this status. This means that it must be active, must be conducted
in every direction, must make a maximum contribution to the
stabilization of the situation in our far-from-simple world,"
Primakov pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said today's Russia lacks a sufficient economic foundation
for her external policy and its military power has diminished as
compared to that of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"We must not give up, nevertheless, our active foreign policy,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the NATO's eastward expansion efforts, Primakov
said Russia continues its opposition to such moves of the Western
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, Moscow is ready to hold dialogue with NATO
in order to minimize the negative impacts.
</P>
<P>
In his words, Russia's attitude to NATO consists of three
points: "We still adhere to a negative stand on NATO's
enlargement, because we believe that this contradicts our
interests, and this belief, of course, is not groundless."
</P>
<P>
"We favor dialogue with NATO, because we realize that this
organization is an existing entity and we must do business with
it," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "The third point is that our purpose in this dialogue
is not merely to maintain some sort of relations with NATO, but to
dispel our concerns and minimize the negative aspects of NATO's
activities for us."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the problem of European security cannot
be solved without the participation of Russia.

<HEADLINE> China Purchases Equipment for Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China today signed a contract
with three foreign companies to buy construction equipment worth
17.82 million US dollars for the much-publicized Three Gorges
Project.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time in 1996 that China has bought
construction equipment for the project, thus bringing the total
contract value of purchased equipment to 135 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The three foreign equipment suppliers are the Mitsubishi
Corporation of Japan, C.S. Johnson of the United States and Potain
S.A of France.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project is one of the world's largest water
conservancy schemes, with a static investment of 90 billion yuan
based on a 1993 calculation or a dynamic investment of 203.9
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that one fourth of the investment will be used to
buy equipment, and 80 percent of the existing equipment was bought
from overseas suppliers.
</P>
<P>
He Gong, vice-president of the China Yangtze Three Gorges
Project Development Corp. (CTGPC), said that the project has been
operating smoothly since it started in 1993, and the second phase
project will begin immediately following the damming next November.
</P>
<P>
He said that a huge dam and factory buildings will be built on
the main navigation course of the Yangtze River during its second
phase construction, and the first group of generating units are
expected to start operation by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said at today's signing ceremony that more
equipment will be purchased through bidding.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Commerce Minister
Cham Prasidh expects his country to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) by the end of 1997, a local newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The English-language Cambodia Daily quoted Cham Prasidh as
saying Sunday that "Cambodia will enter the WTO after the country
joins the ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and
we expect to be a member (of the WTO) by the end of next year."
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks after attending last week's
four-day ministerial meeting in Singapore of the 120-member
international organization, of which Cambodia is an official
observer.
</P>
<P>
"If we are late to join the World Trade Organization, we are
left alone in trade," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has been preparing to join the ASEAN, which groups
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN leaders agreed at an informal summit meeting in Jakarta
on November 30 to extend membership to Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia
simultaneously. But no date was set for their admission.
</P>
<P>
Some ASEAN leaders, including Malaysian Prime Minister
Mhahathir Mohamad, recently said ASEAN will "very likely" grant
membership to the three countries next year.
</P>
<P>
"It is not an easy job to join the World Trade Organization,"
Cham Prasidh stressed. "We need time to negotiate with them."
</P>
<P>
He said that he would have all the necessary documents ready
for WTO membership, including a detailed policy of Cambodian
economics and tax procedures.
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia needs to negotiate with the rich countries before a
bilateral trade will operate," he said, adding he is developing
plans to export local products to the world market and to attract
investment in Cambodia.

<P>
ALMA-ATA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said today that political stability and national unity
are important guarantees for the country's development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering marking the fifth anniversary of the
country's independence, Nazarbayev said that the country has
undergone great changes in every field, and it is now in a
transition from the planned economy to the market one.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan declared independence on December 16, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The president said one of the most important achievements since
independence is that the country has successfully avoided ethnic
clashes during the serious economic crisis and major political and
judicial changes.
</P>
<P>
He added that political stability is also very important, but
such a stability is possible only when it is based on national
unity.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the economy is still in a difficult period and
that not every citizen has benefited from the reforms.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Turkish President Suleyman Demirel also attended the
gathering.

<HEADLINE> Project Launched to Reinforce Qiantang River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China today began the arduous
and expensive job of fortifying the northern embankment of the
Qiantang River in eastern Zhenjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The river is well-known for producing strong tides every year
around August 15 on the lunar calendar, and also for its
once-durable embankments built several hundred years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the aging embankment has endangered the development of
the prosperous industrial area behind it, including the cities of
Hangzhou, Huzhou, Suzhou cities and the the southern part of
Shanghai, which have a total annual industrial output value above
100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony held today, Chai Songyue, deputy governor of
Zhejiang Province, started the five-year project, which will cost
536 million yuan in total investment from the central and Zhejiang
provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
The new 44.7-km embankment is designed to resist any storm
tides as well as typhoons up to force 12 on the Beaufort scale. It
will be built with reinforced concrete bars to replace the wooden
planks that have been there for centuries.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Abida Hussain, the education
 minister of Pakistan's caretaker cabinet, formally tendered her
resignation today after she decided to contest the elections
scheduled for February 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hussain announced her decision at a press conference here this

</P>

Last month, both Pakistani President Farooq Leghari and
caretaker Prime Minister Malik Miraj Khalid said that in order to
ensure the fairness of the elections, members of the caretaker
cabinet should not contest the polls unless they resign.

Hussain, a key member of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz
group), had been in the current caretaker government for six
weeks.
</P>

She was also in Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi's caretaker government in
1990 after Benazir Bhutto had been dismissed as the prime minister
for the first time by the then President Irshaq Khan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press conference, Hussain also praised Khalid
and the current caretaker government for their great efforts to
save the country.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Crude Oil Starts To Be Loaded in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi crude oil through the
Iraqi-Turkish pipeline today started to be loaded into oil
tankers in Yumurtalik (Ceyhan), southern Turkey, following the
over six-year-old embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The loading was carried out under the instructions of Turkish
Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a grand ceremony held in Yumurtalik, Adana, in
celebration of the reopening of the 986-kilometer-long
Kirkuk-Yumurtalik twin pipeline, Erbakan said that Turkey,
together with Iraq and other neighboring countries, will take the
lead in the new world with the development of trade.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Ambassador to Ankara Rafi Dahham Mijwel al Tikriti and
other Turkish high-ranking officials attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
After making speeches at the ceremony, Erbakan and Ciller
together told the Ceyhan petrol terminal through radio: "You
start petrol operation."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi crude oil began to be loaded into the first
150,000-ton tanker Gole waiting offshore near Ceyhan. It will
carry the crude oil to the Aliaga refinery in the western city
of Izmir.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said: "Today is a joyful day not only for Ceyhan or
Adana, but also for the whole Turkey," referring to the reflow
of the Iraqi crude oil in the interest of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey began to struggle for the reopening of the pipeline in
1993, which was closed on August 8, 1990 following the Iraqi
invasion of oil-rich Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said: "We want to use and bring here the total
capacity of the 80-million tons of the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik
pipeline."
</P>
<P>
Turkey now uses only 17 percent of the total capacity of the
Iraqi-Turkish pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly lost 25 billion U.S. dollars due to the
imposition of the trade embargo on Iraq in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under an oil-for-food deal signed between Iraq and the U.N. in
May this year, Iraq is allowed to sell 2 billion dollars worth of
oil in every six months.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Unemployment Rate Rises Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The provisional seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate edged slightly higher to 2.7 percent
for the period of September to November this year, according to
the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The provisional rate remained unchanged at 1.5 percent, a
spokesman of the department said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on these figures, the spokesman said that for the
latest period of September to November 1996, the increase in the
unemployment rate occurred mainly in the restaurant and transport
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said that the unemployment situation in the other major
sectors was broadly stable.
</P>
<P>
Total employment continued to show robust growth, at a faster
pace than total labor force, he said.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the period of
August to October was revised marginally downwards to 2.5 percent,
which was 0.1 percent of a percentage point lower than the
provisional figure released last month.
</P>
<P>
In the three months ending October 1996, total employment had a
further notable increase of 3.2 percent over a year earlier,
while total labor supply grew by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the period of August to October this year, the number of
unemployed persons was estimated at 79,900 while the number of
under-employed persons was estimated at 45,200.

<HEADLINE> Sentences on Five South Korean Business Leaders Commuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul High Court today cut
the sentence on five South Korean tycoons, who had received prison
terms for bribing ex-president Roh Tae-woo.
</P>
<P>
Chung Tae-soo, chairman of Hanbo Business Group, and Lee
Kyung-hoon, president of Daewoo Corporation, were acquitted from
the original sentence of 10 months in prison with a suspension of
two years made by the Seoul District Court on August 26 this year.
</P>
<P>
The jail terms of two or two and a half years imposed in the
August trial on Choi Won-suk, chairman of Dong-Ah Business Group,
Kim Woo-Choong, chairman of Daewoo Business Group, and Chang
Jin-ho, chairman of Jinro Business Group, were suspended.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hyun-woo, former presidential security force chief, and Lee
Won-jo, former National Assembly lawmaker, who were convicted on
charges of arranging bribery for Roh, were also commuted.
</P>
<P>
The original sentences for those defendants involved in former
President Chun Doo-hwan's corruption case were also commuted later
in the day.
</P>
<P>
The court, in explaining the commuted ruling, said that the
primary responsibility for the bribery resides in power and
henchmen, and the businessmen were deeply repentant and have made
great contribution to the nation's economic development.
</P>
<P>
This morning, the Seoul High Court commuted the death sentence
to life imprisonment for Chun and the prison term of 22 years and
six months to 17 years for Roh respectively for the mutiny,
treason and bribery case.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges stemmed from the roles played by
Chun and Roh as well as their cronies in the military coup on
December 12, 1979 and the suppression of the civil uprising in
Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province, on May
18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court also fined Chun 265.7 million U.S. dollars
and Roh 316.6 million U.S. dollars, representing the bribes they
allegedly accumulated while in office.
</P>
<P>
It also commuted the prison terms of 4-10 years to 3.5-8 years
for 13 former South Korean officers, including former First Army
Corps Commander Hwang Young-si, who helped Chun and Roh in their
quest for power.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the nation until
February 1988. He was followed by his friend, Roh, who stepped
down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Since the two former presidents and their followers refused to
admit their crimes in connection with the 1979 and the 1980
incidents, it is most likely that they will appeal the case to
South Korea's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
If the case is brought to the Supreme Court, the country's
highest court will start its deliberation early next year and is
expected to make its judgment around April.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Refugees in Tanzania Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Rwandan
refugees in Tanzania have returned to Rwanda as the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and Tanzania insist, a UNHCR
press release said here today.
</P>
<P>
Today's arrivals reached about 51,200 as of 12:15 p.m. local
time, and at one point, field officers counted as many as 15,000
crossing each hour, said the release.
</P>
<P>
It noted, "90,000 Rwandan refugees have now returned home from
Tanzania since December 1 -- the vast majority over the last
three days."
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, the refugees started flooding back into Rwanda
over the weekend despite an earlier move orchestrated by
extremist forces opposing their return which led them to flee
into the interior.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania announced on December 5 that conditions in Rwanda are
now conducive for people to return in safety and that the 535,000
Rwandan refugees on its soil must go back to their country before
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Since October, massive numbers of refugees from Zaire have
returned peacefully to Rwanda, it noted.
</P>
<P>
As of December 11, UNHCR had registered 474,333 returnees who
had returned to their home communities in Rwanda. The number
comprises about 80-85 percent of those who crossed back into the
country from Zaire, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Before fighting broke out in eastern Zaire in October, UNHCR
cared for 1.2 million refugees in eastern Zaire. And now a
regional summit is being held in Nairobi, Kenya to discuss the
situation of the refugees in the region.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin On Artistic Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, urged
today that efforts be made to carry forward artistic and academic
democracy.
</P>
<P>
In addressing the opening session of the Sixth National
Congress of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles
(CFLAC) and the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Writers'
Association, Jiang asked writers and artists to be unceasing in
their exploratory and creative work.
</P>
<P>
Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of
thought contend is a principle which conforms to the law of
socialist literature and art and helps literature and art
flourish. Literature and art are a sphere that requires the use of
individual creativity to its fullest extent, he said.
</P>
<P>
This "Two Hundreds" principle must give free rein to artistic
and academic democracy and encourage writers and artists to
explore and create.
</P>
<P>
Both the improvement of art and the judgement of the quality or
right and wrong in works of art should not rely on administrative
orders but rely instead on arduous artistic practice and vying on
an equal footing, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary that there be comradely discussions based on
the search for objective laws, safeguarding the interests of the
citizenry as a whole, supporting free development and contention
among different academic and artistic forms and styles, and
providing different academic and artistic viewpoints to achieve a
mutual understanding, and to make up for each person's
deficiencies and to make common progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Literary and artistic comments give a great push to artistic
development, and should play an important role in searching
artistic laws and promoting art and fine works of art, criticizing
mistakes and helping people to distinguish between the real and
fake, good and evil, and beauty and ugliness.
</P>
<P>
Fine literature and artistic creations and scientific comments
are the twins of outstanding writers, artists, and commentators,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Correctly implementing the "Two Hundreds" principle will
effectively improve the guidance for theoretical study and
creation, and promote artistic development and the flourishing of
art.

<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng signed
Decree No. 207 of the State Council here today, appointing Tung
Chee-hwa the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Tung will take office on July 1, 1997. Prior to that date, he
will be responsible for preparing for the establishment of the
first government of the Hong Kong SAR, according to the
stipulations of the Basic Law and the related decision adopted at
the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The decree was signed after the 11th plenary meeting of the
State Council, which was held today in Beijing. Premier Li Peng
presided over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Selection Committee for the first government of the
Hong Kong SAR, which is composed of 400 permanent Hong Kong
residents, elected Tung Chee-hwa the candidate for the first Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong SAR on December 11.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the Hong Kong people have chosen
the executive leader themselves, he pointed out, signaling that
Hong Kong will enter a new era. He congratulated Tung on his
success, and also the smooth operation of the election.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the Basic Law and the NPC's decision,
the candidate for the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR,
once elected, should be reported to the central people's
government for appointment.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR also approved a
report on this issue, he said, noting that this plenary meeting of
 the State Council was held specifically to appoint the first
Chief Executive according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Li said that after discussion, the participants held the
process of choosing the candidate for the first Chief Executive is
democratic, reflects the principles of justice, fairness and
openness, and is completely in accordance with the Basic Law and
the NPC's decision.
</P>
<P>
He noted the appointment is a special and important mission,
because it fully demonstrates the determination and sincerity of
the central people's government to implement "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and a high-degree of autonomy in Hong Kong,
in accordance with the "one country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced his belief that Tung Chee-hwa, after he is
appointed, will contribute to the smooth transition and overall
implementation of the Basic Law in Hong Kong to maintain the
long-term prosperity and stability of the region.

Council Zhu Rongji, Qian Qichen, Li Lanqing, and Jiang Chunyun,

<HEADLINE> Beef Wholesale Prices Increase in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Wholesale prices of all beef
grades go up by 22 percent with effect from today as Zimbabwe's
cold storage company battles to attract more cattle to its
abattoirs ahead of the christmas period in face of shortage.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth significant and the highest price rise this
year where increases have not exceeded 15 percent. Some
butcheries raised their prices at the weekend, saying they could
not absorb the imminent increase.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Zimbabwe Association of Butchers Theo Te Braake
said that although butchers had become used to the seasonal
increases, they did not expect such a big hike.
</P>
<P>
The increase would hit the average income earners hard as
butchers adjusted their prices. Indications were that there would
be a severe shortage of beef in the coming month or two as no
significant efforts had been made to rebuild the cattle herds
which were wiped out during the drought years.
</P>
<P>
Te Braake said, ''i am not trying to create panic among meat
eaters but the situation is really bad.''

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh today called on all government agencies and state
enterprises to spend the national budget economically.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the call here when he was outlining his
government's policy for some 300 top officials from government
agencies and state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, Chavalit stressed that the government is ready to
fully support urgent and important projects while accelerating
efforts to solve social problems, revive the economy and reform
the existing education system.
</P>
<P>
Local media today also said Chavalit noted that programs for
major changes in the 1997 budget would not be introduced as the
budget program has already been in force.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that his government policy statement is quite broad
because of limited time in drafting, Chavalit pointed out that
some points of the previous government and platforms of various
parties have also been included in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Yet he stressed that his government policy statement is in line
with the current political, economic and social situation in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
On political reform, Chavalit emphasized the need to reform the
government bureaucracy to promote administrative efficiency.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government will reduce conflicts and create
better understanding when drafting a new constitution for the
country.

project to foster an elite group of experts who can contribute to
the country's science and technology development in the 21st
century, a senior official with the Ministry of Personnel said
today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Shang Chunbo, vice director of the Department of Experts under
the Ministry of Personnel, said that a total of 683 sci-tech
personnel have passed a nationwide selection process to enter the
project, which was jointly initiated by his ministry and six other
state departments one year ago.

<P>
He said that the project, which is included in the national
plan for science and technology development, aims to attract a
number of outstanding scientists with worldwide prestige by the
end of this century.
</P>
<P>
"We also want to prepare a group of academic and technical
researchers who can lead the country in their own fields for the
coming century," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that all people chosen to participate in the program
are under 45, and already rank among the top researchers in the
country in the natural and social sciences.

"All of them will get preferential treatment for academic or
scientific research funds, acquisition of professional titles,
change of jobs, and living conditions," he noted.

complete system for fostering talents, and will see a powerful
academic group who will take over the older generation's leading
position in the country's key academic and technical fields," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China hopes to promote trade and economic
relations with Hungary in order to usher in a new phase of
bilateral trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting this afternoon with visiting Hungarian Foreign
Minister Kovacs Laszlo, Li also expressed his satisfaction over
the smooth growth of the Sino-Hungarian relationship.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Li said, the two countries have witnessed
constant contacts between their leaders, with increasing exchanges
and cooperation between various departments of the two sides.

"one China" stand concerning the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In regard to bilateral trade and economic relations, Li
stressed that China places importance on its trade ties with
Hungary, which are based on equality and mutual benefit. China
will support and encourage the companies of the two countries,
which are financially powerful and have good credibility, to
increase their contacts and establish direct ties, so that they
can know each other's specific demands for merchandise, and meet
the other's needs accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The premier suggested that to promote bilateral trade ties to a
new level while at the same time expanding trade, the two sides

cooperation, including the establishment of joint ventures.

years, wishes to become China's steady partner in economic
cooperation.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi left here today for Nairobi, Kenya to take part in
the summit of leaders of central African states scheduled to
discuss the crisis in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the foreign ministry quoted by the Ethiopian
News Agency said, the Nairobi summit is expected to reach a
consensus on whether or not to deploy a peacekeeping force to
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the problem in the area is partially
alleviated by the return home of half a million Rwandan refugees
in eastern Zaire, adding that the peaceful return of the
remaining refugees now dispersed in eastern Zaire would be on the
agenda for the summit.
</P>
<P>
He said despite the delay in the implementation of the
decision of the U.N. Security Council, preparations are being
made to deploy troops to the area.
</P>
<P>
He added some countries believe that the establishment of safe
corridors by deploying a peacekeeping force is necessary for the
peaceful return of refugees to their homeland while others say
army deployment is unnecessary because the refugees have already
begun returning home.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi summit is held after the Canadian-led
multinational force in eastern Zaire has received notice from the
United Nations to close down and leave bases in Rwanda and
Uganda.

FREETOWN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Commission for the
Consolidation of Peace with rebel RUF members inside it will hold
its first meeting here on Wednesday, a foreign ministry official
said today.
</P>
<P>
The government ''is in the process of providing office
accommodation'' for the commission whose members include four key
functionaries of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Ibrahim
Deen-Jalloh, Fayia Musa, Commander Philip Palmer and Allie
Bangura, the official who refused to be named, said.

<P>
The commission was set up two weeks after the signing of the
peace agreement which ended nearly six years of bitter fighting
in the west African state.
</P>
<P>
He said, it ''will monitor the peace process and ensure that
there is no violation by either parties.''
</P>
<P>
The commission ''will liaise between President Tejan Kabbah and
Corporal Foday Sankoh (the RUF leader)," said the official.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Revolution
Guards Corps (IRGC) have launched a 10-day military maneuvers
against chemical-biological warfare in Ahwaz, 847 kilometers
southwest of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source said that 51 battalions of the elite
fighters from IRGC participated in the first defensive
maneuvers against the chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the last stage of these maneuvers
are to be held on December 20. Both women and men battalions
of IRGC are taking part in these maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
Women's battalions of IRGC are known as Az-Zahra (the name
of the daughter of Islam's Prophet) and men's battalions are
called Ashura (the day of martyrdom of Prophet's grandson).
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Gorji-Zadeh, Commander-in-Chief of IRGC in Khuzestan
province, said that the maneuvers were focusing on ways to defend
against chemical and biological warfare as part of "the modern
warfare."
</P>
<P>
Defending against chemical warfare has become an integral
part of the military maneuvers in Iran in recent months. Iran
has had first-hand experience in this type of warfare.
Thousands of Iranians were exposed to mustard and cyanide gases
during the Iran-Iraq war between 1980 and 1988.

came from Egyptian exports to Libya, said the Egyptian Trade
Representation Office in Tripoli, capital of Libya.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian exports to Libya are rice, legumes, cakes, fresh and
canned vegetables, dairy products, textiles, leather products,
medicine and chemicals.

convenient and cheaper conditions for the insurance of their
export activities to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The volume of commercial exchange between Italy and Egypt
reached 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1995 and showed a sharp rise

was Egypt's third most important trade partner.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The cable linking the Egyptian and Libyan power
networks will start operating next September as part of a project
to connect electricity grid among some Arab countries.

There has been a booming literature, drama, films, television
programs, music, dance, painting, photography, calligraphy,
acrobatics and folk arts, and literature and art have thrived in
rural areas, in businesses and in military camps, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"This is the result of a shift in the Party's and the country's
central task, and in the implementation of the Party's basic
theory and line, and in the overall socialist modernization
drive," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
It is also the result of carrying on the policy of literature
and art serving the people and socialism, and the policy of
letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought
contend, he said.
</P>
<P>
In promoting cultural and ethical progress, literature and art
have a serious responsibility of providing people with lofty
ideals, moral integrity, a good education and a strong sense of
discipline, and encouraging them to unite and to forge ahead, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The glory of writers and artists is in being engaged in the
splendid cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
keeping pace with the times, marching forward with the motherland
and being the architect of man's soul. This is the fundamental
reason for their getting the support and respect of the people,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The Party and the people strongly believe that our writers and
artists will play a greater role and make a bigger contribution to
China's reforms, opening-up and modernization drive, and to
material and cultural progress and the revitalization of the
Chinese nation," Jiang said.

PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Kofi Annan, the newly-elected
United Nations secretary-general, today expressed his
understanding of France's position during the crisis over the
election of a new U.N. chief, saying that Paris "has taken a
position of principle."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with British, U.S. and French journalists,
including that of the French daily Liberation, Annan said that one
should be fair toward France, who said nothing bad about him
personally throughout the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"All along the crisis, they have never said one negative word
about me and it is very clear to me that it was not my person
which was in dispute. They (the French) have taken a position of
principle," he said.
</P>
<P>
France had threatened to veto an English-speaking candidate for
the seat of U.N. secretary-general, after the United States vetoed
a Security Council nomination of Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a
second term.
</P>
<P>
However, in an apparent yielding to U.S. pressure, France voted
for Annan at last Friday's informal polling in the security
council.
</P>
<P>
Annan also denied that he was elected because the
newly-nominated U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
preferred to have him as the next U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
As for the contribution pay arrears owed by the United States
to U.N., Annan said that he would work with the Clinton
administration and through it, with the U.S. Congress, to solve
the problem.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin On Literature, Art (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese Communist Party
leader Jiang Zemin today called on Party committees at all levels
to strengthen their leadership over literature and art, and to
take this as an important part of promoting ethical and cultural
progress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, general secretary of the Party Central Committee, issued
the call while addressing the opening session of the Sixth
National Congress of the China Federation of Literary and Art
Circles and the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Writers'
Association.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also Chinese president, told the gathering that
the Party has not used the slogan that literature and art are
subordinate to politics since the third Plenum of the Eleventh
National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and that the
practices of the past 18 years have proven that this is correct.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he quoted Deng Xiaoping as noting, "This, of
course does not mean that literature and art can be separated from
politics; it is impossible for literature and art to be separated
from politics."
</P>
<P>
"Politics exists in a concrete way both in our social life and
in the thoughts and feelings of writers and artists," he said,
emphasizing that it is impossible to neglect politics or to keep a
distance from politics, especially when facing the pressure of the
dominant position of Western countries in the economy, and in
science and technology, and when dealing with the infiltration of
Western ideology.
</P>
<P>
In literature and art, he said, it is imperative to adhere to
the Party's basic theory, its basic line, its principles and
policies, and to hold to the correct creative ideas, and create
more outstanding works and to provide the people with good
cultural sustenance.

<TEXT>
<P>
The social effect of literature and art must be taken into
account, Jiang pointed out, and that writers and artists must take
a clear stand against all kinds of decadent cultural influences of
capitalism and the exploiting classes, and oppose any idea or
practice of doing everything for the sake of money, and to
encourage people to work hard for the socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
"This is the fundamental requirement of a writer or an artist
as called for by Marxist politics," he noted, and called for Party
committees at all levels to improve their leadership over
literature and art and to regard that as an important part of
pushing for cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
He said that an effort must be made to help writers and artists
study Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong thought, and Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to
provide favorable conditions for them to penetrate the realities
of life, and to immerse themselves in the people, to improve their
ideological and professional qualities, and to make full use of
their artistic creativeness.
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts should be redoubled in training more
writers and artists to keep up with the times, to love the
motherland and the people, and to perfect their art.
</P>
<P>
Ideological and political work must be improved, as must the
education and supervision of writers and artists who are also
Communist Party members, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Party members who work in literature and art or with related
departments should set an example for others to follow in
ideology, politics, work style, and in going deeper into the
realities of life and immersing themselves in the people, he added.
</P>
<P>
He asked leading officials in literary and art departments,
above all, to learn from writers and artists and to try their best
to become experts or specialists in their field to exercise their
leadership in literature and art in a manner that conforms to the
laws of literature and art.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he pointed out, it is necessary that the
rights and interests of writers and artists be protected and that
they be helped in overcoming difficulties in work, in their lives,
and in their studies.

in order to obtain exclusive marketing rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A favorable response was
recorded as the number of applicants for two of Hong Kong's sports
aid funds registered an increase this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 165 athletes from more than 20 different sports have
applied for the Sports Aid Foundation Fund (SAFF) and Sports Aid
for the Disabled Fund (SADF) for 1997-1998, the Hong Kong Sports
Development Board (SDB) said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The SDB-administered funds were set up to provide financial
assistance to athletes who have the potential, talent and
commitment to achieve success in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.9 million HK dollars (0.5 million U.S. dollars)
generated from the funds was allocated to 103 top athletes in Hong
Kong for their preparation for international competitions in
1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Of the applications received, more than 40 percent are from
disabled athletes, a big increase from last year. This was
believed to be a result of stimulation and encouragement by Hong
Kong's Paralympic team's achievement at this year's Atlanta Games,
according to SDB's Sports Development Manager Margaret Siu.
</P>
<P>
"We think it is very important that financial assistance be
offered to Hong Kong's top athletes to pay for competition expense
 and loss of earnings during the training and competition and this
 is exactly what the SAFF ad SADF are set up for," Siu said.
</P>
<P>
Recipients of the grants will be divided into three categories,
 namely, elite, potential and disabled athletes. The maximum grant
 for each elite athlete is 85,000 HK dollars (10,900 U.S. dollars)
 while that for each potential athlete is 25,000 HK dollars (3,200
 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Fighting Breaks Out at Mogadishu Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Forces of Hussein Mohamed
Aidid and the "Peace AllianceU" of Osman Atto and Ali Mahdi started
fighting bitterly today at the International Airport of Mogadishu
which has been closed since the U.N. left Somalia early in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This latest armed clashes have recommenced after Aidid's
militiamen attempted to take over part of the airport controlled
by Muse Sudi Yalahow, militia commander of Ali Mahdi in Medina
district.
</P>
<P>
At least eight people have died and more than 24 others were
wounded during the clashes in the airport. Eyewitnesses said the
deceased and wounded were all combat militiamen at the field.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid's men have made a considerable advance in the
airport far reaching at the Southern end of the runway which is
attached to the former military training base of Halane.
</P>
<P>
Even though the rapid advance of Hussein Aidid's men was
halted by heavy counter attack from the Median Peace Alliance,
shooting continued with high intensity, forcing people at K-4
junction to flee and avoid the tarmac road which leads to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
Heavy gun fire and mortar exchange also continues at the
Northern front line of Median where the opposing sides are
fighting for the control of Hosh militia base.
</P>
<P>
An armed confrontation along the green line this morning has
also left dead two fighters of Aidid's men while two more were
wounded after a technical vehicle belonging to Ali Mahdi has
sneaked through a checkpoint at the green line and opened fire.
</P>
<P>
The technical vehicle moved back unhurt and the shooting has
subsided even though the situation at the green line remained
volatile.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in Medina and at the airport is likely to spread
to other parts of the capital especially Huriwa district where
the supporters of Ali Mahdi share a common boundary for the Habar
Gidir and Abgal led by Aidid and Ali Mahdi respectively.
</P>
<P>
The four-day fighting in South Mogadishu has claimed the lives
of nearly 100 men, mainly civilians and more than 200 others were
wounded. Radio South Mogadishu supporting Aidid claimed that the
forces of the national army are "cleansing bandits in Medina
neighborhood."
</P>
<P>
In another battlefield, hospital sources said more than 50
people were killed at Bakara market yesterday as it is returning
to normal today.

<HEADLINE> High Investment Return in Central, Western China's Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A noted agricultural economist
with the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations (FAO) said during
an inspection tour here that the prospects for agricultural
investment in central and western China are bright.
</P>
<P>
John Weatherhogg, a 53-year-old agriculturalist, arrived in
Xinjiang, northwest China, in November, together with six of his
colleagues, to confirm the feasibility of a World Bank-financed
agricultural project in this autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview with Xinhua that investors in
agriculture in central and western China are likely to get
unexpected returns.
</P>
<P>
After a 20-day study tour, he concluded that agriculture in
this part of the country is one of the most promising and
profitable industries, if taking input, output and cost-profit
ratio into consideration.
</P>
<P>
China's central and western areas include 18 provinces and
autonomous regions, which account for 86 percent of the country's
population and 58 percent of its total territory.
</P>
<P>
He said that FAO, which specializes in agricultural technical
aid, is undertaking a number of technical projects, including the
transformation of saline-alkali soil and control of
desertification in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
However, Weatherhogg pointed out that the most unfavorable
factor affecting agricultural development in the region is that
farmers there have outdated management concepts, and they depend
too heavily on the state and the collective modes.

<HEADLINE> Literature And Art Congress (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang said that literature and art work is an integral part in
the drive for socialist ethical and cultural progress, and that
both must be done by adhering to the guidelines of Marxism,
Leninism, Mao Zedong thought, and Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"Our current socialist modernization is a great creation with
no predecessor, which promotes the development of our country's
socialist literature and art, by providing excellent conditions
for writers and artists to use their talent to the full," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
He called on writers and artists to delve deep into the
realities of life, to immerse themselves in the lives of the
people, and to learn from reality and the people.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, they can know the process of social development,
and the interests of the people, as well as people's role in the
making of history and the progress of their cultural lives, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that literature and arts should eulogize
heroic times, reflect epic and magnificent realities, and vividly
portray the great reformation of nature and society to its depths
and, in the process, shed light on what is in the people's minds.
</P>
<P>
Writers and artists should fill their works with the lofty
ideas of patriotism, collectivism and socialism, and at the same
time, castigate the worship of money, hedonism, egoism, and other
passive and corrosive practices, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Writers, Artists Are Trustworthy: Jiang Zemin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin stated
today that China's millions of writers and artists can be trusted
by the Chinese Communist Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the statement while addressing the opening session
of the Sixth National Congress of the China Federation of Literary
and Art Circles and the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese
Writers Association.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the new historical period, China's literati and
artists have worked painstakingly, playing a key role in trying to
improve the ideological morals and culture of the whole nation, and in
involving the entire nation in building socialism with Chinese
characteristics with one heart and one mind.
</P>
<P>
"Our writers and artists have helped socialist ethical and
cultural progress, and have met the cultural needs of the people,"
he said, adding: "in general, they are good and trustworthy."
</P>
<P>
He went on to express the hope that writers and artists should
better grasp the essence of life, and learn from the citizenry, in
order to recognize the objective course of social development,
people's interests, and their historical creativity and
ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
"Socialist modernization itself is a vivid historical drama
with tens of millions of people playing a role," he pointed out,
noting that, "Life is like a flowing river, which inevitably has
turbid water and adverse currents. Literature and art must reflect
this magnificent reality, singing the praises of the epoch's
heroes, and reflecting people's practice and feelings in
transforming nature and society in a profound and vivid way."
</P>
<P>
He urged writers and artists to try their best to support
patriotism, collectivism, and socialist ideas in their works and
their performances, and reject the worship of money, pleasure
seeking, egotism, and all decadent and corrupt phenomena in
society.
</P>
<P>
"It is only by linking artistic creation to people's creation
of history, by combining artistic progress with people's
advancement, and by providing people with confidence and the will
to seek progress, that writers and artists can accomplish their
task of encouraging the people with fine works, meeting people's
steadily increasing cultural needs, and uniting the pursuit of the
central theme with the advocation of diversity," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Australia to See Second Largest Wheat Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia's wheat production
is expected to be 21.5 million tons this year, the second largest
for the country, according to the Australian Wheat Board (AWB)
today.
</P>
<P>
"This is a crop that has surprised everyone -- as late as
October the best estimates put the crop size at 19.5 million tons,
now we are within half a million tons of a record crop," AWB, the
main selling body for Australian wheat, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The estimated return for durum wheat 1 and 2 has been lifted by
15 Australian dollars per ton to 255 Australian dollars for type 1
and 240 Australian dollars for type 2 (204 and 192 U.S. dollars
respectively), while the estimate for durum 3 has been lifted by
35 dollars per ton to 220 Australian dollars (176 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Australian Standard White wheat, the benchmark
grade, was still estimated at 185 Australian dollars (148 U.S.
dollars) a ton gross.
</P>
<P>
The board said a sale of 1 million tons to India and the
anticipated resumption of sales to Iraq, along with good sales
already finalized, would underpin the board's present pool
estimate.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of sales already finalized, we'll see shipments
for each of December, January and February break previous monthly
records," Ron Storey, AWB's general manager, said.
</P>
<P>
But Australia would face competition from the northern
hemisphere winter wheat crop next June and July and the state of
the market then would have a significant impact on the final pool
return, he added.

<HEADLINE> Writers, Artists Must Serve People, Socialism: Jiang Zemin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today
called on China's writers and artists to adhere to the cardinal
principle of serving the people and socialism.
</P>
<P>
He issued the call at the opening session of the Sixth
National Congress of the China Federation of Literary and Art
Circles and the the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Writers
Association.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee, said that serving the people and
socialism determines the nature and orientation of China's
literature and art, and opens up bright prospects for the
development and prosperity of China's literature and art, so it is
essential that China's writers and artists adhere to this
fundamental principle in the entire course of the socialist
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sixth Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central
Committee recently adopted "the Decision of the Communist Party of
China Central Committee Regarding Important Questions on Promoting
Socialist Ethnical and Cultural Progress," and this grand
gathering of writers and artists can be seen as an important part
of implementing that decision.
</P>
<P>
In ethical and cultural progress, the leader said, literature
and art are an important part, promoting the cause of helping
training people with lofty ideals, moral integrity, good
education, and a strong sense of discipline.
</P>
<P>
Literature and art also have the solemn responsibility of
inspiring people to unite and work hard. This is a glorious cause
and the root cause for the sake, as well as support and respect of
the masses because writers and artists can use literature and art
to build socialism with Chinese characteristics and they can
advance in step with the times and in unison with the development
of the motherland to become real engineers of the soul of the
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his sincere belief on behalf of the Party and
the people that Chinese writers and artists can play a greater
role in and contribute more to the reforms and opening to the
outside world, to the modernization drive and the development of
material progress and ethical and cultural progress, and to the
all-round invigoration of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He said that socialist ethical and cultural progress, including
literary and artistic development, must follow the guidance of
Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong thought, and Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Mao Zedong Thought is a combination of the essence of Marxism,
Leninism, and China's reality, and is the application and
development of Marxism and Leninism in China, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics inherits and develops Mao Zedong Thought in the
new historical period and it is Marxism developed for modern
China. It is also the fundamental guiding principle for various
kinds of work of the Party in the current new historical period,
as well as the powerful ideological mainstay for the invigoration
of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong thought, and Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics can be
traced back to the same origins, and are therefore a unified
scientific system. The belief in Marxism is the ideological
driving force behind "our cause and the prosperity of
literature and art," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Expects Improvement in Debt Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' performance in
the debt market is expected to improve further next year, with the
sustained stabilization of the peso, a faster growth in the gross
national product (GNP) and a slower growth of the inflation rate,
the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is an assessment made by Joycelyn Tanada, vice president
and financial chief officer of the All Asia Capital and Trust
Corporation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The country posted a 7.1-percent GNP growth rate in the first
three quarters this year and a record low inflation rate of 4.4
percent in September, declining from double digits early this
year.
</P>
<P>
Tanada said foreign investors have been showing greater
enthusiasm for Philippine debt issues because of some good records
of Philippine corporate issuers accessible to the Eurobond market.
</P>
<P>
She said there have been some improvements in domestic and
international settlements of peso bonds and debt issues.
</P>
<P>
Debt indicators also showed that various government securities,
such as treasury bills, floating rate treasury notes and fixed
rate treasury notes, have been faring well, said Tanada.
</P>
<P>
However, she noted that despite the country's positive mood in
the debt market, a number of issues have yet to be resolved to
sustain its growth potentials.
</P>
<P>
These issues are enhancing the liquidity by way of fostering a
more active debt market and the rationalization of tax measures
including the comprehensive tax reform package, she said.

</P>
<P>
The general budget revenue up to the end of October this year,

<HEADLINE> Minister Says: Opening China's Markets Should Be Gradual Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Wu Yi, in speaking about
international trade today said, "On the issue of China's entering
the World Trade Organization (WTO), demanding the opening of
China's markets too wide is unrealistic, and a transitive process
is rather more practical."
</P>
<P>
The comment came in a meeting with Canada's Minister of
International Trade Arthur Eggleton. During the meeting, Wu
explained that the opening of China's markets "must take stability
and prosperity in the Chinese economy as a prerequisite" and that
only with the development of the economy can China provide a
larger trade and investment market.
</P>
<P>
Eggleton is the first foreign trade minister to visit China
after the ministerial-level WTO Conference in Singapore. During
that conference, trade officials from the United States, the
European Union, and Japan discussed China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
In briefing Wu on that discussion, Eggleton said that there was
a unanimous agreement by the United States, Canada, the European
Union, and Japan that China should join the WTO as soon as
possible. The four, he added, are of the view that the negotiation
process should be accelerated, but they insisted that China must
abide by the common multi-lateral rules.
</P>
<P>
In the 10 years since China applied for restoration of its
membership in GATT, the predecessor of the WTO, China has made an
enormous effort, participating in the Uruguay rounds of talks, and
signing the final documents. This indicated that China was willing
to meet its obligations as a developing country as described in
the agreement, "Therefore, none of the signatory parties should
have any worries about China," Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
The discussion of China's entering the WTO centers on how wide
China will allow its market to open but a common acknowledgement
has been reached through the 10-year negotiations, that a
transitive method should be taken to settle the issue. "This
attitude is one of deriving truth from facts," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to China's economic development and the gradual
integration of its economy with the rest of the world, China's
entering the WTO is a necessary and natural development, and
during that process, China will not change its reform and
opening-up policies, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral trade issues, the two ministers agreed to take
steps to raise economic cooperation to new heights on the basis of
equality and mutual benefits.

principle for the entire socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>

Party of China (CPC) Central Committee led by Jiang Zemin, who is
the committee's General Secretary, and are expected to carry on
the past tradition and pave the way to the future, drawing the

and artists got fresh vitality, and middle-aged writers and
artists, and outstanding younger ones have appeared," Jiang
commented.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Claims Victory at WTO Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has announced an
all-round victory at the recent World Trade Organization (WTO)
ministerial meeting in Singapore, as its senior officials claimed
the meeting's final declaration reflects its position on every
issue.
</P>
<P>
Thai Commerce Minister Narongchai Akraseni said the declaration
does not set specific rate cuts on information technology
products, which is in line with Thailand's insistence on a
flexible global deal on the issue.
</P>
<P>
On the labor standard issue, the WTO declaration stresses the
need to prevent the abuse of labor standards for protectionism and
affirms that the International Labor Organization is the competent
body to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
That is exactly what Thailand advocates, said Narongchai, who
accompanied Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan to the
five-day inaugural WTO meeting in Singapore last week.
</P>
<P>
Narongchai said Thailand's hope for an effective integration of
textile products into the WTO was reflected in the final document
which stresses the importance of such integration in order to open
more markets.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also calls for the spare use of "safeguard"
measures and suggests that the textile monitoring body work with
greater transparency and make rational recommendations, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the investment issue, Narongchai said his country hoped for
no agreements on investment, competition policy and government
procurement and this goal was achieved as the WTO only agreed to
set up working groups to oversee the issues.
</P>
<P>
Krirk-Krai Jirapaet, Thai ambassador to the WTO, also said the
consensus reached among WTO members in setting up three working
groups to study the transparency of government procurement
procedures, relation between trade and investment and interaction
of trade with competition policy, was a major victory of
developing members over powerful ones.
</P>
<P>
On agricultural products, Narongchai said Thailand wanted WTO
members to build up momentum on the products next year in
preparation for new rounds of negotiations on them.
</P>
<P>
Although the declaration did not include the Thai position, WTO
members have agreed to step up analysis and exchange of
information on the issue next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, some other Thai officials were not so satisfied with
the Singapore meeting, saying Thailand did not get everything it
wanted.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that Thailand did not accomplish its objective
of completely cutting the linkage between labor issues and trade.
</P>
<P>
They added that Thailand actually got nothing on the textile
issues because there was no commitment from importing countries to
removing controls on the restricted popular items.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's joint efforts with other WTO members that export
farm products also failed to make other member countries highlight
the importance of these products, they said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Calls Himself Physically Fit to Run State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today described himself as "very much physically and
mentally fit" to run the country until he finishes his six-year
term on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the assurance after he was told by Philippine Stock
Exchange President Vitaliano Nanagas that the performance of the
country's stock market was affected when he was hospitalized
Thursday night after suffering "a viral infection."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I even got a call from London asking about your
health condition," Nanagas told Ramos during a meeting at the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) building here.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who checked out of the Makati Medical Center here on
Sunday, was attending the celebration of the 60th anniversary of
the foundering of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Nanagas said people from the stock market gave a sigh of relief
upon learning that President Ramos got a clean bill of health and
the doctor's clearance to leave the hospital on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Ramos denied rumors that he had suffered a mild
stroke or a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Hector Villanueva said on Sunday that Ramos was
"amused and alarmed and a bit disappointed" over reports that he
had a mild stroke or a heart attack when he was only "overfatigued
rather than anything else."

<HEADLINE> Abacha Calls for Reforms in U.N., IMF, World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Sani Abacha has called for the reform of the U.N., the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in order to redressing
the injustice against developing member countries.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in Abuja in a 44-page address delivered at
the annual patron's dinner of the Nigerian Institute of
International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, he remarked, considered the United Nations too
important to be left in the hands of a section of the
international community to dominate.
</P>
<P>
Abacha said Nigeria has lent its full support to the ongoing
efforts to reform the global body to make it more responsive to
the contemporary challenges and better equipped to serve the
interests of all its 184 members.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, he said, the reform of the Security
Council, the organ responsible for the maintenance of
international peace and security, is of crucial importance.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "a compelling necessity exists for the
membership of the council to be expanded at both the permanent
and non-permanent levels" and that "its membership should be made
more representative of the various regions of the world."
</P>
<P>
He also said the drive for transparency and reform of the UN
system would not be complete without a simultaneous reform of the
international economic and financial institutions, particularly
the World Bank the the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"Like the U.N., these financial institutions were established
at a time when a majority of the developing countries were not
independent. Consequently, even till today, these countries have
been marginalized in the control and management of these
institutions, with little prospects for redress," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria believes that only a thorough and comprehensively
reform which takes fully into account the peculiar interests of
all members, will adquately rectify existing imbalances within
these institutions," He added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Privatize Airlines, Railways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
decided to privatize the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and
railways in the country, Chairman of the Privatization Commission
Salman Shah said today.
</P>
<P>
"On the request of the government, a team from the
International Finance Corporation has arrived and they will be
giving us reports on the proposed privatization of the PIA in the
next couple of days," Shah told local reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the restructuring of the PIA would be carried out on
IFC reports. "We are moving quickly in that direction," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Golden handshakes will be offered to laid-off employees of
over-staffed organizations under privatization, he added.
</P>
<P>
The process, which is in its infancy, may take between six to
nine months to complete.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to package the whole process in a very
attractive fashion as being a national asset, it cannot be done
overnight," said Shah.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not foresee any reversal of this process even
with a change in the government after the next elections, as
privatization is now a trend worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere you look, the governments are getting out of
business which can be done by the private sector in a more
efficient manner. Public sectors are not good at carrying out
such services," he said.
</P>
<P>
The work on the privatization of the Pakistan Railways, another
public sector organization heavily burdened by huge staff, still
awaits cabinet approval, Shah said.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring plan includes setting up an autonomous
Railway Board which supervises four "economic units" -- the
Infrastructure, the Passenger Traffic, the Freight Traffic and the
Manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Shah complained that decision making has been rather slow in
the process because of the "excessive government control" and the
"non-commercial attitude."

<HEADLINE> HongkongBank Forecasts 5.2 percent GDP Growth for HK in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will enjoy a real
gross domestic product (GDP) rise of 5.2 percent in 1997,
according to an economic forecast released today by HongkongBank's
Economic Research Unit.
</P>
<P>
The projected growth rate compares favorably with the
4.6-percent expansion expected in 1996. The inflation forecast for
next year is 6.8 percent, slightly higher than the projected
6-percent growth for 1996.
</P>
<P>
George Leung, economic adviser of HongkongBank, said
consumption-led expansion is expected to drive the territory's
economic growth in 1997. The local stock and property markets'
positive outlook will help stimulate consumer spending, along with
anticipated higher tourist income derived from Hong Kong's
handover to China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"While domestic demand is expected to revive strongly, the
territory's external sector should also improve upon this year's
unsatisfactory performance. Capital investment will remain buoyant
on the back of ongoing infrastructure projects, with the added
impetus of increased property construction," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that improvement should be seen in Hong Kong's
external sector next year, although the pace of recovery might be
slow. However, he expects the overall impetus for trade growth to
be mild in 1997, with a continuous structural shift taking place
simultaneously in the external sector.
</P>
<P>
The upward pressure on prices in 1997 is expected to be higher
than this year, mainly due to stronger consumer spending, he
said. "The factors underlying lower inflation in 1996 are unlikely
to be seen again in 1997."

with poorest telephone service in the world, is to increase its
number of telephone to 300,000 by 6.5 times within six years, a

person, ''the Monitor'' paper quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that telephone communication in Uganda
concentrated in urban areas, leaving the rural areas poorly
served, adding that out of four pay telephone, there are three in
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Only one percent of the people in Uganda who have their own

her country is studying Malaysia's experience in privatizing the
telecommunications sector to further develop its own privatization
program.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, which will start the second phase of
telecommunications privatization next year, can gain from the
Malaysian experience, Mujuru told reporters here after she was
briefed on Malaysia's telecommunications development by her
counterpart, Leo Moggie.
</P>
<P>
Mujuru, who arrived here last Friday leading a seven-member
delegation for a week-long visit, said that currently, Zimbabwe's
main telecommunications services are still government-owned, but
the country has started privatizing its cellular
telecommunications service.
</P>
<P>
The delegation already visited several Malaysian private
telecommunications companies including the Measat Broadcast System
Network.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Tackle Poverty, Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti has announced plans for executing a 400 million
Jordan dinars (about 550 million U.S. dollars) worth of social
security package program to help the needy groups.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting here Sunday on government's strategy to
combat poverty and increase productivity, the prime minister said
the purpose of the meeting was to review progress in ensuring a
social security network which the government had committed to
setting up last August, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said the concerned group of officials was instructed
to design the social security package and to find the necessary
funds from local and external sources for its implementation from
the beginning of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The basic components of the strategy, he said, are the
following:
</P>
<P>
-- Training of the poor.
</P>
<P>
-- Social help which entails financing small-size projects.
</P>
<P>
-- Improving the infrastructure in poor areas and refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
-- Expanding the base of beneficiaries of the National Aid
Fund to guarantee a decent living for them.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the program aims not only to alleviate the
consequences of poverty and unemployment but also to address
their underlying causes so that Jordanian citizens can lead a
decent life and participate in the country's social, economic and
political life.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the poverty rate in Jordan rose from 3 per
cent to 15 per cent and unemployment soared to 25 per cent in the
wake of the Gulf War, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the average per capita income
was now below the 1985 level and many Jordanians were still
suffering from poverty and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"Since development does not run in harmony with poverty and
unemployment, the government is determined to implement a
strategy on social security net at the cost of 400 million Jordan
dinars and will give it priority over other issues," he said.

motion against the coalition government, was adjourned today for
five days soon after it was convened.
</P>
<P>

withdrawal from the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>

<P>
CAIRO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Newly-appointed Israeli
Ambassador to Egypt Zvi Mazel arrived here Sunday night to assume
his post amid growing tensions between Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mazel, a 57 year-old diplomatic veteran and African Affairs
Director at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, replaced David Sultan
who returned home in August.
</P>
<P>
His appointment came at a time when the two countries stepped
up a tit-for-tat verbal warfare against each other over the
impasse in the long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from the West
Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, at one point, has even threatened to shelve diplomatic
normalization as a result of the Israeli government's policy of
expanding Jewish settlements on occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab country to make peace with the Jewish
state in 1979, but relations remained cool over the years.
</P>
<P>
Ties strained after Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's
Likud government took power in June and over the deadlocked
Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Announces Two Acts to Free Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos granted here today a self-regulatory body status to the
Philippine Stock Exchange, an act to further free the country's
capital market.
</P>
<P>
The act, which was enforced on the 60th anniversary of the
Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), will enable the PSE to adopt a
code of conduct to govern its activities besides installing a
surveillance system to monitor stock market transactions.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the president also handed the same license to
the Philippine Central Depository Inc., allowing it to operate a
central depository system that will speed up the clearing of
transactions and pave the way for "scriptless trading".
</P>
<P>
Ramos expressed confidence that the two acts will further
increase investors' confidence in the country's capital market.
</P>
<P>
He said the two acts would free the country's capital market
from uncertainties of needless government intervention, adding
that "this freedom should be accompanied by a deep sense of
responsibility by the market players."
</P>
<P>
"The PSE, therefore, must accept its newfound freedom with a
clear sense of its own duty to its constituents and to the public
at large in order to deserve the powers upon which it has been
vested," Ramos said.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of the Indian
Ministry of Mines C. Sen said today that the Foreign Investment
and Promotion Board (FIPB) has cleared about two dozen proposals
for foreign investment worth 500 million U.S. dollars in the
mining sector.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international conference on business and
investment opportunities in the mining industry here, Sen said
one single iron ore project cleared by the government for the
second phase of mining proposes an investment of 800 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the stage of mining, one already-cleared prospecting
proposal for diamonds envisages an investment of over 500 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has recently announced new guidelines
which have further liberalized the country's mining sector. They
would facilitate further privatization of Indian investment and
foreign capital and technology inflow into the mineral sector.
</P>
<P>
Most of the proposals cleared by the government so far relate
to prospecting and in the second phase, they would bring in
substantial investment to mining, the secretary added.

PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French Observatory of Drugs and Drug-Addictions
published its annual report today which shows evidence of a slight
drop of consumption of heroin in the country. This tendency is
explained by the increasing use of methadone, a drinkable medicine
proved effective in curing drug addiction after being used by 84
drug addiction curing centers across the country on 4,000 addicts.
</P>
<P>
-- Both the French leftwing and rightwing parties are gearing
up for the 1998 legislative elections by hardening their tones.
Socialist Party First Secretary Lionel Jospin accused the ruling
rightwing of practicing a theory of sacrificing the poor to serve
the interests of the rich. Former Prime Minister Edouard Balladur
and member of the ruling RPR said the economic platform of the
socialists is nothing but demagogy.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Six Corsicans were arrested Sunday evening in Paris for
suspected involvement in two recent attacks on a target of
paramilitary police and a golf center owned by the son of a local
financial boss, Jacques Dewez, in Corsica. The arrests are
believed to have resulted from the change of attitude toward
Corsican militants by Dewez, who for the first time became the
victim of racketeerings on the island.
</P>
<P>
-- The French Socialist Party adopted its economic platform
last weekend during its national convention, in preparation for
the 1998 legislative elections. The main contents of the platform
are creating jobs for young people, reducing weekly working hours,
and cutting tax charges.
</P>
<P>
-- The merger of Boeing and McDonnell airspace corporations
confirms the continuous concentration of airspace industry in the
United States, which has seen several other mergers in the field
recently.

ALMA-ATA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev said here today
that their two countries will expand economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents said relations between the two countries
have developed rapidly over the past five years since Kazakhstan
gained independence.
</P>
<P>
According to Nurblan Danenov, Kazakhstan's first vice-foreign
minister, the two presidents agreed that vast potential for
Turkish-Kazakh economic cooperation should be tapped.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Turkish firms are operating in Kazakhstan, involving
a total investment of 1.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
President Demirel, who arrived in Kazakhstan Sunday for a
three-day official visit to the central Asian country, said Turkey
will continue to provide loans for Kazakhstan's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Demirel's visit coincided with celebrations marking the former
Soviet republic's fifth anniversary of independence.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Envoy Threatens to Leave Post Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Ambassador to
Israel, Mohammed Bassiouny, has threatened to leave his post if
diplomatic situation continues to deteriorate, reported Israel
Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Bassiouny made the threat when he was speaking to Israeli
Arab affairs reporters from his residence in Herzliya, a
seaside town near Tel Aviv, Sunday night. He warned that
Cairo might recall him unless Israel advances the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is open," he said. "We hope the Israeli
government will move forward and implement the agreement. Not
moving means a deterioration in the region."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian envoy declared: "I am not threatening you, but
it would not be only this (the return of the ambassador).
Many things can happen. You know where it starts. You don't
know where it ends."
</P>
<P>
Bassiouny stressed that Egypt is a partner, rather than a
mediator, in the peace process. He cautioned that failure to
implement the Oslo Accords would result in violence that would
undermine stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is the key to the solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador's remarks came against the backdrop of mounting
tension between Egypt and Israel. Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak complained Wednesday that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu is backtracking on a commitment to having Egypt's
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa play a role in resolving the current
impasse over Israel's partial withdrawal from the West Bank
Palestinian city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak reminded Israel of the fact that Netanyahu made the
offer during a meeting with Moussa in Lisbon. But, Mubarak said
that Netanyahu changed his mind later due to domestic politics on
returning home.
</P>
<P>
"They want us to press (Palestinian Authority leader Yasser)
Arafat to accept their proposals, whether public opinion in
Palestine agrees to it or not, or whether Mr. Arafat finds
it feasible or not," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser Dore Gold was sent to
Cairo last week to discuss Moussa's visit to Israel, but it
remains unclear when Moussa would come and to what extent his
visit would be tied to the Hebron talks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Director-General Eitan Bentsur said Saturday
that European and Arab countries should stay out of Israel's
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Army Radio, Bentsur accused Europe and
Arab countries of interfering "at every stage of the
negotiations." He claimed that their pressure on Israel was
"damaging" and slowing the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Take Part in Nairobi Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela left here today for nairobi to take part in a
summit of the Great Lakes countries to try to end the region's
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from regional powers are due to gather in Nairobi at
the initiative of kenyan President Deniel arap Moi for a second
summit to discuss the situation in Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
At an earlier summit, also in Nairobi, seven African leaders
called for a ceasefire in eastern Zaire, deployment of a multi-
national force and respect for the country's territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Those leaders, from Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Ethiopia,
Eritrea and Zambia, will be joined today by Mandela and President
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's attendance will confirm South Africa's commitment in
efforts to end conflicts in the continent, a statement issued by
the foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim, and Ferdinnd Oyono, foreign minister of
Cameroun, who is current OAU chairman,a re also expected to
attend.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been no indication that a delegation from
Zaire will be at the summit.Burundi,according to a list of those
expected, is also not expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
Since the earlier summit on November 5, the situation in the
region has altered dramatically.
</P>
<P>
The multinational force called for on that occasion was
deployed in Uganda, but is already making plans to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many of the refugees in Zaire, some 600,000
out of 1.2 million registered before fighting broke out, have
fled their camps and returned to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The refugee problem in the region is not resolved, however.

<HEADLINE> Egypt To Link up Power With Libya in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The cable linking the Egyptian
and Libyan power networks will start operating next September as
part of a project to connecting electricity grid among some Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Libyan hook-up will coincide with the switch-on of
the Egyptian-Jordanian cable, which aims at linking power networks
in eastern and western Arab countries, said today's Egyptian
Gazette.
</P>
<P>
The unified Arab network will later be linked to Europe through
Turkey in the east and Spain in the west.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Energy Maher Abaza and
his Libyan counterpart Abdullah el-Badri Sunday signed a protocol
for boosting energy cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The 170 km cable will connect the Egyptian town of el-Salloum
and Tobruk in Libya, at a cost of 25 million U.S. dollars financed
by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, according to
the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The protocol also includes establishing an Egyptian-Libyan
authority to exploit new and renewable energy resources in the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The authority will carry out research and exchange of expertise
in using solar energy power station.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation was sped up after President Hosni Mubarak and
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi during their recent meeting in
Tripoli, Abaza said.
</P>
<P>
Two working groups will soon be set up to follow up the
operation of the cable project and regulate trading activities of
energy between the two countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Netanyahu Have Phone Conversation to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat phoned Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu Sunday night as both sides moved to calm the rising
tension.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's call came after top Israeli negotiator Yitzhak
Molcho and Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh met with him in Gaza
Sunday night. Earlier Sunday, Arafat reportedly rejected a
visit by Molcho to Gaza, but he apparently changed his mind
later.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister's Office said that
Arafat and Netanyahu discussed prospects of moving forward on
the Hebron talks, which have in fact totally stalled for the
past week.
</P>
<P>
During the phone call, Arafat expressed sorrow for the
killing of a Jewish mother and her son in the Wednesday
drive-by shooting attack launched by radical Palestinians near
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
In response, Netanyahu expressed sorrow for the killing of a
Palestinian worker by an Israeli farmer in Negev last week,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Netanyahu that he had demanded the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which claimed
responsibility for the Wednesday attack, to stop its
attacks against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The PFLP, a Syria-based Palestinian group, opposes the
Israel-Palestinian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the latest shooting attack, Palestinian police acted
quickly by detaining dozens of PFLP activists. However,
Palestinian police have turned down a request by Israel for the
extradition of suspects.
</P>
<P>
Molcho, who is also a lawyer for Netanyahu, briefed Arafat
about the Israeli government's decision Friday to encourage
expansion of Jewish settlements, a move aimed at calming the PA
anger at Israel's settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
Following the Wednesday attack, the Israeli government
responded by granting tax breaks and financial grants to Jewish
settlements to entice more Israelis to join the 140,000 settlers
who live in the West Bank and Gaza among 2 million Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The move has aroused strong protests from the Palestinian
leaders, who called on all Palestinians to confront such
activities to defend their land.
</P>
<P>
The developments have escalated the tension between the two
sides, fueling fears about an outbreak of new violence.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Egypt Continues Active Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has continued its
concerted efforts to push forward the stalled Middle East peace
process through 1996.
</P>
<P>
Though Egypt is no direct party to the Arab-Israeli
negotiations, it has kept on playing -- in its capacity as a key
Arab state that was the first to establish diplomatic relations
with Israel -- an active role in the Middle East peace process
especially on the Palestinian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
The hosting by Egypt of an international peace-making
conference last March was an initial step made by it to save the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following four suicide bombings by the Hamas movement in Israel
early this year, killing 60 people and injuring hundreds of
others, the Israeli government suspended its talks with the
Palestinian National Authority, bringing the peace process to a
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the peace process from collapsing, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak proposed holding an international
anti-terrorism conference, and made urgent contacts with the
parties involved in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's proposal drew strong support from the world,
including the Palestinian National Authority and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The international peace-making conference convened in the
Egyptian town of Sharm el Sheikh on March 13 this year. The
conference was attended by leaders of about 30 countries. The
Egyptian diplomacy scored.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the untiring international mediation efforts,
including those made by the Egyptians, the Palestinian-Israeli
relations saw signs of relaxation early last May when the two
sides held the first round of "the ultimate status" talks.
</P>
<P>
Though that round of talks had but token significance, it was a
new stage of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The hosting by Egypt of an Arab summit in Cairo was the second
step made by Egypt to save the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the Likud bloc won the Israeli parliamentary election
held late May, the Netanyahu government adopted a series of
intransigent (hardline) policies that consisted in failing to
approve the setting up of an independent Palestinian state,
failing to negotiate on Jerusalem, and failing to withdraw from
the occupied Syrian Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
To tackle this grave state of affairs, the leaders of Egypt
and some other Arab countries agreed to convene the first Arab
summit in six years on June 22 and 23.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Egypt Continues Active Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The summit -- which was attended by all Arab states with the
exception of Iraq -- was intended to be an evident signal to
Israel that Arab states would take a unified stand to meet the
challenges facing the peace process, and that unless the new
Israeli government changed its intransigent policy toward the
peace process, it would be collectively boycotted by Arab states.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to break up his country's isolation from the Arab
world Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu paid a visit last
July to Egypt, the first Arab country visited by him after he
assumed the premiership.
</P>
<P>
The visit was intended to improve relations with Egypt, the
most effective power in the Arab world, and to ask it persuade
the other Arab parties -- especially the Palestinians and Syrians
-- to adopt flexible attitudes while negotiating with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The third step made by Egypt to break the deadlock suffered by
the peace process was its hosting of the third Mideast-North
Africa Economic Summit held in Cairo last November.
</P>
<P>
Though it was primarily economic, the summit was closely
connected with the Middle East peace process. Before the summit
was convened, Egypt repeatedly affirmed that the success of the
summit depended on the making of some progress in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The president had even warned of a delay or cancellation of the
summit unless some progress was secured in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Though the Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations have not resumed
since they came to a standstill last February, Egypt has made a
lot of efforts to revive these negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and Syrian leaders and officials have exchanged
frequent visits to examine ways of pushing forward the Middle East
peace process especially on the Syrian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
Syria is opposed to Israel's occupation of the Syrian Golan
Heights and calls for a complete Israeli withdrawal from them in
return for a complete peace.
</P>
<P>
Egypt seeks to persuade Syria to adopt a more flexible attitude
in its negotiations with Israel, with the aim of reaching a
solution acceptable to both parties.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's active role in the Middle East peace process has met
with high appreciation from the international community.
</P>
<P>
In an opinion poll held recently with the participation of more
than 500,000 Arab citizens and members of Arab communities
overseas, President Hosni Mubarak won the title of "The 1996
Political Figure", and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa won
the title of "The 1996 Diplomatic Figure."
</P>
<P>
Political observers in Cairo expect the road to peace to be
difficult and to meet with obstacles sometimes, but Egypt will
continue the efforts made by it to push forward the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
It is certain that Egypt's mediation role is indispensable to
the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, especially on the
Palestinian-Israeli and the Syrian-Israeli tracks, they
added.

Meanwhile, the court commuted the prison terms of 13 former
South Korean officers from 4-10 years to 3.5-8 years. The
officers included former First Army Corps Commander Hwang
Young-si, who helped Chun and Roh in their quest for power.
</P>
<P>
The court, in explaining the commuted sentences, said that
although these former military leaders seized power during a coup,
they peacefully transferred power to their successors through a
direct presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
In the first trial on August 26 this year, the Seoul District
Court sentenced Chun to death and Roh to 22 years and six months
in prison respectively on the same charges.
</P>
<P>
The district court also fined Chun 282 million dollars and Roh
355 million dollars, and sentenced the 13 former officers to four
to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges stem from the roles played by
Chun and Roh as well as their cronies in the military coup on
December 12, 1979 and the suppression of the civil uprising in
Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province, on May
18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun, 65, and the 63-year-old Roh, as well as their followers
were arrested at the end of last year after President Kim
Young-sam called for the enactment of a special bill paving the
way to punish them for past wrongdoing without regard to the
statue of limitations. Kim's action came after evidence of Roh's
slush fund was uncovered.
</P>
<P>
In December 1979, Chun arrested the then martial law commander,
Chung Sung-hwa, and accused him of complicity in the assassination
of President Park Chung-hee. That made Chun the de facto head of
the martial law command.
</P>
<P>
Chun, then a major general, had been in charge of investigating
Park's death at the hands of his intelligence chief. After
consolidating power, Chun was elected president in 1980 and was
succeeded by his friend, Roh, in 1988, who stepped down in
February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Today's ruling followed 11 trial sessions on the mutiny,
treason and bribery charges involving the 15 defendants since
October 7.
</P>
<P>
Outside the court, some 15 people staged a sit-down protest,
crying and screaming. "Bring back my son to life," one of the
protesters from Kwangju City shouted.
</P>
<P>
Since the two former presidents and their followers refused to
admit their crimes in connection with the 1979 and the 1980
incidents, it is most likely that they will appeal the case to
South Korea's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
If the case is brought to the Supreme Court, the country's
highest court will start its deliberation beginning early next
year and is expected to make its final judgment around April.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Refugees Trek Back Home From Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 300,000 Rwandan
refugees have crossed into Rwanda, with the last main group of
about 77,000 refugees still at Ngara, Kagera of Northwestern
Tanzania expected to cross the Rusumo Border post tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, Mohammed Babu, the
Kagera Regional Commissioner, told reporters in Ngara yesterday
that progress in the repatriation exercise was encouraging.
</P>
<P>
He said the December 31 deadline of the departure of all
camped Rwandan refugees from the country would be met.
</P>
<P>
"If the current massive return of refugees continues at the
same pace, it is possible that the repatriation exercise will
meet the deadline to finalize it by the year's end," Babu noted.
</P>
<P>
Refugees who have already crossed the border back to Rwanda
from Tanzania were among the 400,000 who had left their camps, a
large number among them wishing to find their way to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
They were driven back by police and army units to their camps,
to be repatriated at the earliest availability of trucks.
</P>
<P>
Some were being carried in hired vehicles but thousands of
others, who seemed rather impatient, were walking back home.
</P>
<P>
Benaco camp is located less than a dozen kilometers from the
Rusumo border post.
</P>
<P>
Army units deployed along the main road from a junction called
KO through Benaco camp to Rusumoo border were not harassing the
returnees, Babu said.
</P>
<P>
"At the border, the refugees are crossing freely without being
searched, harassed or charged with duties or levies of any sort,"
Babu said.
</P>
<P>
No refugee remained in the Lumasi camp, while only a few of
them remained packing their luggage in Benaco and Msahura camps
ready to leave.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers who mounted tight security in Benaco camp, a
sprawling meeting point for the various waves of refugees since
the crisis started in early 1994, were not allowing any refugee
to re-enter the camp.
</P>
<P>
They were only directing them to Rusumo, saying that the
returning refugees had violated the law prohibiting them to leave
the respective camps without due permission.
</P>
<P>
The latest migration is the second mass return wave of Rwandan
refugees. More than 500,000 left Zaire in four days from November
15 after a rebellion by Zairean Tutsis broke the Hutu
intimidators' hold.

<HEADLINE> China's Life Insurance Market Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- About 300 million people in
China have bought life insurance, so the premiums account for only
0.3 percent of the country's GNP, meaning great potential in the
country's life insurance market.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the Chinese spend the equivalent of
only four US dollars per person on insurance policies per year,
with two-thirds of that going to property insurance.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 6,000 dollars in the United States, and life
insurance is the priority choice there.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, parents often bought insurance for children as a
gift for their future, according to a local newspaper. Few adults
did it for themselves.

CHANGCHUN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Holsten Premium
Bier, which is being jointly produced by Germany's largest drinks
manufacturer, Holsten-Brauerei AG, and China's Jilin Songyuan Food
Industry Company, is finding its way into the Chinese market.

<HEADLINE> Double Digit Growth for Shanghai Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Industrial production in
China's largest city of Shanghai is expected to go up by 16
percent this year as a result of market growth, technical
improvements, and enterprise reforms.
</P>
<P>
Industrial departments report that the municipality's
industrial sector will have an over 97 percent
production-marketing ratio and a 120 percent industrial economic
efficiency index.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November this year, the industry in Shanghai had
maintained strong grow with a double-digit increase in industrial
production, sales, and exports.
</P>
<P>
This is in large part because enterprises have become more
market aware, and have opened offices in 20,000 places across the
country to promote Shanghai-made industrial goods. Moreover, major
industries have also established special departments for market
promotion.
</P>
<P>
Industries in the municipality have also laid emphasis on
industrial and technological progress, and many have also seized
opportunities to transform the enterprise mechanism.

<HEADLINE> S. African PAC Elects New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Methodist Bishop
Stanley Mogoba was elected unopposed as Pan Africanist Congress
(PAC) President at PAC Conference at Thohoyandou in the Northern
Province early this morning.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted a PAC source as saying
that the announcement of Mogoba's unopposed victory was greeted
by warm applause from conference delegates.
</P>
<P>
It was for "the first time that so much emotion had been
expressed spontaneously," a PAC member told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Mogoba, who had support of most delegates includingou the former
Azanian People's liberation army high command, gave up his
position as head of the Methodist Church last week to contest the
PAC election.
</P>
<P>
Former PAC chief Clarence Makwetu, who strongly objected the
nomination of Mogoba, surprisingly changed his mind minutes
before the vote was held, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Mogoba's victory was announced, Makwetu stood up
immediately and walked across to Mogoba shaking hands with the
new party leader and "promptlygou started crying", SAPA quoted
witnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu has been widely blamed by PAC members for his poor
performances both in PAC leadership and national elections.
</P>
<P>
PAC is the third biggest black political party in South Africa
after the ruling African National Congress and Inkatha freedom
Party.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after Mogoba's election, Makwetu said he wished his
successor "good luck and the support of the organization". The
outgoing leader did not make himself available for any other PAC
leadership positions, instead he has expressed willingness to
quit parliament and return his farm. enditem

<HEADLINE> Record Grain Harvest in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
has reported a record harvest of 24.8 billion kilograms, 160
million kilograms more than last year, in spite of heavy flooding
earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
This grain-producing province had a number of rainstorms in
July that affected 1.3 million hectares of farmland and caused a
reduction in early rice output.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the local government, farmers quickly planted
late rice and other food grains soon after the floods. As a
result, the province's gross agricultural product has increased by
six percentage points over last year, and famers' net income will
reach at least 1,800 yuan per capita, an increase of 340 yuan over
last year.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Awarded MK Service Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
has become the first recipient of the Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK)
Service Medal for his over 30 years' involvement in the military
service of the ANC, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1961 and disbanded after the 1994 election,
Umkhonto we Sizwe or Spear of the Nation was the military wing of
the African National Congress (ANC) during the anti-apartheid
struggle.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the MK Veterans' Association here at
the weekend, Mandela, MK's first commander-in-chief, said there
was a need for former guerrillas to preserve the history of the
people's army and to look after all veterans since MK's
disbandment two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Mandela paid homage to former MK members, including leaders
like Oliver Tambo, Chris Hani and Joe slovo, by saying that much
of where South Africa was today could be attributed to the work
of MK.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of veterans' association would keep alive
the memory of those who had fought for a democratic society, and
to champion the welfare of ex-members and provide assistance,
said the President.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that history had shown former freedom
fighters were prone to forgetting where they came from and after
three to five years had lost touch with people on ground level.
</P>
<P>
Mandela then accepted the MK medal for 30 years of service,
presented to him by another MK stalwart Walter Sisulu.
</P>
<P>
Among those who received the 30-year-medal was Sisulu himself,
outgoing Eastern Cape Premier Raymond Mhlaba, and Defense
Minister Joe Modise.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with Kovacs Laszlo, the Hungarian
foreign minister, at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China and Hungary and their peoples have a
deeply-rooted traditional friendship, and their friendly,
cooperative relations have gone smoothly and have withstood the
test of time, against a backdrop of great changes and a changing
international situation.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the two countries' leaders have kept in close
contact, and the visits by President Jiang Zemin and Hungary's
President Goncz Arpad have brought bilateral relations to higher
level.
</P>
<P>
The two sides enjoy continued development in cooperation and
exchanges in politics, the economy, science and technology, the
military, culture, and education, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Qian emphasized that the Chinese government and people place
great importance on Sino-Hungarian relations and are willing to
increase bilateral cooperation in all fields on the basis of the
five principles of peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Kovacs praised China as a great country and a strategic partner
of Hungary, and said that his country values China's achievements
in the reforms and opening up, and its important status and role
in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have seen the continued development of
Hungarian-Chinese relations, with the two heads of state
exchanging visits, government departments keeping in close
contact, and cooperation in every field going smoothly, Kovacs
said, adding that Hungary is pleased with all these and believes
that Hungarian-Chinese relations have excellent prospects for
development.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the Hungarian government's stand on the "one
China" principle and on unofficial ties or exchanges with Taiwan,
and its recognition of Tibet as an inalienable part of Chinese
territory.
</P>
<P>
Both of the two ministers described their respective domestic
situations and foreign policies and they discussed a variety of
international issues of mutual concern in detail. Kovacs invited
Qian to visit Hungary and Qian accepted the invitation with
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two ministers signed a protocol on
cooperation between the two foreign ministries.
</P>
<P>
Kovacs arrived here Saturday on a five-day visit at Qian's
invitation.

BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Foreign Enterprise
Service Corporation has provided 4,000 foreign-funded enterprises
in China's capital with 16,000 skilled or professional people

<HEADLINE> Indian Railways Minister Hints at Gas Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian Railways Minister Ram
Vilas Paswan has indicated an increase in gasoline prices in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't increase the price of petrol today, then within
the next six months we will end up increasing our foreign debt by
a further 150,000 million rupees ( 4,243.28 million U.S.
dollars)," he told the private home TV channel in an interview to
be telecast Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister's statement is expected to cause a furor in the
parliament today.
</P>
<P>
An earlier hike in gasoline prices this year gave rise to
severe criticism of the united front government from all quarters
including left parties in the front.
</P>
<P>
With the parliament in session, the united front government
will be under pressure to make a categorical statement on whether
it intends to raise the gasoline prices or not.
</P>
<P>
"Every single Indian has a right to know exactly what the
economic state of the country is," the minister said in the
interview. "If I tell you, which I should not, what the exact
economic position is, you will realize we are sitting on a
volcano."

<HEADLINE> Delhi Private Bus Operators to Stage Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Private bus operators in New
Delhi, capital of India, are reported to have decided to go on
strike Monday to protest the recent cancellation by the government
of the licenses of some operators.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi government has recently canceled the licenses of some
private bus operators due to their fatal accidents in the capital
killing and wounding passengers. it also rejected the fitness
certificates of some vehicles for their failure to meet government
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Ramesh Dalal, president of the private State Transport
Authority, has demanded that the cancellation of permits should be
revoked immediately as the fatal accidents were the fault of the
drivers.
</P>
<P>
While the erring drivers continue to drive other buses, he
noted, the owners of the buses suffer due to the cancellation of
permits.
</P>
<P>
In a move to counter the strike threat by the private bus
operators, the Delhi government Sunday imposed an essential
services maintenance act on the operators to prevent any hardship
to the people.
</P>
<P>
Describing the strike call by the private bus operators as
"uncalled for," Delhi Transport Minister Rajendra Gupta said the
Delhi government was also increasing the number of public buses on
the roads of the capital Monday.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all motorists to offer lifts to commuters on the
road and to all taxi and three wheeler operators not to overcharge
the commuters. He also called on the private bus operators to sit
with the government to resolve their problems.

<HEADLINE> Grain Production Still A Priority for 1997 In China  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists and
agronomists have called for steps to be taken to prevent a
possible drop in grain output next year.
</P>
<P>
Government departments report that China is confident about
producing a record 480 billion kg of grain this year, 4.3 percent
more than output of the peak in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This success has been resultant from a series of policies from
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State
Council, according to an article in the current issue of Beijing's
"Outlook" magazine.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists attending a seminar for officials and experts from
the country's policy-maling bodies said that they share the view
that the slack mood that has followed the successful harvests is a
hidden danger for agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
They warn that, if the government fails to solve
harvest-related problems, there will be a recurrence next year of
the big drop in grain production that happened in 1985, following
a record harvest in 1984.
</P>
<P>
That conclusion was based on the following unfavorable signs:
</P>
<P>
-- In some major grain producing areas, the market price has
dropped to below the grain purchase price, falling to 20 percent
below the purchase price at its worst, which was about equal to
production cost. This greatly affects farmers' enthusiasm in
growing grain, Li Yingzhong, a research fellow of the Academy of
Agricultural Science, noted.

<HEADLINE> Grain Production Still A Priority for 1997 in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- Farmers have found it difficult to sell grain because state
warehouses have been full and state-owned grain departments were
compelled to buy even more grain at higher than the market price
to comfort the growers.
</P>
<P>
-- Also, there are those who have mistakenly held that grain is
a profitable business and question the truth about agriculture's
being an inefficient and weak link in the national economy, and
have therefore paid less attention to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The article quotes Wang Pingsheng, an official from the State
Planning Commission, as saying that the law of agricultural
production proves that every five-year cycle has two good years,
two average years, and a lean year, which usually follows a fat
year. "We should be prepared for this and keep a close watch," he
said.
</P>
<P>
China has a large population and limited land. Its per-capita
grain averages 400 kg -- not much when compared with developed
countries, said Sun Zhixin, an official with the State Commission
on Restructuring the Economy. And, the conflict between population
growth and shrinking land is not likely to be solved in a short
period of time, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Many experts have put forward suggestions on improving the
country's ability to deal with great fluctuations in grain
production.
</P>
<P>
Wang Pingsheng proposed an increase in agricultural input by
government, and building more water control projects, which would
help hold losses caused by natural adversities to the minimum and
improve the utilization rate of water resources.
</P>
<P>
An effort will also be made to improve grain distribution and
marketing, building a better supervisory and regulatory system for
grain prices, and improving market forecasts to control supply and
demand.
</P>
<P>
One agronomist said that the state should put more money into
grain risk funds to offset possible losses assumed by state-owned
grain departments.

BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
confirmed that no formal dumping complaints have been lodged
against electric appliances imported from Thailand, a senior Thai
Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Kobsak Chutikul, director-general of the Economic Affairs
department, said that Roderick Abbott, EU ambassador to the World
Trade Organization, has informed him that the European Commission
cannot launch anti-dumping investigation because no formal
complaints have been accepted.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU acknowledged there were informal contacts
between European industries and the European Commission on
electronic appliance imports from Asia, Kobsak was quoted as
saying by local newspapers as saying today.
</P>
<P>
A Thai delegation on Thursday presented a letter of complaint
from Sharp Appliance (Thailand) to Abbott in Singapore, voicing
concern about an investigation into the alleged dumping of the
firm's facsimile machines.
</P>
<P>
The delegation said that any dumping probe would run counter to
the spirit of liberalizing information technology trade.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is likely to speed up
the process to free its telecommunications sector, although it
opposed an early time frame at the first World Trade Organization
ministerial meeting held in Singapore earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry will put for the cabinet approval in
February a master plan which are mainly based on initiatives by
the Chuan Leekpai government to provide for a stage-by-stage
liberalization of the sector, Commerce Minister Suwat Liptapallop
said.
</P>
<P>
Suwat said that his ministry would keep to the guidelines set
by previous governments rather than prepare a new draft.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the two state telecommunications enterprises -
the Telephone Organization of Thailand and the Communications
Authority of Thailand - were scheduled to be privatized by the end
of this year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that the process was delayed as some
deals made by the Banharn government might postpone the
implementation of the plan until 1999.
</P>
<P>
Suwat also said that some sections of the existing
telecommunications laws will be amended after the cabinet approve
the plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul High Court commuted
the death sentence on former South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan
to life imprisonment at an adjudication session for the mutiny and
treason case here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another former South Korean president, Roh Tae-woo,
was also given a reduced sentence, from 22 years and six months in
prison to 17 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
On August 26 this year, the Seoul District Court sentenced Chun
to death and Roh to 22 years and six months in prison respectively
on charges of mutiny and treason.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges stem from the roles played by
Chun and Roh as well as their cronies in the military coup on
December 12, 1979 and the suppression of the civil uprising in
Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province, on May
18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the nation until
February 1988. He was followed by his friend, Roh, who stepped
down in February 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The value of Thailand's frozen
shrimp exports to key markets declined sharply in the first nine
months of this year, according to latest statistics from the Thai
Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of this year, the value of outbound
shipments to the top-ranked Japanese market showed a massive 36.5
percent drop to 8.91 billion baht (356 million US dollars) from
14.04 billion baht (561 million US dollars) in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the U.S., the second largest export destination,
dropped by 17.1 percent on a year-on-year basis to 8.17 billion
baht (326 million US dollars) from 9.84 billion baht (393 million
US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Noise Law to Quieten Beijing Yangko Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A new law on the prevention of
noise pollution will set a limit to the most popular outdoor
entertainment of Beijing retirees.
</P>
<P>
From next March, Yangko dancing teams on Beijing streets and
residential communities will not be allowed to make excessive
noises, reported today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
"Yangko teams whose noise exceeds 70 decibels at the dancing
sites or 45 decibels at the homes of nearby residents will have to
stop or reduce the noise, and must finish dancing before 9:00 pm,"
the report quoted a local official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yangko was originally a popular rural folk dance in north
China, characterized with heavy gong and drum beats. Yangko lovers
hold that the dance is an important form of exercise which helps
maintain health, and the team work promotes friendship.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing and other Chinese cities, many senior citizens
choose it as a major entertainment to spend post-retirement time
and get rid of loneliness.
</P>
<P>
"But the dancers' pleasure has drawn a growing number of
complaints about noise," said Liu Chunxiang, who is in charge of
social activities with Beijing Cultural Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"From then (March 1st) on, we will deal with complaints of

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1996 Brings Peace to Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1996 would always
be remembered in the Philippines for bringing peace to the
southern part of the country, which has been seriously battered by
a 24-year-old war between government troops and Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government put an end to the war by signing a
final peace agreement last September with the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), the largest Muslim rebel group in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Having achieved this, the government is pursuing peace talks
with other Muslim insurgency groups which include the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), the Abu Sayyaf and the United Moro
National Organization.
</P>
<P>
The ending of the war was hailed as a great event in the
Philippine history. Since MNLF chairman Nur Misuari and some other
Moro leaders waged the war against the government in 1972, it had
killed at least 120,000 people and resulted in an huge economic
loss of around three billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the peace agreement was a product of compromises.
The MNLF realized that it could achieve through peace talks what
it could not by force. Thtry had for long desired.
</P>
<P>
After three years' hard bargain, the government and the MNLF
last June struck an interim agreement under which the Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD) would be set
up in Mindanao. In return, the MNLF agreed to abandon its armed
struggle for a separate Moro homeland.
</P>
<P>
The SPCPD will oversee peace and development in 14 provinces
and 9 cities in Mindanao. Three years later, a plebiscite will be
held to determine which of the provinces or cities will join a new
autonomous region to replace the current one that includes only
four Muslim-dominated provinces.
</P>
<P>
The agreement brought peace to Mindanao. After it was signed,
the MNLF not only ceased its hostilities with government troops,
but also helped to and appointed chairman of the newly-installed
SPCPD as scheduled. In the meantime, the integration of 7,500 MNLF
members into the military and police forces is also underway.
</P>
<P>
What is more important is the fact that the peace deal also
gave Mindanao a chance to achieve economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao has always been known as a "land of promise". It is
rica 280-million-U.S.-dollar
contract to build 400,000 telephone lines in the area.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao has begun to enjoy peace. However, to make sure that
peace will last, it still have to meet some challenges.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a break-away group of the MNLF with some 20,000
members, has already said that it rejected the peace agreement
because it did not address all fundamental issues in Mindanao. It
demanded separate peace talks with the government, but until now
the two sides have made less progress on when to formally start
their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is growing into the biggest group in the country. It
has courted at least 2,000 defectors who were dissatisfied over
Misuari's deals with the government. At the same time, the group
has had some skirmishes with the military 200-member terrorists group, also voic
ed its
opposition to the peace deal and announced that it would
assassinate Misuari and government officials who proposed and
inked the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Misuari has repeatedly said that he is ready to mediate between
the rebel groups and the government so as to have the rebels
switched to peace talks. But analysts said a question mark should
be hung onto Misuari's promise because he had already been branded
by other rebel groups as "traitor" for selling out to the
that they would be
persecuted by Muslims with whom they have been at odds for
centuries, they have also formed 34 armed vigilante groups.
</P>
<P>
Despite these obstacles on the road to final peace, analysts
said, the peace process in Mindanao is on right track and will
before long turn one of the world's poorest area into a growth
center of the country's economy.

HAIKOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Haikou city, capital of south
China's Hainan Province, plans to build itself into a world level
health city in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the ecological and social problems that have
resulted from industrialization and urbanization, the World Health

<HEADLINE> Russian Leaders Praise Duma Approval of 1997 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today welcomed the State Duma's approval of the draft budget for
1997 after its first reading.
</P>
<P>
"The whole country has gained from this reasonable approach,"
said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The bill was supported by 262 deputies in the Duma, the lower
house of parliament, well over the 226 votes needed to pass. There
were 122 votes against and seven abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The Duma told the government to prepare amendments to the draft
budget by December 25 when the bill goes for its second and third
readings.
</P>
<P>
The Duma lawmakers rejected the original budget bill in early
November, describing it as "unrealistic."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was quoted by his press service as saying the bill was
approved thanks to the joint efforts of the government, the Duma
and the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
After the Duma vote, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
thanked the lawmakers' "stance of understanding the government."
</P>
<P>
He said it was very important for Russia to start the new year
with an adopted budget.
</P>
<P>
The premier hoped the draft budget would be approved in the
second and the third readings.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget expenditure in 1997 will be 529.8 trillion
roubles (about 96 billion U.S. dollars), while budget revenue will
be 434.4 trillion roubles (about 77 billion dollars), and deficit
will be 95.4 trillion roubles (about 19 billion dollars), or 3.5
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and 18.12 percent of
budget expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin has said he believes Duma approval of the draft
bill will ensure a 2 percent growth in GDP in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Duma also recommended that the government, together with
the lower chamber's corresponding committees, draw up measures to
stabilize the social and economic situation in the country and
achieve economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also urged the government to present an economic
program to the year 2000 to the Duma by December 25.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Start Hearings on Infotech Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
hold public hearings on the early reduction of the tariffs on
information technology (infotech) products as proposed by the
United States during the World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines together with 14 other WTO members which
account for 85 percent of the total trade in infotech had promised
to notify the WTO about the changes in their tariffs by March 15
next year.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista, upon
his return to Manila from the WTO ministerial meeting in
Singapore, said he would ask the Tariff Commission to hold public
hearing on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials said the public discussions should focus on the
binding of tariffs on infotech products and the speedy
liberalization of these items.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on infotech products average 10 percent in the
Philippines. If the country will sign the US-backed Information
Technology Agreement (ITA), this should slim between zero and 5
percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it would be easy for the country to agree to the
US initiative because of the already moderate rates on infotech
goods here.

MANILA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are business news
in brief in the Philippines:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine national inflation rate is likely to settle
at an average of 9 percent by the yearend, higher than the 8.7
percent revised inflation rate programmed by government economic
managers, according to a report from Hongkong Shanghai Banking
Corp. (HSBC). But the HSBC is confident that, in view of the
country's stronger economic momentum, real gross national product
growth will exceed 7 percent this year. In its Asian Economic
Quarterly report dated November 1996, the HSBC noted that the 4.4

American oil companies were also required to seek clearance from
the U.S. government before buying crude from Iraq. Some 85 percent
of the crude requirements of the company are sourced from the
Middle East while remaining supply comes from East Asian
countries.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Railways to Prepare for Spring Transport Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China's most populous Sichuan
Province has taken a series of steps to prepare for the
forthcoming Spring Festival peak transport season for receiving
and dispatching people working outside the province.
</P>
<P>
The transport peak season will arrive around February 1997 and
this southwest China province, with a 100 million population, will
go all out to cope with the 6.5 million transient workers
traveling in and out of the province, which account for one fifth
of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
As this huge number of transient workers play an important role
in the province's economic and social life, the province makes it
a point to mobilize all water, rail, highway and air transport
means to ease traffic pressure.
</P>
<P>
The Chengdu Railway Administration will reduce the number of
cargo trains and increase passenger trains. And the number of long
distance buses will be increased to 4,800.
</P>
<P>
The province will also persuade 60 percent of its transient
workers to stay where they work during the peak season and ask all
its employment agencies not to recruit transient workers the peak
season.
</P>
<P>
The police, civil affairs and health care departments in the
province are also required to work together to keep order for the
smooth transport of transient laborers in and out of Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Festival is the traditional holiday for all Chinese
and there are usually some 200 million people traveling around the
country for family reunion at the peak season around
February.

PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian Government today
expressed its readiness to open the country's civil aviation,
which has been under state monopoly since independence in 1962, to
private investment, according to reports reaching here.

The Algerian Council of Ministers adopted a draft aviation
code, which said that it "aims to allow from now on activities
of air transport to open to private investment and competition,"
both national and international.
</P>
<P>
Algerian President Liamine Zeroual said at a cabinet meeting
today that the new law should guarantee the role of the state in
the strategic sector when opening to private competition.

<HEADLINE> Algeria to Invite International Observers to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual said today that Algeria will invite international
observers to supervise the country's general elections to be held
in the first quarter of next year, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian official news service APS quoted the president as
saying in a written statement that he will also set up an
independent supervision commission of the elections, which will be
participated by "all the actors of the national life."
</P>
<P>
Such a commission will be charged with contacting the United
Nations, the Arab League, and the Organization of African Unity on
the sending of international observers to the elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three organizations sent observers to Algeria's
presidential election held on November 16, 1995, in which Zeroual
was elected with 61 percent of the votes from a suffrage with a 75
percent participation rate.
</P>
<P>
However, Algeria did not invite foreign observers to its
constitutional referendum held on November 28, which
overwhelmingly adopted a new constitution drafted by Zeroual to
ban religious parties.
</P>
<P>
The 79.78 percent participation rate and the 84.60 percent
"yes" votes for the constitution announced by the government
were disputed by the opposition parties of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual warned that in the next general elections, Algerians
are not entitled to indulging themselves in religious, tribal and
political competitions.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that the field of sectarian and political
competition among the elements of the common heritage of all
Algerians, which are Islam, Arab and (Berber) Amazighite, must be
excluded," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Leaders Praise Duma Approval of 1997 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian leaders welcome the
approval of next year's draft budget by the State Duma, the lower
house of Russian parliament, today in the first reading,
describing this move as very important for Russia to begin the
year of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bill was supported by 262 deputies with 122 against and
seven abstentions. To pass, the draft budget needed 226 votes. The
Duma lawmakers rejected the original bill in early November,
describing it as "unrealistic."
</P>
<P>
Expressing his satisfaction with the Duma's approval, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin said: "The whole country has gained from
this reasonable approach"
</P>
<P>
He believes that the bill was approved thanks to the joint work
of the government, the Duma and the Federation Council, the upper
house of Russian parliament, according to his press service.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin thinks that further work on the budget should focus on
social and investment parameters and the spending on the military
reform.
</P>
<P>
After the Duma's voting, Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said thanks to the lawmakers for "understanding of
the government stance."
</P>
<P>
He said that it is very important for Russia to start the new
year with an adopted fundamental financial document, referring to
the bill.
</P>
<P>
The premier expressed hope that the draft budget may be
approved in the second and the third readings scheduled for
December 25.
</P>
<P>
Under the adopted bill, next year's budget expenditure will be
529.8 trillion roubles (about 96 billion U.S. dollars), while
budget revenue will be 434.4 trillion roubles (about 77 billion
dollars), and the deficit will be 95.4 trillion roubles (about 17
billion dollars), or 3.5 percent of the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) and 18.12 percent of the budget expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin believes that the Duma approval of the draft bill
could ensure a 2-percent growth of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
While adopting the bill, the Duma recommended that the
government together with the lower chamber's corresponding
committees draw up measures to stabilize the social and economic
situation in the country and achieve economic growth.
</P>
<P>
It proposed that the Cabinet bring in amendments to the draft
1997 budget when it considered in the second reading.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also urged the government to submit to the Duma a
program to develop the national economy during the years 1997-2000
before December 25.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, December 15 (Xinhua) - Bosnia's Muslims and Croats
have signed a new U.S. brokered-agreement to solve their disputes,
according the Bosnian TV reports.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed late Saturday night by Alija
Izetbegovic, the Muslim chairman of the Bosnia presidency;
Kresimir Zubak, the Croat member of the presidency; Ejup Ganic,
the Muslim deputy president of the Muslim-Croat federation and
John Kornblum, the U.S. assistant secretary of state who proposed
the document.
</P>
<P>
The six-item statement called for setting up the federation's
post-election council of ministers at a session of the federal
parliament on Wednesday, and nominating the federation's new
president and deputy president at the next session of the federal
forum attended by Muslim, Croat as well as U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
By the end of next January, four federal ministries--ministry
of trade, ministry of transport and communications, ministry of
industry, energy supply and mining, ministry of education, culture
and sports--are to be transferred to Mostar, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Police forces of mixed ethnic and in unified uniform would also
be set up in Sarajevo, Mostar and other places with the help of
the UN international police monitors early next year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Muslims and Croats have been tense since the
new federal government can not be formed three months after the
country's elections and following a new wave of evictions of
Muslims in the Croat-controlled western Mostar.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Warns Against Infiltration of Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today warned against the
infiltration of secretly-funded religious extremist groups into
local councils in a scheme to undermine the upcoming parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
Schemers are introducing "elements of religious extremism" and
registering "unknown persons with ambiguous tendencies" inside the
local councils to cause division and gain domination in favor of
extremism, according to Egyptian Interior Minister Hassan Alfi.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of young members of the ruling National
Democratic Party, the minister said these elements and groups have
been getting financial support from abroad and "dubious societies."
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that Egypt might be vulnerable to the same
militant acts as confronted by the violence-plagued Algeria if it
fails to stop "infiltration of such elements in local councils."
</P>
<P>
"We should not stand with folded arms and adopt a negative
attitude towards these elements," he said.
</P>
<P>
He deplored that some governments in Europe and Africa have
given the "heads of terrorism" indirect support by granting them
residence rights, while several dubious societies under the cover
of religion give financial support to "terrorist plots" in Egypt
and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"Elements of internal extremism" were trying to recruit a
number of youth, he warned.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Council of the Arab Interior Ministers,
at its coming session, will map out an effective strategy to
combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He charged the country's influential but outlawed Moslem
Brotherhood with the many assassinations and bombings in
Egypt. "It attracts youth through brainwashing with illusions
under religious pretexts, forgetting that religion calls for
tolerance and mercy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of the Egyptian security forces, he said that
international security agencies have praised the efficiency of
Egyptian security apparatus and its effectiveness in dealing with
preventing crimes before they are committed.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed the confidence that the Egyptian
security agencies will be among the strongest in the world in the
coming years as modernization program is being carried out in all
branches of security.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Crude Oil to Be Loaded in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan and his coalition junior partner Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller are expected to flick
the switch Monday in Yumurtalik (Ceyhan) to load the first Iraqi
crude oil shipment into oil tankers following the over
six-year-old embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Among the first companies that have contracts with Iraq for the
oil sale was the Turkish Oil Refineries Corporation (TUPRAS).
</P>
<P>
The 150,000-ton tanker Gole is waiting offshore near Ceyhan,
which is to receive the first oil shipment during the ceremony
scheduled to be held Monday. It will carry the crude oil to the
Aliaga refinery in the western city of Izmir.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister Recai Kutan
said at a press conference today that about 70 million barrels
of oil is estimated to be pumped through the 986-kilometer
Kirkuk-Yumurtalik twin pipeline, as part of Iraq's total oil
exports worth 2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kutan said that as soon as the amount of oil pumped reaches
the value of 2 billion dollars, the pumps will be turned off,
"even if the six-month period has not expired."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Turkey expected to earn between 1
billion and 1.5 billion dollars from the pumping of the oil,
adding that this was a small figure compared to the 25 billion
Turkey has lost since the imposition of a trade embargo on Iraq
following Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

CAIRO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan has received 100 million U.S. dollars worth of
U.S. military equipment as part of Washington's defense security
aid to the kingdom, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Included in the equipment were 18 UH-1H helicopters, 50 M60A3
tanks, 250 M1008 and M1009 trucks, two MK-4 personnel boats and an
air-sea rescue vessel as well as machine guns and 1,000 pairs of
night vision goggles.
</P>
<P>
The equipment represented the 300 million dollars worth of
assistance program signed by U.S. President Clinton last February,
and was part of the U.S. military program to provide defense
articles, services and training to friendly countries, according
to the United States Information Service (USIS).
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's customs duties on cars would be reduced by 40
percent from January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in customs duties for cars came in line with
Jordan's internal moves to make the country's tariff structure
more compatible with the requirements of a partnership agreement
with the European Union (EU) and the kingdom's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO), Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and the EU will sign a partnership agreement in early
1997. The kingdom has already started accession negotiations with

KUWAIT -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister
Sheikh Salem al Sabah announced today that steps have been taken
to abolish the system of middle men in arms deals and arms
maintenance.

In a statement to the Kuwaiti news agency (KUNA), Sheikh Salem
said that involvement of middle men in the arms business was
"unacceptable" both in and out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense was
prepared to cooperate directly with the governments of
arms-producing countries through the producing firms
themselves. He also affirmed that this is a state policy to cut
state budget deficit and to avoid further burdens on the state's
public finance or reserves.

<HEADLINE> France Calls EU Stability, Growth Pact Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Economy and
Finances Jean Arthuis said today that the adoption by the European
Union summit in Dublin last weekend of a budgetary stability and
growth pact has made up "a victory of Europeans."
</P>
<P>
"President Jacques Chirac has often insisted on the importance
of including growth in the pact. In other words, the single
currency, Euro, is not an end in itself, this is an instrument to
serve the growth and employment (in Europe)," said the minister
during a meeting with the press in Paris today.
</P>
<P>
He described the pact as a "rule of co-ownership of the Euro"
by European countries which is aimed at avoiding the risk of
"deviations" in monetary policies by EU members.
</P>
<P>
"The famous criteria of the Maastricht treaty are the criteria
of good management, of wisdom, which are the guarantee of economic
success without which one cannot have good social policy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU countries struck a compromise deal over the budgetary
stability pact aimed at preventing EU countries from exceeding the
budget deficit limits after joining the Euro.
</P>
<P>
However, they failed to solve a dispute over Germany's
insistence on imposing tough sanctions on those countries which
break the rule of controlling their budget deficit under 3 percent
of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Arthuis said that EU countries have agreed to respect national
sovereignty of each member nation, instead of imposing automatic
sanctions on members for breaking the rules, as Germany wanted.
</P>
<P>
"We have the rules and we will keep them. But this is the last
resort, " he said.
