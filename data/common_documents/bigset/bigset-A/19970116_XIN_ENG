<HEADLINE> UK's Campaign to Double Exports to Central Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain launched a new export
promotion campaign -- Open For Business in Central Europe -- here
today, urging its businesses to embrace the emerging economic
power in the area.
</P>
<P>
The campaign focuses on five countries: the Czech, Hungary,
Poland, Slovak and Slovenia, along with five key sectors which
have a wealth of opportunities for British business.
</P>
<P>
The five key sectors are: agri-business, automotive components,
consumer goods/retailing, electronics/telecommunications and
health care.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch, Ian Lang, president of the Board of
Trade, said the Central European market could be "The Tiger" on
Britain's doorstep. It is a region of dynamic growth, with nearly
19 billions pounds (32.3 billion U.S. dollars) of foreign direct
investment between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
"British exports grew by over one third in 1995 and these five
markets are expected to be worth 125 billion pounds (212.5 billion
dollars) by 1998, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president said, "Awareness is the key." Yet it is an
unfortunate fact that there are too many British businessmen who
could not tell you where Slovakia or Slovenia are on a map. That
is one reason for the campaign, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 18-month campaign aims to create 100 investment projects
and to double British exports to 4 billion pounds (6.8 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Britain's Know How Fund has also to make up to 1.2 million
pounds (2.04 million dollars) available to help businesses with
investment and training schemes.
</P>
<P>
The key elements of the campaign are:
</P>
<P>
-- 30 road shows and seminars around the UK organized through
local Business Links;
</P>
<P>
-- Trade missions each month to Central Europe and from Central
Europe to the UK;
</P>
<P>
-- Support for 15 trade fairs in the region; and
</P>
<P>
-- Advice and information of how to get the most out of
business in Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the launch, Foreign Secretary Malcomlm Rifkind
said, "These are increasingly sophisticated markets in need of
investment, foregin capital and know-how.... This is a great time
to seize the opportunities."

BRUSSELS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The agreement reached on
implementation of Israeli redeployment in Hebron represents a very
important step forward in the Middle East peace process, said a
statement issued today by the European Commission (EC).
</P>

<HEADLINE> 70 Percent of Retired Zambians die soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A study shows that 70 percent of
retired Zambians die within the first three years after their
retirement due to stress and depression.
</P>
<P>
While presenting the study results in Livingstone in the south of
Zambia today, Director in the Department of Labor Ngosa Chisupa
said that the fact that many do not get their package on time leads
to the stress and depression, he was quoted by the Zambia News Agency
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Senior labor officer John Kabwe appealed to the Zambian
government to be serious and ensure that retrenched or retired people
are taken care of by giving them their packages on time, according to
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
He said ''we should retire with our heads up as citizens in this
Christian nation of Zambia. Retirees should be respected and should
not become laughing stalk.''
</P>
<P>
Kabwe regreted that most people have struggled to have their age
on their national registration cards reduced to avoid their despair
and death. enditem

<HEADLINE> Taliban Rejects Demilitarization Of Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
today reiterated its rejection of the demand made by its opponents
for demilitarization of Kabul, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban Information and Culture Minister Amir Muttaqi said in
Kabul that as anti-Taliban factions' representatives set
demilitarization of Kabul as one of the conditions, talks in
Pakistan aimed at establishing peace in Afghanistan ended without
any particular result, reports said.
</P>
<P>
This (demilitarization of Kabul) was "not acceptable to the
Taliban," Muttaqi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
At the Islamabad talks, which ended earlier in the day, the
Taliban delegation had proposed the formation of a joint
commission made up of the Taliban and the groups opposed to it, in
order to oversee a ceasefire and exchange of prisoners, Muttaqi
said.
</P>
<P>
This was rejected by the anti-Taliban groups, he said, adding
that another meeting would take place in February. He did not,
however, specify the date nor the venue for such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Islamabad talks brought together delegates from the Taliban
 militia and those of the coalition led by the northern warlord
Rashid Dostum and ousted defense minister Ahmad Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban vice minister of foreign affairs, Sher Mohammed
Stanakzai, in an interview Monday adopted a tough stand on the
demand for demilitarization of Kabul, made by the opposition
coalition.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out a Taliban pull-out from Kabul, as well as the
setting up of a joint police force or an international force.
</P>
<P>
Stanakzai said the Taliban wanted a negotiated solution to the
conflict which has plagued the country for 20 years, adding that
if none was found, the Taliban would wipe out its detractors.
</P>
<P>
Forces loyal to Dostum control the northwest of Afghanistan
while those led by Masood prevail in three northeastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Another anti-Taliban faction, Shiite Hezb-i-Wahdat, controls
large parts of the central province of Bamian.

<P>
CAIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Vice-President El
Zubeir Mohamed Saleh arrived here today for a visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The unannounced visit came amid escalating tensions in Sudan
as government forces are fighting against rebels in areas
bordering Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Saleh was welcomed upon arrival by Egyptian Prime Minister
Kamal el-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
Cairo-Khartoum ties have been cool since Egypt accused Sudan
of having orchestrated the 1995 failed attempt on the life of the
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa and granting
asylum to Egyptian extremists.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese troops and rebel forces have been engaged in a
military clash since Sunday after two towns on the border with
Ethiopia were attacked by rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
While the Arab League has expressed "deep worries" over the
Sudanese situation, Egypt has given no response so far.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's opposition forces comprise elements from the Umma
Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Sudanese Democratic
Alliance and the Sudan People's Liberation Army.

<HEADLINE> Western Europe Sees Car Sales Rise in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Passenger-car sales in Western
Europe rose 6.6 percent in 1996 with South Korean brands making
the biggest inroads in the lucrative market, the European
Automobile Manufacturers Association said in its latest report.
</P>
<P>
Registration of new passenger cars rose to 12,818,700 last year
from 12,026,900 in 1995 in the 15-nation European Union, plus
Norway and Switzerland, it said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase, the association said it was not satisfied
with the results. "If you look at the underlying factors, you
can't say it's a buoyant market," said a spokesman for the
association.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen AG of Germany, the largest European automaker, was
leading the list of giant automakers as it increased its Western
European market share to 17.2 percent for 1996 from 16.8 percent
in 1995. Meanwhile, its U.S. and French competitors lost ground.
</P>
<P>
Britain's largest automakers -- Ford Motor Co., General Motors
and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG's Rover Group Ltd. -- lost market
shares to importers, which gained 62 percent of the market, up
from 58.9 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The three automakers blamed the loss of their market shares on
the ending of discounts to favored customers and reductions in
fleet sales.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korean automakers hailed 1996 as a year of
success. Their passenger-car sales jumped to 248,509, gaining a
1.9 percent share of the Western European market.
</P>
<P>
And it was not a bad year for car sales in Norway and Ireland,
which saw a separate increase of 38 percent and 32 percent. But
Italy only had a slim increase of 0.3 percent in car sales last
year.
</P>
<P>
Volvo AB, which sold 5.5 percent fewer passenger cars, had a
hard time in 1996 with a dwindling 1.6 percent of market share.
</P>
<P>
Also declining were the shares of PSA Peugeot, Citroen SA and
Renault, which slipped to 11.9 percent, 10.1 percent and 10.3
percent on the Western European market, respectively.

LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government today
said it welcomed the deal signed between Israel and Palestine on
extending Palestinian rule in the West Bank, calling it "an
essential step" in revitalizing the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a written statement issued today, British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said the British government "welcomes
the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians have reached an
agreement on redeployment of Israeli troops from Hebron."
</P>
<P>
"This is an essential step in unblocking the Middle East peace
process, and a reward for persistence. King Hussein's intervention
was particularly helpful, building on the efforts made by the US
and the rest of the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary also urged both sides to make
concrete efforts in other aspects in a bid to achieve a
long-lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to move on swiftly now to other outstanding
elements of the Interim Agreement. The (Middle East) peace process
must continue to move forward," he added.

<P>
HARARE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere said here today African leaders need to first
understand the realities in the Great Lakes region before looking for
solutions to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He told journalists shortly after an hour-long meeting with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in Harare that the region's
problems were inter-linked and needed to be well understood before
efforts were made to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
''What happens in Burundi will also affect Rwanda and Zaire...
Africa should understand that and help the region using this kind of
understanding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Rwanda crisis needed to be dealt with on the
leadership level with the help of the Arusha tribunal, adding that
the country had very high prospects for reconciliation compared to
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
On Burundi, he said, even international sanctions were failing
to produce the desired results and neither were the ongoing talks.
</P>
<P>
''They (sanctions) didn't work that effectively but they at least
helped in the sense that they had created an environment to open
dialogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe is one of the four African heads of state and government
chosen at a summit in December to find lasting solutions to the
situation in the Great Lakes region. enditem

<HEADLINE> World Jewish Congress Ready to Resume Talks With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Jewish Congress (WJC)
is ready to resume constructive talks with Switzerland after
former Swiss President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz sent a letter of
regret to the organization, WJC President Edgar Bronfman said
today.
</P>
<P>
In his reply to Delamuraz's letter, Edgar Bronfman said that he
was satisfied with Delamuraz's explanation. "I am delighted to
resume constructive talks with the Swiss authorities and banks,"
said Bronfman.
</P>
<P>
According to Bronfman, Delamuraz told the WJC that he had not
intended to hurt the feelings of the victims of the Nazi holocaust
and their families. Delamuraz said that he made the remarks based
on imprecise information.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Delamuraz expressed regrets for his
remarks directly to the WJC although he has made similar
statements in the Swiss press.
</P>
<P>
Delamuraz, current Swiss minister of economy, said on December
31, 1996, when he was the Swiss president, that the Jewish demand
to set up a compensation of 250 million francs (about 200 million
U.S. dollars) was "ransom and chantage" and that the idea was to
destabilize Switzerland's international financial status.
</P>
<P>
Delamuraz's controversial remarks made Jewish organizations
like the WJC angry. The WJC suspended the talks on Jewish assets
left in Swiss banks with Switzerland and threatened to boycott
Swiss banks after that.

<HEADLINE> PAC Agrees to Join S. African Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Pan
Africanist Congress (PAC) today accepted in principle President
Nelson Mandela's offer to join the government of national unity,
the South African Press Association (SAPA) has reported.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made soon after a "cordial and fruitful"
meeting between Mandela and newly elected PAC leader Stanley
Mogoba at Mandela's residence in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Although the timetable for the PAC's joining in the cabinet is
yet to be made, the two leaders have agreed to deal with the
matter soon, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mandela urged
political parties throughout the country to work together for the
benefit of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"Let us speak with one voice on matters of national interest.
Let us not waste our energies on issues that will continue to
divide us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Magoba said that in the spirit of national unity,
the PAC would in principle join the government, but it has not
been decided whether he will take a seat in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The PAC, born in April 1959, is a major political party of the
black people in South Africa. It joined the country's multi-party
negotiations in April 1993, but failed to win a seat in the
government after the 1994 general elections.

PARIS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- France has sent more than 15
million francs (3 million U.S. dollars) in humanitarian aid to
refugees in eastern Zaire, said the Office of the French State
Secretary for Emergency Humanitarian Action today.
</P>

since last November to evaluate the humanitarian situation and
launch emergency actions from Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian situation is worsening for some 350,000

500,000 of their fellow refugees returned home, according to the
United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
France has been collaborating with Denmark, international
humanitarian organizations and the UNICEF in dispatching on planes

<HEADLINE> 2 Million UK Children Suffer Malnutrition: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Growing poverty and the
inadequacy of school nutrition, particularly the withdrawal of
school milk, were putting the health of more than 2 million
British children at risk, according to a study published today.
</P>
<P>
The study, the Hunger Within by the School Milk Campaign, a
pressure group fighting for the restoration of free school milk,
said that the loss of free school milk and subsidized hot school
meals had led to malnutrition, and rickets, anaemia and
tuberculosis had all returned to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Free school milk was introduced into primary schools soon after
World War Two, but was scrapped in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was based on a survey of 179 local
authorities and 36 health authorities all over the country, said
that cases of rickets had been found in the Midlands and Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Some impoverished children in Yorkshire were almost eight
pounds lighter and 1.5 inches shorter than their better-off
friends.
</P>
<P>
"Children born healthy are being put at risk of a lifetime of
disability by poor nutrition. Short term policies which reduced
funding for school nutrition are now being shown to have had
alarming consequences," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is calling for free milk for all children under
five and all older children in families on income support. It also
calls for the reinstatement of European school milk subsidies
which were withdrawn in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Repays US With Last Loan Installment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government today
paid the final installment on a 13.5 billion U.S. dollar loan
extended by the U.S. government to help overcome financial
difficulties in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton planned a White House ceremony to
announce the last-batch 3.5 billion dollar payment, according to
an AP report.
</P>
<P>
As Mexico's economic growth is picking up gradually, the
country repaid the loan three years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
By January 1996, Mexico had paid 3 billion dollars in
short-term loans. By August, the country had prepaid 7 billion
dollars of the 10.5 billion dollars still outstanding.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Mexican interest payments amounted to 580
million dollars, a net income for the U.S. treasury.

<HEADLINE> US Plans to Put Tariffs on Argentina Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government planned
to put higher tariffs on 260 million U.S. dollars worth of trade
with Argentina in a dispute over protection of U.S. drug patents,
a senior U.S. trade official said today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision, Acting U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said the sanctions would go into effect on
March 1 following a public comment period, giving both countries
time to negotiate a settlement to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
U.S. pharmaceutical companies complain that their products were
not being protected by Argentina's current copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky said that unless the current dispute was resolved
satisfactorily, the U.S. would withdraw 50 percent of Argentina's
duty-free privileges under the Generalized System of Preferences
(GSP). That would affect 260 million dollars of the 520 million
dollars in products Argentina exported to the United States last
year under the GSP program.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government was issuing a list of proposed target
products and asking for public comment and then it will draw up a
final list of Argentina's goods which would lose GSP preferences.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky said that Argentina had made some progress in
meeting U.S. demands for better copyright protection but had not
gone far enough.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan welcomed today the signing of an interim deal by Israel
and the Palestinians on a partial withdrawal from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general is very much encouraged by the

"He considers this to be an important achievement, which he
hopes will now pave the way for further progress towards the full
implementation of the process envisaged in the Declaration of
Principles agreed in Oslo," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The interim agreement set out a series of broad guidelines,
dividing the city into an area to be patrolled solely by the
Palestinians, about 80 percent of the city, and an area where the
Palestinians would have civil powers and responsibilities over
Palestinians, but Israel "will retain all powers and

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urges Turkey to Follow Demilitarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A Cyprus government spokesman
today called on Turkey to follow President Glafcos Clerides'
proposal for the demilitarization of this east Mediterranean
island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing here today, Yiannakis
Cassoulides said "if Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan
wishes Cyprus to be an island of peace, he can not but seriously
examine the president's proposal for demilitarization of
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on Erbakan's statement in
Istanbul on Tuesday, which called for disarmament in Cyprus and
the Greek islands in the Aegean as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides' proposal submitted to the U.N. in 1993
envisages the disband of the Cyprus Republic's armed forces and
the delivery of its weapons to U.N. custody in parallel with a
similar move on the part of the Turkish Cypriot forces and the
simultaneous withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has so far not met with a positive response
from the Turkish side.
</P>
<P>
Referring to statements from the Turkish military, Cassoulides
said the Cyprus government will face Turkish threats with
"wisdom and calmness."
</P>
<P>
Ismail Hakki Karadayi, Chief of Turkey's armed forces, said
during his recent visit to the Turkish-controlled northern
Cyprus that Turkey will stand by the Turkish Cypriots and do
whatever it could to protect them.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops landed and
seized 37 percent of the island following a short-lived coup
seeking union with Greece by some Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Some 35,000 Turkish troops has been stationed in northern

(By Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A sustainable
industrial development policy for Tanzania was officially
launched here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony of the 1996-2020 industrial
policy, Minister for Industries and Trade Abdalah Kigoda said the
policy will focus on poverty alleviation, people's development
and promotion of the private sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
It will also focus on the consolidation of existing and new
industrial development in the coming two decades.
</P>
<P>
He said the national goals, towards which the industrial
sector will be geared, include human resources development and
creation of employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"In this policy, we have taken all important consideration in
addressing local industrial protection, import management,
transit trade, cross border trade problems and the recent trade
agreement among the SADC countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the policy has also critically addressed
aspects like incentive package to investors, infrastructural
facilities like roads, airports, harbors and railways.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned that for any policy to achieve its aims
and objectives sectoral co-operation is needed, saying that the
policy has also taken into account such prerequisite.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece Stick to Joint Defense Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Greece have
reaffirmed their common adherence to a joint policy on defense
issues, Cyprus' Defense Minister Costas Eliades said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Cyprus Radio in Athens after two days of
talks, Eliades said that "the Greco-Cypriot defense pact proceeds
as planned and provides an answer to Turkish threats and
strengthens our negotiating position."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece clinched a joint defense pact in 1993,
which provides for sea, air and land cover for Cyprus from
Greece in the event of Turkish offensive.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Cyprus' recent decision to buy Russian-made
S-300 surface-to-air missiles, Eliades said that Cyprus did not
cause any tension, but on the contrary it is ready to
contribute to efforts to reduce tension and begin negotiations
for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Eliades is currently in Athens for talks with the
leadership of the Greece's National Defense Ministry. The talks
are expected to focus on security issues and issues related
to the joint defense pact agreed upon by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He was accompanied by National Guard Commander Nicolaos
Vorvolakos and the president and members of the House of
Representatives' Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
House Defense Committee President Takis Hadjidemetriou also
said in Athens today that Cyprus will not take any military
action if Turkey does not launch a fresh offensive against the
island.
</P>
<P>
"The consolidation of the Turkish occupation of part of the
island will be met with political and diplomatic means and
this is the path the government follows," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following
a coup seeking union with Greece.

CAIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat is due here early next week to brief the Arab League
(AL) and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the details of the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will also extend his thanks to Mubarak for the Egyptian

Esmat Abdul Meguid a copy of the redeployment protocol, the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Arafat received from the Egyptian president a
message which dealt with the future steps to be taken for further
negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians on expanding
Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
A Hebron deal was initialed in the small hours today by the
Palestinians and Israelis following a summit between Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after four months of hard bargainings
between the Palestinians and Israelis. It is unclear for the time
being whether a formal signing ceremony will be held for the
Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
In line with the document, Israel will complete the troop pullback
from 80 percent of the West Bank town of Hebron within two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan Pay Tribute to Pooled Arab Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Jordan today paid
tribute to the pooled efforts by Arab countries to deliver a deal
to expand the Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa hailed the Hebron
agreement signed at an early hour today between the Palestinians
and Israelis "a step on the right path."
</P>
<P>
While praising the American key role, Moussa underlined the
important efforts by Arab countries in general and Egypt and Jordan
in particular in securing the Hebron deal in line with the Madrid
peace framework.
</P>
<P>
In statements to reporters, Moussa said the agreement "opens
the door for the definitive implementation within an agreed
timetable.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the good implementation of the agreement would
encourage progress on the other tracks, namely the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
The top Egyptian diplomat dismissed the suspicion that Israel
would ignore the U.S. guarantees that the redeployment takes
place at the set dates according to the agreement as it did on
previous occasions.
</P>
<P>
He said it is impossible to ignore that progress made
in the peace process in a reference to the fact that Israeli
forces had already withdrawn from a number of cities with Hebron
remaining as the last city under occupation.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Jordanian Ambassador to Egypt Nayef
Saud al-Qadi expressed hope that the Hebron agreement would be a
key element in activating the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Qadi, also his country's chief delegate to the Arab League,
said the Egyptian and Jordanian role could not possibly be
separated from the Arab role in pushing forward the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that "the clear coordination between Cairo and
Amman in bypassing the Hebron obstacles would succeed in solving
other problems in the way."
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after four months of hard bargainings
between the PNA and Israel, pushed by tortuous mediations involving
the U.S., EU, Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The latest breakthrough came after Arafat agreed to a
Jordanian-Egyptian initiative that Israel could prolong its
three-stage pullbacks from the West Bank rural areas to the middle
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis initialed the executive protocol
on implementing the agreement previously signed between the two
sides following a summit between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu in the early hours of today.
</P>
<P>
Under the document, Israel will complete the troop pullback
from 80 percent of the West Bank town of Hebron within two
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Mexico to Repay US With Final Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced today that the Mexican government was repaying the final
3.5 billion U.S. dollars of the 13.5 billion dollar loans that the
U.S. had offered in 1995, three years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo told him through
telephone today that Mexico was repaying the final instalment of
the loans.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the loans helped Mexico survive an economic
crisis, earned the United States 580 million dollars in interest
payments and led to increased U.S. exports to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
By January 1996, Mexico had paid 3 billion dollars in
short-term loans and by August, it had prepaid 7 billion dollars
of the loans.
</P>
<P>
The early payment underscores an economic recovery in Mexico
from its 1995 financial crisis. Preliminary estimates put 1996
growth at about 4 percent and analysts say 1997 growth could reach
4.5 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. loans aroused controversy in the United States. When
Clinton intended to offer financial assistance to Mexico to help
it overcome its crisis, the Congress opposed it. Some politicians
called Clinton's action as "daylight robbery of the nation's
wealth" and said the loan would never be repaid.
</P>
<P>
After the Congress' refusal, Clinton negotiated a deal with
congressional leaders from both parties under which the United
States and foreign leaders arranged a loan program of up to 50
billion U.S. dollars. Clinton contributed the U.S. share without
requiring formal congressional approval by using 20 billion
dollars in funds from the Exchange Stabilization Fund.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had argued that the U.S. could not afford to ignore a
potential economic disaster on its southern border, especially
after the two countries began a free-trade zone with Canada in
January 1994.
</P>
<P>
At a signing ceremony on the repayment at the White House
today, Clinton said that two years ago, "some said that we should
not get involved, that the money would never be repaid, that
Mexico should fend for itself. They were wrong."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Today the American people can be proud that we did
the right thing by Mexico and the right thing for the United
States and the right thing to protect global prosperity."

<HEADLINE> Cargo Handled by Dar Port Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Cargo handled by the
Tanzania Harbor Authority (THA) at Dar es Salaam Port has
declined substantially in recent months.
</P>
<P>
According to a THA report today, the deteriorating performance
of the port should be attributed to unfavorable political and
economic environment in the east and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the third quarter of 1996 declined to 225,370 tons
from 303,044 tons in the same period the previous year, owing to
the uncertain political climate following the first multi-party
general elections in October, 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the third quarter of 1996, Burundi and Ugandan imports
handled by the port declined substantially from 29,878 tons and
4,365 tons to 16,437 tons and 2,949 tons respectively in the same
period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Exports passing through the port in 1996 also declined from
161,933 tons to 144,992 tons, according to THA.
</P>
<P>
The total cargo handled by the port in the third quarter of
1996 declined to 370,362 tons from 464,977 tons.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the number of countries using Dar es
Salaam Port for their exports and imports increased from nine in
1995 to 11 in 1996. But the total volume of exports and imports
was lower than that in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Both imports and exports were in decline owing to political
instability in countries such as Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The Major countries using the port for delivering cargoes are
Zambia, Zaire, Burundi, Rwanda, Malawi, Uganda and Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
<P>

growth of 3.25 percent in 1996, the country's Federal Office of
Statistics (FOS) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The government agency, which based the growth on the very

<P>
The mining and quarrying sector takes the lead with a 6.82
percent growth, followed by the agricultural crops, livestocks,
forestry and fishing sector with a 3.8 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing and distributive sectors had a slight
increase of 0.7 and 0.85 percent respectively, while other
sectors combined grew 2.54 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the publication, the primary industry, which
consists of agriculture, livestocks, forestry and fishing,
contributed 35.45 percent of the growth, representing the highest
share to the GDP last year.
</P>
<P>
The contribution of the petroleum and gas sector to real
growth stood at 34.45 percent while that of the wholesale and
retail trade came at 15.27 percent.
</P>
<P>
The FOS report said the share of exports in the country's GDP
last year decreased by 2.91 percent, from 37.84 percent to 34.94
percent, while that of imports dropped substantially by 8.86
percent, from 47.34 percent to 38.48 percent.

However, the agency failed to give concrete figures to show
the nation's foreign trade in the past year.

<HEADLINE> Luxembourg Foreign Minister Visits Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister of Luxembourg
Jacques Poos arrived here this evening for a visit to Syria in
line with the European Union policy on seeking to play a greater
role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Poos was greeted at the Damascus airport by
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed Syrian sources, the Luxembourg
foreign minister will hold talks with Shara on the Middle East
peace process, especially its future prospects, and the obstacles
the process is facing on account of Israel's intransigent policies
towards Syria.
</P>
<P>
The two men will focus the discussion on the Israeli-Syrian
track of negotiations and exchange views on the latest regional
and international developments.
</P>
<P>
In his arrival statement, the Luxembourg foreign minister said
that Europe was extremely interested in the peace process and had
appointed a special envoy to the region to help promote the peace
march.
</P>
<P>
On the Hebron accord the Palestinians and Israelis initialed in
the small hours today, he said the document did solve a small part
of the important problems facing the peace process. He expressed
the belief that it was opportune to move forward and achieve
progress along all tracks of peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Poos said that the success of the Middle East peace process
needs the support from the U.S., the European Union and the Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Poos visited Egypt and met with Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdul Meguid on the peace process and
regional developments. Poos carried a message to the league on the
need to support President of the Palestinian Authority Yasser
Arafat.
</P>

Poos, who arrived in Cairo Monday night within the framework of
his regional tour.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg will assume the rotating EU presidency in the later
half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed to appoint a peace envoy to the region on
October 5. The 15-member block, urged by France, has been seeking
to play a greater role in the Middle East peace process, in which it
is already a chief financial backer.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Urged to Protect Returning Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A representative of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today urged the
Burundian government to take urgent steps to ensure that the
military did not harm returning refugees, said the Geneva-based
UNHCR in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR representative in Burundi Hitoshi Mise was assured by
Burundian Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama that the Burundian
government would strive to ensure that the incident last Friday of
the killings of 122 Burundian refugees having returned from
Tanzania was not repeated.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in the Burundian capital of Bujumbura,
Rukingama said that his government also deplored the incident and
suggested that a number of measures to improve the situation.
Burundi has sent a message to the United Nations concerning the
incident.
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, UNHCR High Commissioner Sadako Ogata said, "I was
deeply distressed by these killings. I am pleased that the
governments involved have assured me that steps will be taken to
prevent such a thing from happening again and that the culprits
will be severely dealt with. I repeat my call for all governments
in the region to act in a humanitarian manner to the hundreds of
thousands of people who have been displaced by conflicts there."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dennis McNamara, the UNHCR's international
protection division director, who was sent to the region at the
weekend, has held talks with high Tanzanian officials, expressing
concern over both the Burundi killings and the fate of thousands
of Rwandan refugees who remain in Tanzania, the UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 220,000 Burundian refugees in Tanzania now
and hundreds more are coming into the country each day, according
to the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said that Tanzanian ministers expressed regret over
the expulsion of the Burundian refugees. They said that the return
was not authorized by the government, whose policy was not to
return refugees to Burundi at this stage.
</P>
<P>
McNamara was assured that "very stern action" would be taken
against those responsible and that nothing of the kind would be
allowed to happen again.

<HEADLINE> De Klerk Announces Steps Toward New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National
Party (NP) leader F.W.De Klerk today announced a series of steps
to set up a new political movement that might develop into a new
political party.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria, De Klerk said these steps
would include more urgent and more substantive talks with
political parties such as the Inkatha Freedom Party and the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
"It will be good for the country if a new movement can
manifest itself with a view to the 1999 elections," said De
Klerk.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, He said the NP would draw up a new negotiation
strategy and action plan before February 10.
</P>
<P>
During a behind-the-doors meeting last week, the NP Executive
agreed a new approach was necessary to realize the party's
vision, but it did not contemplate changing its name to absorb
other parties.
</P>
<P>
The NP, traditionally a white-only political party, had been a
ruling party since 1948 until its withdrawal from the African
National Congress (ANC)-led Government of National Unity in May
last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, De Klerk said his party is planning to hold talks
not only with other parties, but with community leaders,
organizations and individuals to "break the stereotype
party-political pattern".
</P>
<P>
Referring to the agreement in principle by the Pan Africanist
Congress (PAC) to join the Government of National Unity earlier
in the day, De Klerk said PAC's presence would not change the
fact that the government was dominated by the ANC.
</P>
<P>
Newly-elected PAC leader Stanley Mogoba accepted in principle
President Nelson Mandela's offer to join the government after a
"cordial and fruitful" meeting at Mandela's Houghton home in
Johannesburg.

<HEADLINE> US Official: More Weapons Not Mean More Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. official said here today
more soldiers and more weapons do not mean more security in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department official Carey Cavanaugh made the
remarks after the three-hour talks with Turkish Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Onur Oymen on the missiles crisis in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh said that his talks with the Turkish high-ranking
officials were "constructive and productive."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official arrived here this afternoon following his
visits to Cyprus and Greece in a bid to ease the tension of the
missiles on the east Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
His contacts in this region will make contributions to
disperse the atmosphere of the crisis in Cyprus, said Cavanaugh.
</P>
<P>
To cool down the Turkish tempers, the U.S. official said upon
his arrival in Ankara he did not believe the Cyprus government
will carry out its decision to acquire the S-300 Russian-made
missiles which are said to be capable of downing Turkish jets
over Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel told reporters
today that the missiles crisis on the divided island cannot be
solved unless the Cyprus government gives up the arms deal to
buy the surface-to-air missiles worth of 250 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh said Monday night in Nicosia, capital of Cyprus,
that Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides had promised not to
install the anti-aircraft missiles for the next 16 months, which
the U.S. official believed will ease the tension on the island.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here today by the Turkish Foreign Ministry
said that northern Cyprus leader Rauf Denktas will pay a two-day
visit to Turkey between January 20 and 22 at the invitation of
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to discuss the latest
developments on the Cyprus issue and the measures against the
Cyprus government.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since 1974 when the Turkish
troops landed and took control of the northern third of the
island following an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Some 35,000-strong Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus to protect the Turkish Cypriots on the island.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Urges Continued Momentum for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- In a farewell speech on
Wednesday, outgoing Secretary of State Warren Christopher, while
hailing a Hebron deal, urged Israel and the Palestinians to
continue their momentum on the direction of the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
But he also said the United States faces an aid cut for Israel
and Egypt if Congress continues to insist on further reductions in
overseas spending.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of
Government in his final formal address, Christopher said: "Now
that the parties have taken this difficult step, they must not
step back in fatigue. They must now use this new momentum to move
ahead to build the peace that is in the common interest of
Israelis and Palestinians alike."
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators signed an accord on Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron at Midnight on
Tuesday after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held a summit at the Erez
crossing between Israel and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Israel will withdraw its troops
from 80 percent of Hebron in 10 days and implement a three-staged
pullout from the West Bank rural areas before August 1998.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, after receiving calls from the two
leaders, said in a statement that the Hebron deal "brings us
another step closer to a lasting, secure Middle East peace."
</P>
<P>
Christopher said the United States has helped the two parties
reach the agreement because it has "resources to support those who
took the risks for peace."
</P>
<P>
But he admitted the Clinton administration might have to cut
aid for the Middle East if Congress continues to slash its
assistance program.
</P>
<P>
"Aid to Israel, Egypt and Jordan will inevitably come under
pressure, perhaps irresistible pressure, if our other assistance
program continued to be decimated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who will leave his office in five days and returns
to California, warned further reduction of overseas spending would
lead the United States to a new form of isolationism, which he
said would affect self-bragged U.S. "leadership" in the world.
</P>
<P>
Christopher also said the United States should pay its 1.1
billion dollar debt to the United Nations, which is hobbled
because of U.S. arrears.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Deputy PM Spared Trial on Corruption Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A decision made by the Turkish
parliamentary inquiry commission today exempted Turkish Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller from a trial in
the Supreme Court on charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that Ciller, Turkey's first woman prime
minister, was rescued by her ruling coalition partner, the
Welfare Party (RP) led by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan. The
vote was eight from the coalition deputies against seven from the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
The commission dismissed the claims that the Ciller family's
assets were greatly boosted while she was a cabinet member and
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The commission, however, failed to give a reasonable answer
for the acquisition of her family's properties, including
business, real estate and financial sources.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry commission's third blockade of the probe into
the Ciller's alleged corruption case provoked strong protest from the
opposition, which suspected that the ruling coalition was trying
to shield Ciller.
</P>
<P>
The commission chairman Naci Terzi, who is from the RP,
emphasized that everyone, including the press, should respect the
commission's decision.
</P>
<P>
Although Ciller had tried to prove the legitimacy of her
huge private assets, she found it difficult to justify herself
throughout the course.
</P>
<P>
The parliament set up the inquiry commission to investigate
corruption charges against Ciller after the RP, which was the
opposition at that time, submitted such a motion in April
last year.
</P>
<P>
Facing a possible trial by the Supreme Court, Ciller pulled
out from an earlier coalition government partner the Motherland
Party after its leader Mesut Yilmaz voted for the motion for
an investigation against Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Ciller then reversed her hostility toward the RP and set
up a coalition with it regardless of the accusations that she
made a U-turn to avoid the possible trial.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The 13th World Taekwondo
Championships and the Sixth Women's World Taekwondo Championships
are to be held during November 18-23 at the Hong Kong Coliseum,
organizers announced here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first world-class sporting event to be hosted
by Hong Kong after the handover in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
And Hong Kong will participate in the world championships by
using the name of "Hong Kong, China" for the first time, according
to Ching Men Ky, president of the Hong Kong Taekwondo Association
and president of the Organizing Committee (OC).
</P>
<P>
Invitations had been sent to all the 144 member associations of
the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF), the sport's world governing
body, and some 1,000 participants are expected at the world
championships, according to OC officials.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the third to host the biennial event in the Asian
region after South Korea and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The total cost for hosting the championships is estimated as
1.5 million U.S. dollars. The sum has to be raised entirely by
the organizers, WTF officials said.
</P>
<P>
WTF vice-presidents Josiah Henson of the Unite States, Ching
Woo Lee of South Korea and Manuel Marco Saila from Spain arrived
here earlier this week in a five-member WTF survey team to look
into the preparations for the championships.
</P>
<P>
The WTF officials expressed satisfaction with the Hong Kong
Coliseum, the site of the event, and hoped there would be enough
spectators.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Hong Kong association expressed their
confidence that the 12,000-seat stadium will be filled at the
time.
</P>
<P>
An OC delegation will visit Beijing in March to hold
discussions with China's State Physical Culture and Sports
Commission on such issues as cooperation in the world
championships and in the future.
</P>
<P>
The possible change of name for the Hong Kong association might
be one of the topics for the discussions, according to Ching Men
Ky, president of the association.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison
Group (JLG) will discuss a number of important issues concerning
the 1999 handover of power at its 28th plenary session scheduled
for late March here.
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour-plus meeting here today with his Portuguese
counterpart, Guo Jiading, chief representative of the Chinese side
of the JLG, told reporters that topics of the coming session have
been prepared well at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We have talked about the three leading issues of the
transition (the localization of law and civil servants and the use
of Chinese as an official language) at today's meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also exchanged views on many issues related to the handover
of power in 1999," he added.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that the two sides have come to better understanding
after the meeting, which covered issues such as the treasury reserve
of Macao, the transfer of archives and government assets, the
nationality question and the question of the "Oriental
Foundation."
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Chief representative Antonio Carlos said that the
two sides discussed the issues in detail and made a good
preparation for the coming plenary session.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong To Continue Free Trade Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will continue to
practice unwaveringly a free trade policy and to play a leading
role in world trade liberalization after June 30, a Hong Kong
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon meeting hosted by the Hong Kong
Exporters' Association, Alan Lai, Director of Trade said: "The
changeover will not affect Hong Kong's bilateral relations with
our trading partners as the Sino-British Joint Declaration
provides clearly that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) shall retain the status of a free port and continue a free
trade policy."
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law,
Hong Kong SAR will continue to be a separate customs territory
with full autonomy in developing external commercial relations,
and will continue to take part in international organizations,
including the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Asia-Pacific
Economic Co-operation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has been participating actively and constructively
in the international trade forums and will continue to do so when
it becomes an SAR," said the official.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Hong Kong will focus on trade and investment
liberalization in such fields as textiles, clothing and
telecommunications.

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has threatened to fine KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and its
U.S. partner, Northwest Airlines, for failing to provide the EC
with details of their planned alliance, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The procedure that could lead to fines has been suspended after
the carriers promised to supply the information quickly, according
to commission resources quoted in an Agence France-Presse report
from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the EC threatened to take legal action
against the proposed alliance between British Airways and American
Airlines, saying the alliance will "eliminate all
competition ... on the market for transportation of passengers
between the U.K. and the U.S."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EC is also examining the implications for
competition of a proposed link-up among Scandinavian Airlines
System, Lufthansa and United Airlines and one between Swissair and

<HEADLINE> Major Breakthrough in Sino-US Scientific Relations(1) (By Li Xiguang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) --Scientific links between China
and the United States in the next few years and towards the 21st
century took a giant step forward in Beijing tonight.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious U.S. National Academy of Sciences agreed to
devote most of its funds for international cooperation in the
coming years to programs that will bring together the most
outstanding young scientists of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement signed between Professor Zhou Guangzhao,
president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Dr. Bruce
Alberts, president of U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the two
sides agreed that the two academies "will enhance their
partnership for the benefit of both countries and that of the
world at large."
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after a two-day behind-doors meeting
between Chinese and U.S. scientific leaders which ended tonight in
the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that U.S. National Academy of Sciences
had sent a 14-member high-level delegation to China since 1988 and
signed a joint statement with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"The defining challenge for the 21st century is achieving a
sustainable, desirable life for the world's people," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"China is the world's most populous country and is experiencing
extraordinarily rapid economic growth, and the United States is
both the world's largest economy and the most prolific consumer of
resources," it noted.
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries, therefore, have a special responsibility
and opportunity in working together to apply science and
technology in achieving the goal of sustainability, and
consequently improved management of well over a third of the
world's resources, " it added.

<HEADLINE> China Highly Evaluates South-South Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The just concluded South-South
Conference on Trade, Investment and Finance was the most important
event since the similar conference was convened in Caracas 16
years ago, a senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Long Yongtu, assistant minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation, said that with
globalization and liberalization, the world economy experiences a
fundamental change in the past decades. Under the new situation,
developing countries should strengthen cooperation so as to make
good use of opportunities and accept challenges arising from
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The San Jose Declaration and Plan of Action, adopted at the
three-day conference which closed Wednesday, provided principles
and guidelines for future South-South cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, the dialogue between developing countries
and UN agencies engaged in development and trade will strengthen
their cooperation. As a small number of developed countries
attempted to weaken the function of these UN agencies,
representatives of developing countries expressed strong support
for them, thus boosting their role in coming years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Long said that South-South cooperation has a bright prospect
thanks to the rapid economic growth of East Asia and other
developing countries, the active intra-regional and sub-regional
cooperation among developing countries, and understanding and
support on the part of some developed countries.
</P>
<P>
On relations between China and other developing countries, he
said that though China's economy has developed healthily in recent
years, China is and will always be a member of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthening friendship and cooperation with other developing
countries is a basic policy of China. China will always support
and safeguard the interests of developing countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU, Japan Resolve Music Copyright Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Some of Europe's biggest
musical names will enjoy better copyright protection in Japan for
the hits they produced in the 1950s and 1960s, as Japan finally
agreed to accept new rules after a year of tough negotiations with
the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Diet, or parliament, has agreed to backdate to 50
years ago the intellectual property protection it grants to
performers and producers of European sound recordings, giving the
full 50-year cover required under world trade rules.
</P>
<P>
The European recording industry, one of Europe's most dynamic
exporters, will thus avoid annual losses in royalties of up to 100
million ECUs (about 130 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Japan's previous rules only extended an intellectual property
cover back to 1971, missing out on some of Europe's most
successful music exports, including the Beatles, the Rolling
Stones and classical performers such as Herbert von Karajan and
Karl Bohm.
</P>
<P>
EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said the agreement
"demonstrates the effectiveness of the multilateral trading system
at helping Europe resolve disputes, open markets and prevent
piracy."
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough followed a year of discussions between Japan
and the European Commission, which ultimately brought the European
complaint before the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
A WTO-based agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual
property rights requires all its members to give at least 50
years' protection to performers and producers of sound
recordings.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Minorities Key to Dutch Population Growth: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The overall Dutch population
is expected to grow by 700,000 to 16.2 million over the next 25
years, chiefly due to an estimated 1.6 million rise in the ethnic
minority population, the Statistics Netherlands said today.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by the organization on the country's future
labor supply found that Dutch minorities will increase from 1.2
million in 1995 to 2.8 million in 2020, while the Dutch majority
population will drop 900,000 to 13.4 million.
</P>
<P>
Moroccans, Turks, Surinamese and Indonesians live together with
the dominant Dutch community in the Western European country.
</P>
<P>
The study predicted a larger labor force of 7-8 million in two
decades, up from the 6.4 million at present. The increase, faster
than that in other European countries, is attributed to an
estimated surge in female workers.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the Dutch will be better educated in
2020.

A total of 3.5 billion yuan will be raised through the bond
issue, which will be mainly invested in the nation's key railway
projects including the Jingjiu (Beijing-Kowloon) Railway, Nankun
(Nanning-Kunming) Railway, and Chenkun (Chendu-Kunming) Electrified
Railway.
</P>
<P>
Guaranteed by the Ministry of Railways, the bond issue was

<P>
"Capital shortage is the biggest problem facing China's railway
construction," Vice Ninister of Railways Sun Yongfu said, adding
that the ministry will tap the capital market more actively in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The issue includes three-year and five-year bonds, valued at
two billion and 1.5 billion yuan, respectively. They carry an
annual interest rate of 11 percent and 12 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bonds are also expected to be listed on the Shenzhen
Securities Exchange once the public offer is completed, according
to Shao Chun, president of China Securities Company, which is the
leading underwriter of the bond issue.
</P>
<P>
China has twice issued bonds to finance railway projects, in
1992 and 1995 respectively, raising 3.53 billion yuan in
total.

<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Trade Point Beijing, a new
member of the Global Trade Point Network of the United Nations,
started a pilot operation today in the country's capital.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing point will act as a non-profit making intermediate
dealer for foreign trade enterprises. It will help them get
information and business opportunities in the international
market, and have all the necessary work done before a deal is made.
</P>
<P>
Each of the governmental organs related to foreign trade will
set up an office in the business hall of the Beijing point,
including banks, insurance companies, customs, ocean shipping
companies, and commodities inspection departments.
</P>
<P>
The point is an important step for Beijing to realize the
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) of foreign trade, said Xu Xiaoxi,
deputy director of the Municipal Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Commission.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the Global Trade Point Network was suggested
at the 8th Trade and Development Conference of the United Nations
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Its purpose is to help generate more business opportunities for
the medium and small-sized foreign trade enterprises of
developing countries in the international market.
</P>
<P>
About 100 countries and regions have built a network of 140 of
U.N. points over the past few years. The Beijing point is the
second in China, with the first already operational in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Tiawan Noodle Giant Expands Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan-funded Tinghsin
International Group, an instant noodles giant, has made a new
investment worth 30 million US dollars in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The group is famous for its brand-name product "Master Kang,"
eaten by many families in China.
</P>
<P>
The new company, Shenyang Ting Yi International Food Company,
was set up in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning
Province, today.
</P>
<P>
The company, with four production lines, will be able to
produce nearly 50,000 boxes of instant noodles daily. It is
expected to generate an output value of 1.2 billion yuan (about
132 million US dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
The company is the 42nd subsidiary the group has set up in the
mainland. The group has invested more than one billion US dollars,
and employs more than 23,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Tinghsin group started to invest in the mainland in
1989. Two years later it went into production of instant noodles.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the group's sales volume exceeded five billion yuan
(about 602 million US dollars). The group plans to increase its
assembly lines in the mainland from current 68 to 78 by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
A company executive said that northeast China is a prospective
market for the Tinghsin group. Last year the group sold 610
million yuan worth of products in the region, nearly one eighth of
its sales volume in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
A US market survey organization "SRG" has reported that the
Tinghsin group occupies more than a quarter of the instant noodles
market in the inland area.

"The need for improvement is urgent, since all resource
indicators -- changes in the atmosphere, loss of topsoil, loss of
forests, the extinction of organisms -- have moved sharply and
continuously downward during the second half of the twentieth

<HEADLINE> Japan Begins to Recover Oil From Sunken Russian Tanker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Maritime Disaster
Prevention Center started to scoop up the fuel oil remaining in
the grounded bow of a wrecked Russian tanker in the Sea of Japan
today to prevent further pollution, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The operation, which was previously scheduled for Wednesday but
suspended due to rough seas and strong winds, may prevent the oil
spill from drifting further north to the shores of Toyama and
Niigata prefectures.
</P>
<P>
The spill has already affected the coasts of Shimane, Tottori,
Hyogo, Kyoto, Fukui and Ishikawa prefectures, where local people
are concerned about adverse effects on maritime products and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The Russian tanker, Nakhodka, carrying some 19,000 kiloliters
of fuel oil, broke into two during a storm on January 2, and the
bow of the 13,157-ton tanker ran aground in waters in Mikuni,
Fukui prefecture.
</P>
<P>
At least 5,000 kilomiters of oil have spilled from the bow,
polluting 450 kilometers of coastline in six prefectures in
western and central Japan, according to the latest estimate by the
Maritime Safety Agency.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Chairman's Interview with U.S. Journalists (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, accepted an
interview recently by correspondents of the English-language
monthly magazine ``China Information'', published in the United
States. Following are the questions and answers of the interview.
</P>
<P>
Question: It is said that the problem between China, a new
rising political and economic power, and the United States, the
superpower that is playing the leading role internationally, is a
contention for world leadership in the 21st century. What do
you think of the relations between the two countries?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Chinese people love peace. China's policy has always
been to develop friendly relations and cooperation with all
countries including the United States on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Since China initiated the policy of the reform and opening to
the outside world, the Chinese people have scored achievements that
have drawn attention of the world in national construction. We are
fully confident that China will become a strong, prosperous,
democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country. At
the same time we are keenly aware that China is a developing
country with a huge population and a poor economic
foundation. The country's economic development level is not high
and its regional development is uneven. China's per capita GNP is
still very low, with about 80 percent of the population living in
rural areas. About 60 million Chinese still have difficulty in
securing adequate food and clothing. Therefore, the work of
development is still arduous. As we march forward, we are bound to
encounter many difficulties and challenges. It will take a long
period of development and need the hard work of several generations
before the modernization of China is realized.
</P>
<P>
The development of China means a growth in world forces
favoring peace. Because of our historical experiences and our
practical needs, we do treasure our hard-won independence and
freedom, as well as the rare peaceful international
environment. China has always pursued an independent foreign
policy of peace. It is diametrically opposed to both hegemonism
and power politics in any form, and never seeks
hegemony. Naturally, there does not exist the question of
contention between China and any other country for so-called
"leadership."
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two years ago, Deng Xiaoping solemnly declared at the
Sixth Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly that
China would never become a superpower. Our country currently does
not pose a threat to any other country, and it will not do so even
when it is fully developed and when its overall national strength
has increased. As a matter of fact, the stability and development
of China constitute an indispensable and important factor in
peace, stability and development in the world. China will always be
friendly to all other countries and will unswervingly devote
itself to world peace and development.

Maintaining and developing a sound relationship between China
and the United States will benefit both countries and the world as
a whole. China is the largest developing country and has bright
prospects for development and great market potentials. The United
States is the largest developed country. Therefore, the two
countries share extensive and important common
interests. According to Deng Xiaoping, there is a solid foundation
for Sino-U.S. relations, that is, the two countries can help each
other to develop their economies and safeguard their economic
interests. It conforms to the fundamental interests of the two
countries, and is the common aspiration shared by their people to
increase bilateral cooperation in economic affairs, trade,
science, technology and in other areas. I have met with people
from industrial, commercial and other communities in the United
States. They all hope that China and the United States will acquire a
better understanding of each other, and strengthen cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States are very influential countries in
the world; they are both permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council. They shoulder important responsibilities for
safeguarding world peace and stability, and for promoting world
economic development and prosperity. It is necessary for the two
countries to strengthen cooperation in international affairs. In
the fundamental interests of the two countries and in accordance
with the requirements for human cooperation and world historical
progress, we hope to develop a long-term, sound and stable
relationship with the United States and make concerted efforts to
create a glorious 21st century of peace, stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The key to improving Sino-U.S.relations lies in strictly
abiding by the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques. If this is done,
the relationship will develop smoothly. If not, problems will crop
up. Practice has demonstrated that to be true time and time
again. In general, Sino-U.S. relations have shown a tendency
toward development over the past few years, but also have
experienced some twists and turns along the way for the reasons I
have just mentioned. Recently, with concerted efforts of both
sides, bilateral relations have improved to some extent, and the
two countries have begun to have more contacts and consultations,
and have begun to exchange visits at the high level, which
is a good start. As long as the two countries take a strategic
perspective, and strictly observe the three Sino-U.S. Joint
Communiques, they will be able to develop a constructive
cooperative relationship.

<P>
Q: Public opinions overseas have always paid close attention to
the Taiwan issue. What would you like to say about this?
</P>
<P>
A: It is the common aspiration of the Chinese people both at
home and abroad to reunify Taiwan with the mainland. The
reunification is in the fundamental interests of the Chinese
nation. We have never been vague on this issue. Just as Deng
Xiaoping pointed out, there is no room for manoeuvre on issues
related to sovereignty. Of course, as the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits have been separated for about 50 years, they cannot be
reunified in an instant. Reunification will take time, and so far
we have been patient enough. But what is important is that we must
advance in the direction of reunification. Since the second half
of 1995, we have been waging the struggle against the scheme of
splitting China and the "independence of Taiwan". This is to
demonstrate to the various forces in Taiwan which stir up the
splitting of China or the "independence of Taiwan", as well as to
the international community that we are determined and able to
safeguard China's sovereignty and its territorial integrity, and
that under no circumstances will we allow the splitting of Taiwan
from China. The basic principle we adhere to on settling the
Taiwan issue is "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two
systems", which is the most reasonable way to settle the issue.
On the eve of the Spring Festival of 1995, President Jiang Zemin
delivered an important speech concerning the principle. We have
consistently proposed that the two sides should, in accordance
with the principle of one China, settle differences through
negotiations and consultations to create conditions for the
reunification of the motherland. Of course, the Taiwan authorities
must halt activities aimed at creating "two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan" in the international arena because these activities
run counter to the one-China principle, and ruin the foundations
for a peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is part of China's territory. The settlement of the
Taiwan issue is the internal affair of China, as are the ways to
settle this issue. The involvement of the United States in the
Taiwan issue has made the issue a sensitive question in
Sino-U.S. relations. China hopes the US government will strictly
abide by the principles defined in the three Sino-US Joint
Communiques, and not allow the Taiwan issue to hinder the
development of Sino-US relations. This not only benefits China,
but is also in the fundamental interests of the United States.
The US government has indicated repeatedly that it will continue
to pursue the one-China policy and that it will not support Taiwan
in joining the United Nations or the "independence of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
We hope the US government will uphold that attitude for a long
time to come and handle the Taiwan issue properly and with
caution, while taking into consideration the overall Sino-US
relationship as well as the peace and stability of the region.

<P>
Q: Some readers in the West are familiar with the US system in
which the three powers of the state are separated, but they do not
know much about the People's Congress system in China. Would you
please elaborate on China's people's congress system?
</P>
<P>
A: The people's congress system is the fundamental political
system of China. The reason why we have introduced that system,
and not any other systems, is that it best conforms to the
national conditions in China. Historically, during the New-Democratic
Revolution, and soon after the founding of the People's Republic,
we explored ways to establish a new organizational form for the
exercise of the people's political power, and thus gained
experience for the institution of the People's congress
system.
</P>
<P>
China's first Constitution was adopted at the First Plenary
Session of the First National People's Congress held in 1954. The
Constitution contained explicit stipulations concerning the
people's congress system. More than 40 years has passed,
tremendous changes have taken place in China's political and
economic situation, and the Constitution has been revised several
times. But the basic principles and essence of the system remain
unchanged. The introduction of the people's congress system is the
choice of the Chinese people and an inevitable outcome of the
history. This system has taken deep roots in Chinese soil.
</P>
<P>
The People's Congress system includes mainly the following
points:
</P>
<P>
1) In China, the masters of the state and society are the
people. According to the Constitution, "All power in the People's
Republic of China belongs to the people." This constitutes the key
aspect and basic norm of China's state system.
</P>
<P>
2) The people's congress system is the organizational form and
system through which the people exercise state power. According to
the Constitution, "The organs through which the people exercise
state power are the National People's Congress and the local
people's congresses at different levels."
</P>
<P>
"The National People's Congress and the local People's
congresses at different levels are instituted through democratic
elections. They are responsible to the people and subject to their
supervision." Our laws stipulate that electors and electoral
units have the right to dismiss and replace or recall at any time
the deputies they elect, These provisions of the Constitution and
the laws are all designed to ensure that the people's congresses
at all levels perform their duties in accordance with the people's
will and in their interests.
</P>
<P>
3) The organs of state power are the people's congresses at all
levels. The National People's Congress is the highest organ of
state power and its permanent body is its Standing Committee. The
local people's congresses at different levels are the local organs
of state power at various levels. The local people's congresses
at and above the county level establish standing committees. State
administrative, judicial and procuratorial organs are all
constituted by the people's congresses, to which they are
responsible, and by which they are supervised.
</P>
<P>
State organs are instituted in this way in order to ensure that
the people's congresses will be able to exercise unified state
power, and that on this premise, the administrative, judicial and
procuratorial powers of the state, as well as leadership over the
armed forces, are clearly defined. In other words, the formulation
of laws and policy decisions on important matters must be made
through full, democratic discussion by the organs of state power,
that is, the National People's Congress and the local people's
congresses at different levels. These laws and decisions are
implemented by the administrative, judicial, procuratorial and
other organs of the state in accordance with their respective
duties.
</P>
<P>
4) The basic organizational and work principles of organs of
state power are to promote full democracy and apply democratic
centralism. When the people's congresses at all levels and their
standing committees perform their duties and exercise powers, all
deputies to the people's congresses and members of the standing
committees are considered as equals, and they can fully express
their views on any issues under discussion.
</P>
<P>
However, when it comes to adopting laws, resolutions and
decisions, the minority must be subordinated to the majority, and
decisions must be made by ballot by the deputies to the people's
congresses at all levels and by members of their standing
committees. No decisions should be made by an individual or by a
small number of people. The collective performing of duties is an
important principle followed by the people's congresses at all levels
and their standing committees.
</P>
<P>
5) The duties of central and local state organs are clearly
defined in such a way as to give full play to their
initiative. According to the Constitution, the National People's
Congress and its Standing Committee examine and decide major
national issues, and the laws, resolutions and decisions they
adopt are binding nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The local people's congresses at different levels and their
standing committees must ensure that the Constitution and the laws
are observed and enforced in their own administrative regions, and
they examine and make decisions on important issues in their
respective regions.
</P>
<P>
6) On the basis of a unified country, regional autonomy is
practiced in areas inhabited by people of ethnic groups. According
to the Constitution, China is a unified multi-ethnic country, and
regional autonomy is practiced in areas where people of minority
nationalities live in compact communities. Under the unified
leadership by the central authorities, the regional autonomous
areas can exercise the autonomy which the Constitution and
relevant laws have entrusted to them. They enjoy autonomy in,
among other things, planning and managing local economic
construction, education, science, culture, public health and
sports, under the guidance of state plans. They may also implement
state laws and policies in line with specific local conditions.
</P>
<P>
What I mentioned above makes up the major aspects of the
people's congress system of China. That system has been in effect
for over 40 years and has proven itself to conform to national
conditions in China. We will continue to uphold and improve this
system in the future.

<P>
Q: Since China began to reform and open to the outside world, it
has promulgated many laws. How have these laws been enforced ? If
the government violates the laws, how can the National People's
Congress correct it?
</P>
<P>
A: Since the policys of reform and opening up was implemented,
the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee have
formulated over 300 laws and decisions on legal affairs. The local
people's congresses have also formulated over 4,000 local
regulations. As a result, laws now serve as a paradigm for the
basic and major aspects of the country's political, economic and
public activities. The people's concept of the legal system and
their awareness of legal affairs have been notably enhanced.
</P>
<P>
In general, the enforcement of laws in the past has been
efficient. However, it is true that some departments and
localities ignore the laws, neither observing nor enforcing them
strictly, nor failing to punish lawbreakers. And there have even
been cases in which law enforcement officials violate laws and
some people override laws with their own opinions and power. We
are now taking measures to tackle those problems.
</P>
<P>
It is an important duty of the National People's Congress and
its Standing Committee to supervise the enforcement of the
Constitution and the laws. We have always devoted much attention
to this and have stressed the need to attach equal importance to
qualitative checks and supervision of law enforcement, as to
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the Standing Committee of the Eighth National
People's Congress was established in 1993, we formulated
regulations concerning the strengthening the inspection and
supervision of law enforcement. According to these regulations,
the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress
should organize a number of groups to inspect and supervise the
enforcement of laws each year. After the inspection tours, the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress will listen
to, and analyze the report made by the inspection groups, notify
relevant organs of the groups' conclusions and suggestions, and
urge the organs to tackle the problems that have cropped up. The
organs will also report to the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress on their handling of the problems.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1996, the Standing Committee organized 46 groups
to make 51 inspection tours on the enforcement of 13 major laws,
which received a positive response from society and yielded
practical effects.
</P>
<P>
We also attach great importance to formulating laws and
establishing relevant systems to supervise strict law enforcement
by administrative and judicial organs. Over the past few years, we
formulated the Administrative Procedural Law, the State
Restitution Law and the Administrative Penalty Law, and revised
the Criminal Procedural Law. These laws have played an important
role in standardizing the conduct of administrative and judicial
organs, urging and supervising them to work according to law and
safeguarding the legal rights and interests of citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social
Development and Outline of the Long-Range Objective to the Year
2010, which was examined and approved by the Fourth Plenary
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress in 1996, stressed
the need to establish a system for investigating the activities of
law enforcement officials who have violated the law, as well
as a punitive system for those cases. This has greatly facilitated
administrative organs to act in strict accordance with the laws.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution contains many provisions on exercising legal
supervision and ensuring a coherence in our legal system. The
State Council must formulate administrative statutes in accordance
with the Constitution and the laws. The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress can annul any State Council
administrative statute which goes against the Constitution or the
law, and local statutes formulated by local people's congresses and
their standing committees should not run counter to the
Constitution, the law, or administrative statutes, and should be
reported to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress for record.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress can
annul local statutes formulated by the local people's congresses
that go against the Constitution, the law, or administrative
statutes of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
In addition, in accordance with the Chinese Constitution,
citizens have the right to direct criticism or suggestions to any
state organs or functionary. They have the right to lodge
complaints and charges to the relevant state organs against any
state organ or functionary on their violation of the law or
dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
Handling letters from the people, receiving their calls,
reporting their presentations and opinions to the relevant organs
in order to urge those organs to correct their illegal activities,
constitute an important way in which we ensure that administrative
and judicial organs strictly enforce the law.

<HEADLINE> Reform of Commodity Circulation System Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese premier Li Peng has
urged the country's commercial departments to speed up the reform
of commodity circulation systems.
</P>
<P>
"Internal trade departments have made great contributions to
the thriving of China's domestic market and control of inflation,"
Li wrote in a letter to a national conference on the circulation
of commodities, held today in Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
However, the departments should continue to push forward
reforms of circulation systems, especially the grain purchasing
and sales system. The reforms can be carried out by developing
chain stores, agency sales and goods' distribution systems, Li
said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Chen Bangzhu, minister of Internal Trade, said at the
conference that China will this year designate rural areas as an
important marketplace for increased sales.
</P>
<P>
"Top priority should be given to the purchase of grain from
farmers in the rural areas," he said, adding that internal trade
departments should protect farmers' enthusiasm for planting
agricultural crops by stabilizing the price of grain.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts should also be made to balance the supplies of
agricultural by-products in various areas and seasons," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that if farmers earn profits by selling grain
and agricultural by-products, they will have more money to
purchase goods.
</P>
<P>
He urged large commercial enterprises to set up sales centers
in economically developed townships and set up second-hand goods
markets, food markets and service markets.

Q: Now that deputies to the people's congresses at county
and township levels and the members of villagers' committees are
elected directly, will the scope of direct elections be gradually
expanded in China in the future?
</P>
<P>
A: In 1979 we formulated the Electoral law and the Organic Law
of the Local People's Congresses and Governments at Different
Levels. In 1982, 1986 and 1995 we revised these laws and made a
major reform of China's electoral system. The reform mainly covers
the following:
</P>
<P>
First, we expanded direct elections of deputies to the people's
congresses from township to county level.
</P>
<P>
Second, we introduced the method of nominating candidates in a
fully democratic manner from bottom up and from top down. Ten or
more electors or deputies to the people's congresses may jointly
nominate their candidates for deputies. Ten or more deputies to the
people's congresses may jointly nominate their candidates for
members of the standing committees of the people's congresses, the
people's governments, the people's courts and the people's
procuratorates at the same level.
</P>
<P>
Third, we changed the practice whereby the number of candidates
is the same as the number of positions, to a method whereby the
number of candidates is, in general, greater than the number of
positions. This major reform of the three aspects of China's
electoral system has expanded the people's democracy and helps the
people to exercise their right as the masters of the
country. Since 1995, elections of deputies to the people's
congresses at township level have been held. We have discovered
that the people are very enthusiastic about these elections, and
that more than 90 percent of the voters took part in the
elections. We also know that most of the candidates for the
position of deputy to the people's congresses at township level
were recommended jointly by electors in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
In 1987 we formulated the Organic Law of villagers' Committees
for trial implementation. A villagers' committee is not an organ
of state power, but rather a people's organization for
self-government at grass-roots level, through which villagers
manage their own affairs, educate themselves and provide services
to themselves. These committees are directly elected by
villagers. We formulated this law in order to enable the people to
manage their own affairs independently and to further expand
people's democracy.
</P>
<P>
China has a vast territory and a large population and its
economic and cultural development level is not high. Therefore, it
conforms to our country's special conditions to elect deputies to
the people's congresses directly only at the county and township
levels for the present. Along with economic and cultural
development, and the improvement of people's living standards,
democracy in China will be constantly developed and the electoral
system will be further improved.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few decades, especially since the policies of
reform and opening up were implemented, China has scored notable
achievements in building its socialist democracy and legal
system. The Ninth Five-Year plan for National Economic and Social
Development, and the Outline of the Long-Range Objective to the
year 2010, which was examined and approved by the Fourth Plenary
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress held in March
1996, emphatically pointed out, "We should administer our country
according to law, and build it into a country with a socialist
legal system." We will lose no time in improving the legal
system, Of course, as China was a feudal society for several
thousand years, and because of the realities of our present social
and economic development and other factors, it will take a long
period of hard work to establish a complete legal system in an
all-round way. We are confident that as long as we make
unremitting efforts in this regard, we will surely attain our
goal.

<HEADLINE> UK to Establish Virtual Business Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain will launch a project in
March to create the world's first virtual business park, where
companies can conduct full electronic commerce on the Internet,
Ian Taylor, minister for Science and Technology, said today.
</P>
<P>
The park, named UKTrade, "will put the British exporters
directly in touch with customers all over the world," said Taylor
at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the park is expected to boost the country's
competitiveness in world trade.
</P>
<P>
The park, which will have more than 250,000 members in the next
few years, will initially contain about 12,500 companies and any
British company or organization can register and be listed.
</P>
<P>
A directory of companies in the park will provide links to the
companies' web sites and allow potential customers to make E-mail
sales inquiries.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said that the use of new technology in business has
improved Britain's trade and exports.
</P>
<P>
Some 23 percent of British companies are using the Internet and
52 percent more are potential users, a recent survey has said.
</P>
<P>
The UKTrade program is jointly launched by the British Trade
Associations and the private ICL, a leading European information
technology company.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the directory to be the first international
reference source of the UK business," said ICL Director Dereck
Sayers.
</P>
<P>
The ICL will provide companies with free entry to the Internet
and a CD-ROM listing as well as a paper directory listing,
considering some developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that free information service and multi-language
support will also be available soon.

<HEADLINE> Smuggled Explosives Seized in Kathmandu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Nepali police seized smuggled
explosives and some detonation equipment in the capital city of
Kathmandu last week, a senior police official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Additional Inspector General Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan told a
press conference that a Pakistani passport holder under the name
of Muhammad Shakeel Siddiqi was the prime suspect in the frequent
incidents of explosives smuggling in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
A police patrol in Kathmandu last Thursday seized a bag
containing 13.5 kilograms of RDX explosives, remote control
devices and detonators in a chase for the suspect, who absconded
after throwing away the bag.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time that smuggled explosives were recovered
in Kathmandu in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
The inspector said that a total of 60 kilograms of explosives
were seized during the period and the police already arrested two
persons from Kashmir. A search for other 10 suspects is underway,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali police have sought help from neighboring countries
to arrest Siddiqi, who is still at large after entering Nepal last
June.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Urges Quicker Reform of State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese president Jiang Zemin
has urged state-owned enterprises to speed up the reform process
to help them survive market competition.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, said that it is an imperative task
for the state sector to step up structural readjustments and
complete strategic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
He made the call to a group of managers of Beijing-based
state-owned enterprises after inspecting their enterprises in the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises have made great contributions to the
development of the national economy for decades, and the current
problems they are confronted with should be properly analyzed and
tackled, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Those problems are to some extent inevitable in the process of
economic reform and structural readjustment, and need to be
handled with all-out efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
For state-owned enterprises, it is essential to fully bear in
mind market rules and arrange production and management in line
with market demands and change, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in reform of the state sector, re-employment
programs should be pushed ahead vigorously, and establishment of
the social security system should be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
"We must pay close attention to, and treat properly the issue
of re-employment of those without jobs and their current
difficulties in daily life, which has a major impact on the
nation's reform, development and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked governments at various levels to strive to develop a
diversified economic pattern to increase job opportunities, and
facilitate job-skill training for the jobless.
</P>
<P>
As the Spring Festival, the most important traditional
celebration in China, draws near, all local governments and
departments must take practical and effective measures to solve
the problems in daily life for the jobless, so that they can have
a happy festive season, the leader added.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo and a number of leading officials of
the central authorities and Beijing municipality were with Jiang
during the inspection.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army is
preparing to move out of Hebron today though official
redeployment should begin only after the Hebron agreement is
approved by the Knesset (parliament) later.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the state-run Israel Radio, at a
street junction of the West Bank city, braving a heavy rain,
Israeli soldiers were busy removing heavy equipment from the
military headquarters, preparing for the transfer to the
Palestinian police, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli flag was pulled down from the building which had
been there ever since Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967. Army
bulldozers removed cement barriers in the areas which will come
under Palestinian self rule.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu this morning opened a stormy
 Knesset (parliament) debate on Hebron agreement only hours

Israel will not be leaving Hebron, but redeploy in the town.

He appealed to the Jewish settlers to keep calm, calling them
brothers and sisters representing not 400 people, but 4,000
years of Jewish history there.

Netanyahu will appear before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee later this afternoon, expected to present
details of the Hebron deal.

<HEADLINE> Iran against Military Solution to Afghan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani said here today that there is no military
solution to the crisis in the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub
Khan, Rafsanjani said, "friendly and neighborly countries such
as Iran and Pakistan must help to resolve Afghanistan's domestic
crisis in a peaceful way."
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president stressed that all the warring
factions should participate in the government of Afghanistan in
the interests of the people there.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his grief concern over the continuation of
the fighting in that country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the relations between Iran and Pakistan, he
said, the improvement of its ties with Pakistan is a priority in
Iranian foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries should not allow secondary issues to
affect their close ties," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan's foreign minister arrived here Wednesday morning
 to hold talks with Iranian officials and tries to work out a
settlement in the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Yaqub Khan this morning delivered a message from President
Farooq Ahmed Leghari to his Iranian counterpart Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that Leghari had extended
his invitation to Rafsanjani to attend the summit meeting of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Pakistani foreign minister said that the people
of Pakistan expect a ranking Iranian delegation to attend the
OIC meeting which happens to coincide with the 50th anniversary
of Pakistan's independence.
</P>
<P>
As to the Afghan issue, he said, the relations between
Pakistan and Iran are closer than ever before despite the
propaganda regarding the Iranian-Pakistani differences over
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the crisis has made the two countries more
determined to work together to find a negotiated settlement of
their neighboring country's problem.
</P>
<P>
Yaqu bKhan said, "Pakistan is of the opinion that
Afghanistan's domestic dispute and differences should come to an
end in line with the will of the people of that country and
their best interest."
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention whether the two sides
have reached any agreement on the settlement of the crisis in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival here, Khan said at a press
conference that Pakistan does not recognize as legitimate
government of Afghanistan of neither Taliban nor Burhanuddin
Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran meeting between Pakistani and Iranian foreign
ministers is a follow-up to their recent contacts in Turkey and
Indonesia during multilateral meetings of Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is known to be sympathetic to the Taliban militia
which seized the Afghan capital, Kabul, on September 27, driving
out the government of president Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Kabul is considered as a major setback in Iran's
foreign policy. As a result, the relations between Iran and
Pakistan were getting cold since then.
</P>
<P>
Iran called the Taliban as a hand raised group, which has
flourished as a result of U.S. planning, Saudi financial support
and Pakistan's logistical backing.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been supporting the deposed government, which allied
with the faction of northern Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostam
after losing Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has continued north of Kabul between the Taliban and
the alliance opposing it, with clashes also reported between
Taliban and its rivals in the northwestern region in the
vicinity of Dostam's base.

<HEADLINE> Top Trade Unions Official Urges Supervision Over State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Workers of state owned
enterprises in China have been told to step up supervision over
their enterprise leaders, to help guarantee a smooth reform of the
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Having a group of honest leaders who really rely on workers is
the key to deepening reform and revitalizing state-owned
enterprises, said Wei Jianxing, member of the Political Bureau of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
during a teleconference held in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who is also president of the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions(ACFTU), said that a system should be established to combine
supervision from the top to grassroots level, along with that from
the grassroots to the top.
</P>
<P>
An important channel for workers to supervise their enterprise
leaders is the congress of workers' representatives, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
He urged that congresses of workers' representatives be set up
and perfected in all state-owned and collectively-owned
enterprises, and enterprises where the property right is dominated
by the public.
</P>
<P>
Wei also insisted that heads of the state-owned enterprises be
evaluated by workers once every year. The evaluation would be
taken as an important criterion to judge their work abilities and
whether their terms should be renewed or refused.
</P>
<P>
An honest and efficient executive board and an annual
conference of worker representatives are pivotal to deepening the
reform of state-run enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment and perfection of the system of workers'
representatives' congresses in all state companies, including
fully and partly state-owned enterprises, needs effective trade
unions as guardians protecting employees' legal rights.

<HEADLINE> Drug Trafficker Jailed for Three Years' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian businessman was
sentenced to three years' imprisonment with hard labor for
trafficking more than one kilogram of hashish cake.
</P>
<P>
The businessman, Felix Muposhi, was detained on July 12
last year after a tip from a member of the public to the Drug
Enforcement Commission (DEC) that someone was selling
psychotropic drugs at the Lusaka Post Office.
</P>
<P>
DEC officers went to the area and cornered Muposhi. They
recovered a carefully wrapped hashish cake which he was carrying
in a plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
In mitigation, Muposhi pleaded for lenience saying he is
keeping five dependents who are all in school.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka Principal Resident Magistrate Francis Nsokolo turned
down the request, saying that Zambia is saying no to illegal
trafficking of narcotic drugs and courts of law will complement
the government's efforts to eradicate the scourge by punishing
the culprits.
</P>
<P>
The DEC is making efforts to stop drug trafficking. Its
offices in various parts of the country are working the clock
round.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 1,529 Zambians were arrested locally and another 22
in other countries for drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Assures Aid Donors of Better Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A Cambodian official today
told foreign aid donors that many "positive and favorable"
developments have taken place over the past six months in Cambodia
and the country is facing a better future.
</P>
<P>
"Much has happened in and for Cambodia in the past six months
on the security and socio-economic fronts and all these, in our
view, are for the better future of Cambodia," Finance Minister
Keat Chhon told aid suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Keat Chhon, who is Senior Minister in Charge of Rehabilitation
and Development, briefed ambassadors and representatives from
aid-supplying nations and international bodies on economic and
political situation in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
On his country's economy, Keat Chhon said: "We continue to make
encouraging and healthy progress and can safely claim that
stability is now here to stay."
</P>
<P>
He said Cambodia's GDP growth rate was six percent in 1996,
slightly lower than the projected seven percent due mostly to the
severe flooding in September and October.
</P>
<P>
The average annual inflation rate in 1996 was estimated at 7.4
percent, a little higher than originally anticipated. The national
currency remains stable with only a gradual, non-destabilizing
devaluation of about six percent during the year.
</P>
<P>
GDP growth and inflation rate are expected to be 6.4 and six
percent respectively for 1997 and investment is estimated at 404
million U.S. dollars, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his country will exercise austerity in
expenditure and at the same time increase national revenue in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Our National Assembly has recently passed an ambitious and
bold budget seeking an overall amount of domestic revenues of
about 900 billion riels (about 333 million dollars) or 9.7 percent
of the GDP, representing an increase of about 22 percent."
</P>
<P>
He predicted that there would be an overall deficit of 585
billion riels (about 216 million dollars).

ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia

In tanks and on armored personnel carriers, Taliban forces this

However, it was not clear how many casualties either side
suffered.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban met only mild resistance from former government
soldiers defending both Bagram and Charikar, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban offensive came after the United Nations-sponsored
peace talks earlier this week in neighboring Pakistan appeared to
be going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
"When we understood that the peace negotiations were not
working we started our offensive," the Taliban's Information
Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
From Monday until Wednesday, representatives of the Taliban sat
across the negotiating table from their rivals -- an alliance led
by commander of the ousted government force, Ahmad Masood and
northern warlord Rashid Dostum.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban control roughly two-thirds of Afghanistan, while
the alliance rules the northern one-third.
</P>
<P>
Both Bagram and Charikar were being largely defended by
Masood's soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Masood was forced to flee Kabul last September 27 when
advancing Taliban soldiers swept into the capital. For several
weeks, Masood and his troops were trapped in the Panjshir Valley,
nearly 150 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
But they eventually pushed the Taliban back toward the capital
and for nearly two months, the frontline remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Bagram, the biggest military and civilian airport in
Afghanistan, has become a major battlefield since the Taliban
seized the capital last year. Both the Taliban and its rival
forces have controlled the Bagram airbase many times.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Underlines Continued Tight Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice premier Zhu Rongji
said in Beijing today that he is confident the country's inflation
rate will fall below six percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last year inflation rate was 6.1 percent - much lower than
soaring inflation of 20 percent and more just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged the country's banking sector to continue carrying out
a moderately tight monetary policy to further scale down inflation
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an ongoing national banking conference in Beijing,
Zhu said that the macro-economic control policy adopted by the
central authorities has effectively reined in inflation for the
past three years, while helping maintain a rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector did a good job in implementing the
macro-economic policy last year, with note issuances totaling 91.7
billion yuan, well within the 100 billion yuan limit set in the
national plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the central bank lowered the interest rates twice,
greatly helping ease the debt burden of state-owned enterprises,
and tightened supervision over banking institutions to rectify the
order of the sector, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
While the foreign exchange reserve soared to 105 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, China has also successfully turned the
legitimate currency, Renminbi, into a convertible one under the
current account, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the macro-economic control policy as a success, the
vice premier asked the banking sector to further abide by it,
while continuing to deepen reform and improve management
performance.
</P>
<P>
Noting that excessive note issuances leads to inflation, he
urged the sector to pay more efforts to control note issuance,
setting a limit of 120 billion yuan for this year.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence in bringing down inflation to below six
percent in 1997, compared to 6.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also underlined supervision over various kinds
of banking institutions and the prevention of banking risks,
stressing that any major cases in illegal banking business will be
dealt with strictly, with those involved subject to heavy
punishment.
</P>
<P>
He asked banking institutions to ensure a sufficient supply of
funds for state grain purchase, and support reform measures of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Banking institutions should also improve their internal
management and increase profitability on the basis of maintaining
safety and liquidity of their capital, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Deal Not Breakthrough in Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- It does not seem that the Hebron
agreement "will be a breakthrough in the Palestinian crisis,"
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati has said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian official news agency IRNA today quoted Velayati as
saying that "based on our knowledge on political and social
situation in the region and people's attitude, it does not seem
that the Wednesday agreement will be a breakthrough in the
Palestinian crisis."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Hebron accord initialed by Palestinian Leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
Wednesday, "will face problems and difficulties," adding
that the Middle East peace process will continue to be confronted
with "impasse."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the truth of what Iran said
two years ago is now proven and the disappointment of Arab states
is clear to all.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official media today also slammed the Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
The English-language dailies of Tehran Times and Iran News
said in their editorials that the Hebron deal further justifies
Israeli expansionism.
</P>
<P>
Iran News said in its editorial that "no sensible person will
oppose a move for peace wherever and whenever it takes places, but
the peace should be real and fair."
</P>
<P>
Apparently referring to the Netanyahu administration, the
editorial noted that a government which is not only reluctant,
but bluntly refuses to accept what its predecessor had agreed to
is not trustworthy, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the light of these facts, the daily concluded by saying
that one should "think twice" before calling Wednesday's agreement
a "breakthrough in the so-called peace process."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tehran Times said in its editorial that "the
Al-Khalil (Hebron) accord can not lead to a lasting peace because
there are a host of unsettled issues facing the Palestinians and
Israel..."
</P>
<P>
"If peace is to be comprehensive in the Middle East,
solutions should be sought to some more serious issues remaining
unsettled so far, such as the occupied Arab territories including
south Lebanon and the Golan Heights," it noted.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Welcomes German Decision to Take Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has voiced welcome to
Germany's decision to take back waste that was illegally
sent to the Beirut Port last August, Beirut's Daily Star reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of Environment Akram Shuhayyeb was quoted by
the only English-language daily in Beirut as expressing
his government's happiness over the German decision.
</P>
<P>
"We have been coordinating this retrieval with the German
government for a long time. We are very happy that they finally
pulled through," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
A team of German experts visited Lebanon in November and
tested the 750 tonnes of waste and found the waste to be
non-toxic, after local experts had pronounced it toxic.
</P>
<P>
The waste arrived in the Beirut Port last August but was not
discovered until October 24 after the Lebanese authorities were
tipped by both European Interpol and the Green Peace.
</P>
<P>
Details of the reshipment are yet to be finalized, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Shuhayyeb said he hoped Germany's decision would prompt the
Canadian and Belgian governments to follow suit on similar
shipments originating from their countries.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Canadians and Belgians were waiting for
Germany's decision and that it will incite them to take action,"
the Lebanese official underlined.
</P>
<P>
Two containers of plastic waste arrived at the Beirut Port on
October 24 from Antwerp, Belgium, allegedly imported by a
Lebanese company. Two other containers of hazardous paint
residue from Canada, still remaining at the port since December
1995, were discovered at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Environment Ministry has been requesting both
the Belgian and Canadian governments to retrieve the two
shipments of chemical waste since November.

<P>
HANOI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial output hit
113,000 billion Vietnamese dong (about 10 billion U.S. dollars) in
1996, an increase of 14 percent over the previous year, the
Industry Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Of the total industrial output, 52 percent were made by
state-owned enterprises, while private and foreign-invested
enterprises each achieved 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
High growth was made in the production of metal products (26.7
percent), machinery (10.8 percent), rubber and plastics (27.5
percent), footwear (43.9 percent), tobacco and cigarettes (142.4
percent ).
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the rapid growth in the industrial sector
to the increase of investment in technology renovation and new
equipment in large and medium-sized enterprises nationwide.

TOKYO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose further
against the yen in Tokyo, topping the 117 yen at one point for the
first time in 46 months despite a yen-supportive comment by
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto reportedly said in the afternoon that an "excessively
weak yen is undesirable."
</P>
<P>
The dollar was changing hands at 116.90-93 yen at 5 p.m., up

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Take Part in Beijing Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will take part in the
April 3-8 Beijing International Exhibition to showcase its
industrial progress in the fields of engineering, metallurgical
furniture, leather and foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
Rushdi Saqr, chairman of the Exhibitions and International
Markets Authority, told the Egyptian MENA news agency today that
Egypt will exhibit high-quality products of factories based in the
country's new industrial cities.
</P>
<P>
He said contacts are under way with Egyptian businessmen
interested in the Chinese market to assess the possibility of
their participation in the exhibition with a view to promoting
Egyptian exports and opening new markets for its burgeoning
national industries.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts to boost economic and trade ties
between the two countries, a 12-member Chinese delegation of
businessmen held talks with the Egyptian General Federation for
Chambers of Commerce here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The talks covered the process of establishing joint companies
for the sale of the products of the two countries on the
international markets.
</P>
<P>
They also dealt with forming a free trade zone in Egypt to
help export Chinese goods to various Arab and African countries,
as well as making use of the Chinese free trade zones in
marketing Egyptian products in South and East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Supply, Internal and Foreign Trade Ahmed
Goweili paid a visit to Beijing last October to promote
the Egyptian-Chinese trade and investment cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a fresh bid to boost exports, Egypt is planning to
intensify its participation in international fairs and markets to
help increase and promote the exports of the country.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Beijing international exhibition, Egypt will also
take part in the Tokyo international trade fair in April, run the
first exhibition for the Egyptian products in San Francisco, the
United States, on February 9-14, and hold the second Egyptian show
in Nairobi, Kenya in November.

<TEXT>
<P>
In addition to reinforcing the agricultural base and making
progress in key projects, especially infrastructure, Chen said,
China has increased its ability to sustain economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, grain output exceeded 480 billion kg, an increase of
over 13.5 billion kg, and 123 key infrastructure projects were
completed, more than for any other year.
</P>
<P>
China's international payments are sound at present,
strengthening the possibility of its cooperating and competing
internationally in the economy and technology, Chen noted, adding
that China will expand its foreign economic cooperation and
exchanges in various ways.
</P>
<P>
Because the world economy and trade are expected to maintain
relatively rapid growth, Chinese companies have become more
accustomed to adjustments in foreign trade taxes, the changing
international market, and the convertibility of the Chinese
currency under the current account, all of which have made things
more favorable to expanding foreign trade and attracting overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
China will maintain stability and flexibility in its
macro-economic controls and will do everything it can to combine
output with structural adjustment, macro-economic controls with
micro-economic controls, and deepening reforms with promoting
development, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will speed up the pace of enterprise reforms,
increasing economic structural adjustments.
</P>
<P>
The current economic structural readjustment focuses on
overlapping construction projects to ensure healthier, more
orderly economic development, he said, noting that the planning
commission will not approve any new projects that overlap other
projects.

MOSCOW, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Rodionov said today Russia plans no new military alliances in
response to the planned eastward expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to expand or create new defensive alliances,"
denying the possibility of military alliance with Belarus,
Rodionov said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
He said President Boris Yeltsin had ordered the foreign

</P>
<P>
However, he urged the Russian Armed Forces to carry out
military reform, saying that an effective national system of
management on military construction and defense must be created.
</P>
<P>
He suggested further reduction in the armed forces "on the
basis of keeping their combat capacity and ability to accomplish
national defense tasks."
</P>
<P>
Russia plans to cut its armed forces from the current 1.7
million to 1.5 million, and the reduction is estimated to cost
around 10 trillion roubles (1.8 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> China's Economy To Develop at Moderately Fast Pace (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China's economic growth is
expected to be moderately speedy and relatively stable in 1997,
while further progress will be made in improving its efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The comment by Chen Jinhua, the minister in charge of the State
Planning Commission, came at a news conference held by the
Information Office of the State Council for a group of local and
overseas journalists today.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China enjoyed an economic growth rate of
9.7 percent in 1996, while its inflation rate dropped to 6.1
percent, better than what was expected and in line with the Ninth
Five-Year Plan, which called for the inflation rise to be lower
than economic growth. He said that the rate of inflation this
year is certain to be lower than last year.
</P>
<P>
The three-year-old macro-economic controls have helped China
maintain speedy economic growth and to hold down the inflationary
trend, which is an extremely good indicator of a sound general
economic situation and a good foundation for moderately rapid
economic growth in future, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the good indications in the economy, the
improved balance in supply and demand, and the sufficient market
supplies, especially of industrial products have provided
necessary conditions for effectively controlling inflation.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there was an 18.9 percent growth in investment in
fixed assets in China and a 19.3 percent rise in retail sales. In
general, trends in investment and consumer spending were
reasonable and provided a good foundation for moderately fast
economic growth,
</P>
<P>
Chen predicts that this year China will maintain the moderate
increase in both investment and consumer spending, with investment
in fixed assets to be held at 32 percent. Meanwhile, the country
will continue to have a relatively high rate of savings and to use
overseas funds effectively.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Unveils New Law on National Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia today unveiled a new
draft law on national security which gives the president the
authority to mobilize the people when the nation is in danger and
the armed forces can no longer overcome the threats.
</P>
<P>
"People are to be mobilized into armed and un-armed resistance
forces (when the nation is in danger)," Defense and Security
Minister Edi Sudradjat told the House of Representatives when
explaining the government's draft law on military court, mass
mobilization and de-mobilization.
</P>
<P>
Sudradjat said the bill represented an effort to overcome the
increasing intensity of threats to the nation's life, unity and
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The mobilization of the people into armed and un-armed
resistance forces is in line with international law, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the bill is being worked out as an effort to implement
the people's universal defense system and is not against
international law," he said.
</P>
<P>
The draft law regulates the implementation of mobilization and
demobilization of the masses and the legal sanctions against those
who ignore or neglect calls for participation in the mobilization.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bill regulates legal sanctions against
officers who abuse their power or fail to return properties to
their owners after using them during mobilization.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Indonesians are a peace-loving people but
they love independence and sovereignty more.
</P>
<P>
War will therefore be declared only as a last resort and will
only be carried out to defend independence, sovereignty and
national interests, he said.

<HEADLINE> China To Invest Heavily In Non-Staple Food Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China will allocate several
billion yuan over the next five years for building a great number
of vegetable, aquatic food and meat production bases to stabilize
retail prices in large and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
These will include construction of 300 lean-pork pig, cattle,
and sheep farms, fresh water aquatic ponds with a total water
surface of 820,000 ha, and large tracts of experimental vegetable
plots.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the central
government invested three billion yuan in its Shopping Basket
program, which began in 1988, to develop production of non-staple
food to ensure urban supplies.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have also built 134 vegetable bases, 250
lean-pork farms, 113 cattle farms, and aquatic centers with a
total water surface of 2.57 million ha.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin municipalities have invested 300
million yuan each for these programs.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China produced 50 million tons of meat, 7.3 million
tons of milk, 17.5 million tons of eggs, 28 million tons of
aquatic products, and 46 million tons of fruit. The per capita
consumption of meat, eggs and aquatic products in China is now
above the world average.
</P>
<P>
Studies by the State Statistics Bureau show that price
increases in foodstuff have contributed 60 percent to China's
inflation in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the supply of non-staple food constitutes a
key element in the country's inflationary rate.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Jiang Chunyun has urged all provinces to build a
production and supply system to meet the growing demand for
non-staple foods in both urban and rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Terminates 5 Billion Dollar Contract with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has terminated a
five-billion-U.S.-Dollar contract with a Russian company on the
construction of a steel mill, which is near finished, the local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Nigeria paid the TPE company of Russia 50 billion
Naira (about 620 million Dollars) late last year to terminate the
contract for the construction of the Ajaokuta Still Mill in Kogi State
in central Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Ministry of Power and Steel estimated that about
98 percent of the project have been done, but the lack of
capital and raw materials were stalling its final operation.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the mill will get its raw materials from the
south through the Itakpe-Ajaokuta-Warri Railway, but the line
has not been completed.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side said it will go into further contract only if
the rail line is completed.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now has four steel plants: the Osogbo Steel Rolling
Company, the Delta Steel Company, the Katsina Steel Company and the
Jos Steel Company. All are not operating well.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade minister
said today China hopes to increase economic and trade cooperation
with Austria and see more investment from Austrian enterprises,
especially the large ones.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Austrian Minister of Economics
Johann Farnleitner, Wu Yi, Chinese minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, said that the trade between the two
countries is satisfactory overall, despite a drop in bilateral
trade volume following the historic record in 1995.
</P>
<P>
China and Austria have conducted good economic and
technological cooperation. There are over 300 Austrian-funded
enterprises with an investment of 78 million US dollars, according
to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Farnleitner regarded the economic and trade cooperation between
the two countries as smooth and promising. He said China's
economic growth is conducive to the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that his trip to China will enhance
closer bilateral cooperation in machine building, environmental
protection, agriculture and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, Wu met a group of Austrian entrepreneurs
accompanying the Austrian economics minister.

<HEADLINE> 16 Groups Show Interest in Privatization of Pak Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Privatization
Commission (PC) has received Expression of Interest (EOI) from 16
domestic and international groups for privatization of the
country's Habib Credit and Exchange Bank Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The interested parties include the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation Limited, ABN AMRO Bank and Dallah Albaraka
Group, a financial institution from the Middle East, PC sources
told local press today.
</P>
<P>
Major local institutions of Fauji Foundation and Cresbank have
also shown their interest in acquiring the management control of
Habib Credit and Exchange Bank Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Habib Creent's efforts to make improvement in
the banking system, the State Bank of Pakistan will be an active
participant along with the PC in this process, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan started its privatization process in the banking
sector in 1989. Two commercial banks have been already privatized
while the privatization process of the second largest nationalized
commercial bank, the United Bank Ltd, failed last year due to the
bad conditions of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Since taking power on November 5, the caretaker government
emphasized on the reform of the country's banking sector and to
use the privatization fund for retirement of the national debt,
which consumed one third of the government's annual revenue.

<HEADLINE> Japan Insists on Unofficial Compensation for Sex Slaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- In spite of South Korea's demand
for an official compensation, Japan has insisted on
non-governmental compensation for Korean women forced into sex
slaves by Japanese troops during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese decision came in response to an earlier
announcement by a private Japanese organization to compensate
wartime comfort women (sex slaves) forced to serve Japanese troops
half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Women's Fund, which has pooled donations from private
Japanese corporations and individuals, announced last saturday
that it will pay a 2 million yen cash (18,200 U.S. dollars)
solatium to each of some 300 sex slaves in Philippines, South
Korea and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We take it that the project was launched in order to respond
to the feelings of aged former comfort women as soon as possible,"
Kaoru Yosano, deputy chief cabinet secretary, told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
"Thinking of the current conditions of the former comfort
women, we cannot but respect the stand of the fund," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha was
quoted as saying Seoul wanted an immediate halt to the payment
process.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday the Asian Women's Fund, a private group set up
in 1995 with heavy Japanese government prodding, paid five million
yen ($42,700) to each of seven Korean women.
</P>
<P>
The fund was initiated by the Japanese government in July 1995
and has pooled donations from Japanese businesses and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Seoul has declined asking for government-to-government
compensation for the comfort women, but demanded that the Japanese
government should pay compensation and apologize to the 162 South
Korean women officially registered as sex slaves.
</P>
<P>
Historians estimate that some 200,000 women from Korea and
other Japanese-occupied territories in Asia were forced into sex
slaves by Japanese soldiers before and during the war.

<HEADLINE> China to Stop Random Electrical Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen
management of electrical fees across the country this year in a
move to stop irrational collections.
</P>
<P>
Shi Dazhen, the country's power industry minister, made the
statement at a national power meeting which opened in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
Due to increases in power production costs, cases have been
reported in some regions of power production enterprises involving
randomly collecting electric fees, Shi said. This has hindered the
natural growth of the state's electrical prices, and has reduced
the country's capacity to withstand price reforms in the power
industry.
</P>
<P>
To make charges for electricity more rational, the Ministry of
Power Industry will work out detailed rules for adjusting fees,
and will set new charges that take fuels and transport into
account, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry will also draft the "Rules on
Management of Electrical Charges" and detailed regulations for
their implementation.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, several provinces with more
sophisticated conditions will be chosen to test the practice of
charging customers unified electrical fees for using electricity
from the same power grid.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soldier Condemned to Imprisonment for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Seoul District
Court today sentenced a U.S. soldier, Eric Munnich Stephen, to 15
years in prison for murder.
</P>
<P>
The court gave the sentence after reviewing the prosecution's
demand for life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Stephen, a 22-year-old serviceman stationed in South Korea, was
charged with killing a South Korean woman, Lee Ki-soon, near a
U.S. military base in Tongduchon, Kyonggi Province on September 7,
1996.
</P>
<P>
"The accused ought to be condemned to capital punishment," the
court said, "but the sentence was given in extenuation of the
circumstances that he committed the crime on the spur of the
moment with psychological unrest."
</P>
<P>
Stephen has confessed to prosecutors that he stabbed Lee, a
prostitute, to death in a brothel in Tongduchon.
</P>
<P>
The American soldier had been detained at a U.S. military camp
in Kyonggi after the killing.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, some 40 murders have been linked to the
U.S. military presence in South Korea, where 37,000 American
troops are stationed.

HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese representative
of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) Zhao Jihua today
urged the British side to set great store by the supervising
function of Hong Kong communities and the Airport Advisory
Committee on Hong Kong's new airport construction.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that since October last year, the Chinese and British
sides of the JLG have reviewed the progress of the 10 core
programs of Hong Kong's new airport.
</P>
<P>
He said the overall review of the programs was necessary at the
critical phase of the construction of the new airport and new
airport railway and conformed with the Agreed Minute of the
Financial Arrangements for the New Airport.
</P>
<P>
During the review, the representatives and experts of the two
sides of the JLG Airport Committee examined every project of the
new airport core programs.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said the British side assured the Chinese side that all of
the 10 core programs will be fulfilled within the original budget
on time and the new airport will come into operation in April
1998.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciates the efforts made by the related
departments of the Hong Kong government, Airport Authority and the
Mass Transit Railway in the new airport construction, adding that
he hopes that the British side will achieve what it has promised.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhao noted, the Chinese side has noticed that some
of the major projects of new airport construction have been
delayed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the British side to enhance its supervision and
control over the projects and improve management so as to complete
the new airport construction within schedule.

<HEADLINE> Videotapes on Deng Xiaoping Sell Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A videotaped set of the
documentary "Deng Xiaoping" has been selling well since its recent
publication, the "Guangming Daily" has reported.
</P>
<P>
The documentary has attracted widespread public attention since
its broadcast as a 12-part series on China Central Television
Station (CCTV).
</P>
<P>
"I am very confident in the market of the newly-issued
videotape, because the documentary is warmly human," said Wu
Xiaochuan, deputy general manager of the China International
Television Corporation (CITC).
</P>
<P>
The corporation is the copyright owner of the TV series.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that so far, CITC has produced 2,100 sets of
videotapes, but more than 5,000 are needed to satisfy the demands
of customers across the country.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, home of Yan'an, a
well-known revolutionary center in the 1940s, has ordered 1,000
tapes, added the paper.
</P>
<P>
It is a rare event in the audio and video industry that a
videotape has found so many buyers in such a short time, said the
paper, and the 2,100 tape sets already have been sold.
</P>
<P>
Some audio-visual companies had hoped to acquire circulation
rights to produce VCD and LD versions of the documentary, but CITC
refused the requests.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the corporation received several calls
daily from people all over China wanting to know about the
possibility of VCD publication of the TV program.
</P>
<P>
The corporation has begun the program's VCD production, and
4,000 tapes in ordinary packaging; 2,000 luxury sets are expected
to be available in the next two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Youngest Bank Builds Image by Appointing Overseas Auditor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- While most established Chinese
banks try to build their images through advertising, charitable
donations and large-scale meetings, their baby brother has a
different approach.
</P>
<P>
China Minsheng Banking Corporation, the first non-government
bank in the country, recently sealed a contract naming Price
Waterhouse of the United States as the firm's auditor for the 1996
annual report.
</P>
<P>
The American firm, one of the oldest international accounting
companies in the world, has more than 460 members in over 120
countries and employs 57,000 people. It broke into the
Chinese market in 1979 and has opened offices in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhong and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
"Minsheng Bank employed both Chinese and international auditing
standards to prepare its annual financial reports and made public
the information about its financial condition from the very
beginning," bank president Tong Zengyin said at the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to Tong, the bank is currently focused on exploring
the domestic market, highlighting the importance of preventing
operational risks, developing its management system and improving
its internal supervision.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng was founded on January 12, 1996, with a capital of
1.38 billion yuan, thanks to the efforts of the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce. As of now, the joint-stock
bank has 2,000 shareholders, who are members of the Federation.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, the bank had assets of over eight billion
yuan, with deposits and loans amounting to 4.3 billion yuan and
2.6 billion yuan, respectively, and with net profits totaling 11
million yuan, according to Tong.
</P>
<P>
In order to build a clean, internationally-standardized bank,
Minsheng operates in accordance with internationally accepted
practices, said Tong.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Price Waterhouse will advise us on our control
mechanism, auditing system, accounting processing, and other
management methods," he said, "and that the cooperation will boost
Minsheng Bank's progress toward an internationally standardized
bank."
</P>
<P>
Some local observers say that this first private bank of China
has attracted notice from its domestic and international
counterparts since the beginning.
</P>
<P>
Some well-known international financial institutions are
seeking opportunities to cooperate with China's youngest bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official with Minsheng said, "Unlike other
Chinese banks that have evolved from government administrations or
are closely related with state-owned enterprises, ours is brand
new."
</P>
<P>
"We do not have burdens such as overstaffing and suffering
from bad loans," she said.

<HEADLINE> Surgeons in S.Leone Remove 18 Carat Diamond From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 16 (Xinhua) - - Surgeons in Sierra Leone
Thursday ''successfully'' removed an 18 carat diamond from the
stomach of a hired diamond miner, David Marah who is now in
stable condition, local journalists said today.
</P>
<P>
A journalist said the incident happened in the daimond mining
town of Tongo in eastern Sierra Leone two weeks ago when Marah
''swallowed'' the gem to evade detection.
</P>
<P>
''He had hoped to excrete it later and make himself an instant
millionaire,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Medical officer Samuel Lisk giving a background to the
Thursday surgical operation said Marah was ''in severe pains and
could neither stand or walk when he was brought to the Kenema
government hospital early this week.''
</P>
<P>
A scanning examination revealed that a large stone was lodged
in his stomach but Marah could not afford the huge surgical cost.
</P>
<P>
Marah then disclosed he swallowed the diamond belonging to
his employer, diamond merchant Lebanese born Allie Bahsoon, said
relatives of Marah.
</P>
<P>
Bahsoon, according to hospital sources, paid the 1,000 dollars
for the operation but lamented afterwards, ''I am amazed that my
most trusted miner can be so dishonest.''

<HEADLINE> Influenza Epidemic Believed to Be Normal This Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese flu prevention experts
believe the country's flu outbreak this winter was nothing out of
the ordinary, and that this year's cases are under control.
</P>
<P>
"Although a number of flu cases have been reported in north
China since last December, the general situation is normal and
stable," said Dr. Guo Yuanji, director of the National Influenza
Center.
</P>
<P>
Both the northern and southern parts of the country reported a
spread of influenza last winter, but this winter, south China has
no epidemic, Guo noted.
</P>
<P>
However, a large-scale outbreak of the illness in the Beijing
area since December has affected mainly kindergarten children,
students and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
"We've found the variant Type A virus this year, and that is an
important cause of the rapid spread of the illness this winter,"
said Dong Zhenying with the Beijing Epidemic Prevention Station.
</P>
<P>
Dong, who is responsible for influenza detection, explained
that because the variant virus has disappeared from the city for
several decades, people's resistance to it has lowered, which can
easily lead to epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"I think such a situation is quite normal, because every
January-February period is a peak season of influenza epidemic,"
Dong said.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the number of flu patients in Beijing this
winter has not remarkably exceeded the average level, though she
declined to provide exact statistics.
</P>
<P>
For a long period, China has been regarded as a place
vulnerable to the spread of influenza, as well as an area where
the virus frequently originates.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and overseas experts have predicted that a
large-scale influenza epidemic will occur around the world before
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We'll pay close attention to any kind of epidemic situation in
order to effectively control the spread of influenza," Guo said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Proposes Action Plan to Boost Asia-Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has prepared an action
plan to promote investment flows and improve investment climates
between Asia and Europe, according to a press release from the
Thai Board of Investment (BOI) today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Secretariat has completed
the draft ASEM investment promotion action plan for the purpose,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The draft plan is a revised version of the one presented by BOI
Secretary-General Staporn Kavitanon at the first ASEM business
forum in Paris last October, but it still falls on two key
components - investment promotion activities and improvement of
investment policies and regulations.
</P>
<P>
On concrete investment promotion activities, the plan proposed
to set up an ASEM virtual business information exchange network to
facilitate flows of investment information among ASEM members.
</P>
<P>
It also suggests to launch a series of roundtable meetings to
bring together top business leaders to discuss business-related
issues and the solutions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the plan recommends to launch an ASEM
business-to-business exchange program to back the existing
programs and develop new programs to stimulate cultural and
business exchanges between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a series of high profile business-related
public relation campaigns, including sporting events, will be
launched to raise ASEM awareness.
</P>
<P>
On policy and regulations, the draft plan proposed a set of
ASEM non-binding investment principles and urged ASEM senior
officials to strengthen dialogues on the areas of common concern,
such as business disputes, labor standards, and intellectual
property rights.
</P>
<P>
The draft action prepared by a team led by the BOI will be
tabled for consideration at the ASEM economic ministers meeting
this September in Japan, and then it will go to the second ASEM
meeting scheduled for 1998 in London.
</P>
<P>
Staporn said that the draft plan just marks a start of the
process of enhanced Asia-Europe cooperation in the investment
arena.

<HEADLINE> UAE, Pakistan to Enhance Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) will further strengthen its military cooperation with
Pakistan by sending an armed forces delegation to visit that
country in February, according to local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will visit Pakistan to examine various defense
products that could be inducted into the UAE's armed forces, Inam
Ullah Khan, defense liaison officer at the Pakistani Embassy in
the UAE said recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UAE delegation will also hold talks with some
Pakistani military officials on topics of common interest to the
armed forces of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and Pakistan in 1995 formed a joint consultative
committee to enhance their defense cooperation. Pakistan supplied
expertise to train UAE armed forces personnel and it is also one
of the major suppliers of small arms and ammunition to the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes before the International Defense Exhibition in
1997 (IDEX '97) Which will be held in UAE from March 16 to
20. About 50 countries are expected to participate in the
exhibition.

<HEADLINE> More Efforts Urged Against Oil Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today ordered an all-out effort to stop any more oil
spill from a wrecked Russian ship's bow section, which lies
aground near the shore at Mikuni, Fukui Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto summoned Transport Minister Makoto Koga and Maritime
Safety Agency (MAS) chief Yasuroshi Tsuchisaka to his official
residence and gave the orders, Kyoto News said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said after the meeting, "There is not much oil
cleaning equipment available in the world but I directed the
officials to focus their effort on draining fuel oil from the bow"
of the 13,157-ton Nakhodka, which broke into two during a storm in
the Sea of Japan on January 2.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo said Hashimoto has been under pressure from fishermen and
residents of several prefectures along the Sea of Japan coast to
step up the clean-up campaign, which has been hampered by bad
weather and bureaucratic logjam.
</P>
<P>
Fight against Japan's worst-ever oil spill expanded to
previously untouched parts of the shores of Toyama and Niigata
prefectures, adding to the six regions across more than 500
kilometers hit by the spill, with new oil leaks discovered from
the wrecked tanker.
</P>
<P>
The prefectures, heavily dependent on fisheries and tourism,
have struggled to protect and clean shores dotted with shellfish
farms, scenic beaches and marine bird sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
The MSA patrol boats reported a 37-kilometers-long slick near
the tip of the Noto Peninsula, 400 kilometers northwest of Tokyo,
and agency officials said they feared currents would carry the
slicks and globs of solid oil far beyond.
</P>
<P>
The battle against oil spill has mostly been waged by local
authorities, fisherman and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
The MSA raised its estimate of oil spilled Thursday from the
bow to 5,000 tons, from the 3,700 tons estimate issued when the
crisis began two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that calmer seas on Thursday raised hopes that
their goal of emptying the bow of remaining oil with pumps could
be achieved within a week.

<HEADLINE> Asians Arrested in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Asians, mostly of Indian
origin, are being arrested almost every day in Uganda, Ramesh
Chander, the First Secretray at the Indian High Commission in
Kampala, disclosed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Chander said that 10 Asians, mostly of Indians origin, are
being arrested daily in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He said: ''We have reeived complaints of our nationals being
rounded up by immigration officials and we are disturbed by such
inhuman treatment."
</P>
<P>
The diplomat was quoted today by local newspaper "The
Cursdader" as saying that if such harassment continued, "it would
explode into a bigger problem at a later date.''
</P>
<P>
His remarks come on the heels of the Ugandan President's
recent appeal for the people to stop harasssing the Asian
community.
</P>
<P>
In his speech last week, President Museveni said that such
harassment is paretly responsible for the low level of investment
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chander's concern comes against the background of the bad
blood created by the explusion of Asians from Uganda during the
period Uganda's former President Idi Amin.
</P>
<P>
Amin accused the asians of repatriating their profits to
Europe and Asia, what he termed '' milking the cow without
feeding it.''
</P>
<P>
Since Amin fell in 1979 and especially after Museveni came to
power in 1986, the Ugandan government has pursued a policy of
encouraging the expelled Asians and other foreigners to come back
to the country.
</P>
<P>
However, tension is now reigning between the Asians and some
indigenous Ugandan businessmen, particularly over the
repossessing by Asians of their own building.

<HEADLINE> US Warned Not to Link MFN Status with the Hong Kong Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen
Guofang said here today that the Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade
status has nothing to do with the Hong Kong issue and the US
should not consider these issues as being in any way connected.
</P>
<P>
A member of a US Congressional delegation visiting China said
recently that the US will not grant permanent MFN status to China
this year, and the issue will depend on the situation in Hong Kong
after 1997.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on these remarks at today's routine press
conference, Shen said the vast majority of Hong Kong residents are
confident about the future of the region, and that there isn't any
need for Americans to worry about it and no need at all to link
MFN with the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
The US' extension of the MFN status to China is a sort of trade
arrangement based on a reciprocal and mutually-beneficial basis,
the spokesman said. "This is also the basis for normal economic
and trade contacts between China and the US, and not at all a
special preferential treatment," he added.
</P>
<P>
The US side wasts time in holding annual discussions on the
issue, and this will not help the development of bilateral trade,
Shen said, expressing the hope that the US government will make
the wise choice on this matter.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Denies Involvement in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government
Wednesday denied any involvement in Tuesday's assassination
attempt on Araham Adesanya, the Deputy Chairman of the National
Democratic Coalition (NADECO).
</P>
<P>
Minister of Special Duties Alhaji Wada Nas told a BBC
broadcastt that the attempt was planned by Adesanya himself for
publicity.
</P>
<P>
Adesanya, 74, was raided by unidentified men in Lagos on
Tuesday on his way to Ogun State. Eight bullets was shot into his
car, but he and his driver were not hurt.
</P>
<P>
The car, a Mercedes Benz 200, has been towed to the police
station for examination, for one bullet had pierced the oil tank
and the gasoline was drained out.
</P>
<P>
Adesanya implied that the assassination attempt was done by
the government for quelling the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Adesanya even quoted a broadcast of the Radio Kudirat as
saying that the contract to eliminate himself and NADECO's
Chairman, Chief Michael Adekunle Ajasin had been given to the
Second Mechanised Division of the Nigerian Army in Ibadan.
</P>
<P>
However, Nas said the Nigerian government could not be
interested in assassinating Adesanya, because it can gain nothing
from it.
</P>
<P>
The assassination attempt may have been organized by the
people around Adesanya who suspected that he was cheating them on
the money they got from overseas sponsors, said Nas.
</P>
<P>
Nas alleged that NADECO is not a human rights organization but
saboteurs of government's activities under the guise of
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Adesanya's second son, a 42-year-old businessman told
reporters Wednesday that he received a death threat letter early
that morning.
</P>
<P>
The letter was reportedly picked up at his residence at
Surulere in Lagos, at 6:00 am on Wednesday morning by Adesanya's
daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
NADECO has not formally reacted to the assassinationa attempt
on its deputy chairman.
</P>
<P>
A number of other organizations, such as the Movement for
Economic and Social Justice, the Campaign for Democracy, the
National Association of Nigerian Students and others have all
condemned the assassination attempt.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanese Media Feel Downbeat after </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Beirut's press media today
showed a downbeat feeling over the prospect of the Mideast peace
process in light of the Hebron agreement initialed by the
Israelis and Palestinians Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They echoed a fear expressed Wednesday by Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi that the agreement could be used by Israel as a
"means of pressure against Syria and Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Bassem Al-Sabaa quoted the president as
saying during a cabinet meeting that the agreement "does not
necessarily mean Israel has changed its negative stance on the
peace process in the region."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed in the early hours of Wednesday,
Israel will hand over most of Hebron to the Palestinians, the
first concrete progress in the peace process since Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu took power last June.
</P>
<P>
An-Nahar, the Beirut daily with the largest circulation, said
in an editorial that "it is better not to ask questions about
negotiations on the final status" in view of the long
procrastinated talks on the problem of Hebron which "had
originally been decided."
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the last West Bank town still under the
Israeli control, should have been signed months ago under the
terms of the 1993 Oslo peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations on Hebron changed into negotiations on the
future Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank" in which the
Palestinian side has compromised a lot, the conservative paper
added.
</P>
<P>
In another editorial, the paper's publisher and editor Emil
Khoury said that "an important subject still absent from the
concern" is the problem of some half a million Palestinian
refugees residing in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has indicated a possibility that this subject will
be treated as long as Israel refuses a return of the
Palestinians to the West bank," he said.
</P>
<P>
The leftist AS-Safir daily wondered whether the agreement on
Hebron is "tantamount to a basic step" on the road to peace, or
"a mine which will definitely explode and probably lead to bloody
confrontations" between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
It noted that a "serious atmosphere" has not been created for
resumption of the peace talks on the Syrian track, then on the
Lebanese, due to the positions taken by Netanyahu for the past
seven months while in office.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing Nida Al-Watan daily claimed that the initialing
has proved that the Oslo Accord did not get the glow it deserved,

<HEADLINE> China Carries Out Practical Macro-Economic Control: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China has succeeded in its
macro-economic control efforts as a result of the correct policy
decisions set by the Communist Party, the efficiency scored by the
central government in implementing these decisions, as well as the
practical measures taken by the relevant government departments.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning
Commission, made the remarks at a news conference sponsored by the
Information Office of the State Council today.
</P>
<P>
When asked to sum up China's experience over the past three
years in macro-economic control, he said that, under the guidance
of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the
core, formulated the policies that aim to maintain moderate
high-speed economic growth while guaranteeing the quality and
efficiency in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In implementing the policies, he noted, the State Council
respects what guides the market development and safeguards the
long-term interests of the public.
</P>
<P>
During the process, the government has had a "visible hand" in
macro-economic control, hoping to prevent side-effects brought by
the blindness from "invisible hand" of the market economy, driven
by short-term goals, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the relevant government departments in charge of
different economic sectors have adopted practical measures and set
forth correct tasks and objectives by making careful and accurate
judgments of the situation.
</P>
<P>
For example, he noted, China's experienced a confused financial
market in 1993 and a fast inflation rate in 1994. In response,
authorities adopted corresponding measures to cope with problems
and reversed the trend.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the three-year-old macro-economic control is
still primary and exploratory, he said, noting that the current
situation in China is very good in terms of the macro-economy, and
problematic in the micro sector.

<HEADLINE> China To Work With Ogilvy &AMP; Mather on Brand-Name Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China will work with one of the
world's best known advertising agencies, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
Worldwide, to develop its own brand-name goods.
</P>
<P>
The idea was put forward by Li Tieying, state councillor and
minister in charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the
Economy, during a meeting this morning with Shelly Lazarus,
president of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
After briefing his guest on China's reforms and the socialist
market economy, Li said that China, in developing its economy,
needs to display its own characteristics, but should also learn
from all human achievements.
</P>
<P>
China's businesses must understand the methods of the market
economy to be a part of international society, he said, and
suggested that Ogilvy &AMP; Mather cooperate with Chinese departments
in developing Chinese brands for the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Lazarus said she was fascinated with China's economic growth
and sensed the Chinese people's interest in brand-names during her
short stay in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather has come to understand China's potential for
vibrant and successful advertising, which is one of the reasons
for her visit. She said that she hopes to help China develop its
own brands.
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather is one of the largest advertising agencies and
has handled the accounts of many multinationals like IBM, Pepsi
Cola, Kodak, and Shell.

<HEADLINE> U.N.-Sponsored Afghan Peace Talks Positive: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani Foreign Office
spokesman today described the U.N.-brokered meeting between the
Afghan Taliban militia and their opponents as a "positive" step
toward a peaceful solution to the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
It was important that representatives from all the Afghan
warring factions took part in the talks which ended on Wednesday
in Islamabad, the spokesman told a news briefing at the Foreign
Ministry this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting was the first-ever contact between the
Taliban and the anti-Taliban alliance since the rise of the
student militia in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The talks began on Monday and were attended by three
representatives from the Taliban and three representing
respectively the commander of the ousted Afghan government forces,
Ahmad Masood; northern warlord Rashid Dostum; and Karim Khalili,
who leads the Shiite Hezb-i-Wahdat faction.
</P>
<P>
The six-member working group, as termed by the U.N. special
envoy on Afghanistan, discussed issues ranging from a nationwide
cease-fire, the demilitarization of Kabul, the Afghan capital, to
the establishment of a broad-based government in their country.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators made no substantive progress at the meeting but
decided to resume talks in February.
</P>
<P>
When answering a question, the Foreign Office spokesman said
the major difference between Pakistan and Iran on the Afghan issue
was that "Iran recognizes the (Burhanuddin) Rabbani regime (the
ousted Afghan government), but we don't."
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Yakub Khan went to Tehran on
Wednesday in a bid, observers say, to forge a consensus with Iran
on bringing peace to the war-torn Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Reveals Cost of Missile Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot high-ranking
official has revealed that the cost of the Cyprus missile deal
with Russia was estimated at 200 million Cyprus pounds (about
400 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The local press today carried a statement by government
spokesman Yiannakis cassoulides, which disclosed the cost of the
deal. However, the official declined to give further details
about the quantity of missiles the Russians will deliver.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted as saying that the decision for the
arms deal was taken in full knowledge that, for technical
reasons, the weapons would not be deployed in Cyprus for at
least 16 months.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said that President Glafcos Clerides had
requested the Russian company to speed up the process of
delivery but the manufacturing companies informed him that
delivery could not take place before 16 months elapse.
</P>
<P>
"We can devote the time between now and the deployment of the
missiles to push forward a political settlement of the Cyprus
question," Cassoulides said.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that the purchase agreement does not
include a clause on the possibility of non-delivery of the
missiles, in case of sufficient progress toward a solution.
</P>
<P>
Asked what will happen if sufficient progress on a Cyprus
settlement is achieved, a development that would not warrant the
deployment of the missiles, Cassoulides said in such a case,
Cyprus would have spent 200 million pounds (400 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A solution to the protracted Cyprus problem would be well
worth this money, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' deal to buy Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missiles
with a range of 150 kilometers, signed on January 4, has
triggered criticism from the United States and Britain. And
Turkey has threatened to strike at the missiles if they are
deployed.
</P>
<P>
But the Cyprus government has refused to bow to international
pressure to cancel the deal and vowed to go ahead for the sake
of defense.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized 37 per cent of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Reform Crisis Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government plans to
strengthen the Cabinet Security Affairs Office (CSAO) to enable
the prime minister to provide more effective leadership in the
event of a crisis, a leading Japanese daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Yomiuri Shimbun said that the plan, part of the
government's drive for administrative reform, will be drawn up on
the assumption that the prime minister will take direct command of
handling emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The CSAO, which comprises senior bureaucrats of the Defense
Agency, the Foreign Ministry, the National Police Agency and four
other government bodies, has been accused of being ineffective
during the Gulf War and in the aftermath of the Great Hanshin
Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto has admitted defects in the government's
administrative structure, citing his executive office's failure to
gather information about the attack on the Japanese ambassador's
residence in Lima by Peruvian rebels.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the CSAO will be reorganized and given powers
to secure information and initiate measures to cope with crises,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The head of the office, who will probably be recruited from
outside the government -- possibly a former chairman of the Joint
Staff Council of the Self-Defense Forces, will also serve as one
of the prime minister's senior aides, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Administrative Reform Committee, which is under the direct
control of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, is responsible for
drawing up detailed proposals to beef up the office.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Recapture Bagram Airbase North of Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, Pakistan, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban
militia recaptured the Bagram airbase, about 50 kilometers north
of Kabul, from the anti-Taliban alliance early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that three Taliban fighters were
killed and seven others injured during the fierce battle while 12
opposition soldiers also died.
</P>
<P>
Maulvi Shahabuddin Dilawar, the Taliban Councilor in Peshawar,
confirmed the recapture of the Bagram by the Taliban today.
</P>
<P>
Dilawar said that the Taliban launched a two-pronged offensive
on the opposition forces in Bagram because the peace talks between
the Taliban and the three-party anti-Taliban alliance in Islamabad
ended in failure on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance includes the Uzbek militia led by
Rashid Dostum, the ousted government troops led by Ahmad Masood
and Hezb-i-Wahdat (Khalili group).
</P>
<P>
Bagram, the biggest military and civilian airport in
Afghanistan, has become a major battlefield since the Taliban
seized Kabul on September 27, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Both the Taliban and its rival forces have controlled the
Bagram airbase many times since last September.

<HEADLINE> Japan Gives No Comment on Peru's Hostage Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Foreign Ministry
failed to give any insight to hostage-holding rebels' agreement to
a format on talks over the month-old hostage crisis in Lima, Kyodo
News reported.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that the MRTA (the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement) in principle accepted the Peruvian government's proposal
on setting up a commission of guarantors," the new service quoted
a Foreign Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"So we cannot say anything at this stage as to whether the two
sides will agree to move forward," the official said, referring to
the prospects for the proposed peace commission's fate and the
course of its discussions.
</P>
<P>
The MRTA's Wednesday announcement by radio was coming in
response to Peruvian government negotiator Domingo Palermo's
Sunday proposal aimed at facilitating a peaceful end to the
hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
The proposal consists of setting up a commission of guarantors
to mediate talks, deciding a negotiation site acceptable to the
two sides and establishing the issues to be raised and a timetable
for talks.
</P>
<P>
While accepting the government proposal to set up a "guarantor"
commission, rebel leader Nestor Cerpa demanded Wednesday that the
release of his jailed comrades must be on the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Domingo Palermo, Peru's education minister, acknowledged the
receipt of Cerpa's reply in a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
In a radio conversation from within the Japanese ambassador's
residence in Lima, Cerpa pledged that the rebels would not kill
any of their hostages.
</P>
<P>
Despite the breakthrough in the crisis, the two sides remained
far apart on the key issue -- the release of about 400 imprisoned
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) members.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A record 12 million farmers in
southwest China's Sichuan Province left their hometowns in 1996 to
look for work in other counties, cities, or even distant provinces.
</P>
<P>
A study by a provincial research group on surplus rural labor
found that 6.5 million farmers left the province last year to work
in construction, housekeeping, and other businesses across the
country, some even going to Beijing and Shenzhen, or the Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 however have returned to their villages, opened
factories or went in for businesses on their own with the money
they "took" from the pockets of urbanites.
</P>
<P>
Some farmers brought back as much as seven times the annual
amount of regional revenues, the study found.
</P>
<P>
Experts cited this as an encouraging sign, saying that it
benefits the small cities and the process of urbanization.
</P>
<P>
With its more than 100 million people, Sichuan is the most
heavily populated province in China.

Tade, Investment and Finance, which closed here today, will give a
new impetus to South-South cooperation as representatives of 110
developing countries and the United Nations (UN) agencies have

</P>
<P>
First, they have reaffirmed a continued relevance and increased
importance of South-South cooperation in the current situation.
</P>
<P>
"With the increasing obstacles faced in our economic
development, with the North-South dialogue stalled and with the
emerging complementarities within developing countries, the scope

is even more pressing today than it was at the beginning of the
decade when the Caracas Program of Action was adopted," said Daudi

international decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
Official Development Assistance has dropped to 0.29 percent of
the gross national product (GDP) of developed countries in 1995,
the lowest in the past two decades or more.
</P>
<P>
Even the private investors have bypassed the region that
urgently needs funds: Africa attracted only five percent of the
foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the unbearable debt swallows 40-60 percent of export
earnings of some low-income countries. Thus, goals and aspiration
of South-South cooperation continue to be valid.
</P>
<P>
Second, participants to the conference have agreed that
South-South cooperation has a great potential as well as a bright
prospect.
</P>
<P>
With a combined population of over 80 percent of the world
total, developing countries have rich natural resources,
diversified experiences and know-hows, a wide range of products
and personnel in many fields.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by UN agencies show that trade volume
among developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America has
increased 2-3 times over that 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the share of South-South trade remains a fraction in
the world trade. If developing countries can improve their
exchange of information, a considerable increase of trade among
them will become a reality. The coordination of investment
policies among them may reduce the unnecessary competition for
attracting investors.
</P>
<P>
Though finance is a nascent industry for many developing
countries, some have accumulated experience and expertise in
banking, insurance and securities sector.

<HEADLINE> San Jose Conference Adds Impetus to South-South Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Third, South-South cooperation is based on sound conditions
today with some developing countries having achieved remarkable
progress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Some developing countries in East Asia, Southeast Asia and
South America have registered 6-11 percent annual economic growth
despite recession and slow recovery in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Mauricio de Maria Campos, director-general of the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), said that the
developing-economy share of the world manufacturing value added
rose from under 12 percent in 1970 to 20 percent in 1995 and is
expected to rise to 29 percent in the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Rubens Ricupero, secretary-general of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), said, "For the first
time, cooperation among developing countries is one among
countries with significant economic capacities and a large degree
of autonomy."
</P>
<P>
The developing countries for the first time account for over 25
percent of world trade and their exports have been growing at
twice the average of the developed ones.
</P>
<P>
In consumer markets, developing countries, in terms of equal
purchasing power, account already for almost half of the world
GNP; and many developing countries, especially in Asia, are
surplus saving countries.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, South-South cooperation is a part of interntional
cooperation and a complement to North-South cooperation, rather
than a substitute to North-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Representatives expressed their hope to establish partnership
with the developed countries and enjoy common prosperity in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, South-South cooperation needs a better external economic
environment, for which the developed countries cannot but carry
out their responsibilities and honor their commitments.
</P>
<P>
The North is expected to increase the official development
assistance to 0.7 percent of its GNP as stipulated by the United
Nations General Assembly's resolution; implement the Marrakesh
Agreements in areas of interest to developing countries; reduce
disguised protectionist measures such as labor standards,
environmental protection and human rights; and relieve the debt
burden of Africa and the least-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The representatives also reaffirm the important role of the
UN development institutions such as UNDP, UNCTAD and UNIDO.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the understanding and consensus
reached among developing countries will inject vigor into
South-South cooperation, which will develop healthily in
accordance with principles and guidelines put forward by the San
Jose Declaration and San Jose Plan of Action.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China had finished two optical
cable trunk lines by the end of 1996, providing a successful
conclusion to a series of optical cable construction projects.
</P>
<P>
According to the lastest issue of People's Post and
Telecommunications, the 462.7-km cable from the capital of
Shandong Province, Jinan, to Qingdao went into operation last
December. It is equipped with four transmission systems, each
with a speed of 622 Mb/s, meaning 20,160 telephone lines and 7,560
international call lines for the province.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou-Nanjing cable, which connects the capital cities
of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, began operation, greatly easing
the communications bottleneck between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
The cable has a total length of 338 km and will provide 35,910
telephones lines for the region, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China completed expansion projects for two of its
longest optical cables, the Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou and the
Beijing-Jiujiang-Guangzhou, which are part of a nationwide optical
trunk grid.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament to Vote on Hebron Deal Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset
(parliament) is expected to pass the long-awaited Hebron accord by
a large majority today, due to pledges by the Labor-led opposition
to lend its support to the government.
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear whether the vote will be turned into a
motion of confidence instead of an endorsement of the agreement,
which had already been approved early this morning by the Israeli
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The accord was initialed Wednesday morning at the end of a
summit meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat
at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The far right-wing Moledet party is threatening to file a
no-confidence motion today.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli government has said it would counter
this by changing the vote into a motion of confidence.
</P>
<P>
Under such situation, the National Religious Party ministers
are expected to absent themselves from the voting and the rest of
the party would either vote against, abstain or leave the room.
</P>
<P>
Although the Knesset has ratified other international
agreements, including the Camp David Accords to make peace with
Egypt, and the Oslo Accords for settlement on the country's
long-time disputes with the Palestinians, this is the first time
that it is going to vote on an agreement which has just been
initialed and not signed and implemented.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset session is scheduled to open with a speech by
Netanyahu, followed by an open discussion in which any member of
the Knesset (MK) who wants to address the House will be
allocated five minutes.
</P>
<P>
Knesset House Committee Chairman Raphael Pinhasi (Shas) has
demanded that the vote be postponed to Sunday to avoid the
possibility of the implementation of the agreement on the Jewish
weekend Sabbath (Saturday), but Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai assured him the army would not be involved in Sabbath
desecration.
</P>
<P>
At present, the agreement is expected to pass in the
120-member Knesset, although several MKs have said they will not
support it.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A considerable number of
international observers will monitor the forthcoming Pakistani
elections scheduled for February 3, a Pakistani Foreign Office
spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing at the Foreign Office this
afternoon, the spokesman said, "we have issued the invitations to
various non-governmental organizations to send observers."
</P>
<P>
A non-governmental body of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) based in Sri Lanka has been sending
observers to monitor polls held in SARRC member states, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The body will send the observers to Pakistan again," he added.
</P>
<P>
"However, I cannot give you the exact number of the coming
observers," he noted, adding that so far, Pakistan has been told
that each SARRC country will send 10 observers.
</P>
<P>
SARRC comprises Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka,
Maldives, Nepal and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, the spokesman said that no official
observers will come, and the coming observers are in non-official
status.
</P>
<P>
"They will come on their own and pay their own expenses," he
noted, adding, "they are completely free."
</P>
<P>
"We just give them guidance and the logistic assistance that
they may need," he said.
</P>
<P>
The observers are totally independent, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Asked to Change Foreign Labor Sponsor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) has called on the Kuwaiti government to
introduce a new sponsor system for foreign workers to replace
the existing one which it said has "a lot of weaknesses."
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with local English daily Arab Times,
which was published today, director of the ILO Office in Kuwait
Abubakr Badawi said the ILO is ready to help the Kuwaiti
government adopt viable and practical alternatives for the
existing sponsor system whereby any working foreigner in Kuwait
must be sponsored by a Kuwaiti.
</P>
<P>
He said the ILO is ready to offer some other alternatives to
the system, adding that the system has "a lot of weaknesses." He
said the issue has been raised with the Kuwaiti government
several times. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The interview was conducted in the context that a new labor
law in Kuwait is expected to be completed shortly.
</P>
<P>
There are more than one million foreign laborers working in
Kuwait, accounting for about two thirds of the Kuwaiti labor
market. Most of them are from Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said that expatriate workers in Kuwait should be
entitled to a pension and retirement scheme like their Kuwaiti
counterparts, stressing that there should be no difference
between local and foreign laborers with regards to social
security.
</P>
<P>
As Kuwait does not have a minimum wage standard, he said the
ILO hoped that Kuwait would introduce the concept of minimum
wages.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Child Laborers Exceed 200,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan child laborers has
exceeded 200,000 and one-fourth of them work on agricultural farms
with poor payment, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The press quoted the annual report from the U.N. Children's
Fund (UNICEF) as saying that Kenya is listed as one of the
countries in the world hit hard by child labor.
</P>
<P>
"A recent survey in Kenya showed that 78 percent of child
payment is 'in kind,' usually in the form of the occasional new
dress or shoes. Only 17 percent say they are paid in cash,"
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Children comprise one-fourth of all agricultural workers and
are commonly seen in urban areas of Kenya, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of children work in households as maids, taking up
duties of the wife of the house, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Poverty and underdevelopment are the root causes driving
children into hazardous labor, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Now a center, funded by the International Labour Organization,
has been set up in Nairobi to offer basic training and
education to about 100 children.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is among the first signatories to the Convention on
Rights of the Child which became international law on September
2, 1990.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Kenyan Attorney-General Amos Wako said that at
least 19 Acts of Parliament would be amended to be in line with
the provisions of the Convention.
</P>
<P>
Wako noted that the government was adopting administrative and
other measures to ensure compliance of the requirements set by
the Convention.

<HEADLINE> Poland Keen to Join European Monetary Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Poland should make itself a
member state of the European Monetary Union (EMU) by 2006 and
replace national currency zloty with euro by then, said Polish
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko.
</P>
<P>
Kolodko made the remarks Tuesday when he presented a government
10-year plan "Euro 2006."
</P>
<P>
The plan, which was designed to help realize the government's
hope of joining the European Union by 2002 and the EMU by 2006,
was approved earlier by a government committee in charge of the
issues of European intergration process.
</P>
<P>
The plan pointed out that a major obstacle to Poland's
admission to the EMU is the high inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1991 Maastricht Treaty, a would-be member state of
the EMU should maintain an annual inflation rate of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Poland's inflation rate in 1996 was 18.5 percent, and the
government planned to lower it to 13 percent in 1997, to 5 percent
in 2000 and to 2.5 percent in 2006.
</P>
<P>
The government should also push forward the privatization
process and the reforms of the social security system and
industrial and agricultural structures, the plan added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's CPI Increases by 3.5 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Consumer Price
Index (CPI) for 1996 increased by 3.5 percent to 107 compared with
the previous year, according to the Statistics Department today.
</P>
<P>
The CPI, a measure of inflation, rose 3.3 percent to 108.4 for
December 1996 compared with that for the same month in 1995, but
only by 0.2 percent compared with November 1996, it said in its
CPI figures released today for December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5 percent increase in the CPI for 1996 was brought about
by increases observed in the indices of all main groups except
for clothing and footwear which decreased by 0.7 percent, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
Notable among those increases were food which increased 5.7
percent, medical care and health expenses (3.7 percent),
recreation, entertainment, education and cultural services (3.3
percent), and gross rent, fuel and power (3.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous goods and services also recorded an increase of
2.5 percent, beverages and tobacco (2.2 percent), transport and
communication (1.4 percent) and furniture, furnishings and
household equipment and operation (1.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
The two main groups -- food and gross rent, fuel and power --
together accounted for 78.5 percent of the overall increase
recorded during the review period.
</P>
<P>
The index for food increased 5.7 percent to 110.9 in 1996 from
104.9 in the previous corresponding period, which was the result
of six percent increase for food at home coupled with the increase
of 5.2 percent for food away from home.
</P>
<P>
The indices for furniture, furnishing and household equipment
and operation; beverages and tobacco; and recreation,
entertainment, education and cultural services remained unchanged
at 103.9, 105.3 and 105.8 respectively whereas decreases were
observed for gross rent, fuel and power (0.4 percent) and clothing
and footwear (0.7 percent).
</P>
<P>
The index for coffee and tea remained stable at 105.5 while the
indices for oils and fats and other foods declined 0.2 percent and
0.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia targeted inflation rate below 4 percent for 1996 and
the rate was estimated to be 3.6 percent for the whole year.

breakthrough in the widespread problem of electric contacts made
of copper oxidizing too easily.
</P>
<P>
Electric contacts are a key part of electrical appliances and
are normally made of silver with its superior electric
conductivity. China has to import as much as 80 percent of the
silver it uses for industrial purposes each year.
</P>
<P>
Tests showed that the performance of copper contacts is better
than that of silver, at a cost that was only 58 percent that of
silver.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Tough on Timeframe Flexibility on IT Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has threatened to quit
the World Trade Organization (WTO) talks on ending tariffs on
information technology (IT) if WTO members do not give Thailand
leeway on the timeframe.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan told a meeting here
on Wednesday that without timeframe flexibility, Thailand "may not
join the information technology agreement" of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
At the WTO ministerial meeting in Singapore last December,
Thailand, balking at the implementation timeframe, refused to sign
an agreement on eliminating tariffs on information technology
products by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
At the information technology talks which will begin on January
31 in Geneva, Thailand will propose three lists of products in the
order of their sensitivity to its economy.
</P>
<P>
If the WTO does not agree to the Thai request for flexibility,
the Thai government will attempt to find common ground with
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Amnuay
said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The first category will include products for which Thailand can
meet the WTO timeframe by the year 2000. It comprises products
which do not use local content and carry tariffs of almost zero
percent already.
</P>
<P>
The second category will include products with tariff rates of
up to 5 percent. Thailand will seek leeway of up to six years
before eliminating the tariffs, starting from 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the third category, Thailand will seek a delay of seven to
10 years on "sensitive" products, which carry tariff rates of
between 5 and 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Approves Hebron Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet today
approved an agreement on the Israeli army's redeployment in
Hebron, reached after a late Tuesday night summit meeting between
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
After close to 12 hours of deliberation, the cabinet
approved the agreement by an 11 to 7 vote in the early
hours of this morning, followed immediately by the dramatic
resignation of diehard opponent Science Minister Ze'ev Begin.
</P>
<P>
Leading the attack in the cabinet against the agreement
were Begin and National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon.
Begin charged that Netanyahu was ceding the historic "Jewish
homeland."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian leadership, including selected members
of the national council, legislative council, cabinet and PLO
executive committee, met in Gaza Wednesday night and approved
the Hebron agreement after a three-hour session.
</P>
<P>
While they conceded that it filled in many holes of the
more sketchy arrangements drawn in the Oslo 2 agreement, where
Hebron guidelines occupied only two pages out of 300, the
Palestinians considered their biggest achievement to be hard
dates for three further pullbacks supported by a U.S. letter.
</P>
<P>
They gained this by being flexible on Hebron itself,
offering Israel a further year to implement the final
redeployment, while bending on such issues as a police
presence at the Machpela Cave (the Ibrahimi Mosque) and
identical weapons for the Israeli army and Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
The accord, including a protocol concerning the Hebron
redeployment and "a note for record" dealing with further West
Bank pullouts and other issues, was initialed in the early
hours of Wednesday morning at the Erez checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, the Israeli army will leave some 80
percent of Hebron within 10 days if not sooner, and will redeploy
its troops in rural areas of the West Bank in three phases, with
the first one to be carried out during the first week of March,
and the last in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Within two months after the implementation of the Hebron
redeployment, the Israelis and Palestinians will begin
negotiations on the final status in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
By August 1998, the Palestinians are due to control most
parts of the West Bank except Jewish settlements and what
Israel considers as military areas.
</P>
<P>
In other commitments, Israel agreed to release Palestinian
prisoners and to resume negotiations immediately on opening a
Palestinian airport in the Gaza Strip, as well as a
safe-passage between the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
For their part, the Palestinians agreed to complete the
process of revising the Palestinian National Charter which calls
for the destruction of Israel, to fight terrorists and to
confiscate illegal firearms.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians also agreed to deal with Israeli requests
to transfer of suspects and defendants in accordance with the
Interim Agreement, known as the Oslo II accord.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet secretary Danny Nevah said that one of the
most important achievements for Israel was a letter of
guarantee to Netanyahu by outgoing U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Among other issues, the letter permits Israel to unilaterally
decide the size of the areas it will turn over to the Palestinians
and ultimately the areas to be turned over in a final
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Today, the Hebron accord is expected to be passed in the
Knesset (Israel's parliament) without difficulty, since Netanyahu
enjoys the support of the opposition parties concerning the
peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cager Jumps up for Stupid Dunk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- With whimsical passes and
flying dunks, the sport of basketball is attracting more and more
fans to the stadiums around the world.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a drama was orchestrated by a budding cager Zhao
Renbin in the Chinese Men's first-division league game in the
northeastern city of Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
With 16 mintues after the half break, Shenyang Army Lions still
led 65-58 against Shanghai Oriental at home in gusts of applauses.
</P>
<P>
Then the drama echoed in the stadium when Zhao Renbin, in
jersey number six, intercepted a pass at the backcourt and jumped
over for a dunk into his own basket without any hesitation.
</P>
<P>
Spontaneously, Zhao Renbin swung his arms for the feat before
sorrow crept upon his face and he stood aghast in a second.
</P>
<P>
Home fans jeered in chaos and two points were scored for the
Oriental for 65-60. However, the Lions still managed for a 74-68
home win.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army on Alert for Violence in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Large numbers of Israeli
soldiers, police, and border policemen have been brought in to
Hebron to ensure a smooth redeployment in the city, which is
expected soon after the Knesset gives its approval today.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted military sources as saying that soldiers
have been instructed to be on special alert to foil attempts
by extremists from both sides to disrupt the transfer during
this sensitive interim period.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the massive presence of army forces
in the city is aimed at deterring a repeat of an attack like
that of Noam Friedman, the off-duty Israeli soldier who fired
on Arab shoppers in the city two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"Soldiers are on alert," said one officer in Hebron. "If
anything there are more forces and police and border policemen
here than ever so they are actually deterring the repeat of
such incidents."
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we are waiting for orders from the government
to carry out the redeployment. Nothing has been changed yet,"
the officer added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai issued orders to
the army Wednesday not to begin the redeployment until the
Knesset gives its authorization.
</P>
<P>
However, Mordechai allowed for heavy equipment to be moved
following this morning's cabinet approval of the agreement,
officials in the defense ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senior Israeli army officers met Wednesday with top
Palestinian security officials to coordinate the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, the Palestinians handed over to
Israel the names of the 400 Palestinian policemen who are
expected to take up position in Hebron as well as the serial
numbers of their weapons.

TAIYUAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China's inland province of
Shanxi has given trade development a shot in the arm since its
airport at Taiyuan, the provincial capital, was approved by the
State Council to handle overseas business in 1993, Shanxi's first
port of entry ever.
</P>
<P>
When a Russian cargo plane took off recently at Wusu Airport
there, it signalled the opening of Shanxi's first international
cargo-transport route.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the airport has handled more than
15,000 travelers from overseas. There have been more than 300
charter flights from Taiyuan to Hong Kong with no incident during
that period.
</P>
<P>
Taiyuan's land port of entry, which began operation a year ago,
is also playing an increasingly important role in Shanxi's cargo
transport business, especially container transport.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to set up a complete port network by the end
of the century, with an airport to be established at Datong, and
land ports in Changzhi, Datong, and Houma cities, local officials
say.

<HEADLINE> Gas Price Hike Unavoidable: Manmohan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Finance Minister
Manmohan Singh has said that a gasoline price hike in the country
is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report to Congress President Sitaram Kesri, he said
the mounting deficit in the oil pool account caused by an
unexpected decline in the domestic production of crude oil and
rise in international prices "is giving rise to expectations that
sooner or later government will have to adjust domestic prices of
petroleum products."
</P>
<P>
The former finance minister has called for an orderly
replacement of the present administered pricing mechanism for
petroleum products and coal by a more rational system reflecting
the cost of supply. The withdrawal of the administered price
mechanism needs urgent attention, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Demand for petroleum products which is currently 81 million
tons is expected to go up to 113 million tons by the end of the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1998-2002)," He noted. "Yet we do not have a
credible demand management policy."
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid strong criticism from left constituents in
the United Front government as well as opposition parties in the
country, the union government so far has taken no decision to hike
the prices of petroleum products to reduce the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deve Gowda said Wednesday that the government
would resort to "borrowings" to bridge the mounting deficit of
more than 125 billion rupees ( 3.52 Billion U.S. dollars) in the
oil pool account.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say what is going to happen ( on oil prices ) in the
next budget for five to six months from now," Gowda said.

<HEADLINE> China To Develop Capital Market Through Legal Means </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government says it
will promote the healthy development of the capital market through
improvements in the legal system in the coming years, according to
the minister in charge of the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The minister, Chen Jinhua, in speaking to a group of Chinese
and foreign reporters at a news briefing sponsored by the
Information Office of the State Council today, explained that
China's fledgling capital market, including the stock and futures
markets, has developed rapidly in the past few years, and there
are still many problems.
</P>
<P>
The main problems are the people working in the markets, the
lack of experience of local securities and futures traders, and
the lack of an adequate legal system and governmental
administration in the markets, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he said, local securities markets suffered from
overheated trading and excessive speculation, and the market was
stablized only when the government intervened.
</P>
<P>
In future, the government will make a greater effort at
perfecting the law and regulations to guide the capital markets as
they develop, rather than using only administrative means, and he
remarked that those enterprises listed on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange should familiarize themselves with the law and follow
it.

quality of the grain.
</P>
<P>
There were two trial plots at CSIRO Ginninderra Experiment
Station in Canberra, from which a few hundred plants were
harvested yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The first plot was a test of a "marker gene" to monitor the
field performance of the enhanced wheat varieties.
</P>
<P>
The second trial was aimed at measuring starch composition and
quality of plants that have been genetically enhanced. This would
help scientists better understand how they can modify starch
composition in wheat with a view to improving dough and baking
qualities.
</P>
<P>
"The trials are proving successful and our aim is to transform
a number of wheat varieties with key improvements linked to plant
performance such as disease resistance and grain quality," Peacock
said.
</P>
<P>
Wheat production in Australia is worth 4.4 billion Australian
dollars (3.52 billion US dollars) a year to the economy, and any
moves to make production and processing more efficient will result
in a huge increase in productivity.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Think Tank To Modernize Information Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, regarded as a think tank for the central government,
will join the Internet this month, according to an official there.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua today that it will get a site on the World Wide
Web, with the help of the Ministry of Electronics Industry. But,
before all of its 33 institutes can get on the Internet, the
academy will build a computer network to link them because they
seldom have much contact with each other.
</P>
<P>
Six research institutes, including those of economics and
history, will set up data bases soon.
</P>
<P>
The academy spent about 10 million yuan (1.1 million US
dollars) on its information moderization drive last year, and a
training program has been launched to make all its researchers
under the age of 45 computer literate.
</P>
<P>
The academy, which was set up in 1977, is seldom seen as being
very trendy in this age of global information revolution, even
though it has the top seat in liberal arts and social science
research in the country.
</P>
<P>
A shortage of money and a lack of sense of modern trends among
the academy's elder scholars are blamed for the large number of
computer illiterates among its 2,000 researchers.
</P>
<P>
In recent years however more scholars have visited universities
and institutes overseas, and have been shocked by the popularity
of computer technology in the western world.
</P>
<P>
The modernization plan will help the academy continue to play a
leading academic role in the world, officials said.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- World top player Pete Sampras
conceded one set to enter the third round of the Australian Open
in Melbourne on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras lost the first set before winning the next three sets
in a row to eliminate unseeded Romanian Adrian Voinea 3-6, 6-2,
6-3 and 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The top player who bowed out of the Open last year in the third
round, acknowleged that he had entered the danger zone as he plays
in-form Mark Woodforde who has an impressive list of upset wins in
his 14-year career.
</P>
<P>
"He is very capable of beating me and I hope I hit the ball a
bit better than I did today," said Sampras who won all eight
matches against the Austrlian.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Woodforde who climbed to 28 in the world rankings,
caused major upsets in the tennis world by toppling former world
number one Andre Agassi, Thomas Muster and Thomas Enqvist.
</P>
<P>
On the center court, Sampras once became vulnerable against
48-ranked Voinea in the first set but pulled himself back in time
to seal the competition with 14 aces.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Erupts in Western Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fighting erupted in
western Afghanistan between the Afghan Uzbek militia led by Rashid
Dostum and the Taliban militia last night, local press reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out following the talks between the Taliban
and the anti-Taliban alliance in Islamabad had failed to score any
achievement.
</P>
<P>
This was also believed to be the first-ever battle between the
Afghan warlords during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan which
started last Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Dostum's forces launched a massive ground
attack against the student militia in the western province of
Badghis.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting continued between the two factions, said the
reports, adding that no shift in previous position was observed.
</P>
<P>
Fighting was also reported between Dostum forces and the
Taliban militia in Ghor province.
</P>
<P>
Afghan observers believed that fighting was likely to intensify
in different parts of Afghanistan after failure of the talks
between representatives of the Taliban and the anti-Taliban
alliance in Islamabad, which ended on Wednesday without any
progress.
</P>
<P>
The talks, organized by the UN Special Envoy Norbert Holl,
failed to produce any fruitful results as was obvious from the
beginning of the parley.
</P>
<P>
Both sides were giving priority to their demands instead of
trying to develop a consensus on establishing peace in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Afghanistan's ousted defense minister
Ahmad Masood and Dostum had recently met in northern Afghanistan
and discussed the prevailing situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The two faction leaders had agreed to launch joint attacks on
Kabul as well as provinces controlled by the Taliban, who now
controls two thirds of the Afghan territory.
</P>
<P>
It was yet not clear whether Masood forces were involved in the
continued fighting or not.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia overran Kabul last year and pushed the
forces of the ousted government led by Masood towards north.
</P>
<P>
The spectacular rise of Taliban prompted the rival groups,
including Dostum, Masood and Karim Khalili who led Shiite
Hezb-i-Wehdat faction, to close their ranks.

COLOMBO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) on Wednesday attacked two
navy dinghies off the North Western coast of Kalmunai, according
to navy sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the two dinghies were made of fiber
glass. One of them was damaged and captured by the rebels along
with one soldier on board. The other craft had escaped.
</P>
<P>
The missing personnel were identified as a sailor, patrolman
and a volunteer.
</P>
<P>
The sources believed that the two dinghy patrol crafts had gone
too close to the rebel-held territory.
</P>

The LTTE has been fighting a guerrilla war for an independent
homeland for minority Tamils in the Indian Ocean island's north

<HEADLINE> San Jose Declaration Calls For Stronger Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The South-South Conference on
Trade, Investment and Finance today adopted a declaration calling
for stronger cooperation among developing countries and better
North-South dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference concluded today.
</P>
<P>
The San Jose Declaration noted that since the Caracas Program
of Action was adopted in May 1981, historical circumstances
have changed considerably and developments of great significance
have taken place, introducing new trends and reshaping central
aspects of the international agenda.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries reaffirm the continual relevance and
increasing importance of South-South cooperation in the current
international situation and recognize the great potential for
furthering this cooperation, says the declaration.
</P>
<P>
"We resolve to strengthen cooperation among the developing
countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit,
complementarity and common development. We emphasize that a more
dynamic economic cooperation will significantly contribute to the
strengthening of South-South cooperation in other fields," the
declaration read.
</P>
<P>
While many countries and regions of the South had followed
different patterns in economic growth, the advantages of
cooperation and economic integration among countries of the South
constituted a promising strategy to foster their development,
according to the declaration.
</P>
<P>
"We reiterated that South-South cooperation constitutes an
important element of international economic cooperation and viable
strategy for greater collective self-reliance for national,
regional and global development," the declaration read.
</P>
<P>
There was also a firm conviction that South-South cooperation
was not a substitute for, but rather a complement to North-South
cooperation. The declaration vigorously stressed the strengthening
of North-South dialogue, through which the countries of the North
were called upon to fulfil their international commitments.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the unexplored or un-utilized capacities in the
South, the member countries of the Group of 77 and China believed
that the realization of the full potential and opportunities
offered by South-South cooperation were extricably linked to a
favorable external economic environment.
</P>
<P>
The external economic environment should enable the developing
countries to play a more active role in international policy
decision-making processes, improve their terms of trade and
access to international markets, promote their commercial and
industrial competitiveness, provide a durable solution to their
external debt problem and support their efforts in achieving
sustained economic growth and sustainable development, the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
As globalization and the revolution in information technology
had increased economic interdependence, the different levels of
economic development must be addressed in South-South cooperation
so as to accelerate development and enhance capacities to deal
with the new challenges.
</P>
<P>
The declaration stressed the importance of partnership among
public and private entrepreneurs, non-governmental organizations
and civil society.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the United Nations must play an important role in
expanding South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the developing countries, in the spirit of true
partnership for development, called on the developed partners and
relevant international institutions to provide concrete support to
the efforts of developing countries to strengthen South-South
cooperation, according to the declaration.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- India's Cabinet Committee on
Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Wednesday approved some proposals and
recommendations in a bid to press ahead with economic reforms in
the country, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The CCEA okayed a statutory telecom regulatory authority of
India (TRAI), cleared the government equity in infrastructure
development finance company (IDFC), lifted the ban on mega
petrochemical projects to borrow from public financial
institutions, and reintroduced incentives for new sugar mills.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the CCEA also approved a new policy for highway
development clearing the guidelines for private investment in
highway development through the build-operate-transfer route
(BOT).
</P>
<P>
The TRAI will have the task of resolving disputes between
private service providers and ensure technical compatibility and
effective interconnection between different service providers.
</P>
<P>
The TRAI setting-up is expected to provide confidence to the
private sector investors, both Indian and foreign, to invest in
the telecom sector.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also approved a proposal to enact new measures for
land acquisition for national highways and simplification of
environmental clearance and procedures for financial approval.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Industrial Zone Faces Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chittagong export processing
zone (EPZ), Bangladesh's first EPZ with over 80 different types of
industrial units, is running short of water, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The total demand of water in the Chittagong EPZ is now over 1.6
million gallons a day, but only about 1.15 million gallons of
water are being supplied to this country's most important
industrial zone, according to the English-language daily the
Financial Express.
</P>
<P>
Due to implementation of several more industrial units in the
EPZ at the beginning of this year, the gap between the requirement
and the supply of water increased further, although the
authorities had installed several deep tubewells in that area.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, construction of water consuming industries
such as textiles, printing and packages, and dyeing is discouraged
in the Chittagong EPZ, the paper added.

<P>
SAN JOSE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The South-South Conference
adopted a plan of action at the closing session here this evening,
calling on developing countries to make a more rational and
effective use of their resources through South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The San Jose Plan of Action elaborated specific measures for
strengthening South-South cooperation in trade, investment,
finance and industrialization.
</P>
<P>
The plan said that developing countries should promote full and
faithful implementation of the Marrakesh Agreements, especially in
areas of interest to developing countries, such as textiles and
agriculture and those in favor of least-developed countries and
net-food-importing developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries should also resist pressures for new
protectionist measures and develop an agenda to be pursued for
further liberalization, the plan said.
</P>
<P>
They should consult on issues such as investment, competition
policy and trade and environment, effectively utilize the dispute
settlement mechanism of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
implement the decisions in favor of the least-developed countries,
which were approved at the WTO Singapore Conference, the plan added.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries need to build up their capital markets and
stimulate private domestic investment, and seek international
direct investment through joint venture partnerships, the plan
said.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested that intra-regional and inter-regional
agreements be pursued to encourage integration of the Southern
financial markets; institutional and regulatory capacity be
developed for expansion of South-South financial transactions; the
capacity in mobilizing capital be enhanced for investment in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77 and China reaffirm that industrialization of
developing countries should be urgently promoted in order to
contribute to the eradication of poverty and the creation of
productive employment, the plan said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Justifies Joint Hydro Projects with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
said that two proposed major water projects, to be jointly
developed by Nepal and India, will be implemented in Nepal's
national interest.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here on Wednesday evening, the Water
Resources ministry said that Nepal prepared a report on the two
projects with full guarantees of national interests, including
benefits sharing in terms of flood control, power generation and
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, a joint technical group between the
two countries earlier had issued guidelines for detailed studies
on the two high dams on Koshi river, which flows from east Nepal
into India, and entrusted Nepal with drafting an inception report.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has accorded first priority to the irrigation-oriented
Sunkoshi Diversion project, followed by the Saptakoshi
Multi-purpose project which will be built mainly for power
generation and flood control, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's statement came out after oppositions argued that
a recent Nepal-India agreement to start the detailed study for the
Saptakoshi project was against Nepal's national interest.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed last week after a meeting of the
Nepal-Indian joint technical group in Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
Water resources experts here also were puzzled by the bilateral
agreement as the lingering differences over the Saptakoshi
project, which could become the largest hydro project in Nepal
with an over 250-meter-high dam, between Nepal and India were
ironed out suddenly.
</P>
<P>
India earlier had emphasized the flood-control benefits of the
project while Nepal paid more attention to its irrigation and
navigation facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to Nepali officials, the joint detailed study for the
two high-dam projects, to be funded by India, will look into all
these aspects and come up with a report suitable for both sides
within three or four years.

<HEADLINE> Thai MPs Urged to Tighten Belt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai house Speaker Wan Muhamad
Nor Matha on Wednesday urged members of the House of
Representatives to spend taxpayers' money sparingly to help cut
the country's huge current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Wan Muhamad Nor Matha, who also serves as president of the Thai
Parliament, told chairmen of the 23 committees in the Lower House
to think twice before they organize overseas trips in light of the
country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that any overseas trips must be considered by all
members of the respective committees, not just its chairman alone,
which used to be the practice.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that each of the 23 house committees is
allocated 3 million baht (120,000 US dollars) every year for
overseas visits.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post said that certain house committee members took
their families on official trips overseas and some committees even
chose to go to countries which have nothing to do with their work.
</P>
<P>
The call made by the Thai parliament leader coincided with
recent appeals made by Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
to urge government officials to save every satang for the public
benefit.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Dollar Soars Against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian dollar jumped half
a cent to 74.54 U.S. cents today on the currency markets, good
news for average Canadians, since so many of the products sold here
are imported.
</P>
<P>
The steep rise of the Canadian dollar was fueled mainly by an
up-beat article on Canada's economy by The Financial Times and a
"buy" recommendation from a major currency dealer, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Today's rise continues the push the Canadian dollar got last
week, when it jumped more than a cent. The currency has now
reached its highest level since last November, when it reached 75
U.S. cents for the first time in a year. But it then fell to 72
cents by the end of the year as institutions cashed in year-end
profits.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts say the dollar could rise to between 75 and 80
U.S. cents this year. But they warned that, if the Canadian dollar
reaches 78 to 80 U.S. cents, it would raise the price of Canadian
exports and exporters would start to lose their cost advantages
over other competitors in international markets.

JAKARTA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Most of Indonesia's 17,500
islands do not have names, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it's urgent to find names for the many isles,"
chief of the Survey and Mapping Agency Paul Suharto said Wednesday
after signing a cooperation agreement with the Home Affairs
Ministry on the project, The Jakarta Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia had yet to find names for 11,808 of its isles
across the world's largest archipelago.
</P>
<P>
The country is also having a headache in finding proper names
for numerous rivers, forests, mountains and hills, he added.
</P>
<P>
The absence of names posed problems for search and rescue
operations trying to locate incidents in remote places, he said.
</P>
<P>
The project will involve linguists from the Center for
Development of Indonesian Language, he said.
</P>
<P>
He refused to say how much the project will cost.

<HEADLINE> Thai Baht Hits Six-Year Low Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Thailand is
considering whether it needs to take any action after the Thai
currency slipped to a six-year low against the U.S. dollar on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand fixed the mid-rate at 25.69 baht to the
dollar Wednesday, raising it from 25.66 on Tuesday. The U.S.
dollar was traded at 25.632 baht before rising to 25.638 and was
closed at 25.632, with moderate transactions.
</P>
<P>
The overnight interest rate on loans among banks ranged from
10.5 to 11.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
A source in the Bank of Thailand's Banking Department predicted
that the baht would depreciate further against the greenback but
would rise against the German mark and the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The source said international investors would continue to buy
more dollars for investing on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
index was setting records, so as to gain from both the greenback's
appreciation and capital gains on stocks.
</P>
<P>
The weakening of the baht against the greenback would affect
Thailand's external debt, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Some exporters expressed the hope that the central bank would
take this opportunity to devalue the baht to boost Thailand's
exports. But the bank disagreed, arguing that the exchange rate is
only one of several factors in boosting exports.
</P>
<P>
Other factors affecting exports include trade barriers and
competitiveness of Thai goods on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Although depreciation of the baht could in some way boost
exports, it would not automatically improve the country's current
account deficit if imports remain high, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thailand faced several capital outflows arising from
speculation in the dollar and dumping of stocks in the Thai
market.

<HEADLINE> Chargesheet of Ex-President Killing Case Submitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Criminal
Investigation Department (CID) has submitted formally a
chargesheet of the murder case of former president Mujibur Rahman,
father of incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, informed sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
A copy of the chargesheet was submitted to the chief
metropolitan magistrate court on Wednesday, which has named a
total of 25 accused persons and 70 witnesses, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members were gunned down
in a military coup in 1975, three and a half years after
Bangladesh's independence.
</P>
<P>
Since Sheikh Hasina took power last June, the CID has already
arrested several persons in connection with the case, among whom
are some prominent persons including retired generals and former
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Before submitting the chargesheet, relevant authorities
including the Home Ministry have cross-checked the memorandum of
evidences, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Breast Removals Could be Avoided: Canadian Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Removal of breasts can be
avoided for many women with breast cancer when other forms of
treatment would be just as effective, said a Canadian specialist.
</P>
<P>
Mastectomies - removal of the breast - are still being
performed frequently in Canada despite the fact that it is an
outdated treatment for most patients, she said.
</P>
<P>
Adalei Starreveld, a professor of oncology at the University of
Alberta, claimed that women are not being well informed about the
options in breast cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
"The breast is one of the icons of womanhood...I think that
women should not give up their breasts without a fight," she said
in local reports.
</P>
<P>
For the most common forms of breast cancer, a lumpectomy
followed by radiation treatment was just as effective as a
mastectomy, she noted.
</P>
<P>
In a lumpectomy, only the cancerous lump is removed.
</P>
<P>
A removal of a breast was only necessary when there was more
than one cancer, or when the cancer had spread over a large area,
she said.
</P>
<P>
However, those cases represented only a fraction of the 14,400
breast cancers diagnosed in Canada every year.
</P>
<P>
At present, Canada is developing national guidelines for breast
cancer treatment. They are expected to be ready by the end of the
year.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Region Producing 16 Million Tons of Coal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region produced 16 million tons of coal last year, with
a production to sales ratio of 105 percent.
</P>
<P>
The coal industry was profitable for the first time in 10
years. It had been suffering from losses in the sector since the
late 1980s because of its outmoded production methods and limited
railway transport, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The change was attributed to concerted efforts of various coal
mining administrations and coal mines in implementing reform
measures over the past two years and in arranging production
schedules according to market demand.
</P>
<P>
The same year, the autonomous region saw an increase in its
economic efficiency in the coal industry overall, its sales, and
open market price of coal.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is one of China's six leading coal producers and one of
the country's key energy construction centers.

mountain cave on the huge rock.
</P>
<P>
Their human neighbors live in a household on the other side of
the rock, selling groceries.
</P>
<P>
The huge rock is located in Xiaguping Town of Tujia Ethnic
Group in the Shen Nong Shelf forest area.
</P>
<P>
Every March the two snakes leave the cave, enjoy sunshine,
dance gracefully or just move around the rock as though they are
taking a walk.
</P>
<P>
According to the female grocer, when the snakes play on the
rock, her family members usually became their audience.
</P>
<P>
The two snakes often show their care for each other, she added.
</P>
<P>
The snake couple also show off by dancing gracefully, and never
tire when they have attracted the attention of their neighbors or
passers-by.
</P>
<P>
But they do react by raising their heads high when boys throw
stones at them.
</P>
<P>
The snakes have never bitten or attacked passers-by or
residents nearby, or stolen food from them during the five years
they have lived on the rock. Instead the happy snakes enjoy a
carefree life on their huge rock, she said.

<HEADLINE> Trade Council Sets Out Exhibition Plan for Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) will conduct five China
trade exhibitions abroad and help local enterprises participate in
28 overseas expositions this year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that following advice from various Chinese
embassies, the council arranged China trade fairs in South Africa,
Morocco, Iraq, Czech Republic and Croatia. Some of those countries
have only recently set up diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 Chinese enterprises attended the fairs last
year and returned with export contracts worth 267 million US
dollars and letters of intent worth 447 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Organizing trade fairs at home and abroad is emerging as a
lucrative industry, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"China's exhibition industry is still in its early phase of
development and we will try to make sure that exhibition
organizers do their job properly," said Gong Qijun, deputy
division chief of the Council's national co-ordination office for
overseas exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
The number of international affairs involving China grew
10-fold in the past one and one-half decades as China applied an
export-based way of economic growth, statistics indicated.
</P>
<P>
A greater sense of appreciation for advertising among domestic
manufacturers, which are becoming increasingly quality and brand
conscious and stress a rise in overseas sales, has also fueled the
growth, said Gong.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian President-elect Welcomes Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President-elect Petar
Stoyanov said today he is happy to see the ruling Socialists and
the opposition moving toward reconciliation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ease in the crisis has been achieved after the Bulgarian
Socialist Party agreed to hold early elections before the end of
this year, a year ahead of schedule, Stoyanov added.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian opposition led a 10-day street protest and strike
threats to press forward with its demand for early parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov told reporters that since the incumbent President
Zheliu Zhelev has refused to ask the Socialists to form a new
government, he would help to bring about the reconciliation among
the political forces before authorizing a cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov, who was elected the president during last November's
presidential elections, attributed the Bulgarian crisis to the
government's failure in reform, social corruption and financial
instability.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist party introduced market reforms after it came
into power in 1994. But people's living standards have dropped as
a result of inflation which is running at more than 300 percent on
a year-on-year basis.

<HEADLINE> 1.6 Million More People Eliminating Poverty In Guizhou Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.6 million people in the
mountainous province of Guizhou, in southwest China, got out of
poverty and became well-to-do last year, thanks to aid-the-poor
projects financed by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
People with an annual income of less than 500 yuan (about 60 US
dollars) are listed as living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou has a dozen ethic groups who make up a third of the
province's total population, and the number of poverty-stricken
people is fairly large. By the end of 1995, that number was 7.89
million. But that's as opposed to 15 million in 1985.
</P>
<P>
China's total number of people living in poverty was 65 million
at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Great progress has been made in aid-the-poor efforts in the
province since China started its large-scale poverty-elimination
campaign in 1986, and increased the scale even more in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Guizhou provincial government officials say that some 100
million yuan (about 12 million US dollars) of World Bank loans
were put into agricultural, educational, infrastructure and other
projects last year.

BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A pair of zebras presented to
the Chinese capital by Hiroshima City in Japan have settled into
their routine at the Beijing Zoo.
</P>
<P>
To return the favor, the Beijing Municipal Government will send

Beijing and Hiroshima were hosts of the 11th and 12th Asian

of presenting a pair of Pere David's deers to Hiroshima when its
mayor came to Beijing to light the Asian Games torch in 1994.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Mount Merapi, Indonesia's most
active volcano, continued to spew burning ash and lava Wednesday,
prompting authorities to begin evacuating residents and close off
tourist attractions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The volcano, located on the Central Java and Yogyakarta border,
has been spewing hot fumes over distances of up to 4,000 meters,
reports today quoted local volcanological officials as saying.

technicians from Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean will
attend the forum to exchange scientific and technological
informations on agriculture and livestock breeding.
</P>
<P>
Chavarria emphasized that participants will have the
opportunity to exchange know-how helpful for increased

of proper technology for the socio-economic context," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mejia said COSUDE would present cases of scientific experiments
carried out in the region to improve productivity using low-cost
alternative technologies.
</P>

Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras, we were able to elevate the
production of maize almost 50 percent," he noted.
</P>
<P>

region was very low.

<HEADLINE> -  Philippines' Oil Production Down in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' oil production
continued to experience a downward trend as output in the three
oilfields only totaled 328,582 barrels in 1996, a 69-percent drop
from 1.06 million barrels in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics from the Department of
Energy, the huge drop in oil output during the year can be
attributed to the indefinite suspension of the West Linapacan
oilfield.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, West Linapacan was the largest producer of oil in the
country, accounting for 66 percent of the total output. Production
from the oilfield in 1996 however only reached 5,312 barrels.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, after a four-year closure, reactivation of
the Matinloc oilfield led an uptrend in production as output
reached 109,569 barrels in 1996, showing a significant increase of
80 percent over the 39,759 barrels a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Nido oilfield, now the largest oil producer in the country,
contributed 65 percent of the total or 213,701 barrels during the
period. However, due to a drop in production during the last
quarter, it was not able to exceed the 1995 production of 298,114
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Despite an increase in output during the last two quarters of
the year, total oil production in 1996 was still less than the
previous year, the statistics showed.

He attribute the improvements to better training and advances
in military science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The success of the naval exercises on the southeast coast shows
the improved modern defence and combat capabilities of the PLA,
the officer said, noting that 1996 was the first year for ground,
air, and naval forces to work and train under the Ninth Five-Year
Plan.
</P>
<P>
The senior officers of China's military area commands have put
training at the top on their agenda by working out and
implementing plans and personally making regular on-the-spot
checks, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
Military commands have held more than 4,000 training classes
covering 90 percent of the army troops, with 2,300 model training
teams having cited.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that the army has also paid a great deal of
attention to mastering modern technology to improve officers' and
enlisted personnel's ability to operate under more technical
conditions.
</P>
<P>
General Staff HQ, the General Political Department, and the
General Logistics Department of the PLA have worked out training
plans for officers and have arranged around 3,600 seminars on
military theory and technical know-how.
</P>
<P>
Advanced technology is being applied to the training, such as
computerized simulated combat situations and simulated training
with new equipment.
</P>
<P>
The officer also noted that training methods have been improved
in other ways. Ground forces undergo multi-purpose comprehensive
training, night exercises, and use of live ammunition. The navy
has improved preparation for manouvering in tides and waves, and
in bad weather, and the air force has expanded the practice by
using live ammunition.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Efes Pilsen beat Split

</P>
<P>
The Turkish had the best record of 10-2 after 12 matches among
the 24 clubs taking part.

six go into the last 16 to be started in March.
</P>

At half break in Istanbul, Efes were 32-23 ahead and the group
leaders never looked seriously challenged by the fifth place Split.

<P>
Petar Naumowski, the Turks' top scorer, scored the most of 21
points despite a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
In Athens, champions Panathinaikos thrashed Sevilla 90-71 in a
group G match.
</P>
<P>
Sevilla, making its debut in the top echelon, was no match for
the Greeks who scored 13 out of 20 triples.
</P>
<P>
British forward John Amaechi notched 19 points for the Greek
side while Sevilla's top marksman Michael Anderson scored 18
points.
</P>
<P>
Pananthinaikos topped group G after nine wins from 12 games and
was well on course for the last 16.
</P>
<P>
In another game, Ljubljana of Slovenia won a home game against
Pau-Orthez of France 96-86 although Lawrence Funderburke scored

<HEADLINE> Mexico Liquidates Debt With U.S. Treasury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will pay off in
advance 3.5 billion U.S. dollars Thursday to meet the balance
owing on 20 billion dollars made available to it by the United
States Treasury, Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz Martinez said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Banco de Mexico (Mexico's central bank) will also make a
prepayment of 1.5 billion dollars to the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
In February 1995, the United States and international
organizations provided Mexico with a rescue package of about 50
billion dollars after a devaluation of the Mexican peso on
December 20, 1994, set off a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Martinez pointed out that this liquidation could save Mexico
100 million dollars because of lower financing costs.
</P>
<P>
Noting that his country would close an important chapter in the
evolution of its public debt, Martinez stressed that the
liquidation eliminated the uncertainty that the refinancing of
those debts might have caused in international financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Later, President Ernesto Zedillo asserted that the liquidation
of the U.S. Treasury debt is an important step towards the
consolidation of the economic recovery of his country, and showed
that Mexico is making progress.
</P>
<P>
He added that no money was being used from the budget for the
financial operations that were being made to guarantee the
payment, and that the compliance of social programs had not been
jeopardized or limited.

BRASILIA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Oil production in Petrobras,
Brazil's largest state-owned oil company, is expected to increase
by 10 percent in 1997, a Brazilian official said today.
</P>

RIO DE JANEIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government

an increase of 120 percent over last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoran President Concludes Historic Visit to Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran President Abdala Bucaram
returned home today after concluding a fruitful -- and hopefully
peace promoting -- two-day visit to Peru.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the two governments signed four cooperation
agreements on health, protection of archaeological objects, mutual
aid in case of disasters and scholastic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram, the first Ecuadoran president to visit Peru, headed a
large delegation including eight ministers, senior government
officials, businessmen and reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was reportedly moved to tears when hearing local people
shout "Bucaram, we want peace".
</P>
<P>
This visit, which it is believed will usher in a new era in
bilateral relations, has also created a good climate for
negotiations over disputed border areas on February 17.
</P>
<P>
The Peru-Ecuador border dispute can be traced back to the
colonial period. But their relations deteriorated sharply when a
border war broke out in 1941.
</P>
<P>
Another armed border clash in January, 1995 claimed hundreds of
lives on both sides. As a result of mediation by the United
States, Chile, Argentina and Brazil, both sides agreed to a truce,
but their wide differences over the issue were never completely
solved.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The current township people's
congresses (TPCs), which were held this month in Beijing's
suburban areas, elected 4,366 women to positions as deputies,
reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing women's Association said yesterday that the women
deputies accounted for 31.34 percent of the total TPC deputies
elected, compared with 26.1 percent in the last term who were
elected three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Of all 13 districts and counties in Beijing, 12 of them saw an
increase of women deputies to the TPC compared to the last
election.
</P>
<P>
In Haidian District, for instance, women deputies made up 35.2
percent of the total deputies, up from 19.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Beijing Women's Association said that more
women elected into grassroots decision-making organizations
indicated that the quality of women's lives is improving, and
women are winning public trust. It also shows that more and more
people call for increasing involvement of women grassroots
politics, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Women's Association has made great efforts to
promote women's roles and their contributions to local social and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government encourages women to play a bigger role
in township political and economic affairs. To accomplish this
goal, it's important for more women to be elected to TPCs.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Protects Cultivated Land with Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital city of
Beijing has been striving to limit reduction in the acreage of its
cultivated land through related laws and regulations, according to
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Beijing's Municipal People's Congress, the local
legislative body, has passed three regulations including those on
protecting cultivated land. The municipal government has
implemented five related sets of rules, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Mass media in the city have publicized related state and local
laws and regulations on cultivated land protection. Tens of
thousands of citizens receive information about protection of land
resources every year.
</P>
<P>
Some 58,666 hectares of cultivated land disappeared mainly due
to the adjustment of agricultural structure and construction of
non-agricultural projects between 1993 and 1995, the report quoted
Chai Junyi, director of the city's Building and Land
Administrative Bureau, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some rural places transformed cultivated land into fruit-tree
gardens and fish ponds for more profits, Chai said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from a three-year investigation, the
total area of land in the city covers 16,422.8 square kilometers,
about 66 percent of which is for agricultural use.
</P>
<P>
With investment of nearly 10 million yuan (1.2 million US
dollars), the city has cultivated over 6,667 hectares of waste
land for agricultural use in suburban rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Various bureaux of land use have been set up in 15 suburban

<HEADLINE> Police Clash With Squatters in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were injured
in central Manila Wednesday when police clashed with hundreds of
slum dwellers armed with home-made bombs, broken bottles and
darts, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was the third straight day of clashes between police and
residents of a squatter colony in the city's Binondo district,
according to Manila Standard.
</P>
<P>
The squatters were trying to prevent government wrecking crews
from demolishing more than 500 shanties and semi-concrete houses
they had built on private property.
</P>
<P>
The demolition finally began at noon Wednesday after police
cleared the area of militant squatters.
</P>
<P>
Many slum dwellers defied eviction orders, saying government
proposed resettlement areas are overcrowded, filthy and far away
from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
The government has launched a campaign to demolish the slums in
the capital city to develop them into commercial areas.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attorney General Supports Affirmative Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno said today that she was to push a civil rights agenda that
includes strong support of affirmative action that protects the
rights of minorities.
</P>
<P>
"I recognize that there are those who believe that affirmative
action is unfair," said Reno in observing the birthday of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. in Birmingham, Alabama. "The fact that many
minorities and women are still struggling at the bottom of the
economic ladder suggests that this criticism misses the mark.
Society's reality belies all the purported special treatment for
minorities."
</P>
<P>
"Martin Luther King was a man who saw injustice and felt the
weight of oppression but refused to be broken by it," said Reno,
recalling the civil rights violence of 1963 in Birmingham and
King's role in leading protests that ended legal segregation in
the city.
</P>
<P>
However, there was disagreement in America today about what the
term civil tights even means, Reno said. "Some Americans,
including some minorities, now question by word or by deed whether
integration is still a valid goal."
</P>
<P>
She said. "I fear that what national consensus we have on civil
rights may be at risk of unraveling. We must talk openly about
race relations in this country and try to leave the angry rhetoric
behind."
</P>
<P>
She called efforts in Congress to curtail affirmative action
"misguided and counterproductive" and said California's
Proposition 209 ban on it was "both unconstitutional and bad
policy."

<HEADLINE> Boeing to Be Ordered to Retrofit 737 Rudders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration plans to order Boeing Co. to retrofit the rudder
system of its Boeing 737 to prevent any accident involving
inadvertent rudder movements, Vice President Al Gore said today.
</P>
<P>
Gore made the announcement at the end of a three-day
international conference on aviation safety and security held in
the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
He said the moves "will enhance safety, in partnership with the
aviation industry. And they help set a tone for an expanded and
more innovative approach to improving safety."
</P>
<P>
FAA officials said the modifications followed investigations
into two 737 crashes in which uncontrolled rudder movements may
have been involved. The investigations found some discrepancies
that could lead to reduced pilot control of the craft.
</P>
<P>
The modifications include a redesigned power control unit and a
new system to better stabilize the plane in flight. They are being
developed by Boeing for inclusion in its new 737 and are to be
retrofitted in some 2,700 737s now flying worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The retrofitting worldwide would cost 126 million U.S. dollars,
of which 50.4 million dollars, FAA estimated.

Burundian government to take urgent steps to ensure that the

UNHCR in a press release.

government would strive to ensure that the incident last Friday of
the killings of 122 Burundian refugees having returned from
Tanzania was not repeated.

Rukingama said that his government also deplored the incident and
suggested that a number of measures to improve the situation.
Burundi has sent a message to the United Nations concerning the
incident.
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, UNHCR High Commissioner Sadako Ogata said, "I was
deeply distressed by these killings. I am pleased that the
governments involved have assured me that steps will be taken to
prevent such a thing from happening again and that the culprits
will be severely dealt with. I repeat my call for all governments
in the region to act in a humanitarian manner to the hundreds of
thousands of people who have been displaced by conflicts there."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dennis McNamara, the UNHCR's international
protection division director, who was sent to the region at the
weekend, has held talks with high Tanzanian officials, expressing
concern over both the Burundi killings and the fate of thousands
of Rwandan refugees who remain in Tanzania, the UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 220,000 Burundian refugees in Tanzania now
and hundreds more are coming into the country each day, according
to the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said that Tanzanian ministers expressed regret over
the expulsion of the Burundian refugees. They said that the return
was not authorized by the government, whose policy was not to
return refugees to Burundi at this stage.
</P>
<P>
McNamara was assured that "very stern action" would be taken
against those responsible and that nothing of the kind would be
allowed to happen again.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Invites Arafat, Netanyahu to Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
separately invite Palestinian and Israeli leaders to Washington to
meet with President Bill Clinton in the coming weeks, The White
House said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat concluded a
long-elusive agreement on Israeli troops' pullback from the West
Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"We do expect to see Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister
Netanyahu here sometime fairly early during the course of the
year, separately," White House press secretary Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversations with Netanyahu and Arafat shortly
after the conclusion of the Hebron deal at midnight on Tuesday,
Clinton told the two leaders that he hoped to see them in
Washington soon "so they'd have a chance to discuss the next
step," an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the U.S. attention will now be focused on
"building trust and confidence" between the parties as they are
going to implement the Hebron deal and work on remaining peace
roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
The administration official suggested Jordan's King Hussein and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak might also make separate visits
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
But there are "no plans for a summit" between the Middle
Eastern leaders, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate that there will be meetings sometime in the
first quarter with at least the two major figures, and often
others are coming in this same time frame," the official said.

<HEADLINE> US Announces Plan to Convert Excess Plutonium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Energy Department of the
United States has announced that it would adopt dual-approach plan
to dispose 50 tons of plutonium that the Government says that it
must convert because of the end of the cold war, the New York
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan released on Tuesday by Energy Secretary
Hazel R. O'leary, the first approach is to immediately begin
looking for a place to mix the plutonium with uranium so it could
be used as fuel for civilian power reactors.
</P>
<P>
To pursue the second approach, the Energy Department would mix
the plutonium with highly radioactive waste and solidify it in
high-strength glass at a factory in South Carolina that is already
processing nuclear waste alone.
</P>
<P>
The announcement represents the final decision made by the
Energy Department which first disclosed the plan and drew sharp
opposition from some disarmament and environmental groups.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Welcomes Advance Repayment of Loans by Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), Michel Camdessus, today
expressed his welcome for the advance repayment of loans by
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief made remarks in a statement issued following the
Mexican government's announcement that it plans to make an advance
repayment to the IMF for the equivalent of 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars and to pay off the remaining balance of 3.5 billion
dollars owed to the U.S. under the 1995 financial package.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus noted that the package, along with the decisive
policy actions taken by the Mexican government since then "have
contributed importantly to stabilizing the economy and creating
the conditions for the resumption of growth and jobs."
</P>
<P>
"The Mexican economy is now expanding at a good pace; inflation
and interest rates are declining; export volume is up strongly and
imports have recovered; the external current account deficit is
small and there was a strong increase in net international
reserves in 1996," said the IMF chief.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus also expressed IMF's firm support for the Mexican
government's firm commitment to maintaining a strong fiscal
position and a sound credit policy--- while deepening economic
reforms designed to raise domestic savings, improve efficiency and
generate jobs at a faster rate.
