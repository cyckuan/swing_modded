Mexican musican-politican killed outside graduation party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A band leader who was a losing mayoral
candidate in northern Mexico this week was shot and killed after he
refused to have his musicians continue playing at a graduation
party.
	   Abel Rueda Sarabia, 38, died early Thursday outside the party in
Pueblo Nuevo, about 500 miles (805 kilometers) north of Mexico
City, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   Rueda Sarabia, a candidate for the National Action Party, lost
the mayoral race in Pueblo Nuevo on Sunday.
	   Durango state Gov. Maximiliano Silerio Esparza said he has
ordered the state Attorney General's Office to investigate the
killing, which he said was apparently not politically motivated.
	   Rueda Sarabia's band, Los Inseparables, had been hired to play
at the graduation party until 2 a.m. (0700 GMT) Wednesday. The band
complied with a request to continue another hour, but refused to
play longer.
	   Rueda Sarabai, the father of seven children, was shot several
times with an AK-47 as he went to his car, Notimex said.

North Korea refuses to form joint judo team with Seoul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea has rejected a proposal
that it form a joint team with rival South Korea for this year's
Judo World Cup, the International Judo Federation said Friday.
	   South Korea's Judo Association proposed in May that the two
Koreas field a single team for the inaugural International Judo
Federation World Cup in Minsk, Belarus, Sept. 12-13.
	   The Seoul-based international federation, led by South Korean
chairman Park Yong-sung, endorsed the proposal, saying it would
promote peace on the divided peninsula.
	   In its initial response on May 25, North Korea's Judo
Association insisted that forming a single team would be impossible
before all political and military problems between the two Koreas
are resolved, the federation said.
	   In another response to the federation on June 30, North Korea
said it would not send either men's or women's teams to this year's
World Cup, the federation said.
	   The two Koreas are still technically at war since an armistice,
rather than a peace treaty, ended their 1950-53 conflict. Their
border is sealed, with no mail or other direct means of
communication.
	   In the early 1990s, the Koreas formed single soccer and table
tennis teams for international tournaments.

Golfer Se Ri Pak to receive government medal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Along with the silver trophies and
hefty paychecks, LPGA rookie Se Ri Pak is going to get another
reward for her golfing achievements _ a medal from the South Korean
government.
	   President Kim Dae-jung has approved awarding a medal to Pak, who
has won two LPGA majors this year, an official of the president's
ruling party said Friday.
	   The medal wasn't specified, but it will be one of several
commonly presented for meritorious achievements in the arts, sports
and other fields.
	   Chung Kyun-hwan, secretary general of Kim's National Congress
for New Politics, said the president also plans to invite Pak to
his office for dinner or lunch when she visits Seoul sometime later
this year.
	   The 20-year-old Pak became a national hero after she won the
U.S. Women's Open last week in the first sudden death in the
history of the tournament.
	   Pak is the first rookie to win two consecutive LPGA majors since
1984. She won the McDonald's LPGA Championship in May.

gave Chicago a 5-4 led in the second.

Indonesian academic warns Australia to avoid military ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A respected Indonesian academic on
Friday urged Australia to immediately suspend military ties with
Indonesia or risk being associated with a possible bloody
crackdown.
	   Professor Arief Budiman, head of the Indonesian program at the
University of Melbourne, also said Foreign Affairs Minister
Alexander Downer had spoken too soon Thursday in praising restraint
by the Indonesian military.
	   ``I think it's better to suspend (Australia-Indonesia military
cooperation), not necessarily cancel it _ wait until further
developments occur,'' Budiman said at a conference on trends in
Islam at the University of Melbourne.
	   Budiman returned to Melbourne on Monday from a two-week visit to
Indonesia, describing the political, economic and social situation
there as ``very unpredictable.''
	   Three decades of heavy-handed rule by President Suharto ended in
May this year amid bloody riots. He was replaced by the then vice
president, B.J. Habibie.
	   Links between the Australian Defense Force and the Indonesian
military have deepened dramatically in recent years, partly due to
a 1995 security treaty between the two nations.
	   During a visit to the Indonesian capital Jakarta, Downer said
Thursday he believed that the security links helped advance the
cause of human rights.
	   ``Our position is that the military contact that we have with
the military has been a very useful vehicle for us to encourage the
exercise of restraint by the Indonesian military,'' he said.
	   ``Our judgment is that by and large the Indonesian military have
been exercising restraint,'' he added.
	   Budiman said it was too soon for Downer to form any judgment
about the human rights approach of the military under Habibie.
	   ``Everything is unsettled now, everything is in stalemate in
Indonesia,'' he said. ``I think for Downer this is a political
statement.''
	   The military could not be dissociated from human rights abuses
of the past, he said.
	   ``I think the military are still the same people. There is still
a power struggle within the military, so the military doesn't have
a clear plan what to do with the nation,'' he said.

	   In New York, Rondell White singled home the go-ahead run in the
11th inning as Montreal snapped a seven-game road losing streak.
	   Orlando Cabrera led off the 11th with a single off John Franco
(0-3) and advanced to third on two groundouts. Cabrera scored when
White hit a hard grounder past Golden Glove shortstop Rey Ordonez.
	   Mike Maddux (2-2), activated from the 15-day disabled before the
game, pitched two scoreless innings for the win. Ugueth Urbina, the
losing pitcher in Tuesday night's All-Star game, pitched the 11th
for his 21st save.
	   Mark Grudzielanek was 4-for-4 with two RBIs, and F.P. Santangelo
and Vladimir Guerrero hit solo homers for the Expos. Ordonez tied a
career high with four hits, and Butch Huskey hit a two-run homer
for the Mets.
	   New York has lost four straight and eight of 10.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A top Hong Kong soccer player was sentenced to
a year in jail Friday for conspiring to fix a World Cup qualifying
match last year, Hong Kong radio said.
	   Chan Tsz-kong pleaded guilty last month, and was sentenced
Friday by Magistrate John Brennan.
	   The radio quoted the magistrate as saying Chan's guilty plea
weighed in his favor.
	   The 26-year-old striker admitted to conspiring with teammates to
give up two goals in a World Cup qualifying match between Hong Kong
and Thailand last March in Bangkok.
	   Hong Kong lost the game 2-0.
	   Chan pocketed 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 25,641) from
a bookmaker, the territory's Independent Commission Against
Corruption said.
	   The commission said earlier that several other qualifying
matches played by the team also may have been fixed. Both Hong Kong
and Thailand were eliminated early in World Cup qualifying.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese television network provoked angry
protests from animal lovers after it aired a gourmet-food program
featuring a controversial dish: Stir-fried Bengal tiger,
Cantonese-style.
	   The endangered animal was served up to Japanese television stars
at a restaurant in Shanghai, China, in a segment of Fuji
Television's ``World Gourmet Trip,'' which aired Thursday night.
	   The Worldwide Fund for Nature, an international animal
protection agency, called Fuji to point out that that trade in
Bengal Tigers is prohibited by the 142-nation Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species.
	   ``The program shows absolutely no recognition of efforts to save
the Bengal tiger from extinction,'' Sakiko Takada, a WWF
spokeswoman in Tokyo, told the Associated Press on Friday.
	   There remain between 3,030 and 4,730 Bengal tigers left in the
wild, according to WWF statistics.
	   Other viewers also called the network to protest, saying the
program was ``in bad taste.''
	   But Fuji defended it, saying the tiger had not been killed
especially for the program. The network also said the animal had
died a year ago in a Chinese zoo and been preserved in the
restaurant's freezer.
	   ``We don't believe this program violated (the international
convention),'' Fuji said in a terse statement.
	   But it did make a concession to the sensibilities of the
protesters, adding: ``We will be careful to consider the feelings
of animal lovers in the future.''
	   Also, Fuji spokesman Seitaro Murao explained that Bengal tiger
isn't on the featured restaurant's menu, but that customers can
request it if the establishment happens to have the meat in stock.
	   Fuji's ``World Gourmet Trip'' is one of the ubiquitous food and
travel programs on Japanese television, in which celebrities travel
to exotic locations and sample unusual local delicacies.
	   After the tiger dish was served on Thursday's program, the
Japanese diners were impressed with the exotic cuisine, with one
remarking: ``Today's food was delicious!''

Selig elected commissioner in unanimous vote

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Bud Selig's voice quavered. Now he was in charge
of all of baseball, not just the Milwaukee Brewers.
	   ``I hear people say, `He's an owner and he's one of them,' ''
Selig said Thursday, minutes after fellow owners unanimously
elected him baseball's ninth commissioner.
	   ``First and foremost, for those who know me, I am a fan. There
is no one who could love this game more than I do _ its history,
its tradition, its honor and, above all, its decency.''
	   Turning their back on a tradition of independent commissioners
that began in 1920 following a thrown World Series, owners voted
30-0 for the man who had been baseball's acting head since Sept. 9,
1992, two days after they forced the resignation of Fay Vincent.
	   It was very much a day of celebration for Selig, who has devoted
his entire adult life to baseball. Selig, 64 later this month,
spent so much time at ballparks during the past 33 years that it
contributed to the breakup of his first marriage.
	   On the day of his coronation, he was surrounded by his second
wife, two daughters and four of his five granddaughters _ the
owners even allowed the little kids in their meeting room following
the vote.
	   Selig, elected to a five-year term and given a salary one
official said was about dlrs 2.25 million, grew up wanting to be
``the next Joe DiMaggio.''
	   ``After I saw my first curveball, I knew I had to do something
else,'' he said.
	   Instead, Selig entered baseball management, at first becoming a
minority shareholder in the Milwaukee Braves, then purchasing the
Seattle Pilots in bankruptcy court in April 1970 and moving the
team to Milwaukee.
	   Wendy Selig-Prieb, one of Selig's daughters, has gradually taken
over many of Selig's duties with the Brewers and is expected to
become the team's president and chief executive officer. Her father
will resign as a trustee of the trust that owns the team _
triggering the start of his term, on or before Aug. 1, according to
the resolution approved Thursday. Sal Bando will remain as the
general manager.
	   The change will be a tumultuous one for Selig, a man of habit
who walks through the stands at County Stadium each night, cheering
his players when they succeed and screaming when they don't. He
will move his office from the ballpark to downtown Milwaukee, and
he promises to make more frequent appearances at the commissioner's
office in New York.
	   Former Blue Jays president Paul Beeston, hired last July 22 as
baseball's chief operating officer, will continue to run the
sport's day-to-day operations.
	   ``The team of Selig and Beeston is the strongest possible thing
that's happened to baseball in 25 years,'' New York Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner said.

Chinese dissident arrested, state secrets cited
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese dissident detained nearly seven weeks
ago has been formally charged with unspecified crimes and prevented
from seeing his lawyer, a group of exiled democracy campaigners
said Friday.
	   Police cited no charges and gave no reasons when notifying Chen
Zengxiang's family last week of his arrest, the U.S.-based Chinese
Democratic Justice Party said.
	   While the family hired a lawyer as instructed, the lawyer has
not been allowed to see Chen because police said his case ``touched
on state secrets,'' the group reported.
	   The Chinese Democratic Justice Party said cases like Chen's
belie assertions made recently by U.S. President Bill Clinton and
others that China's human rights situation has improved.
	   Under Chinese law, suspects are supposed to be given timely
access to lawyers. That right is often denied with lawyers and
clients sometimes allowed less than a week before trial to prepare
a defense.
	   Chen was detained May 23 in the eastern port city of Qingdao in
a seasonal roundup of dissidents before the anniversary of the
military's violent quelling of the Tiananmen Square democracy
demonstrations on June 4, 1989. Chinese leaders fear commemorations
will be used to challenge their rule.
	   Some of the most prominent student leaders of the 1989 protests
and now in exile have launched a project to compile accounts of the
movement for next year's 10th anniversary, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement reported
Friday.
	   The group, headed by Wang Dan, who was released from prison and
sent to the United States in April, issued an appeal Friday for
participants in the movement to contribute recordings, journals,
protest posters and other materials to the project, the group said.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's junta commuted the death
sentence of a former military leader accused of trying to overthrow
the country's late dictator, in a move touted by the new regime as
evidence of its interest in reconciliation and democracy.
	   The announcement came amid a new burst of unrest over the death
of the country's most prominent political prisoner.
	   Fires destroyed parts of a popular central market in Lagos and
gutted homes here and in the southern city of Abeokuta.
	   The Provisional Ruling Council announced late Thursday that it
would commute death sentences handed down against Gen. Oladipyo
Diya and five other men convicted of plotting to overthrow the
country's former dictator.
	   Diya and two co-conspirators now face 25 years in prison, while
three others face 20 years. The various jail terms of nine others
convicted in the conspiracy to oust the late Gen. Sani Abacha were
also reduced.
	   Diya, who claims he was framed, was Abacha's deputy.
	   ``This gesture of goodwill is to facilitate the ongoing
reconciliation process in the country'' and in answer to numerous
pleas for mercy, the junta said in a statement.
	   The junta also announced it will set up a commission of top
officials to sketch out the broad outline for a transition to
democracy, and that the country's new military ruler, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, would address the nation on the plan next
week.
	   The country's leaders met late Thursday night to discuss plans
to hand over power to civilians and release Nigeria's remaining
political prisoners.
	   Nigeria was in the midst of a flawed transition to democracy
when Abacha died early last month. Abubakar has vowed to complete
the transition, but he has not said how or when.
	   Police say the Lagos fires were set by youths enraged at the
death earlier this week of Moshood Abiola, the imprisoned
businessman who was the apparent winner of 1993's annulled
presidential elections.
	   The government says he died of a heart attack, but his backers
believe he was killed by the junta.
	   Many members of Abiola's family also have said they believe he
was killed.
	   The government says it has completed an autopsy, but it hasn't
released the results. A second, independent autopsy to be conducted
by a team of visiting foreign pathologists was scheduled for
Friday.
	   On Thursday, hundreds of angry students gathered outside
Abiola's home in the Lagos neighborhood of Ikeja, watched over by a
large detachment of riot police.
	   Lagos woke up to calm streets, but the situation quickly
deteriorated. Four houses were burned in Abiola's hometown of
Abeokuta, where at least 10 people died in rioting on Wednesday. A
dusk-to-dawn curfew did not stop demonstrators from pouring into
the streets again Thursday, where they clashed with police firing
tear gas.
	   Police say 75 people have been arrested in Abeokuta, about 45
miles (72 kilometers) north of Lagos.
	   In a number of Lagos neighborhoods, Yorubas from southwestern
Nigeria battled Hausas from the north of the country using knives,
clubs and bows and arrows, witnesses said.
	   In one area, Yorubas accused Hausas of celebrating Abiola's
death. Hausas and Fulanis, both ethnic groups from the north, make
up a majority in the military and the junta, while much of
Nigeria's pro-democracy leadership, including Abiola, is Yoruba.
	   Brief skirmishes between police and demonstrators also broke out
in the southwestern city of Ile-Ife, where the university has been
shut down.
	   On Wednesday, Abubakar added to the chaos when he dissolved his
Cabinet. He has called the death of Abiola a ``national tragedy''
and appealed for calm.
	   The bodies of at least 24 victims from violence Wednesday have
been either spotted or collected.
	   Abiola had been in prison since 1994, but many hoped he would
emerge from jail to fulfill his 1993 electoral mandate. He died
Tuesday after suddenly falling ill during a meeting with U.S.
diplomats. He was 60.
	   A potent symbol of reform for Nigeria's poor masses, Abiola was
enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, home of his Yoruba
ethnic group.
	   While Abiola reportedly had been seriously ill last year, his
death came as a surprise, just days after U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan announced that all Nigeria's political prisoners would
be freed, including Abiola.

	   In Seattle, Ken Griffey Jr. moved within one of Mark McGwire for
the major league home run lead with his 36th of the season for
Seattle.
	   Griffey's two-run homer off Pep Harris, a 442-foot (135-meter)
shot over the center-field fence, gave the Mariners an 8-1 lead in
the sixth inning.
	   Last-place Seattle beat AL West-leading Anaheim for the first
time in six games this season. The Angels' season-high sixth
straight loss cut their division lead to a half-game over Texas
	   Jeff Fassero (8-5) won his third straight start, allowing five
runs on seven hits, five walks and two wild pitches in 6 2-3
innings.
	   Mike Timlin pitched the ninth for his second save.
	   Omar Olivares (5-5) took the loss.

International observers complete first mission amid lull in combat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts to ADD details on U.S. diplomatic mission between
Serbs and Albanians.. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International officials were pushing
ahead Friday with efforts to calm the crisis in Serbia's separatist
Kosovo province following the successful completion of the first
diplomatic observation mission to flashpoints in the region.
	   The multinational missions are to identify regions that require
further observation and determine the needs for humanitarian
support and displaced persons, John Freely, head of the U.S. team,
told reporters Thursday. He said the mission traveled without
incident into regions previously sealed off to diplomats.
	   Clashes between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian
militants have grown increasingly violent since late February,
killing hundreds of people and forcing thousands of others to flee.
Serbia and Montenegro make up the Yugoslav federation.
	   In Vienna, Austria, the Organization of Security and Cooperation
in Europe said Yugoslavia agreed to let an OSCE delegation visit
the country, including Kosovo, for about 10 days as part of
international efforts to end the conflict.
	   Yugoslavia has refused to accept OSCE mediation until its
membership in the 54-member organization is restored. Although the
Yugoslav agreement falls short of accepting OSCE mediation, U.S.
and European officials called the invitation a step in the right
direction.
	   In a parallel effort, the United States was launching a
diplomatic shuttle between Serbs and ethnic Albanians to try to
work out an arrangement for restoring autonomy to Kosovo.
	   The shuttle by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was approved by
American, British, French, German, Italian and Russian officials at
a meeting Wednesday in Bonn, Germany.
	   Hill is not carrying a ``final plan'' to revive for the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo the limited self-rule canceled by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic in 1989, a senior U.S. official told
The Associated Press on Thursday.
	   ``On the contrary, they are principles to guide discussions,''
the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States and the Europeans are trying to prevent
Kosovo's fighting from spreading to other Balkan countries with
substantial Albanian communities.
	   Speaking in the Macedonian capital Skopje late Thursday, German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel urged the government to support
international officials' attempts to contain the crisis within
Kosovo's borders. Macedonia has its own sizable Albanian
population.
	   Montenegro's Commissioner for Refugees told the independent
Montena-fax news agency Thursday that a record number of refugees
had crossed the border Wednesday. An estimated 15,000 refugees,
mostly women and children, have fled Kosovo for shelter in
Montenegro since violence in May.

Cargo woes worsen; government is `gravely concerned'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The woes of Hong Kong's new air cargo
operations deepened Friday with an announcement the main handler
was slapping a temporary halt on nearly all shipments. Merchants
were suffering, and the government expressed deep concern.
	   Problems stemmed from the opening Monday of the territory's new
dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport, located on an outlying island
about 30 kilometers (22 miles) west of the city center.
	   While passenger services have improved slowly but steadily after
a rocky start, it has become increasingly clear that the cargo
terminal was not ready for the move from old, downtown Kai Tak
airport.
	   After shifting some operations back to Kai Tak and placing a
temporary embargo on some shipments, the main cargo handler, Hong
Kong Air Cargo Terminals, took more drastic action overnight.
	   The government said the handler had informed officials it was
halting nearly all cargo shipments through Hong Kong for nine days,
except for a few items including in-bound perishables, newspapers
and magazines, and lifesaving materials.
	   In one open market in the tourist and shopping district of
Tsimshatsui, only one of 12 seafood stalls was open Friday morning
_ and it was only selling local fish.
	   Other stalls were hosed clean, their walk-in refrigerators
locked, garbage removed, and lights switched off. Where some of
Hong Kong's top chefs and discriminating housewives shopped for
fresh Norwegian salmon, Japanese tuna, and Australian oysters, less
than a handful of buyers were choosing only among local fish.
	   Sandy Kwong, who sells U.S. cherries, New Zealand kiwis, and
Philippine mangoes at the same market, reported big losses due to
the disruption in cargo handling.
	   ``The system at the new airport is very disorganized,'' Kwong
said. ``If you want to order fresh artichokes now, you have to tell
me three days in advance.''
	   Hong Kong is one of the busiest air cargo centers in the world,
and the Tsimshatsui market one of the more impressive wholesalers
in the territory.
	   Although prices of imported fresh produce seem to be unaffected,
many flower vendors at the Tsimshatsui market were eager to sell
the few lilies and roses from Holland _ wilting in the heat and
brown at the edges _ that they had left.
	   ``We regret having to make this decision, but imposing such a
moratorium will assist the company in rectifying software and
mechanical problems,'' the air cargo firm's managing director,
Anthony Charter, said.
	   The Hong Kong Standard newspaper estimated the ban would cost
the territory at least 23 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 2.97
billion). It said Hong Kong businesses lost 3.3 billion Kong Kong
dollars (dlrs 426 million) because of the earlier measures the
shipper took.
	   The government said in a statement that it was ``gravely
concerned that such a moratorium has become necessary.''
	   ``This would clearly disrupt trade and impact adversely on our
economic performance in the short term,'' it said.
	   The government said it and the Airport Authority were
``providing every possible assistance'' to help resume normal cargo
operations as soon as possible.
	   On Thursday, legislators grilled airport officials and cargo
handlers about the failures of the new airport.
	   Charter acknowledged at the meeting that the company wasn't
ready to open on July 6, raising speculation that the government
had rushed the opening.
	   The contract stated the freight company's facility must be
operational by Aug. 18, although the company has the responsibility
to try its best to match the opening date, according to Airport
Authority officials.

Delifrance shop burns down after French soccer victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A French cafe in Singapore burned down minutes
after France triumphed in the World Cup soccer semifinals, and
owners fear the establishment could have been torched by an angry
fan.
	   At dawn Thursday, fire razed the Delifrance sidewalk cafe in
Singapore's central shopping district shortly after France defeated
Croatia to advance to the World Cup finals.
	   Police suspect ``fire by mischief,'' Delifrance, a French-style
cafe chain owned by Singapore's Sembawang corporation, said in a
statement Friday.
	   Police would only say an investigation was under way.
	   ``It's surprising that the fire happened right after the
match,'' Hugues Prince, Delifrance's managing director, told the
Business Times. ``It could be anybody, but we hope nobody links a
football game to a criminal act which is so unacceptable.''
	   Delifrance said it will rebuild the cafe.
	   ``Delifrance is a symbol of France, and like the winning French
soccer team, we will rise and fight to be the best,'' the company
said Friday in a statement.
	   Shares of Delifrance Asia on Friday plunged 20 percent on the
Stock Exchange of Singapore following news of the fire.
	   Though the cafe was insured and earnings should not be affected
by the fire, market observers said the incident threw the
seldom-traded stock into the limelight.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A sweltering summer day in Japan sent demand for
electric power skyrocketing to an all-time high as people turned to
air conditioners and electric fans for relief, a power industry
group said Friday.
	   As temperatures topped 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees
Fahrenheit) in Tokyo, power usage surged nationwide Thursday to a
record total of 3.9 billion kilowatt hours, Japan's Federation of
Electric Power Companies said.
	   The demand for power beat the previous one-day high of 3.7
billion kilowatt hours logged on August 25, 1995, said federation
spokeswoman Satoko Shiraishi.
	   In addition to high temperatures, Tokyo was beset Thursday by a
stagnant air pattern which trapped pollutants and created a thick
layer of smog. City authorities issued a hazard warning, but about
300 school children in central Tokyo alone were believed sickened
by the smog.
	   Friday brought cooler temperatures to the nation's capital as
early morning rain showers doused the city.

record total of 3.9 billion kilowatt hours, Japan's Federation of
Electric Power Companies said.
	   The demand for power beat the previous one-day high of 3.7
billion kilowatt hours logged on August 25, 1995, said federation
spokeswoman Satoko Shiraishi.
	   In addition to high temperatures, Tokyo was beset Thursday by a
stagnant air pattern which trapped pollutants and created a thick
layer of smog. City authorities issued a hazard warning, but about
300 school children in central Tokyo alone were believed sickened
by the smog.
	   Friday brought cooler temperatures to the nation's capital as
early morning rain showers doused the city.

Hundreds of Tokyo school kids fall ill from summer smog

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A stagnant air pattern, oppressive summer heat and
urban pollution formed a smog cocktail over greater Tokyo which is
suspected of sickening hundreds of school children, the Tokyo
government said Friday.
	   In the capital alone, 303 children complained of headaches, sore
throats and itchy eyes Thursday as the temperature soared above 35
degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), according to statistics
compiled by Tokyo metropolitan government health officials.
	   Dozens more fell ill in neighboring Chiba prefecture, or state,
Japanese newspapers said.
	   The sickness was reportedly caused by a thick layer of
photochemical smog which settled over the area and triggered a
hazard warning shortly after 11:00 a.m. (0200 GMT) Thursday.
	   At one elementary school in central Tokyo, dozens of students
were rushed by ambulance to a local hospital, the Yomiuri
newspaper, Japan's largest daily, reported.
	   The Asahi newspaper, another major daily, reported the last time
smog was believed to have caused more than 100 illnesses in Tokyo
was back in 1984.
	   Separately, Japan's Federation of Electric Power Companies said
Friday that demand for electric power swelled to a record high
Thursday of 3.9 billion kilowatt hours.
	   The surge came as people turned to air conditioners and electric
fans for relief from the humid heat.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A top Hong Kong soccer player was sentenced to
a year in jail Friday for conspiring to fix a World Cup qualifying
match last year, Hong Kong radio said.

Friday by Magistrate John Brennan.

from a bookmaker, Hong Kong radio reported that Chan kept 80,000
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 10,256) and gave the rest to his

Philippine journalist-diplomat Cruz dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former Filipino diplomat and
journalist Jose Victor ``JV'' Cruz has died following a bout with
cancer. He was 73.
	   Cruz, who wrote a column for the Philippine Daily Inquirer, died
Thursday in a hospital where he had been a patient since shortly
after his last birthday in May. His health had deteriorated after
his wife of 50 years, Lucy, died three years ago, the Inquirer
said.
	   At 28, Cruz was appointed press secretary by the late President
Ramon Magsaysay, becoming the youngest person to serve in that
post. After Magsaysay died in 1957, he returned to journalism.
	   Cruz also served as Philippine ambassador to Germany, Egypt, the
Netherlands, Iraq and Britain under the late strongman Ferdinand
Marcos.
	   He moved to London after Marcos was ousted in a ``people power''
revolt in 1986 and returned to Manila in 1989. He wrote columns for
the Malaya newspaper, the Manila Chronicle and the Inquirer.
	   ``Whether as press secretary, columnist, diplomat or plain bon
vivant, he was the envy of his friends, and he left a mark which
will take a very long time to erase,'' said Senator Francisco
Tatad, a former journalist and press secretary for Marcos.
	   Cruz is survived by seven children.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Leaders of Northern Ireland's
new Assembly hope meetings with community leaders Friday will help
end the continuing violence sparked when authorities banned a
Protestant march through a Catholic neighborhood.
	   The Assembly's leader, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble,
will join Seamus Mallon, the Catholic elected as deputy first
minister of the Assembly, in meeting with leaders of churches,
businesses, unions and community groups to promote compromise.
	   In a joint statement, they said an accommodation could be
reached if the two sides in the dispute showed ``vision, courage
and leadership.''
	   ``The body politic, the people on the ground, the whole system
in Northern Ireland cannot stand the strain that is being put on
it,'' Mallon said.
	   ``When you look at it ... in the most mercenary terms, 40
million pounds (dlrs 65 million) have been lost as a result of this
confrontation so far. Put that into perspective _ if people think
what 40 million is in terms schools, hospitals, care for the
elderly might do. And here we have it down the drain,'' Mallon
said.
	   On Thursday night, several police officers were hurt as
supporters of the thwarted marchers hurled ball bearings from
catapults and threw fireworks. Police fired plastic bullets at
demonstrators who breached security barriers blocking marchers from
going through the neighborhood.
	   Four police officers were recovering in hospital Friday morning
after undergoing surgery for injuries sustained when they were
caught in the blast of a nail bomb thrown over the security barrier
into police lines.
	   Tensions are expected, graf 7 pvs

Rumors aplenty, but few details in search for new coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Pick a rumor, any rumor. There are plenty
surrounding the Chicago Bulls these days.
	   Tim Floyd is going to be a Bulls assistant for a few years and
then get the top job. A broadcaster with no head coaching
experience is a candidate. Michael Jordan is going to be a
player-coach.
	   While some of the rumors have the ring of truth, many are simply
outlandish. But with the NBA lockout on and Jordan's future
possibly hanging in the balance, speculating on the new coach for
the six-time NBA champions is the latest rage.
	   ``Reading the sports pages makes me not want to read the rest of
the paper because at least 50 percent of what I read in the sports
pages is incorrect,'' Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said Thursday.
	   The Bulls have been mostly silent about their coaching search
since Phil Jackson roared off on his motorcycle almost three weeks
ago. What is known is they have a list of five candidates and are
almost done with interviews, according to a source close to the
selection process who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   In addition to Floyd, long considered the replacement-in-waiting
for Jackson, NBA assistants Paul Silas (Charlotte), Scott Skiles
(Phoenix), Rick Carlisle (Indiana) and Ron Rothstein (Cleveland)
are on the list.
	   Attempts to reach all of the candidates over the past several
days have been unsuccessful.
	   Jordan is still unsure whether he'll play next year or not, and
who the Bulls hire will likely play a role in his decision. But
while Reinsdorf said Jordan has been consulted about the search,
His Airness doesn't get veto power.
	   ``I said I was going to talk to Michael. Is that saying he has
veto power? Of course not,'' Reinsdorf said. ``Michael wouldn't
want that.''
	   Jordan has made no secret of his dislike for at least one of the
candidates: Floyd. Despite no NBA coaching experience, general
manager Jerry Krause seemed to be courting the young Iowa State
coach as a successor for Jackson _ while Jackson was still coach.
That irked Jordan, Jackson's biggest supporter, and he took to
calling Floyd ``Pink,'' as in the rock group Pink Floyd.
	   Floyd does have several things working in his favor. He's a
friend of Krause, an all-important factor after the GM's rocky
relationship with Jackson. He's a defensive specialist, also a
priority for a Chicago coach.
	   And he's young. The Bulls know the Jordan Era can't last
forever, and they'd like the next coach to see them through the
transition.
	   ``He's a very fine coach; we think he has done a terrific job,''
Iowa State president Martin Jischke said last week.
	   ``I know there have been discussions between the management of
the Bulls and coach Floyd,'' Jischke added. ``Tim has kept us
apprised of those discussions. I don't think those discussions have
come to a formal offer.''
	   While their names may not be as well-known in Chicago as
Floyd's, the other candidates are no strangers to the NBA. All are
longtime assistants, and Silas and Rothstein have head coaching
experience. All but Rothstein had solid NBA careers as players.
	   Carlisle, 37, played with Larry Bird on the Boston Celtics' 1986
championship team and began his coaching career three years later.
He started as an assistant with the New Jersey Nets, moving to
Portland five years later. He stayed there until Bird asked him to
join his Indiana Pacers staff last year.
	   Rothstein, a Cleveland assistant since 1993, was the Miami
Heat's first coach and held that job for three seasons. He also
coached the Detroit Pistons in 1992 and 1993.
	   Silas, also a candidate for the Seattle job after George Karl
was fired, just finished his first year as an assistant for the
Charlotte Hornets. Before that, he was an assistant in Phoenix, New
Jersey and New York Knicks, and he coached the then-San Diego
Clippers from 1980-83.
	   He played 16 seasons in the NBA, and was a member of the Seattle
SuperSonics' 1979 championship team.
	   Skiles has been an assistant for just one year, spending last
season as Danny Ainge's top assistant. But prior to that, he
revived a struggling Greek professional team. He also spent 10
years in the NBA, setting the record for most assists in a game
(30).

Civil suit filed against NBA player Anthony Mason
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; MARIA F. DURAND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two teenage girls, who say Charlotte Hornets
star Anthony Mason and his cousin raped them in a home during the
NBA's All-Star Game weekend, have filed civil charges against the
men.
	   Mason, 31, and a friend, Will Duggins, 24, pleaded guilty June
25 to endangering the two girls, ages 14 and 15, after prosecutors
dropped sex abuse and statutory rape charges.
	   The civil suit, filed Thursday in State Supreme Court in New
York City's borough of Queens, seeks about dlrs 20 million in
compensatory and punitive damages.
	   ``This lawsuit seeks redress in civil courts,'' said the
victims' lawyer Barry Washor. ``I know we have a strong case. There
is a lot of forensic evidence. The girls passed a polygraph test
that fully corroborates their story.''
	   But Mason's agent, Don Cronson, said the charges had no merit.
	   ``The charge they pleaded to was a greatly reduced misdemeanor
charge,'' Cronson said. ``They basically pleaded guilty to bad
judgment.''
	   The more serious charges were dropped because DNA tests failed
to link the Mason to the girls, prosecutor Kenneth Appelbaum said.
Mason could have received eight years in prison on those charges.
He was ordered to serve 200 hours of community service with the
homeless at the Progressive Baptist Church in Charlotte, North
Carolina.
	   ``It's another attempt to squeeze money out of my client,''
Cronson said. ``It's baseless, and it will be shown so as the suit
moves along.''
	   Prosecutors and detectives said Mason and Duggins, an unemployed
construction worker, met the girls during a benefit basketball game
at York College on Feb. 6. Mason was not elected to appear in the
All Star game that was being played in New York that weekend.
	   Mason, a former New York Knicks star who was born in Queens, was
traded to Charlotte in 1996. He pleaded guilty in November 1997 to
disorderly conduct after scuffling with a police officer in Times
Square in July 1996. He paid a dlrs 250 fine and apologized to
police.
	   Washor said he also sent a letter to the NBA last month, asking
that the league launch an inquiry on whether Mason has breached
morality clauses in his NBA contract.

Bradman breaks silence for happy birthday wish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Reclusive Australian cricket hero Sir
Donald Bradman made a rare media appearance this week to wish
former English rival Sir Alec Bedser a happy birthday.
	   Bedser and his twin brother Eric turned 80 on Monday and Sir
Alec was reunited with Bradman courtesy of a call, which was
broadcast on Sydney radio Friday.
	   Bradman is acknowledged as the best batsman to have played the
game, finishing his career with a peerless average of 99.94.
	   Sir Alec Bedser claimed 236 wickets at an average of 24.89 in 51
tests and, like most, put Bradman ahead of the rest.
	   ``He was far ahead of anyone else,'' Bedser said.
	   Bradman, who lives a quiet life in Adelaide and granted his
previous interview more than two years ago, reminisced about the
time Bedser dismissed him for nought in the 1946-47 Ashes series.
	   ``Alec, he was a wonderful bowler. He was the best medium pacer
I've ever faced in my life,'' Bradman said. ``He came to Australia
in the 1946 England tour and I went out to the middle and he bowled
one that pitched on the leg stump and hit the off bail.
	   ``You weren't supposed to do that _ (it was the) best ball ever
bowled to me in my life.''
	   After wishing Bedser a happy birthday, Bradman asked him how he
was faring in golf.
	   Bedser replied that it was not bad some days, but not very good
on others.
	   ``Alec's turned out to be the best friend I have in England,''
Bradman said. ``He's a wonderful pal, I'm very fond of him.''
	   That Bradman ventured out of his cocoon to involve himself
publicly with Bedser's birthday is a strong sign of fondness for
his old foe.

Government announces big-spending programs for rural residents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ In the latest apparent campaign
sweeteners in an as yet undeclared election, the Australian
government Friday promised a big spending boost for ailing
manufacturing industries and cheaper telephone charges for people
in rural areas.
	   The government Friday announced it would spend U.S. dlrs 430
million (Australian dollars 700 million) over five years on a
program aimed at encouraging additional investment in the textile,
clothing and footwear industries, which are struggling against
lower-cost Asian manufacturers.
	   The program, which offers cash incentives for some companies, is
the second part of a government plan for these industries,
complementing a five-year tariff freeze on imports of textiles,
clothing and footwear from mid-2000.
	   The plan is targeted to help rural communities, where most of
the manufacturing industries are based.
	   The government also announced that it will spend up to U.S. dlrs
91.5 million (Australian dollars 150 million) to ensure people in
remote areas of the nation have access to untimed, or flat-fee,
local telephone calls.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said the new spending depends
on full privatization of national telecommunications carrier
Telstra Corp..
	   Prime Minister John Howard's conservative government is in
trouble with outback voters, who have been defecting in huge
numbers to the new right-wing populist One Nation party formed by
Pauline Hanson.
	   General elections aren't due until March, but there is growing
speculation that the government will call snap polls this month
before Asia's economic crisis takes a heavier toll on the
Australian economy.
	   Howard's government intends to sell the remaining two-thirds of
Telstra to private investors and use the proceeds to reduce the
national debt and fund government programs.
	   But many rural people and their representatives in Parliament
fear a privatized Telstra will mean they will spend more for
service and repairs, or that the some services won't be available
except at prohibitive cost.
	   Parliament's upper house, the Senate, is debating the planned
sale of Telstra, but the enabling bill faces defeat if rural
conservative National Party senators defect from the government
coalition and vote against it.

World Bank approves Thai loans, plans more
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The World Bank has approved dlrs 700
million in loans to Thailand _ nearly half of it for easing the
effects of the country's economic crisis on the poor _ and plans to
increase its lending to help the country cope with a credit crunch
and deepening recession.
	   The newly-approved loans, announced here Friday after being
approved at the bank's headquarters in Washington late Thursday,
are part of the contribution the bank pledged towards a dlrs 17.2
billion bailout fund organized by the International Monetary Fund.
	   In Washington, a bank official said the international lending
organization intends to boost its aid to Thailand to dlrs 2.1
billion from the originally planned dlrs 1.5 billion.
	   Thailand's once-booming economy ground to a halt last year when
the financial sector faced liquidity problems that exposed massive
debts. Further economic turmoil resulted after the central bank
devalued the national currency, the baht.
	   Unemployment is rising, with more than 2 million expected to be
jobless in 1998, an increase of more than 60 percent from a year
earlier.
	   At the same time, ailing financial institutions have generally
failed to attract new capital needed to overcome the shortage of
operating funds caused by large holdings of bad debt. Under such
circumstances, they are reluctant to roll over debt or make new
loans, hindering the chances of a economic recovery.
	   The World Bank said dlrs 400 million of the loans approved
Thursday will be used to restructure Thailand's debt-ridden
financial and corporate sector and to encourage privatization of
government enterprises.
	   Private-sector debt in Thailand totals about dlrs 67 billion,
and some of the country's biggest corporations have begun to
suspend debt repayment.
	   The World Bank also approved a dlrs 300 million loan for a
Social Investment Program. The program will focus on creating jobs
and improving health services. It will also finance social-service
projects run by community groups.
	   J. Shivakumar, the World Bank's country director for Thailand,
said the loans reflect a ``multi-pronged'' strategy by the bank.
	   ``We are addressing not only the causes of the crisis _
structural weaknesses in the financial and corporate sectors _ but
also the effects of the crisis - rising unemployment, loss in
income, and increased poverty,'' he said.
	   In the year since it triggered the Asian economic crisis by
devaluing its currency, Thailand has been a ``model'' of reform, he
said, but remains ``extremely vulnerable'' to economic turmoil from
elsewhere in Asia, and could sink deeper into recession.
	   ``Domestically it's not certain when the bottom of the recession
will be reached,'' Shivakumar said.
	   The Thai government expects the economy to shrink 5.5 percent in
1998.
	   Shivakumar said the World Bank, which quarreled with the IMF
over its initial insistence on strict austerity programs in Asia,
decided to boost its assistance to Thailand ``unilaterally'' to
help the country ease its credit crunch.
	   ``It's a reflection of our confidence in the Thai government,''
he said, cautioning that ``this extra amount is contingent on the
government continuing to perform.'

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Department of Labor assumed
jurisdiction Friday over a dispute involving ground personnel at
troubled Philippine Airlines, effectively blocking their option to
strike next Monday.
	   ``We are being forced to negotiate with management with our
hands tied behind our back,'' said Alex Barrientos, president of
the ground personnel union. ``We are grudgingly accepting the order
but we have other legal options to air our protests.''
	   Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said the labor department
assumed jurisdiction of the dispute because a strike could damage
the country and its economy.
	   The airlines' 625 pilots went on strike for 22 days last month,
aggravating financial losses caused by Asia's currency storm and
scuttling an ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program. PAL
fired all the striking pilots after they ignored a government
return-to-work order.
	   At the height of the pilots' walkout, the airline laid off 5,000
of its more than 13,000 workers to scale down its operations and
stave off more losses, causing the ground personnel to file a
strike notice as well.
	   A mandatory 15-day ``cooling off'' period following the notice
ends Monday, after which the union would have been able to strike.
	   Laguesma said his order stops the ground personnel from
proceeding with a strike and also prevents management from
dismissing more employees.
	   Under a rehabilitation plan, PAL is slashing its work force,
disposing of 40 of its 54 planes, suspending more than two-thirds
of its routes and selling some subsidiaries.
	   Barrientos declined to say what the union's options now are.
``Just watch out for further developments. It will just happen,''
he said.
	   PAL officials say the company lost more than 2 billion pesos
(dlrs 50 million) in revenue because of the pilots' strike.

Russia launches satellites for Israel, other nations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After several postponements, a Russian booster
rocket blasted off Friday carrying one Russian and five foreign
satellites, including an Israeli one.
	   The Zenith-2 booster rocket lifted off from the Baikonur
cosmodrome that Russia leases from the former Soviet republic of
Kazakstan. Most of the satellites are intended for studies of the
Earth's surface and atmosphere.
	   The rocket carried a Russian Resurs-O satellite weighing about 2
tons along with Israel's Gurwin II, Germany's Saafir-2, Chile's
FASat-Bravo, Thailand's MYSat and an Australian research satellite.
	   It was the first time that Australia and Thailand had used a
Russian booster to launch their satellites.
	   In 1995, Israel tried to put its Gurwin I satellite into orbit
using a Russian booster converted from a military ballistic
missile, but it was lost due to the failure in rocket's control
system. A separate 1995 launch of the first Chilean satellite atop
a Russian rocket also was a failure.
	   The Israel's cube-shaped Gurwin II will help measure the ozone
level in atmosphere and carry out laser tests.
	   Russian space officials have not said how much they charged for
their launching services.
	   The launch had been postponed three times since the end of June
due to technical problems.

Thailand urges India, Pakistan to hold talks to ease tension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ India and Pakistan should open talks to
ease the tension their nuclear tests have created in South Asia, a
Thai government minister said Friday during a visit to Bangladesh.
	   ``Until India and Pakistan conducted the tests, we were
complacent about nuclear danger. But no more,'' Thai Deputy Foreign
Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra told reporters at the end of his
three-day visit.
	   ``India and Pakistan must now pursue building confidence between
them,'' he said.
	   He also urged both nations to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   India has refused to sign the CTBT, saying it allows nations
with sophisticated nuclear arsenals to hold on to the advantage
gained through years of testing. Pakistan says it will sign the
accord only if India does.
	   India set off a series of underground nuclear tests in May,
saying it needed a deterrent because of the nuclear threat posed by
neighbors China and Pakistan. Pakistan responded with its own round
of tests, prompting fears the rivalry that has erupted into war
three times in the last five decades could escalate to nuclear war.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif will meet for the first time since the
tests later this month at a regional summit in Sri Lanka.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In an unusual display of solidarity,
South Korea's two leading labor groups said Friday they would
jointly stage a nationwide strike next week to protest spreading
layoffs.
	   The two rival groups also said they will boycott talks with
government and management officials until they get firm guarantees
of job security for workers at banks and state-owned firms to be
merged or closed.
	   ``The government-sponsored labor talks have become
meaningless,'' the mainstream Federation of Korean Trade Unions and
the maverick Korean Confederation of Trade Unions said in a joint
statement.
	   The two groups were forced to join hands after their key unions
in the car and banking industries faced mass layoffs under the
government's ongoing plans to restructure its battered economy.
	   The groups plan to launch a strike beginning Tuesday at auto
plants, 37 banks and 11 state-run companies. The state-owned firms
are being put up for sale under the government's privatization
program.
	   The 26,000-member Hyundai Motor Co. union said it will take part
in the strike. The nation's leading auto firm already has been hit
hard by intermittent walkouts in the recent past.
	   Hyundai shed about 5,000 surplus workers in June. It is pushing
to lay off 4,380 more this month.
	   The labor groups withdrew from talks aimed at finding a
compromise between big businesses and militant unions on how to
speed up a restructuring of South Korea's inefficient industries.
	   Experts warn that recurring labor unrest could keep potential
foreign investors out of the South Korean market. A mass exodus of
foreign investors fueled a foreign currency crisis in South Korea
late last year.
	   Last week, the government ordered the closure of five
financially shaky banks. It also said it would privatize 11
state-owned corporations to make them leaner and encourage sorely
needed foreign investment.
	   Labor unions reacted angrily, vowing to fight against the
planned restructuring which they fear will lead to mass layoffs.
	   The two labor groups planned a rally of 200,000 workers in Seoul
Sunday in a joint show of force.
	   Restructuring South Korea's inefficient industries is a key
condition set by the International Monetary Fund, which bailed out
the country's economy late last year.
	   Unemployment is rising rapidly in South Korea. Government
figures show that the number of jobless people has doubled to
nearly 1.5 million and will likely top 2 million by the end of the
year.

Forest fires burn in Russia's Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Forest fires burning in Russia's Far East have
engulfed 35,000 hectares (84,000 acres) and are still raging, a
news agency reported Friday.
	   The Kamchatka peninsula has been hardest hit, with one huge fire
responsible for about one-third damage in the region, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported, citing local Emergency Situations Ministry
officials.
	   Forest fires have also been spotted in several other regions
which have had less than normal rainfall this summer.
	   An army of 570 firefighters, with five helicopters and a plane,
continued to fight the fires, ITAR-Tass said.

Expelled Russian diplomat leaves Seoul
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATEs with diplomat's comments, grafs 5-7

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Russian diplomat, expelled by South
Korea on spy charges, left for home Friday amid indications that
Moscow might escalate the diplomatic spat.
	   Oleg N. Abramkin, one of six councilors at the Russian Embassy
in Seoul, was declared persona non grata Wednesday and given three
days to leave the country.
	   Abramkin's expulsion was Seoul's tit-for-tat response to
Moscow's expulsion of a South Korean diplomat a week ago. Russia
said Thursday it was considering further retaliatory action.
	   South Korea's Foreign Ministry said Abramkin had engaged in
``activities that go against his status as a diplomat,'' a common
diplomatic euphemism for spying.
	   ``No. No. No. I was just doing my diplomatic obligations,''
Abramkin told journalists at Seoul's Kimpo airport, shaking his
head when asked whether he engaged in spying activity.
	   He refused to comment on the nature of his job at the Russian
Embassy in Seoul, but hoped that ``this incident is not going to
aggravate the relations between the two countries.''
	   In Moscow, the Russian Foreign Ministry strongly indicated that
it would take further retaliatory action.
	   ``The Korean side has chosen to further exacerbate the
situation, and now it's our turn to make a move,'' said Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin. He called Abramkin's
expulsion ``unwarranted.''
	   He added that Moscow was considering whether to accept South
Korea's proposal to hold a meeting between both nations' foreign
ministers to discuss the matter.
	   The dispute started last Friday, when Russia's Federal Security
Service detained Cho Sung-woo, a political officer at South Korea's
embassy, after he allegedly received classified data from a Russian
contact.
	   The Federal Security Service, a successor of the Soviet-era KGB,
identified Cho's Russian contact as Valentin Moiseyev, a deputy
chief of the Foreign Ministry's First Asian Department, which deals
with both North and South Korea as well as China and Mongolia.
	   South Korean media, reporting from Moscow, said Moiseyev, who
once worked as a newspaper reporter and then later a trade official
in North Korea, is expected to be charged with high treason.
	   The old Soviet Union, a longtime ally of communist North Korea,
opened formal diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1990.
	   Trade and other relations between Russia and South Korea have
since developed significantly, while Moscow's relations with North
Korea have cooled considerably.

Larkham, pack, keys to Australian chances
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's chances of a lively
start to the tri-nations series against the world's best rugby team
rest squarely with a man who gets his nickname from a corpse.
	   Wallaby fly-half Stephen Larkham is known to his teammates as
Bernie, as in the deceased party host in the Hollywood comedy
``Weekend At Bernie's.''
	   Fortunately for the Wallabies, looking to beat New Zealand for
the first time in four years and eight matches Saturday, Larkham's
nickname refers more to his demeanor off the field than his ability
on it.
	   The All Blacks, talking up their vulnerability like never
before, believe cutting off Larkham's supply to Australia's
impressive backline could determine the result in the opening match
of a series which also includes South Africa.
	   ``That doesn't worry me,'' Larkham said. ``If they get me they
get me, but I know I can take the hits.''
	   New All Blacks captain Taine Randell and his fellow loose
forwards Josh Kronfeld and Michael Jones will leave Larkham with a
true indication of his worth at fly-half following his easy runs
against England and Scotland.
	   Jones, one of the best all-time flankers who will be lining up
for his 53rd test, played down the Larkham hunt.
	   He described Larkham as ``gifted,'' adding ``We're very mindful
of that but we're not targeting any one player in particular.''
	   Larkham played fullback throughout last season but took over as
fly-half this year as coach Rod Macqueen sought stability in the
position ahead of next year's World Cup.
	   Wallaby scrum half George Gregan has forged an encouraging
combination with his ACT Brumbies teammate.
	   ``He's an amazing player. He's been thrown into a position where
he's basically running the show in the backline,'' Gregan said.
``He's still got a few games to go to feel that confidence, but
he's doing a really good job and he'll show his wares against New
Zealand.''
	   For New Zealand teams, winning tests usually starts with
dominating in the scrum rather than chasing the opposition.
	   The All Blacks tight five has been widely criticized for an
insipid display in the 40-10 second test win over England a
fortnight ago. The hard men of the world's best rugby team have
been galvanized by complaints that they were too soft.
	   ``The scrums are going to be very important,'' said Macqueen.
``That's where it all starts and finishes _ if we're going
backwards in the scrum all day, we're obviously going to find it
difficult to win.''
	   The coach expressed his respect for the All Black pack which he
said remained the team's greatest strength despite the critics.
	   New Zealand's forwards traditionally set up the platform for
some devastating finishers, players such as winger Jeff Wilson and
brilliant young fullback Christian Cullen, who has 23 tries in 24
tests.
	   And add to those Joeli Vidiri, a Fijian-born giant who takes
over from axed Jonah Lomu on the wing.
	   Viridi, too, has a nickname, but unlike Larkham his perfectly
describes his on-field ability.
	   ``We've nicknamed him Vindaloo because he's very hot,'' said
Lomu. ``I hope he has a great game.''

Indonesia grapples with pace and scope of political reform

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At a recent hearing in Parliament, a
ruling party legislator paused while grilling a panel of cigarette
producers about their business practices.
	   ``We wouldn't have done this before,'' he said in a wry
reference to the days of former President Suharto, when few
challenged the typically shady style of closing deals.
	   The lawmakers lining the benches laughed with gusto, embracing
their new role as agents of reform. Entrusted with rooting out
corruption, many in their ranks knew only too well what to look
for: They had been padding their own income for years through perks
and a cushy web of contacts.
	   Politically fettered for decades, enthusiasm for a democratic
overhaul now abounds in Indonesia, pushed along by protests, riots
and economic collapse that helped dislodge the authoritarian
Suharto in May.
	   President B.J. Habibie has gone a long way in his push for
reform, freeing many political prisoners, allowing trade unions and
political parties to form and encouraging press freedom.
	   But doubts are rife that players in the old, discredited
political system, who still run the government, have the will to
change. After all, a full housecleaning might leave them jobless _
like Indonesia's tens of millions of poor victims of a virtually
paralyzed economy.
	   That's the dilemma facing the ruling Golkar party, which opened
a special congress Thursday in a hurried attempt to recast its role
after decades as a loyal tool of Suharto. It robotically pushed
through his ceremonial reelection to seven, five-year terms.
	   ``It's not a shame to acknowledge the weaknesses and mistakes of
the past. In the era of reform, we have to improve,'' party
chairman Harmoko told hundreds of delegates at a five-star hotel.
	   However, internal jousting for control of the party is evident,
with some Golkar leaders considered Suharto loyalists apparently
resisting efforts to strip them of their privileges.
	   ``If a new group comes to power, it will give no chance to the
Suharto cronies,'' said Eki Syachrudin, a Golkar legislator.
	   Critics question whether an expected reshuffle of the party
leadership is enough in a nation where Golkar's political machinery
remains largely intact at the village level.
	   ``The reform movement has turned into merely replacing the
actors, but it is based on the same scenario,'' said Hendrajit, a
researcher at the Institute for Strategic Studies of Indonesia, a
private think tank.
	   Habibie, himself a Suharto protege, already has sacked 41
members of a special 1,000-member assembly that elects the
president, all people seen as loyal to the former president.
However, three Suharto children remain delegates.
	   The armed forces, once the pillar of Suharto's authority, also
have been accused of dithering on the question of accountability.
Military chief Gen. Wiranto acknowledged that members of the
security forces may have kidnapped dissidents earlier this year,
but he has yet to produce any suspects.
	   Activists are also worried that a parliamentary bill that would
regulate public protests is a throwback to the Suharto era, when
rallies were often banned or broken up.
	   The military retains its powerful role in politics, and
legislators have suggested reducing its number of appointed seats
in the 500-seat parliament by one-third to 50. For political
activists, it's a step in the right direction but hardly
democratic.
	   Emil Salim, an economist and government critic, envisages months
of haggling over electoral laws between opposition figures and
government lawyers. He proposes laws that limit campaign donations
and require political parties to have at least 500,000 members to
register.
	   ``Now we go down to substance,'' Salim said in an interview at
his ornately decorated home. ``It's not these romantic
demonstrations anymore. It's much more difficult.''
	   However, observers fear that if the economy slides further into
ruin, social unrest may sideline political reform. In May, as many
as 1,200 people died in riots over price increases in Jakarta.
	   ``If unemployment increases and people are thinking about the
price of food, then their attention is on the short term,'' Salim
said. ``It's how to fill my stomach today, and not political reform
in the next three months or so.''

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Leaders of Northern Ireland's
new Assembly hope meetings with community leaders Friday will help
end the continuing violence sparked when authorities banned a
Protestant march through a Catholic neighborhood.
	   The Assembly's leader, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble,
will join Seamus Mallon, the Catholic elected as deputy first
minister of the Assembly, in meeting with leaders of churches,
businesses, unions and community groups to promote compromise.
	   In a joint statement, they said an accommodation could be
reached if the two sides in the dispute showed ``vision, courage
and leadership.''
	   ``The body politic, the people on the ground, the whole system
in Northern Ireland cannot stand the strain that is being put on
it,'' Mallon said.
	   ``When you look at it ... in the most mercenary terms, 40
million pounds (dlrs 65 million) have been lost as a result of this
confrontation so far. Put that into perspective _ if people think
what 40 million is in terms schools, hospitals, care for the
elderly might do. And here we have it down the drain,'' Mallon
said.
	   Four police officers were hospitalized Friday morning after
surgery for injuries from bomb shrapnel and a fifth was admitted
after being hit by ball bearings fired by the crowd.
	   Police fired plastic bullets at demonstrators who breached
security barriers, and arrested nine people.
	   Army bomb experts defused a device containing petrol and black
powder at a house in Armagh City, in what police said was a
sectarian attack. Several Catholic-owned businesses were damaged in
Kilkeel, including a pub which was set afire after a Protestant mob
set up barriers in the town center, police said.

Canada hopes for quick release of nuns kidnapped in Rwanda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ A Canadian diplomat said Friday he was
hoping for a quick release of a Canadian and two Rwandan Roman
Catholic nuns abducted by Hutu rebels, apparently to care for their
wounded.
	   The nuns were abducted Tuesday after the rebels robbed a bank
and a health center at Bungwe, 60 kilometers (35 miles), north of
Kigali, where the nuns often worked with the patients.
	   ``It's a very delicate situation,'' said David Foxall, the
Canadian chief of mission. ``We're in contact with the authorities.
We hope they (the nuns) will be released soon.''
	   One local official was killed and medicines and money were
stolen in the attack, officials and residents said.
	   The residents said the attackers escaped pursuing government
soldiers and managed to disappear into heavily forested neighboring
Ruhengeri Prefecture where they are believe to have bases.
	   In a similar incident in March, the rebels held two Spanish nuns
captive for six days to help care for their wounded. They were
released unharmed.
	   Foxall said the family of the Canadian nun, who is from Quebec,
had requested that her name be withheld until her release.
	   No contact with the rebels has been established, Foxall said.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen involved in
the 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and
politically moderate Hutus.
	   Additional thousands have died in rebel attacks since the return
in November 1996 of more than 1 million Hutu refugees from exile,
where they fled in fear of reprisals for the massacres.
	   Tutsi-led rebels overthrew the Hutu extremist government in July
1994 and stopped the killing.
	   Since then, rebel attacks have spread from the northwest, a
traditional Hutu stronghold, to central and western Rwanda.

Estrada government will not settle for less than 75 percent of
</HEADLINE>
Marcos Swiss deposits
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The government of President Joseph
Estrada will not settle the numerous criminal and civil suits
against the family of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos for less
than 75 percent of his dlrs 540 million Swiss bank deposits, a
senior official said Friday.
	   Presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the Marcos
family has expressed privately that ``they are amicable to a
settlement.''
	   On Thursday, Zamora indicated that the Estrada administration
was more inclined to favor an out-of-court settlement with the
Marcoses and their associates because years of legal battles to
recover their alleged ill-gotten wealth have yielded little.
	   The Marcos Swiss accounts have been transferred to a Philippine
bank. The money is to be released to the Philippine government if
it wins a conviction against Marcos' widow, Imelda.
	   Aside from winning in litigation, the government can acquire the
funds through an out-of-court settlement with the Marcos family.
	   In an interview by radio station DZBB, Zamora said the previous
administrations of former President Corazon Aquino and Estrada's
predecessor, Fidel Ramos, had entered into at least two compromise
agreements, but both had been aborted.
	   The latest, a secret agreement uncovered in 1993, called for a
75-25 sharing of the Marcos Swiss accounts in favor of the
government.
	   ``If there will be (a settlement), well, I am already laying the
basis _ it will not be less than the 75-25,'' Zamora said. ``That
will be the starting point of any discussion.''
	   It was the first time that a senior official of the week-old
Estrada administration has set a condition for a compromise with
the Marcos family.
	   Zamora said he believes the Marcoses would accept a settlement.
	   ``I think they realize that it does not do anybody any good if
it is delayed like this,'' he said.
	   The 1993 agreement could not be implemented because the Marcoses
have refused to disclose all their assets.
	   There was a public outcry when it was revealed that the
agreement would have led to the dismissal of all charges against
the Marcoses and immunity from future suits.
	   The Swiss accounts are part of the billions of the dollars the
government claims Marcos embezzled during his 20-year rule.
	   Marcos was toppled in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986 and fled
into exile in Hawaii where he died three years later.
	   He never admitted any wrongdoing.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Its economy slowing, Vietnam is making a
push to join the World Trade Organization with promises to speed up
reform, cut red tape and write clear rules.
	   After hearing similar vows many times before, investors and
diplomats are waiting to see if the government will back talk with
action this time.
	   Vietnam was not hit initially as hard as many of its neighbors
by the Asian financial crisis. But the fallout is slowly battering
the country and exposing its weaknesses, forcing top officials to
be more pragmatic.
	   Exports are shrinking, foreign investors are committing less
money than last year and unemployment is rising, along with
pressure to devalue the dong.
	   On Thursday, Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating of
Vietnam's debt, saying efforts to reform the economy have stalled,
threatening the nation's balance of payments and the banking
sector.
	   The agency also said Vietnam is particularly vulnerable to
Asia's ongoing financial crisis, although so far, foreign exchange
controls have kept the economy from going into a tailspin.
	   While a Vietnam State Bank official said Friday that the ratings
``may not be accurate,'' he admitted they probably will hurt the
reputation of the country's bonds and notes in the international
market.
	   Foreign investors long have complained about Vietnam's
bureaucracy. Still, many have tried to wade through the tangle to
take advantage of cheap labor costs and gain entry into a market of
76 million people.
	   Devaluations of other currencies in the region have taken away
much of that competitive edge, however, leaving Vietnam to fight
for a shrinking pool of foreign investment capital.
	   That has forced officials to scramble to reassure investors and
banking officials that it is serious about speeding up the
decade-old Doi Moi reform process.
	   Government-sponsored conferences in the last week have discussed
the need to making sweeping reforms in the debt-riddled banking
system, heard complaints from oil and gas investors, and sought
support from WTO members for its admission.
	   A news conference on plans to make Vietnam more
investor-friendly included promises to open up more sectors of the
economy and fire officials who create red tape, along with pleas
for reporters to convey Vietnam's efforts to the world.
	   Joining the WTO would help, but the country will have to address
a long list of concerns about its trade and legal systems at the
first working session on its application in Geneva later this
month.
	   Admission now does not seem likely. The WTO frowns on trade
barriers, and Vietnam is under internal pressure from its own
businessmen to protect them for a while from competition. A new
copyright agreement with the United States has yet to be tested.
	   Vietnam still does not have a trade agreement with the United
States, which Washington has touted as a good step toward WTO
membership because of the changes that would be needed for such a
pact.
	   But a Trade Ministry official said Friday that a U.S. deal isn't
a prerequisite for WTO membership.
	   ``Our relationship with the U.S. is a bilateral one, and with
the WTO is a multilateral relationship,'' the official said. ``They
are two different processes.''

Roche: Half yearly sales boosted by strong pharmaceutical division
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Pharmaceutical giant Roche said
Friday its first-half 1998 group sales rose to 13.16 billion Swiss
francs (dlrs 8.54 billion), up 41 percent from 9.30 billion Swiss
francs (dlrs 6.04 billion) in the same period of the previous year.
	   Sales in the pharmaceutical division - by far Roche's largest -
rose 21 percent in Swiss francs to 7.23 billion Swiss francs (dlrs
4.6 billion). Profit figures for the period were unavailable.
	   In March this year, Roche completed a deal to acquire
Bermuda-based Corange. Roche said the acquisition of Corange, the
parent of diagnostics company Boehringer Mannheim and orthopedics
unit DePuy Inc., might reduce profits per share for 1998.
	   But Roche nevertheless said it expected to increase its market
share in the current year and to achieve a good result.
	   ``Our pharmaceutical division performed strongly, with its
growth rate clearly exceeding overall market growth, even if
Boehringer Mannheim sales are not considered,'' Roche said in its
press release.
	   Roche says plans to market its anti-obesity drug Xenical in the
European Union, which are subject to EU regulatory approval, are on
schedule. ``The approval process (for Xenical) in Europe is
proceeding as planned, so that we expect its market introduction by
the end of the year,'' Roche said.
	   Roche added it hoped to fulfill the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's conditions for Xenical's approval by the first
quarter of 1999.
	   Finally, Roche said the integration of Boehringer Mannheim is
proceeding well and according to plan.
	   Roche will present its first-half 1998 earnings report in the
middle of August, the company announced.

Tribal leaders appeal to India to restore peace in northeast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUAHATI, India (AP) _ Naga tribal leaders in India's troubled
northeastern corner said Friday that two of the region's separatist
groups were now ready to give up fighting.
	   M. Vero, president of the Naga Hoho, an umbrella group for
tribal leaders, said Hoho envoys met recently with members of the
Naga National Council and the National Socialist Council of
Nagaland.
	   ``We believe they will give up arms if a cease-fire is extended
and army operations withdrawn immediately,'' Vero said.
	   He called on the Indian government, which has opened peace talks
with an NSCN faction, to extend a cease-fire to the NNC and the
main NSCN and hold talks with them as well.
	   The separatist movement began after India gained independence
from Britain in 1947, when Naga chieftains claimed they were forced
to join India. The situation in the state is exacerbated by
fighting among different rebel groups.
	   The Naga Hoho has refused to take a formal position on
independence, instead calling on the government and militants to
resolve the dispute peacefully.

EU considering visa restrictions on Belarus officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union is considering
imposing visa restrictions to limit the movement of senior
Belarusian officials, EU officials said Friday.
	   EU foreign ministers are expected to approve the restrictions
when they meet Monday in Brussels.
	   The proposed restrictions are in retaliation for orders from the
Belarusian government that several nations vacate ambassadors'
residences in a diplomatic compound in Minsk, the capital of
Belarus.
	   The EU move would likely prevent Belarusian ambassadors from
moving from country to country within the 15-nation EU and restrict
visits from other high-ranking government officials.
	   Belarus says it needs to repair the plumbing and sewage system
in the diplomatic compound. The ambassadors say Belarus has no
right to force them out.
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, Japan, Bulgaria and Poland have all Minsk in
protest.
	   Last September, the EU halted most of its aid projects for
Belarus and froze preparations for a trade and cooperation
agreement in protest at the authoritarian rule of President
Alexander Lukashenko.

Reform support grows in Indonesia's ruling party ahead of vote for
</HEADLINE>
leader
 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Support for democratic change
intensified within the ranks of Indonesia's biggest political
organization Friday when a growing number of its officials said
they would back an ally of reformist President B.J. Habibie as new
party chief.
	   A three-day special congress of the Golkar party, once the tool
of autocratic ex-President Suharto, is scheduled to end Saturday
when 27 officials from each of Indonesia's provinces vote for a new
party chairman.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted 11 representatives as
saying they would back Akbar Tanjung, who is state secretary in
Habibie's Cabinet and his choice for the party job.
	   Eight other representatives announced they would support Akbar's
rival Edy Sudradjat, a retired army general and former defense
minister, picked by supporters of Suharto.
	   Analysts have speculated that Suharto's followers, many of them
retired generals, want to impede change within Golkar and to slow
down political reform so as to protect their positions gained
during the Suharto era.
	   Other party representatives were undecided or have named other
choices, Antara said. However, support for Akbar could grow
following a strong call for reform made by Habibie in a speech when
the congress opened on Thursday.
	   Habibie said it must ``take proactive steps toward national
reform'' and ``reform itself.''
	   The party must redefine its role and be ``more responsive to the
people's interests and their aspirations,'' said Habibie.
	   Habibie came to power in May after a wave of riots and protests
forced Suharto to quit, ending 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   While in power Suharto used Golkar to dominate a largely
symbolic form of parliamentary democracy based on tightly
controlled elections.
	   Although the party remains organizationally and financially
strong, there are doubts about its future.
	   Habibie is a longtime friend of Suharto. Nevertless he has
defined critics and has set about to dismantle the old leader's
legacy.
	   He has promised to free up the political system by allowing the
formation of new parties to challenge Golkar's dominance. Electoral
reforms are to be enacted by Parliament this year and new elections
held next year.
	   The Golkar congress is also expected to dissolve a leadership
council headed by Suharto, who is still technically the party's
chief patron.

Trance dances in Israel protest recent police raids of parties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos TLV101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A new dance craze has taken off in
Israel. Fans say the marathon, hypnotic whirl of bobbing heads and
flailing limbs produces an indescribable high and expresses their
yearning for peace and freedom.
	   But police and anti-drug organizations paint a different picture
of ``trance-dancing,'' attributing the high to rampant use of LSD
and Ecstasy, drugs they often confiscate during raids of Friday
night parties deep in wooded nature reserves or on beaches.
	   While trance-dancers insist their movement is benign, some
concede that drugs were part of its inspiration and can enhance the
experience even today.
	   The debate over trance-dancing _ harmless youth fad or catalyst
for drug use? _ came to a head Thursday, when thousands of Israelis
gathered at a square in Tel Aviv to dance off their anger at
authorities, whom they say are unfairly targeting trance-dance
parties in their search for drugs. Forty-two people were arrested
on suspicion of drug-trafficking.
	   Israel is a leading manufacturer of the computer-generated music
that has swept thousands of Israelis between the ages of 20-30 into
a psychedelic subculture. Police say they have nothing against
``trancers,'' as they call themselves, or the thumping rhythms that
inspire them. They insist they're just opposed to illegal drugs.
	   ``We assume there are people who can dance for hours without
drugs. But the Ecstasy and LSD sold at these parties gives them
hours of energy, and the music and the drugs together help achieve
a greater high,'' said Orit Shapira-Heiman, head of drug research
at the intelligence division of Israel's national police.
	   But organizers of Thursday's ``Give Trance a Chance'' protest
dismissed police claims.
	   ``I ran for close to 24 hours some days in the army without any
sleep and no one thought I was taking drugs then,'' said Eyal
Mirelman, a 24-year-old student working on a documentary about the
trance scene.
	   After police shut down a trance party last month at the home of
popular Israeli socialites, despite finding no drugs, several
left-wing lawmakers voiced their support for the trance movement,
inviting musicians to the Knesset to explain it to conservative
legislators.
	   Mirelman and others said Thursday that the stressful political
realities of living in the Middle East drew people to the trance
culture.
	   ``We have the pressures of the army, a tense political situation
and a difficult economy to deal with,'' said Amir Ginat, who
designs many of the glow-in-the-dark decorations that appear at
trance parties.
	   Shapira-Heiman said the trance phenomenon began about ten years
ago, when large groups of Israeli army veterans began traveling to
beach resorts in southern India such as Goa, where they first
experimented with drugs.
	   After returning to Israel, many tried to recreate the
uninhibited experience by organizing all-night dance parties
outdoors.
	   Ginat said his designs, which include distorted swinging
butterflies in neon colors, smiling alligators and rapidly spinning
pinwheels in bright pink and orange, add to the trance high.
	   ``Of course, if you're on acid (LSD), the party becomes
wonderland,'' he said, grinning.

Tokyo stocks tumble on election concern, dollar rises

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices tumbled Friday amid concerns
about Japan's economic policy after Sunday's elections. The U.S.
dollar rose against the yen.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell 356.89 points,
or 2.17 percent, closing at 16,090.06 points. On Wednesday, the
Nikkei index closed down 84.02 points, or 0.51 percent.
	   Nearly half of Friday's losses came within the last 30 minutes
of the day's trading as investors rushed to sell ahead of the
elections for the upper house of Japan's Parliament on Sunday.
	   ``The direction of policy after the election is unclear,'' said
Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo
Securities.
	   Last week, the government announced a long-awaited plan to
rejuvenate Japan's economy, under which it will be easier for
fragile banks to go out of business.
	   Also disappointing investors was a local news report Friday that
quoted an unnamed senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party that income taxes will be reduced by over 4 trillion yen
(dlrs 28.37 billion) in the next fiscal year, which beings April 1,
1999.
	   Traders said investors had been looking for tax cuts of between
5 trillion yen (dlrs 35.46 billion) to 6 trillion yen (dlrs 42.55
billion) to bolster the sluggish consumer spending.
	   Trading was brisk, with an estimated 570 million shares changing
hands on the first section, up from Thursday's 397 million shares.
Decliners outnumbered advancers 895 to 268, with 105 issues
unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 20.78 points, or 1.65 percent, to 1,241.50. The
TOPIX closed down 6.12 points, or 0.48 percent, the day before.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 141.33 yen, up 1.09 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate
of 141.10 yen overnight. It ranged between 140.95 yen and 141.72
yen in Friday's session.
	   The dollar initially advanced on worry Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's government has not done enough to stimulate the weak
economy by failing to detail proposed tax cuts, traders said.
	   The dollar's firmness also derived from investor concern that
economic reforms could be delayed if Hashimoto's governing party
suffers a big loss in Sunday's elections.
	   Recent polls in Japanese newspapers showing the Liberal
Democratic Party is unlikely to fare well in the vote have weighed
on the yen, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.370 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.360 percent, driving its price down to 110.60 yen from 110.73
yen.

Russian prime minister says `social tensions' rising
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW throughout with prime minister speaking in parliament.
CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's financial crisis has sparked an increase
in ``social tension'' and the government needs to swiftly implement
an economic stabilization package, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
told parliament Friday.
	   With economic problems mounting, the Russian government is
seeking parliament's approval for a series of new tax laws and it
also wants dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in fresh loans from the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders.
	   Kiriyenko, who has been battling a series of economic problems
since he took over as prime minister in March, painted a bleak
scenario of Russia's financial climate in his address to
parliament's upper house, the Federation Council.
	   ``The financial market has practically ceased to exist,''
Kiriyenko said. ``Social tension is growing in society, which
naturally is not helpful to stabilization.''
	   The economy shrank by 0.2 percent for the first half of the
year, returning to negative territory after growing a modest 0.8
percent last year, the first year of growth this decade.
	   The financial crisis has been worsening over the past two months
due to the government's chronic inability to collect taxes, a
reduction in oil export revenues, and an exodus of foreign
investors.
	   The stock market has fallen by more than half this year, and
investors are so wary of the Russian bond market that interest
rates are now over 100 percent, and buyers are still scarce.
	   Meanwhile, millions of workers have been receiving their
salaries months late, and this has resulted in an increase in
strikes and demonstrations.
	   Russia has been holding talks with the IMF and the World Bank on
a new loan package, and there are signs that a preliminary
agreement could be in place within days.
	   But IMF and the World Bank may be reluctant to conclude a loan
deal before Russia's parliament approves an economic stabilization
package that tightens tax collection. The lending agencies consider
improved tax revenues to be the key to a Russian recovery.
	   Parliament's lower house is not scheduled to meet again until
July 15, and the Communists and other opposition members have
strong reservations about measures that would raise taxes.
	   The government's greatest fear is that the currency will be
devalued, forcing up prices and inflicting more economic pain on
all Russians. The government has fiercely defended the ruble, which
has remained relatively steady and is trading at around 6.2 rubles
to the U.S. dollar.

IMF official: Timing of Indonesian recovery uncertain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Stanley Fischer, International Monetary Fund
managing director, said in a magazine interview that it's hard to
estimate the timing of a recovery in Indonesia.
	   ``It is difficult at this stage to know when recovery will begin
in Indonesia,'' he's quoted saying in the upcoming edition of
Asiaweek magazine. The magazine released a summary of the article
Friday.
	   While Fischer said the Southeast Asian crisis ``will be over
sooner if countries get on with their economic programs and the
international community provides financial support,'' he also
praised Indonesian ministers for their ``determination.''
	   Fischer also said Thailand and South Korea could recover ``late
this year or early next year.''

Prominent rabbi under fire for ruling on moving graves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In an angry dispute within Israel's
ultra-Orthodox community, demonstrators targeted one of Israel's
most revered rabbis, stoning his car and the seminary where he was
teaching.
	   The rabbi, Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, is considered the country's
chief authority on traditional Jewish law. Several weeks ago, he
drew the ire of ultra-Orthodox militants with his ruling that it
was permissible to move Jewish graves to make way for a major new
roadway.
	   On Thursday night, protesters threw stones and bottles at the
rabbi's car and at the windows of a yeshiva, or religious school,
where he was teaching a lesson at the time, accusing Eliashiv of
compromising on the issue of respect for the dead.
	   Abraham Ravitz, an ultra-Orthodox member of the Israeli
parliament, condemned the attacks, calling the stone throwers
``hooligans and fanatics.''
	   In Israel, religious differences among various streams of
Judaism _ and within the ultra-Orthodox camp _ often boil over into
violent demonstrations.
	   Protests by ultra-Orthodox militants over the road project have
been going on for the past 18 months, delaying its completion.

Spaniard gored, Briton injured in fourth San Fermin bull run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ A Spaniard was gored in the thigh and a
Welshman suffered head wounds after being trampled upon in the
fourth bull run of Spain's celebrated San Fermin festival.
	   A local government spokesman named the Welshman as 40-year-old
Rob Jones. He was trampled on by several bulls and steer as well as
fellow runners after falling halfway along the 850-meter (935-yard)
run.
	   A 39-year-old Spaniard, whose name was not released, was gored
in the left leg but was said to be out of danger. Two other
Spaniards were treated for minor injuries.
	   Several thousand people tested their nerve and speed as they
raced to avoid contact with six bulls stampeding through the
cobblestone streets to Pamplona's bullring in what is the daily
highlight of this nine-day festival.
	   The bulls used are then fought, and invariably killed, in
bullfights later in the day.
	   San Fermin, one of Europe's most popular festivals, attracts
hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.
	   The celebrations, which include non-stop revelry, were made
world famous by Ernest Hemingway's 1927 novel ``Fiesta, The Sun
Also Rises.''
	   Injuries are common in the runs and death always a possibility.
	   The last fatality was a 22-year-old American gored to death in
1995, the 13th runner to die since records began in 1924.
	   Historians say daredevils flaunting authority began running with
the bulls four centuries ago.

Turkey denies delivering food to breakaway Georgian province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Turkey on Friday denied allegations that
it was sending its ships to deliver food to Georgia's breakaway
province of Abkhazia.
	   ``I categorically deny that Turkish ships enter Abkhazian
ports,'' Turkish Consul Hulusi Kilic said in response to recent
statements by the separatists who claimed Turkey was sending them
food supplies.
	   ``We base our policy on the principle of territorial integrity
of Georgia and support Georgia's efforts to reach peaceful
settlement of the conflict,'' Kilic told The Associated Press.
	   Earlier this week, the Abkhazian separatists told the Georgian
government not to take control of the shoreline along the Black Sea
province, saying they would patrol it themselves.
	   Russia has been patrolling Georgia's coast since 1994, the same
year Moscow deployed peacekeepers to separate Georgian government
troops and Abkhazian separatist forces following a 13-month war.
	   Russia and Georgia agreed last month that Georgian border guards
would take over coastal patrols starting July 16.
	   Abkhazia has strongly opposed the move, which would strengthen
the Georgian government's control over the region, tighten an
embargo on arms deliveries to separatists, and possibly hurt trade.
	   Despite the presence of Russian peacekeepers there have been
sporadic clashes since the end of the 1992-93 war and all attempts
to find a peaceful solution to the conflict have failed.

Takanohana, Musashimaru share lead at 6-0, Wakanohana loses.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ New yokozuna (grand champion) Wakanohana
lost Friday, but his brother yokozuna Takanohana remained
undefeated to share a 6-0 lead with ozeki (champion) Musashimaru in
the 15-day Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   One victory behind at 5-1 were Wakanohana, yokozuna Akebono,
ozeki (champion) Takanonami, sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai
and three lower-ranked wrestlers _ No. 4 maegashira (senior
wrestler) Dejima, No. 5-ranked Tochiazuma and No. 11-ranked
Wakanosato.
	   Takanohana quickly grabbed No. 3 maegashira Shikishima's loin
belt and bulldozed him out. Shikishima is 2-4.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, thrust out No. 3
maegashira Gojoro, who is winless.
	   Dejima slapped Wakanohana across the face, then shoved him hard
from behind, sending the yokozuna diving to the ground.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan, pushed out No. 4 maegashira Tochinowaka
(0-6), using his trademark hand thrusts.
	   Takanonami locked No. 5 maegashira Ganyu's left arm, swung him
around and shoved him out. Ganyu is 2-4.
	   Chiyotaikai pushed No. 1 maegashira Oginishiki to the ringside,
then threw him out. Oginishiki is winless.
	   Tochiazuma bulldozed out No. 2-maegashira Tochinonada (0-6).
	   Wakanosato shoved out No. 13-ranked Kotoryu (2-4).
	   In other major bouts, No. 11 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or
Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, stepped backward near ringside to throw
No. 14-ranked maegashira Kaiho off balance. Kaiho (2-4) slipped and
ended up on his belly. Kyokushuzan is 3-3 and Kaiho 2-4.
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho, or Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, also from
Mongolia, was thrown down by No. 12-ranked Asanosho (4-2) to suffer
his fourth defeat against two victories.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 10-ranked
Hoshiandesu, or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, threw out No.
7-ranked Kaigatake, extending his winning streak to three against
no losses. No. 16-ranked Kaishinzan (2-1), or American Henry
Armstrong Miller, pushed down No. 15-ranked Nakao.
	   No. 27-ranked Wakaazuma (1-2), or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil,
was thrown down by No. 25-ranked Aoba. His fellow Brazilian Tetsuya
Takeda, or No. 56-ranked Kitaazuma, was driven out by No. 58-ranked
Yanagi.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 17-ranked
Kyokutenzan (3-0), or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, threw down No.
15-ranked Ryutenzan.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Norway's annual inflation rate 2.1 percent in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's inflation rate was 2.1 percent for
the 12 months ending on June 15, unchanged from the previous month
and below the 2.7 percent annual rate reported for June 1997, the
state statistics agency announced Friday.
	   Statistics Norway said the consumer price index for June was
276.0, compared to 275.4 in May and 270.4 in June 1997. All the
figures use 1979 as a base year with an index of 100.
	   An increase in housing rental costs and food prices during the
month was largely offset by lower energy and clothing prices, the
agency said.

Controversy over dlrs 1.45 billion Dracula Helicopter deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A deal the government signed with an
American firm to purchase 100 attack helicopters is drawing
criticism that it is too costly for a country struggling to come
out of an economic tailspin.
	   ``While we have no enemies at the country's border it is a
decision that makes no sense,'' wrote the daily Economistul Friday
of the 1.45 billion deal with Bell Helicopter Textron.
	   Political analysts say the timing of the deal is designed to
make points ahead of President Emil Constantinescu's visit to
Washington in mid-July. Romania is keen to make the next cut of
former Soviet bloc countries to be admitted to NATO, after being
left out of the first wave, primarily because of economic problems.
	   The Romanian government voted last week to guarantee a dlrs 1.45
billion loan to purchase 96 attack AH1RO Dracula helicopters to be
produced by Bell and a Romanian company.
	   On Thursday, Bell said it would pay dlrs 50 million to buy a 70
percent stake of Romania's IAR Brasov SA _ which would make the
choppers _ and praised the government's decision to go ahead with
the deal.
	   The International Monetary Fund representative in Romania, John
Hill warned last week the project would increase budget expenses
and thus further burden the economy.
	   The government will have to pour an extra dlrs 120 million each
year into the budget to pay for the loan. This years' defense
budget is 7 trillion lei, the equivalent of dlrs 800 million.
	   Romania is struggling to implement a market economy. Reformists
who came to power 18 months ago have stalled on their promises to
improve performance and living standards because of government
infighting, corruption and red tape.
	   The defense ministry said Thursday that the purchase of the
helicopters is a matter of national security and ``the costs are
totally justified.''

looks forward to meeting with his Pakistani counterpart later this
month to discuss the issues over which they fought two wars and

of India news agency quoted Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as
telling Parliament.
	   Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will meet in
the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, during a regular summit of a
seven-nation regional group.
	   Vajpayee said India is prepared for talks with Pakistan _
without the involvement of any other nation _ in resolving their
disputes, chiefly their competing claims to the Himalayan state of
Kashmir.
	   He repeated his call on Pakistan to enter into a no-first-use
nuclear weapons agreement with India.
	   Vajpayee also said India wants to resolve a border dispute with
China that has chilled relations between both nations.
	   India detonated a series of underground nuclear tests in May,
saying it needed a nuclear deterrent due to threats from China and
Pakistan. Pakistan responded with its own tests.
	   Following the tests, the United States, Britain, Japan and other
industrialized nations imposed economic and military sanctions on
both India and Pakistan. They also urged both of them to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, which they have refused to do for years.
	   India says the treaties are flawed because they allow nations
with sophisticated nuclear weapons to keep their arsenals.
	   On Friday, Vajpayee said India is prepared to discuss the test
ban treaty.
	   ``However, nobody should feel that we are ready to participate
because we are weak,'' he said.
	   On Thursday, the U.S. Senate voted unanimously to exempt
agriculture credits from nuclear sanctions imposed on Pakistan and
India. The move will help U.S. farmers who are desperate for
markets sell wheat and other products in South Asia.

Prominent rabbi under fire for ruling on moving graves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In an angry dispute within Israel's
ultra-Orthodox community, demonstrators targeted one of Israel's
most revered rabbis, stoning his car and the seminary where he was
teaching.
	   The rabbi, Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, is considered the country's
chief authority on traditional Jewish law. Several weeks ago, he
drew the ire of ultra-Orthodox militants with his ruling that it
was permissible to move Jewish graves to make way for a major new
roadway.
	   On Thursday night, protesters threw stones and bottles at the
rabbi's car and at the windows of a yeshiva, or religious school,
where he was teaching a lesson at the time, accusing Eliashiv of
compromising on the issue of respect for the dead.
	   Abraham Ravitz, an ultra-Orthodox member of the Israeli
parliament, condemned the attacks, calling the stone throwers
``hooligans and fanatics.''
	   In Israel, religious differences among various streams of
Judaism _ and within the ultra-Orthodox camp _ often boil over into
violent demonstrations.
	   Protests by ultra-Orthodox militants over the road project have
been going on for the past 18 months, delaying its completion.

Cargo woes worsen; government will appoint independent body to

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Under increasing pressure over air cargo
problems at Hong Kong's new airport, the government announced
Friday an independent body would be set up to find out what went
wrong and who's to blame.
	   The move came after Chek Lap Kok's main cargo handler announced
a temporary halt on nearly all cargo shipments. Merchant in Hong
Kong's markets were suffering because of the cargo problems.
	   Chief Secretary Anson Chan, Hong Kong's top civil servant, said
the government would appoint an investigative body ``to establish
what went wrong and where the responsibility lies.''
	   The independent body will include two international experts and
a ``leading member of the Hong Kong community,'' she said. The
names of the commission members will be announced later. Chan said
the government was trying to help the airport authority work out
the problems.
	   Problems started with the opening Monday of the territory's new
dlrs 20 billion airport, located on an outlying island about 30
kilometers (22 miles) west of the city center.
	   While passenger services have improved slowly but steadily after
a rocky start, it has become increasingly clear that the cargo
terminal was not ready for the move from old, downtown Kai Tak
airport.
	   After shifting some operations back to Kai Tak and placing a
temporary embargo on some shipments, the main cargo handler, Hong
Kong Air Cargo Terminals, took more drastic action overnight.
	   The government said the handler had informed officials it was
halting nearly all cargo shipments through Hong Kong for nine days,
except for a few items including in-bound perishables, newspapers
and magazines, and lifesaving materials.
	   James Tien, chairman of Hong Kong's General Chamber of Commerce,
told Hong Kong radio that businessmen appreciated the cargo handler
giving a firm reopening date rather than operating day to day.
	   He also raised the pressure on Chan and Hong Kong Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa. The airport problems ``prompted investors
around the world to question the government's ability to administer
Hong Kong,'' Tien said.
	   He said he was surprised that neither Tung nor Chan had been to
the airport to show their concern with its problems. Chan was there
when it opened Monday morning.
	   On Friday morning, only one of 12 seafood stalls was open in one
of the markets in the tourist and shopping district of Tsimshatsui,
and that was only selling local fish.
	   Other stalls were hosed clean, their walk-in refrigerators
locked, garbage removed, and lights switched off. Where some of
Hong Kong's top chefs and discriminating housewives shopped for
fresh Norwegian salmon, Japanese tuna, and Australian oysters, less
than a handful of buyers were choosing only among the local fish.
	   Sandy Kwong, who sells U.S. cherries, New Zealand kiwis, and
Philippine mangoes at the same market, reported big losses due to
the disruption in cargo handling.
	   ``The system at the new airport is very disorganized,'' Kwong
said. ``If you want to order fresh artichokes now, you have to tell
me three days in advance.''
	   Hong Kong is one of the busiest air cargo centers in the world,
and the Tsimshatsui market one of the more impressive wholesalers
in the territory.
	   Although prices seemed stable, many flower vendors at the
Tsimshatsui market were eager to sell the few lilies and roses from
Holland _ wilting in the heat and brown at the edges _ that they
had left.
	   ``We regret having to make this decision, but imposing such a
moratorium will assist the company in rectifying software and
mechanical problems,'' the air cargo firm's managing director,
Anthony Charter, said.
	   The Hong Kong Standard newspaper estimated the ban would cost
the territory at least 23 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 2.97
billion).
	   The government said in a statement that it was ``gravely
concerned that such a moratorium has become necessary.''
	   ``This would clearly disrupt trade and impact adversely on our
economic performance in the short term,'' it said.

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A military helicopter has crashed in
northern Uganda where the army is fighting rebels, and several
people were killed, an army spokesman said Friday.
	   ``We (still) have to establish the names of the dead, and the
actual number,'' Capt. Shaban Bantariza said.
	   Bantariza said the helicopter crashed Thursday morning in
northern Gulu district, 360 kilometers (225 miles) north of
Kampala.
	   He said the army had ruled out the possibility that rebels of
the Lord's Resistance Army had shot the helicopter down.
	   He said search parties have been sent to the crash site in the
Okidi Hills, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Gulu town.
	   The independent Monitor newspaper quoted Maj. Gen. Jeje Odongo
as saying seven people were feared killed in the crash. The
state-run New Vision newspaper said one of the dead was a
lieutenant colonel.
	   ``I want to inform the nation of a very sad accident that
happened this morning involving one of our helicopters which
crashed,'' Odongo was quoted as saying.
	   Odongo said the pilot had been flying low because of poor
visibility and crashed into the Okidi Hills.
	   The LRA, which has bases in southern Sudan, has been trying to
oust the government of President Yoweri Museveni since 1987.
	   Military attempts to end the rebellion have met with little
success.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with location and time of robbery &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two Americans suspected of robbing about 1.6
million yen (dlrs 11,338) from a shop just outside Tokyo have been
arrested, a Japanese police spokesman said Friday.
	   Toshitaka Otani, spokesman of the Higashi-Yamato police,
identified the two men arrested as Darnell Hopkins, 24, and Michael
Anthony Sheppard, 26.
	   The hometowns of the two arrested were not yet known, Otani
said.
	   Police arrested the two late Thursday nearby the U.S. Air Base
at Yokota, 33 kilometers (21 miles), west of the capital, and about
2 kilometers (1.24 miles) away from the shop.
	   But a third suspect in the crime, who was also believed to be an
American, remains at large, Otani said.
	   The three men allegedly broke into a shop in Higashimurayama at
around 10:55 p.m. Thursday, when shop manager Masako Ikeda was
about to close for the day, Otani said.
	   One of the three men put his hands on Ikeda's mouth to silence
her by yelling ``shut up,'' the police spokesman said. Ms. Ikeda
was not hurt in the attack, Otani said.
	   The shop specializes in exchanging cash for trinkets won by
players of ``pachinko'' pinball, a popular form of gambling in
Japan.

Indonesian agency investigates 468 alleged rapes against Chinese
</HEADLINE>
women
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A government agency meant to build
bridges between indigenous Indonesians and the ethnic Chinese
minority said Friday it was investigating 468 cases of Chinese
women allegedly raped when riots broke out in May.
	   During the riots, which helped oust former President Suharto
from office, mobs attacked Chinese homes and businesses in their
search for scapegoats for the country's worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   The National Unity Development Board said it had interviewed
many victims, their families and witnesses.
	   Some victims had testified that they had been raped in front of
their parents, said Rosita Noer. A number had been hospitalized,
many had been traumatized, and at least one later committed
suicide.
	   Women's groups have said that rape was used as a method of
intimidation against Chinese families during the riots, in which as
many as 1,200 people died.
	   Mostly Christian and Buddhist Chinese make up only a fraction of
Indonesia's largely Muslim 202 million population. They dominate
commerce and industry, and are often targeted in bad times.
	   On Thursday the National Human Rights Commission described the
pattern of rapes as ``systematic.''
	   It castigated the military for being slow to stop the violence
and demanded the government apologize for not protecting its
citizens.
	   Following complaints official inaction, Suharto's successor
President B.J. Habibie formed a task force to investigate rape
allegations.
	   The official Antara news agency reported the military had also
ordered the police to launch a separate investigation.
	   Social workers say many rape victims are too shamed or afraid to
go to the police.

South Korean couple and employee murdered in Kampala
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A South Korean couple and their employee
were hacked to death at their home outside Kampala in an apparent
robbery, a police spokesman said Friday.
	   Lee Moo Young, 57, his wife Lee Kunja, 52, and their 17-year-
old housekeeper Robert Komakech were killed with machetes Thursday
morning, spokesman John Kimera said.
	   Lee and his wife ran a paper recycling factory in Kampala.
	   Kimera said the robbers are believed to have escaped with large
amounts of cash and personal property, but he said no suspects had
been arrested.
	   Police blame the growing number of robberies in the Ugandan
capital on unemployment among soldiers demobilized from the former
National Resistance Army, which brought President Yoweri Museveni
to power in 1986.
	   Since then, Museveni has been successful in attracting foreign
investment to the impoverished country through a policy of free
markets and privatization.
	   But liberalization has also increased the gap between the rich
and the poor in the nation of 22.4 million people.

Philippine stocks, peso decline on weakening yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with peso closing at three-week low

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Strong dollar demand caused by the
weaker Japanese yen pulled the Philippine peso down Friday to a
three-week low against the U.S. currency, dealers said.
	   Stocks, meanwhile, finished lower in step with other retreating
regional markets and the weakening peso.
	   The peso pierced the psychologically sensitive 42-peso mark
versus the dollar in early trading as the yen searched for a
bottom. The dollar averaged 42.119 pesos for the day, compared to
Thursday's 41.685 pesos.
	   The dollar hit a high of 42.25 pesos, its highest level since
June 16, when it reached 42.26 pesos.
	   Traders expect the peso to continue to depreciate as pressure is
exerted on the yen because of Japanese upper house parliamentary
elections this weekend.
	   Concern over the health of the Philippine economy also weighed
on sentiment toward the peso, they said.
	   In stock trading, the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index
fell 26.19 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,802.21 points, adding to a
29.10-point loss Thursday.
	   The broader All Shares Index dropped 6.62 points to 563.38 after
declining 6.69 points on Thursday. Losers beat gainers 65 to 14,
with 44 issues unchanged.
	   Analysts said investors were taking profits while they await
further developments in Japan.
	   ``Investors are squaring positions ahead of the Sunday
elections,'' said Ramon Lucas, a trader for Kim Eng Securities.
	   ``The situation is regional ... it's the yen and that sinking
feeling,'' said Joy Quintos, research director at Capital
Securities One Inc.
	   She said while there are domestic concerns like rising inflation
and interest rates, these pale in comparison to the adverse effects
of a further decline of the yen.
	   ``The concern now is not prices (of stocks) because everything
now is already cheap, but the risk. These are uncertain times and
risks are high,'' she said, explaining investor wariness in buying
equities. File Stored As: TXS8436 toksup 359 07-10 10:04 rf

 &UR; At least two dead in spate of border clashes
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with border clashes, tense village standoff; trims;

<TEXT>
	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ At least two people died in border
clashes Friday between Albanian arms smugglers and the Yugoslav
army, Serbs reported. Tensions built in a central village, with
hundreds of armed Albanians dug in against feared attack.
	   The deaths, reported by the pro-government Serbian Information
Center, occurred near the border village of Vrbnica, about 75
kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Large quantities of arms and ammunition were confiscated after
army troops were fired on and returned fire, said the center.
	   It also reported an unspecified number of Albanians killed and
wounded in a separate clash near the border village of Kosare, and
another exchange of fire near the border outpost of Gorozup, west
of Prizren. None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   Clashes between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian
militants have grown increasingly violent since late February,
killing hundreds of people and forcing thousands of others to flee.
The Yugoslav army is also increasingly involved as Serbia, the
larger of the two Yugoslav republics, battles Kosovo Albanians
seeking to split Kosovo province away from Serbia.
	   Tensions also grew Friday northwest of Pristina, the provincial
capital. About 400 Kosovo Albanians _ many of them armed _
fortified their village, Pantina, against expected Serb attack from
a neighboring community.
	   Villagers in Pantina, 25 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of
Pristina, said Serbs in nearby Svinjare had burned down four
Albanian houses after their residents had fled. They said Serbs
were sniping at Albanians within rifle-shot of Svinjare.
	   Serb civilians, some toting rifles, blocked reporters from
entering Svinjare.
	   With routes kept confidential for recently begun observer
missions, it was unclear if either the Pantina area or the border
regions would be covered Friday by the diplomats monitoring Kosovo
flashpoints.
	   The multinational missions are to identify regions that require
further observation and determine the needs for humanitarian
support and displaced persons.
	   In Vienna, Austria, the Organization of Security and Cooperation
in Europe said Thursday that Yugoslavia agreed to let an OSCE
delegation visit the country, including Kosovo, for about 10 days
as part of international efforts to end the conflict.
	   Yugoslavia has refused to accept OSCE mediation until its
membership in the 54-member organization is restored. Although the
Yugoslav agreement falls short of accepting OSCE mediation, U.S.
and European officials called the invitation a step in the right
direction.
	   In a parallel effort, the United States was launching a
diplomatic shuttle between Serbs and ethnic Albanians to try to
work out an arrangement for restoring autonomy to Kosovo.
	   The shuttle by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was approved by
American, British, French, German, Italian and Russian officials at
a meeting Wednesday in Bonn, Germany.

Russian prime minister says `social tension' rising

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's financial crisis has sparked an increase
in ``social tension'' and the government needs to swiftly implement
its economic stabilization package, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
told parliament Friday.
	   With economic problems mounting, the Russian government is
seeking parliament's approval for a series of new tax laws and it
also wants dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in fresh loans from the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders.
	   Kiriyenko, who has been battling a series of economic problems
since he took over as prime minister in March, painted a bleak
picture of Russia's financial climate in his address to
parliament's upper house, the Federation Council.
	   ``The financial market has practically ceased to exist,''
Kiriyenko said. ``Social tension is growing in society, which
naturally is not helpful to stabilization.''
	   Strikes by coal miners and other workers have been on the rise
as millions of workers go months without receiving their pay. Coal
miners have been blocking freight trains on the Trans-Siberian
railway for the past week, similar to a protest staged in May.
	   Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin spoke by telephone with
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Jacques Chirac,
and both voiced their support for Russia's anti-crisis economic
program, the Kremlin said.
	   The financial crisis has been worsening over the past two months
due to the government's chronic inability to collect taxes, a
reduction in oil export revenues, and an exodus of foreign
investors.
	   The economy shrank by 0.2 percent for the first half of the
year, returning to negative territory after growing a modest 0.8
percent last year, the first year of growth this decade.
	   The stock market has fallen by more than half this year, and
investors are so wary of Russian government debt that interest
rates are now over 100 percent, and buyers are still scarce.
	   Russia has been holding talks with the IMF and the World Bank on
a new loan package, and there are signs that a preliminary
agreement could be reached within days.
	   But IMF and the World Bank may be reluctant to conclude a loan
deal before Russia's parliament approves an economic stabilization
package that tightens tax collection. The lending agencies consider
improved tax revenues to be the key to a Russian recovery.
	   Parliament's lower house is not scheduled to meet again until
July 15, and the Communists and other opposition members have
strong reservations about measures that would raise taxes.
	   The government's greatest fear is that the currency will be
devalued, forcing up prices and inflicting more economic pain on
all Russians. The government has fiercely defended the ruble, which
has remained relatively steady and is trading at around 6.2 rubles
to the U.S. dollar.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Support for democratic change
intensified within the ranks of Indonesia's biggest political
organization Friday when a growing number of its officials said
they would back an ally of reformist President B.J. Habibie as new
party chief.
	   A three-day special congress of the Golkar party, once the tool
of autocratic ex-President Suharto, is scheduled to end Saturday
when 27 officials from each of Indonesia's provinces vote for a new
party chairman.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted 11 representatives as
saying they would back Akbar Tanjung, who is state secretary in
Habibie's Cabinet and his choice for the party job.
	   Eight other representatives announced they would support Akbar's
rival Edy Sudradjat, a retired army general and former defense
minister, picked by supporters of Suharto.
	   Analysts have speculated that Suharto's followers, many of them
retired generals, want to impede change within Golkar and to slow
down political reform so as to protect their positions gained
during the Suharto era.
	   Other party representatives were undecided or have named other
choices, Antara said. However, support for Akbar could grow
following a strong call for reform made by Habibie in a speech when
the congress opened on Thursday.
	   Habibie said it must ``take proactive steps toward national
reform'' and ``reform itself.''
	   The party must redefine its role and be ``more responsive to the
people's interests and their aspirations,'' said Habibie.
	   Habibie came to power in May after a wave of riots and protests
forced Suharto to quit, ending 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   While in power Suharto used Golkar to dominate a largely
symbolic form of parliamentary democracy based on tightly
controlled elections.
	   Although the party remains organizationally and financially
strong, there are doubts about its future.
	   Habibie is a longtime friend of Suharto. Nevertheless he has
defied critics and has set about to dismantle the old leader's
legacy.
	   He has promised to free up the political system by allowing the
formation of new parties to challenge Golkar's dominance. Electoral
reforms are to be enacted by Parliament this year and new elections
held next year.
	   The Golkar congress is also expected to dissolve a leadership
council headed by Suharto, who is still technically the party's
chief patron.

Hong Kong share prices tumble

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices in Hong Kong tumbled for a second
consecutive session Friday on concerns over the weak Japanese
currency.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 228.01 points, or 2.7 percent, to 8,205.77. On Thursday, the
index had slumped 195.40 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 4.74 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
607 million), up from Thursday's 3.24 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 415 million).
	   Brokers said investors were concerned the Japanese yen would
continue to fall against the U.S. dollar because of uncertainty
over Japan's economic reforms.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar was quoted at 141.33 yen, up 1.09
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
rate of 141.10 yen overnight.
	   Trading remained light as many investors stayed on the sidelines
to await the outcome of Japanese parliamentary elections on Sunday.
	   The Japanese government is expected to announce sweeping tax
cuts after the election to boost the faltering economy.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 1.60 Hong Kong dollars to
35.70, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 80 cents to 31.20.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 6.00 dollars to
182.00, and Hang Seng Bank fell 60 cents to 42.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 2.00 dollars to 38.60, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 1.35 dollars to 27.40.

Military feeding troops with dog food, prosecutors say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The cash-strapped military has apparently found a
new way to cut costs _ it's been feeding some soldiers with canned
dog food instead of meat, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Military prosecutors, who recently checked army food depots near
Moscow, found 1,000 tons of dog food, the business daily Kommersant
reported.
	   The prosecutors also discovered that butter, fish and other
products at the depots were bought after their shelf life had
already expired.
	   The check revealed many other irregularities, the report said.
In one example, a Russian meat factory was systematically placing
less meat in its cans than indicated by the label. The military
paid for some 16 tons of meat that it didn't receive.
	   When the prosecutors warned the military command about their
intention to check several other food depots throughout Russia, Lt.
Gen. Vyacheslav Savinov, the chief of the Defense Ministry's food
service, submitted his resignation report, the newspaper said.
	   The Russian armed forces have been plagued by rampant corruption
and other crimes. Dozens of senior officers have faced criminal
charges in recent years.

Cambodian warns challengers against trying to use force

<TEXT>
	   KOH KEL, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen warned his
challengers Friday not to try resorting to armed force to influence
the outcome of elections July 26, promising to peacefully transfer
power if he loses.
	   The allegations of what would amount to an illegal armed plot
could be used as a pretext by Hun Sen for moving violently against
his opponents, as he has in the past.
	   The warning followed reports that Hun Sen's government suspects
the main opposition leaders _ Prince Norodom Ranariddh and
dissident Sam Rainsy _ of illegally trying to build up military
strength for a post-election showdown.
	   ``I will smoothly transfer power to the winner,'' Hun Sen told
reporters at an irrigation project 50 kilometers (30 miles) south
of the capital, Phnom Penh. ``It is very dangerous to use force. No
one can beat Hun Sen by using force.''
	   Hun Sen has held power since the mid-1980s through force. When
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party won U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993, Hun
Sen threatened war and forced his way into a co-premiership. A year
ago, power-sharing ended when Hun Sen's troops routed the prince's
armed supporters in a bloody coup.
	   This time, no U.N. peacekeepers are overseeing the elections.
Opponents and watchdog groups accuse Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party of using violence and murder against campaign workers and of
packing the electoral machinery with their supporters.
	   In the weeks before deposing Ranariddh last year, Hun Sen
accused the prince of bringing ex-Khmer Rouge guerrillas into the
capital to stage his own seizure of power. The charges were never
proven, though Ranariddh was found guilty in a show trial in March
as a condition to be allowed to return from exile.
	   Hun Sen has called the vote to win back international aid and
legitimacy lost in the coup. Holding practically all the military
cards in Cambodia, he promised Friday to step down within five
hours if the election results show he lost.
	   An official from Hun Sen's party said on condition of anonymity
that Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy were suspected of trying to build up
their own forces: ``Now, we are just gathering the evidence.''
	   Despite all the precautions Hun Sen has taken to emerge the
victor, huge crowds have met the opposition leaders in campaigning
across the country. Hun Sen, who says he has no interest in
campaign appearances, has taken a low profile.
	   Sam Rainsy acknowledged last week that he is building up armed
forces in case Hun Sen loses but refuses to step down, boasting
that a former Interior Ministry official who still commands support
in the police force has shifted support from Hun Sen to him.
	   The official, Sin Sen, quietly left Cambodia on Friday. Any
loyalists he may have would be clearly outnumbered by the troops at
Hun Sen's disposal.
	   Sam Rainsy appealed recently to the armed forces to put aside
factional loyalty and defend the winner of the elections. He vowed
to ``tame all the rebels who would not respect the people's
desire.''
	   On Friday, in the northwestern province of Battambang, Sam
Rainsy called on a crowd of 1,500 people ``to vote to overthrow the
corrupt dictators.''
	   Ranariddh meanwhile told a cheering crowd of about 10,000 in
Siem Reap, site of the ancient Angkor temples, that a vote for him
means a vote for the monarchy.
	   ``If you want the monarchy, the royal family, who will you vote
for?'' Ranariddh asked.
	   ``FUNCINPEC!'' the crowd boomed back.
	   Large crowds welcoming the prince at his campaign stops indicate
that as son of the country's well-liked King Norodom Sihanouk, he
still retains wide popularity.
	   Hun Sen has on several occasions hinted that members of the
royal family should not be allowed to engage in politics. He has
forced two other princes into exile.

Georgian refugees trickle back to homes, U.N. says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Uprooted Georgian residents have started returning
to the Ghali district of the breakaway province of Abkhazia despite
continued looting, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday.
	   The Georgians are ``trickling back at a fairly small pace of
about 100 people a week'' to rebuild their homes, although many
have been completely destroyed, said Kris Janowski, spokesman for
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Some 38,000 ethnic Georgian refugees fled the Ghali region
during fighting in May between Abkhazian separatists and militia
groups that support Georgia's central government.
	   UNHCR estimates that some 1,600 houses were burned down in the
violence.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence has broken about sporadically since then, despite the
presence of Russian peacekeepers in the region.
	   The area remains unsafe for returning refugees, with one
Georgian man being shot dead by Abkhazian militants last week and
more houses being burned down, Janowski said.
	   UNHCR advises refugees ``not to rush to go back, since there
isn't very much to go back to and the situation is very
difficult,'' he added.
	   Some of those who have returned reportedly bribed their way
across a bridge closed by Abkhazian forces.
	   Agency staff visiting the region last week reported continued
looting. Land mines add to the dangers for returning refugees.
	   Georgia demands that Abkhazia allow an immediate, unconditional
return of the refugees who fled May's fighting.
	   Abkhazia says it needs time to build housing for the refugees,
and wants to screen those who return to make sure they don't
include pro-Georgian guerrillas.

British power giant pulling out of power plant joint venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ British power giant Energy Group is
pulling out of a 16 billion Taiwan dollar (dlrs 450 million) joint
venture to build a coal-fired power station in eastern Taiwan, a
company official said Friday.
	   The decision followed Mobil's decision to pull out of another
joint venture in March.
	   The two ventures were among 11 granted rights to build power
stations after the government ended the state-run Taiwan Power
Co.'s monopoly in 1996. The privatization plan also was aimed at
easing Taiwan's power shortage.
	   But both ventures faced red tape, difficulties in land
acquisition and local concerns about pollution.
	   Energy Group's pullout was a sign of discrepancies between the
central government, which wants to attract foreign investment, and
local governments that are concerned about pollution.
	   ``It's a straightforward business decision,'' said an executive
at Energy Group's Taiwan office, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. He refused to elaborate on the decision.
	   Energy Group has a 30-percent stake in the joint venture with
two Taiwanese firms, China Development and Pao Shiang Construction.
	   The power station was required by the government to begin
operations in July to supply power to Taiwan Power.
	   However, Taiwan Power officials said it has yet to begin
construction because the government only recently approved its
environmental standards.
	   Taiwan Power is demanding the venture pay 300 million Taiwan
dollars (dlrs 8.5 million) in fines for the delay. Despite British
Energy's pullout, the project is expected to continue because the
company has agreed to pay the fines in order to prevent its license
from being revoked, they said.
	   Early this year, the German company Bayer gave up plans to build
a 49 billion Taiwan dollar (dlrs 1.5 billion) petrochemical plant
because of local environmental opposition.

Farms flooded in southeastern Poland, three provinces on alert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Low floods have soaked farms near the
rain-swollen Wislok river in southeastern Poland, and two provinces
were put on flood alert Friday as weather reports called for more
rain.
	   The flooding comes one year after a deluge last July and August
in southwestern Poland killed 55 people, swamped 46,000 homes and
caused an estimated 12 billion zlotys (dlrs 3.4 billion) in damage.
	   Dozens of towns and villages along the Wislok were put on alert
Friday in Rzeszow province, 280 kilometers (174 miles) southeast of
Warsaw, and in Krosno province, 350 kilometers (217 miles) south of
Warsaw, local flood prevention officials told PAP.
	   In Krosno province, the Wislok, a Wisla river tributary, has
risen 45 centimeters (18 inches) above alert levels, Wlodzimierz
Kowalski told PAP. Several farms in both provinces were already
covered with centimeters (inches) of water.
	   Nearby Przemysl province was put on flood alert Thursday after
several farms and roads were flooded.

Russia seeks to rebuild sports reputation with World Youth Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Available &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's once-mighty sports program has been
crippled by funding cuts, but Moscow hopes the first-ever World
Youth Games will help to rebuild the country's rich athletic
tradition.
	   The games, which begin Saturday and run through July 19, are
expected to draw 5,000 participants from 130 countries. The
athletes, ages 12 to 17, will compete in 15 medal events, such as
track and field and soccer. There will also be demonstration sports
such as American football, street basketball, and mountain biking.
	   Moscow's ambitious Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who appointed himself
chairman of the games organizing committee, has staged a media
blitz to drum up support, casting it as an event that will help
unite the nation.
	   The games appear well-organized, but there are no big-name
performers and the events are not expected to draw large crowds or
much interest outside Moscow.
	   Luzhkov has sunk 200 million rubles (more than dlrs 30 million)
into the games, according to organizers. He has also spent large
sums on stadium renovations and infrastructure repair around the
city.
	   ``Things have exceeded our expectations so far,'' said Bill
Wenninger, the spokesman for the U.S. team. ``The Olympic village
has been great, and the venues are in excellent shape.''
	   Unlike the rest of Russia, Moscow is relatively rich and Luzhkov
said he was not concerned about whether the city would recoup its
large investment.
	   ``The World Youth Games will be conducted absolutely free of
mercantilism,'' the mayor said Thursday.
	   The benefit, city officials say, will be in demonstrating that
Russia is again capable of handling a large sporting event.
	   ``One of the reasons for these games is to show that Moscow is
ready to hold such events, despite a number of problems,'' said
Rudolph Nevetsky, a spokesman for the games' press service. ``If
these go normally, then Moscow will make (an Olympic) bid.''
	   Russia's second largest city, St. Petersburg, made a bid to host
the 2004 Olympics, but didn't make it to the final round. The
city's poor infrastructure and facilities played a large part in
its failure.
	   Russia is still producing world-class athletes, but many of its
best hockey players, figure skaters and tennis players have fled to
the West to perform professionally or find better training
facilities.
	   The Youth Games also are partly sponsored by the International
Olympic Committee, and Luzhkov has played up this connection.
	   The Olympic rings adorn billboards all over the city, the
Olympic flame is making it's way from Athens, and past Olympic
champions will take part in the opening ceremonies.
	   Despite all the fanfare, the games haven't generated much
enthusiasm among Russian sports fans, and there's been conflicting
information about ticket sales.
	   At the games' information bureau, one spokesman said tickets
would be available at the event venues for a small price. Another
said they would be distributed free throughout the city.
	   A third official promised to call back with details. And a
fourth, angry at the imposition, said adults would not be admitted
to events.
	   ``These tickets have all been given to children,'' said a
spokeswoman, who refused to give her name. ``Why do you want to go?
There will be nothing for adults to do there.''

US Transportation secretary calls for new partnership with Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney E.
Slater said Friday aviation would play a major role opening Africa
to world markets.
	   ``But people will not fly if they fear for their safety and
security,'' Slater told a conference on the U.S. ``Safe Skies for
Africa'' initiative, launched during President Bill Clinton's
recent trip to the continent.
	   Slater urged African states to ensure their airlines complied
with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) rules so that
the number of African carriers qualifying for a Safety Category One
could be expanded rapidly. Only four qualify now.
	   He said the continent could learn from carriers such as
Ethiopian Airlines that had met standards successfully.
	   Zimbabwean Transport Minister Enos Chikowore responded by
accusing the developed states of exploiting Africa's weaknesses for
profit.
	   ``As a first step we implore you to see that steps are taken as
soon as possible in order to redress this situation of Category
Three that you place our country,'' said Chikowore.
	   As a result of being placed in Safety Category Three by U.S.
authorities, Air Zimbabwe is denied overflight or landing rights in
the United States.
	   Chikowore said the airline, which has sought reciprocal landing
rights in the United States, has been dogged since the 1980s by
negative publicity.
	   The state-owned airline was hit in the 1980s by problems of
unreliability and non-compliance with flight schedules.
	   Airliners then were frequently commandeered by President Robert
Mugabe, leaving passengers stranded.
	   Angola, Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ethiopia were
represented at the one-day meeting. Although invited, Burundi,
South Africa, Swaziland, and Zambia did not attend.
	   Slater said Clinton's ``Safe Skies'' initiative was aimed at
bringing Africa into a new era of global prosperity.
	   ``We are here in force and we are here as part of a strategy of
engagement,'' he said, noting that Clinton would invite ``reform
minded African nations'' to a September summit.
	   ``We must advance our main objectives, integrating Africa into
the global economy and promoting democracy.''
	   Africa's long record of civil aviation tragedies include crashes
that killed United Nations secretary general Dag Hammarskjold,
Mozambican president Samora Machel, and most recently UN special
representative on Angola Alouine Blondin Beye.
	   Northwest and Delta Airlines have recently become the first U.S.
carriers granted operating rights here.

Chinese air force helps out in floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's air force has airlifted relief supplies
to people trapped by floods, as the death toll from the nation's
annual flood season rose to at least 590, state media said Friday.
	   Air force planes and helicopters have flown more than 30
missions in five flood-hit provinces, including flying supplies in
treacherous winds, rains and clouds to people trapped by flooding
in southeastern Fujian province, the Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Air force planes have also taken reconnaissance photos that
provided flood control officials with information about the weather
and conditions in affected areas, Xinhua said.
	   As of Sunday, 23 of China's 30 provinces, regions and major
cities had been hit by flooding, and more rains, as well as
possibly one or two typhoons or tropical storms, were expected, the
China Business Times said.
	   More rains also were expected in southwest Sichuan province,
where floods caused by torrential rains that began June 27 have
already killed 170 people and injured more than 1,750 others.
	   The Sichuan deaths pushed the number of people killed nationwide
in the annual flood season to at least 590.
	   Meanwhile, weeks of flooding and sweltering summer heat prompted
authorities in a southern Chinese city to ban raw seafood and
sashimi, Japanese-style sliced raw fish, in an effort to combat an
increase in cholera, dysentery and other intestinal diseases, the
China Daily said.
	   Violators of the three-month ban in Guangzhou ``will be severely
punished,'' the official newspaper said.

Violence jars Lagos, elders urge restraint among rival groups

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Blind rage over the death of political
prisoner Moshood Abiola may be turning more calculated, pitting
Nigeria's ethnic rivals against one another in a deadly, but
ages-old, battle.
	   For the third day straight, outraged youths stormed through the
streets on Friday in parts of Nigeria's commercial capital of
Lagos, setting fires, smashing windows and blocking roads.
	   The bodies of nine people from the northern Hausa ethnic group
that were discovered in various parts of a predominantly southern
Yoruba neighborhood indicated the violence may not be so random.
	   A senior police commander in Lagos described many of the
rampaging youths in Lagos as out of work, disenfranchised
southerners from the Yoruba ethnic group.
	   The death of Abiola _ a Yoruba and the apparent winner of
annulled presidential elections in 1993 _ has infuriated his
supporters who say the northern- and Hausa-dominated military is to
blame.
	   Abiola died Tuesday while still in the custody of his military
captors, who had kept him imprisoned for the past four years.
	   The army says he died of a heart attack, but some of Abiola's
relatives say he was killed by the military even as they prepared
to set him free.
	   The ruling junta says it has completed an autopsy, but hasn't
released the results. A second, independent autopsy to be conducted
by a team of foreign pathologists, was scheduled for Friday.
	   At least 24 people have been killed in three days of violence
following Abiola's death. Many of the victims were members of the
Hausa and related Fulani groups, says military junta commander Col.
Hamed Ali.
	   ``Counsel your subjects on the need for peaceful co-existence,''
Ali told a joint meeting of Yoruba, Hausa and Ibo elders in Lagos
late Thursday.
	   Yoruba leaders have been calling for restraint from their own
members, but have also appealed to the military to help stop
reprisal attacks.
	   Earlier, Yorubas armed with knives, clubs, bows and arrows,
battled Hausas in several Lagos neighborhoods.
	   Nigeria's horrific 1960s Biafran war flourished out of ethnic
hatreds and attacks between northern and southern tribes. More than
a million people died in that civil war as southern Ibos waged a
futile battle to establish an independent homeland in southeastern
Nigeria.
	   Since independence from British rule in 1960, Nigeria has been a
splintered country of ethnic fault lines.
	   The junta, meanwhile, was trying to set a tone of reconciliation
in the face of ongoing violence. The military on Thursday commuted
death sentences handed down to six people, including a former
military leader, accused of trying to overthrow late dictator Gen.
Sani Abacha.
	   Although triggering much anger, it is the military and its
iron-fisted central rule that is often and ironically credited with
keeping fractious Nigeria in one piece.
	   Bowing to enormous pressure, the junta announced it will set up
a commission of top officials to sketch out the broad outline for a
transition to democracy.
	   The country's new military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar says
he will address the nation on the plan next week.
	   The country's leaders met late Thursday night to discuss plans
to hand over power to civilians and release Nigeria's remaining
political prisoners.
	   Nigeria was in the midst of a flawed transition to democracy
when Abacha died early last month. Abubakar has vowed to complete
the transition, but he has not said how or when.

Yeltsin says government strong enough to stop extremist threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin reassured Russians on
Friday that the country can withstand any extremist threat.
	   ``We are strong enough to curb all plans for seizing power and
all other extremist plans,'' Yeltsin said during a meeting with top
Defense and Interior Ministry leaders, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   Yeltsin's comments follow increased attacks by neo-Nazis in
Moscow on foreigners, as well as on Jewish synagogues and
cemeteries. Yesterday the president criticized his own Justice
Ministry for registering extremist parties as legitimate political
entities.
	   Despite the increase in extremist violence, it isn't likely that
such groups pose any real threat to Yeltsin's government, nor does
there appear to be any organized group on the level of the 1993
coup plotters who failed to oust him from power.
	   Immediately after Yeltsin made his remarks, interest rates on
one-month bonds shot up from 122 percent to 149 percent. Some
traders said the comments had spooked Russian markets.
	   Yeltsin also said during the meeting that Russia's navy will
eventually carry half the country's nuclear strike capability,
Interfax said.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Seven people were killed when a military
helicopter crashed in northern Uganda where the army is fighting
rebels, an army spokesman said Friday.
	   Capt. Shaban Bantariza said he did not yet have the names of the
dead.
	   He said the Soviet-era M-17 helicopter crashed Thursday morning
in northern Gulu district, 360 kilometers (225 miles) north of
Kampala.
	   He said the army had ruled out the possibility that rebels of
the Lord's Resistance Army had shot the helicopter down because the
wreckage was scattered over a wide area.
	   ``Those speculating that the plane (sic) might have been shot
down by the rebels are LRA supporters and those speaking from
ignorance'' Bantariza said.
	   He did not explain why a helicopter that crashed without having
been shot down would leave wreckage scattered over a wide distance.
	   The independent Monitor newspaper cited Maj. Gen. Jeje Odongo as
saying the pilot had been flying low because of poor visibility and
crashed into the Okidi Hills, 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of
Gulu.
	   Bantazira said search parties were at the crash site.
	   He said a senior military official would issue a statement later
Friday with the identities of the dead.
	   The state-run New Vision newspaper said one of the dead was a
lieutenant colonel.
	   The LRA, which has bases in southern Sudan, has been trying to
oust the government of President Yoweri Museveni since 1987.
	   Military attempts to end the rebellion have met with little
success.

Russian karate fighter dies of injuries at international contest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A Russian contestant in a contact karate
tournament died after sustaining heavy injuries in a bout,
officials said Friday.
	   Said Isayev, 20, who underwent surgery at the Kiev First Aid
Hospital, died on Wednesday without regaining consciousness,
doctors at the hospital said.
	   Isayev received severe brain injuries last Saturday during a
quarterfinals fight at a youth contact karate world championship in
Kiev organized by the Ukrainian Federation of Martial Arts.
	   Although Isayev was wearing a protective helmet, he suffered a
heavy blow to the jaw, which resulted in a massive brain
hemorrhage, said Dr. Ihor Konivets.
	   Isayev's death was the second in a Ukrainian sporting event in
the last few months.
	   Douglas Dedge, an American who took part in a no-holds-barred
``extreme fighting'' competition in March, died a few days after
sustaining serious head injuries in a fight with a Ukrainian
contestant.

Ukraine offers military training ranges to international forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine is offering international
peacekeeping forces the use of its military training ranges,
Defense Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk said, according to a report
Friday.
	   Kuzmuk said Ukraine's training ranges, including Shyrokyi Lan in
the south and Yavorivskyi in the west, possess unique facilities
such as landing strips for all types of military cargo aircraft,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The offer is not limited to NATO forces, Kuzmuk said Thursday
during a meeting with Canada's visiting Defense Minister Arthur
Eggleton.
	   ``We are offering the ranges for partner countries in the
framework of the (NATO) Partnership for Peace program and for
bilateral cooperation purposes,'' he said.

	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ At least two people died in border
clashes Friday between Albanian arms smugglers and the Yugoslav
army, Serbs reported. Tensions worsened in a village in central
Kosovo province, with hundreds of armed Albanians dug in against an
anticipated Serb attack.
	   The deaths, reported by the pro-government Serbian Information
Center, occurred near the village of Vrbnica, about 75 kilometers
(45 miles) southwest of Pristina along Kosovo's border with
Albania.
	   Serb soldiers seized large quantities of arms and ammunition
after exchanging fire with ethnic Albanian gunmen, the center said.
	   It also reported an unspecified number of Albanians killed and
wounded in a separate clash near the border village of Kosare, and
another exchange of fire near the border outpost of Gorozup, west
of Prizren. None of the three reports could be independently
confirmed.
	   Clashes between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian
militants have grown increasingly violent since late February,
killing hundreds of people and forcing thousands of others to flee.
The Yugoslav army is also increasingly involved as Serbia, the
larger of the two Yugoslav republics, battles Kosovo Abanians
seeking to split the povince away from Serbia.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in the province 9-to-1, but
Serbs regard Kosovo as their historic heartland.
	   Tensions also intensified Friday northwest of Pristina, the
provincial capital. About 400 ethnic Albanians _ many of them armed
_ fortified their village, Pantina, against expected Serb attack
from a neighboring community.
	   Villagers in Pantina, 25 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of
Pristina, said Serbs in nearby Svinjare had burned down four
Albanian houses after their residents had fled and were sniping at
Albanians.
	   Serb civilians, some toting rifles, blocked reporters from
entering Svinjare.
	   It was unclear if diplomats monitoring Kosovo's flashpoints
would visit either the Pantina area or the border regions on
Friday. The multinational missions aim to identify regions that
require further observation and determine the needs for
humanitarian support and displaced persons.
	   In Vienna, Austria, the Organization of Security and Cooperation
in Europe said Thursday that Yugoslavia agreed to let an OSCE
delegation visit the country, including Kosovo, for about 10 days
as part of international efforts to end the conflict.
	   Yugoslavia has refused to accept OSCE mediation until its
membership in the 54-member organization is restored. Although the
Yugoslav agreement falls short of accepting OSCE mediation, U.S.
and European officials called the invitation a step in the right
direction.
	   In a parallel effort, the United States was launching a
diplomatic shuttle between Serbs and ethnic Albanians to try to
work out an arrangement for restoring autonomy to Kosovo.
	   The shuttle by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was approved by
American, British, French, German, Italian and Russian officials at
a meeting Wednesday in Bonn, Germany.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II appointed Bishop
Louis-Marie Bille, head of the French bishops conference, as
archbishop of Lyon, the Vatican said Friday.
	   Bille, who headed the archdiocese of Aix in southern France,
replaces Cardinal Jean Balland. Balland died March 1 of lung
cancer.
	   Bille, 60, an expert in scripture and theology, was bishop of
Laval from 1984-1995. He was named to the prominent post of
president of the French bishops conference in 1996.

Dutch bank and insurer to merge within three years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch bank Rabobank NV and insurer
Achmea Holding NV said Friday they plan to merge within three
years.
	   The cooperation will create a ``powerful'' group that will be a
leader in virtually all sectors of the financial market in the
Netherlands, said the two companies.
	   As a first step, they will establish a joint venture effective
Jan. 1, 1999.
	   Both companies will hold a 50 percent stake in the venture,
which will integrate similar activities such as asset management,
pensions, life insurances, and health insurance.
	   Rabobank, which is among the top five banks in the country, had
total assets of 423 billion guilders (dlrs 211 billion) at the end
of last December.
	   Achmea, which is active in the Benelux countries, had total
assets of 63 billion guilders (dlrs 31 billion).
	   The cooperation of the two companies, both unlisted, is the
latest in a merger and takeover rush in the financial sector.
	   Over the past year, Dutch banking and insurance combine ING
bought U.S. investment bank Furman Selz and insurer Equitable of
Iowa, as well as Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert.
	   Last month, Belgian-Dutch financial services group Fortis won
the bid for Generale Bank of Belgium, and earlier this week,
leading Dutch bank ABN Amro Holding NV said it will buy Brazil's
Banco Real.

Spaniard gored, Briton injured, in fourth San Fermin bull run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ A Spaniard was gored in the thigh and a
Briton suffered head injuries after being trampled by bulls running
through the streets Friday on the fourth day of Spain's celebrated
San Fermin festival.
	   Rob Jones, 40, of Wales was trampled by bulls and fellow runners
alike after falling halfway along the 850-meter (935-yard) run.
	   A 39-year-old Spaniard, whose name was not released, was gored
in the left leg but was said to be out of danger. Two other
Spaniards were treated for minor injuries.
	   Several thousand people tested their nerve and speed as they
raced to avoid contact with six bulls stampeding through the
cobblestone streets to Pamplona's bullring in the daily highlight
of this nine-day festival.
	   The bulls are killed in bullfights later the same day.
	   San Fermin, one of Europe's most popular festivals, attracts
hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. The celebrations were
made world famous by Ernest Hemingway's 1927 novel ``The Sun Also
Rises.''

U.S. hopeful of ratification of military agreement with Philippines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The chief of the U.S. Pacific Command
said Friday he expects the Philippine Senate will approve an
agreement allowing a resumption of joint military exercises in the
country.
	   Adm. Joseph Prueher said military cooperation with the
Philippines is declining because of the delay in the ratification
of the Visiting Force Agreement completed earlier this year.
	   ``I am very hopeful that they will approve the ratification,''
Prueher said.
	   The United States halted all joint exercises on Philippine
territory and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996, when
the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S.
military personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes
committed here.
	   Other countries, including Britain and Singapore, also suspended
military exercises with the Philippines because of a lack of legal
protection for their troops.
	   Under the agreement, the United States has jurisdiction over
American troops who commit crimes while on duty. American personnel
who violate Philippine laws while off duty would be subject to
prosecution by Philippine authorities.
	   The two countries used to conduct between six and eight military
exercises a year, involving up to 3,000 U.S. troops at a time. The
exercises became less frequent after the Philippine Senate refused
to extend the lease of the last U.S. military base in 1991.
	   Prueher spoke with reporters after talks with Philippine
military Chief of Staff Gen. Joselin Nazareno at their annual
Mutual Defense Board meeting.
	   Similar pacts have been widely criticized in several Asian
countries because of difficulties local officials have had in
prosecuting U.S. soldiers who committed serious crimes.
	   About 30 members of the left-wing Movement for National
Democracy picketed the military camp where Prueher and Nazareno
held their meeting and called for the rejection of the agreement.
	   The agreement would mean allowing ``American forces free reign,
access and movement around the country, surrendering the authority
of our laws and our constitution in favor of foreign interests,''
they said in a statement.
	   Newly appointed Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who as a
senator in 1991 voted against U.S. bases, now supports the new
agreement.
	   ``As a small armed force, we need these exercises,'' Mercado
said. ``We need to be able to upgrade our capability and our
readiness.''
	   Prueher said the United States has been providing all
information available on toxic wastes at its former bases in the
Philippines and that discussions on the problem between the two
sides are continuing.
	   ``But from the military point of view, we have not formulated a
game plan on dealing with the toxic waste situation, though it
continues to be one that we watch and we know that it's a very
important issue,'' Prueher said.
	   Filipino environmentalists have demanded that the United States
pay for the clean up of the toxic wastes, which have contaminated
water sources and the soil in several areas of the former Subic and
Clark bases north of Manila.

	   MARAWI, Philippines (AP) _ Two men were killed and four others
critically wounded when a grenade they were playing with during a
drinking spree accidentally dropped early Friday, police said.
	   Police chief Macadatu Ayaon said the blast occurred before dawn
in Marawi City in Lanao del Sur province, about 810 kilometers (505
miles) south of Manila.
	   Ayaon said the intoxicated men were tinkering with the grenade,
which had been purchased for the bargain price of 50 pesos (dlrs
1.20), when it slipped from the hand of one of the men and
exploded.

Ukraine's president urges parliament to approve revised 1998
</HEADLINE>
budget &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma asked
parliament on Friday to approve a revised 1998 budget draft before
lawmakers leave for their summer recess next week.
	   In his appeal to Verkhovna Rada, Kuchma voiced hope that
deputies would treat his request ``with understanding'' and approve
the new spending plan, which would slash spending and lower the
deficit.
	   The cabinet approved the revised 1998 budget earlier this month.
It would bring the deficit down to 2.3 percent of gross domestic
product.
	   Kuchma ordered the cuts after the government found it difficult
early this year to raise enough money to finance the previous
deficit of 3.3 percent of GDP. It blamed poor revenue collection
and a slump in financial markets.
	   Kuchma's message to the Rada cited a ``sharp aggravation of the
payments' crisis, an increase in wage debts and in the country's
foreign and domestic debt,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Parliament so far has failed to address the budget cut issue, as
it was preoccupied with the long process of electing a speaker that
only ended this week following some 20 failed votes.
	   The newly elected leftist speaker, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has
indicated that the lawmakers might approve the government's revised
spending plan before they leave for summer vacations on July 17.
	   ``The new budget deficit figure is acceptable,'' Tkachenko told
reporters.
	   However, it might still be difficult for the government to push
the new budget through the legislature, since parliament's largest
communist faction is known to oppose the measure.
	   Failure to approve the revised budget may in turn obstruct
Ukraine's plans to receive a dlrs 2.5 billion loan from the
International Monetary Fund this year. The decrease in the budget
deficit was a key condition set by the IMF for disbursing the loan.
	   In another development that might also complicate Ukraine's
talks with the IMF, the government failed to keep the budget
deficit in the first half of 1998 within the limits set by the
lending agency.
	   The deficit amounted to 2.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.1 billion) as
of July 1, which is 203 million hryvna (dlrs 102 million) more than
the IMF's target, according to Interfax.

Aftershocks shake Azores Islands as quake clean-up begins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HORTA, Azores (AP) _ Some 1,700 minor aftershocks rumbled
through Portugal's Azores Islands in the Atlantic Ocean overnight
after a 5.8-magnitude quake killed eight people and left about
1,500 homeless, officials said Friday.
	   The aftershocks caused no injuries or damage, according to
officials.
	   Emergency services and local people began removing rubble and
repairing infrastructure on Faial, the hardest-hit of the
archipelago's nine volcanic islands.
	   ``We're cleaning up now,'' said Helena Vaz, spokeswoman for the
Azores Civil Protection Service. ``The homeless people are in army
tents and we're getting back to normal.''
	   Authorities said about 500 houses were destroyed on Faial in
Thursday's quake. Damage was estimated at 12 billion escudos (dlrs
64 million).
	   Vaz said eight people were killed in rural villages on the
island's eastern coast, the area nearest to the epicenter which was
15 kilometers (nine miles) away, at sea. The dead included a
seven-month-old baby and four people aged between 82 and 90 years,
Vaz said.
	   Emergency aid flown in from the Portuguese mainland, 1,200
kilometers (800 miles) to the east, was being distributed to the
island's 5,000 inhabitants.
	   Visiting the island Thursday, Prime Minister Antonio Guterres
said he was ``deeply moved'' by the scenes of destruction and
distraught local people.
	   The archipelago has a total population of about 250,000, most of
whom make their living from agriculture and fishing.

Two Japanese boats detained in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Border guards in Russia's Far East detained two
Japanese boats in unrelated incidents on Friday, a news agency
reported.
	   A Japanese trawler that didn't have a fishing permit was stopped
off of Tanfilyev Island, part of the Kuril Island chain. Russian
officials seized the boat for further investigation, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Border guards also detained a Japanese yacht carrying two crew
members that had sailed into waters near the Primorye territory
without permission. The yacht was going to the port city of
Vladivostok for an international regatta, Interfax said.
	   Russian officials frequently stop Japanese boats in Russia's Far
East, where the two countries have a territorial dispute over the
Kuril Islands that dates back a half-century.
	   Russia and Japan have never signed a peace treaty ending World
War II hostilities because Soviet troops seized four islands at the
end of the war. Japan has demanded their return.

A day before Berlin's Love Parade, court orders trash cans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Needed: dozens of trash cans, fast.
	   A day before 1 million techno music fans were expected in Berlin
for the 10th annual Love Parade, a court ordered the organizers
Friday to set up trash cans for the tons of garbage the partiers
are expected to leave behind.
	   Planetcom, which runs the parade, argued it was not responsible
for the trash because the parade, this year with the motto ``One
World, One Future,'' is registered with the city as a political
demonstration rather than a commercial event.
	   In addition, they said the cans would pose a safety risk because
parade-goers have shown a tendency in past years to climb on
anything for a better view, from street lamps to portable toilets.
	   The administrative court agreed the parade was a demo, ``despite
certain doubts,'' but said that didn't mean that absolutely no
conditions could be placed on them.
	   It ordered trash cans be set up at 50 meter (yard) intervals
along the 4-kilometer (2.5 mile) parade route to make the cleanup
easier. As a last resort, it suggested Planetcom could post people
next to the receptacles to make sure people stayed off them.
	   The parade spokesman, who goes by the name Disko, said they
would comply with the court's order, but predicted it would not
solve the problem.
	   ``Expectations are that most of the containers will be
destroyed'' by the crush of people,'' he said.
	   Last year, city officials picked up 264 tons of trash, mostly
drink cans and bottles.

Mounting losses for cargo handler; government to start

investigation &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: ADDS daily loss for cargo handler in graf 9 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Under increasing pressure over the worsening
cargo situation at the new airport, the government announced Friday
that an independent body would be set up to find out what went
wrong and who's to blame.
	   The move came after Chek Lap Kok's main cargo handler announced
a temporary halt on nearly all cargo shipments. Merchants were
suffering because of the cargo problems.
	   Chief Secretary Anson Chan, Hong Kong's top civil servant, said
the government would appoint two outside experts and an influential
figure from Hong Kong ``to establish what went wrong and where the
responsibility lies.'' The names of the commission members will be
announced later.
	   Problems started with the opening Monday of the territory's new
dlrs 20 billion airport, located on an outlying island about 30
kilometers (22 miles) west of the city center.
	   While passenger services have improved slowly but steadily after
a rocky start, it has become increasingly clear that the cargo
operation was not ready for the move from old, downtown Kai Tak
airport.
	   After shifting some operations back to Kai Tak and placing a
temporary embargo on some shipments, the main cargo handler, Hong
Kong Air Cargo Terminals, took more drastic action overnight.
	   The government said the handler had informed officials it was
halting nearly all cargo shipments through Hong Kong for nine days,
except for a few items including in-bound perishables, newspapers
and magazines, and lifesaving materials.
	   Anthony Charter, the main cargo handler's managing director,
said the embargo was needed to solve software and mechanical
problems.
	   He told reporters later Friday that the embargo will cost the
firm 5 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs. 641,000) a day. The
company handles 5,000 tons of freight daily, worth 1.7 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 217 million).
	   James Tien, chairman of Hong Kong's General Chamber of Commerce,
told Hong Kong radio that businessmen appreciated the cargo handler
giving a firm reopening date.
	   He also raised the pressure on Chan and Hong Kong Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa. The airport problems ``prompted investors
around the world to question the government's ability to administer
Hong Kong,'' Tien said.
	   He said he was surprised that neither Tung nor Chan had been to
the airport to show their concern. Chan was there when it opened
Monday morning.
	   On Friday morning, only one of 12 seafood stalls was open in one
of the markets in the tourist and shopping district of Tsimshatsui,
and that was only selling local fish.
	   Other stalls were hosed clean, their walk-in refrigerators
locked, garbage removed, and lights switched off. Where some of
Hong Kong's top chefs and discriminating housewives shopped for
fresh Norwegian salmon, Japanese tuna, and Australian oysters, less
than a handful of buyers were choosing only among the local fish.
	   Sandy Kwong, who sells U.S. cherries, New Zealand kiwis, and
Philippine mangoes at the same market, reported big losses due to
the disruption in cargo handling.
	   ``The system at the new airport is very disorganized,'' Kwong
said. ``If you want to order fresh artichokes now, you have to tell
me three days in advance.''
	   Hong Kong is one of the busiest air cargo centers in the world,
and the Tsimshatsui market one of the more impressive wholesalers
in the territory.
	   Although prices seemed stable, many flower vendors at the
Tsimshatsui market were eager to sell the few lilies and roses from
Holland _ wilting in the heat and brown at the edges _ that they
had left.
	   The Hong Kong Standard newspaper estimated the ban would cost
the territory at least 23 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 2.97
billion).
	   The government said it was ``gravely concerned'' that the
moratorium was necessary. ``This would clearly disrupt trade and
impact adversely on our economic performance in the short term,''
it said.

Australia ratifies Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia Friday ratified the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, becoming the 15th nation to
do so, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said.
	   ``It marks a watershed in international efforts to address the
global threat posed by nuclear weapons proliferation and is an
indispensable component of the international nuclear arms control
regime,'' Downer said.
	   The importance of the treaty had been highlighted by the recent
spate of nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
	   ``The government strongly condemned India's and Pakistan's
actions, which are in flagrant defiance of international
nonproliferation norms and have serious implications for global and
regional security.
	   ``I call again on both India and Pakistan to sign and ratify the
CTBT without conditions or further delay.''
	   Almost 150 countries have signed the treaty _ including all five
of the world's declared nuclear powers _ but it will not come into
effect until it is ratified by 44 of those nations.
	   Australia would now encourage other countries, especially those
in the Asia-Pacific region, to ratify the treaty so it could come
into effect as soon as possible, Downer said.

	   SHENZHEN, China (AP) _ China has undergone an economic
revolution in the past 20 years, and all of it _ from consumerism
to a building boom to great disparities in wealth _ is on display
here, just across the border from Hong Kong.
	   Two decades ago, Shenzhen was little more than a tightly
controlled rural border crossing. Today, its skyscrapers aspire to
rival those of Hong Kong. So does its consumer class.
	   Since it was declared a Special Economic Zone, one of the focal
spots of China's economic transformation, Shenzhen has drawn
several million people. They came seeking factory jobs that paid a
bit better, provided better conditions and offered hope for a
better life than they lived in the interior provinces they left
behind.
	   Now Shenzhen is moving on, outgrowing the factories that are
heading farther inland and turning into a business and commerce
center.
	   Members of an increasingly prosperous class make their money
running factories and services, shop in malls stuffed with consumer
goods and have money to spend on air conditioners to cool southern
China's steamy days. Prostitution and crime flourish.
	   Even families squeezed into one-room apartments have a bit more
money than average Chinese. In the shadow of Shenzhen's new
skyscrapers, they too can contemplate buying anything from lingerie
to electronics in the numerous open markets.
	   People still stream in from the provinces, but it is becoming
harder for the unskilled to find work. Many end up scanning job
postings around town, but those notices are as likely to be for
computer programmers as for factory workers.
	   Some people become beggars, a common sight on the streets today.
Others don't make it at all; after a time, they turn around and go
home.

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Blind rage over the death of political
prisoner Moshood Abiola may be turning more calculated, pitting
Nigeria's ethnic rivals against one another in a deadly, but
ages-old, battle. For the third day straight, outraged youths
stormed through the streets on Friday in parts of Nigeria's
commercial capital of Lagos, setting fires, smashing windows and
blocking roads. The bodies of nine people from the northern Hausa
ethnic group that were discovered in various parts of a
predominantly southern Yoruba neighborhood indicated the violence
may not be random. (NIGERIA)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Leaders of Northern Ireland's
new Assembly sought Friday to drum up support for compromise over a
blocked Protestant march, but a spokesman for the Orange Order said
he feared the impasse would lead to a lethal clash pitting
Protestant hard-liners against police and soldiers. Four police
officers were hospitalized Friday morning after surgery for
injuries from bomb shrapnel and a fifth was admitted after being
hit by ball bearings fired from a crowd of 20,000 or more massed
near a rural church outside Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest
of Belfast. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ At least two people died in border
clashes Friday between Albanian arms smugglers and the Yugoslav
army, Serbs reported. Tensions worsened in a village in central
Kosovo province, with hundreds of armed Albanians dug in against an
anticipated Serb attack. The deaths, reported by the pro-government
Serbian Information Center, occurred near the village of Vrbnica,
about 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Pristina along Kosovo's
border with Albania. Serb soldiers seized large quantities of arms
and ammunition after exchanging fire with ethnic Albanian gunmen,
the center said. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Support for democratic change
intensified within the ranks of Indonesia's biggest political
organization Friday when a growing number of its officials said
they would back an ally of reformist President B.J. Habibie as new
party chief. A three-day special congress of the Golkar party, once
the tool of autocratic ex-President Suharto, is scheduled to end
Saturday when 27 officials from each of Indonesia's provinces vote
for a new party chairman. The official Antara news agency quoted 11
representatives as saying they would back Akbar Tanjung, who is
state secretary in Habibie's Cabinet and his choice for the party
job. (INDONESIA-PARTY CONGRESS)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's prime minister said Friday he
looks forward to meeting with his Pakistani counterpart later this
month to discuss the issues over which they fought two wars and
launched a nuclear arms race. ``India and Pakistan have to live
together. We can't change the geography and will have to live like
good neighbors,'' United News of India news agency quoted Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as telling Parliament. Vajpayee and
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will meet in the Sri Lankan
capital, Colombo, during a regular summit of a seven-nation
regional group. Vajpayee said India is prepared for talks with
Pakistan _ without the involvement of any other nation _ in
resolving their disputes, chiefly their competing claims to the
Himalayan state of Kashmir. (INDIA-NUCLEAR)

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week lower
Friday, with the key index in Kuala Lumpur tumbling 4.3 percent to
a nine-year low, on fears of more corporate failures in Malaysia.
The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index, which tracks
share prices of 100 key stocks, fell 19.27 points to 428.62. The
slump followed news that MBf Holdings, which controls Malaysia's
largest finance company, has sought court protection from its
creditors. Traders said Malaysian investors' confidence was also
shaken by uncertainty over the outcome of the parliamentary
election in Japan on Sunday. South Korea shares also closed sharply
lower, with the main index losing 3.1 percent, on concerns over
labor unrest in the country. In an unusual display of solidarity,
South Korea's two leading labor groups said Friday they would
jointly stage a nationwide strike next week to protest spreading
layoffs. (ASIA-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's financial crisis has sparked an increase
in ``social tension'' and the government needs to swiftly implement
its economic stabilization package, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
told parliament Friday. With economic problems mounting, the
Russian government is seeking parliament's approval for a series of
new tax laws and it also wants dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in
fresh loans from the International Monetary Fund and other lenders.
Kiriyenko, who has been battling a series of economic problems
since he took over as prime minister in March, painted a bleak
picture of Russia's financial climate in his address to
parliament's upper house, the Federation Council. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In an unusual display of solidarity,
South Korea's two leading labor groups said Friday they would
jointly stage a nationwide strike next week to protest spreading
layoffs. The two rival groups also said they will boycott talks
with government and management officials until they get firm
guarantees of job security for workers at banks and state-owned
firms to be merged or closed. ``The government-sponsored labor
talks have become meaningless,'' the mainstream Federation of
Korean Trade Unions and the maverick Korean Confederation of Trade
Unions said in a joint statement. The two groups were forced to
join hands after their key unions in the car and banking industries
faced mass layoffs under the government's ongoing plans to
restructure its battered economy. (SKOREA-LABOR)
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Its economy slowing, Vietnam is making a
push to join the World Trade Organization with promises to speed up
reform, cut red tape and write clear rules. After hearing similar
vows many times before, investors and diplomats are waiting to see
if the government will back talk with action this time. Vietnam was
not hit initially as hard as many of its neighbors by the Asian
financial crisis. But the fallout is slowly battering the country
and exposing its weaknesses, forcing top officials to be more
pragmatic. Exports are shrinking, foreign investors are committing
less money than last year and unemployment is rising, along with
pressure to devalue the dong. (VIETNAM-ECONOMY)
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German carmaker BMW and Italy's Fiat
denied British reports Friday that they were discussing forming a
strategic alliance. ``It's complete rubbish,'' said BMW spokesman
Juerg Dinner. A Fiat spokesman in Turin also denied the report.
British media reports said the two carmakers had been holding talks
at the highest levels for weeks, in response to the growing
consolidation in the automotive industry. But BMW denied there were
any talks at all. (GERMANY-BMW-FIAT)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The government of President Joseph
Estrada will not settle the numerous criminal and civil suits
against the family of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos for less
than 75 percent of his dlrs 540 million Swiss bank deposits, a
senior official said Friday. Presidential Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora said the Marcos family has expressed privately that
``they are amicable to a settlement.'' On Thursday, Zamora
indicated that the Estrada administration was more inclined to
favor an out-of-court settlement with the Marcoses and their
associates because years of legal battles to recover their alleged
ill-gotten wealth have yielded little. The Marcos Swiss accounts
have been transferred to a Philippine bank. The money is to be
released to the Philippine government if it wins a conviction
against Marcos' widow, Imelda. (PHILIPPINES-MARCOS WEALTH)

prisoner Moshood Abiola may be turning more calculated, pitting
Nigeria's ethnic rivals against one another in a deadly, but

southerners from the Yoruba ethnic group.
	   The death of Abiola _ a Yoruba and the apparent winner of
annulled presidential elections in 1993 _ has infuriated his
supporters who say the northern- and Hausa-dominated military is to
blame.
	   Riot police and paramilitary troops have been ordered to protect
Muslim mosques in Lagos, which could be a target for attacks by the
predominantly Christian and animist southerners.

when violence first broke out in Lagos, police say.

Ko leads in Toyo Suisan Ladies Hokkaido
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITA-HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Ko Woo-soon, inspired by her South
Korean compatriot Se Ri Pak's victory in the U.S. Women's Open,
shot a 6-under-par 66 Friday and took a one-stroke lead in the
opening round of the Toyo Suisan Ladies Hokkaido.
	   Ko, a regular on the Japan tour, started her bogey-free round
with three straight birdies and then sank three more birdies,
one-putting 10 holes over the 6,412-yard (5,835-meter), par-72
Kosaido Sapporo Country Club in northern Japan.
	   ``Throughout the round, I played remembering the image of Se Ri
Pak's game,'' Ko said, referring to the 20-year-old who won in the
first sudden death of in the U.S. Women's Open Monday.
	   ``I beat her once, stopping her from winning the Korean LPGA
Championship for the fourth straight year in 1996,'' said the
34-year-old Ko, in contention for her first victory of the season
and sixth overall in Japan.
	   ``Pak was my playing partner in the third and the fourth rounds
in that championship,'' Ko Said. ``At that time I knew she would
become one of the world's top players one of these days. Her
mentality seemed to be as mature as that of a 50-year-old player.''
	   Ko said she won that championship with an 11-under total,
followed by Pak's 6-under.
	   ``I cried with joy when I watched Pak's victory on the
television,'' Ko added.
	   Kumiko Hiyoshi shot a 67, followed by Tatsuko Morimoto's 68.
	   Veteran Nayoko Yoshikawa, Kayo Yamada and Michie Oba were
another stroke back at 69.

Gold mines denies it benefited from corruption during Suharto era
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The operator of a huge gold and copper
mine in western New Guinea Friday denied claims that it had
benefited from corruption, collusion and cronyism under the regime
of former President Suharto.
	   ``We are not bending the rules. We are not trying to exploit,''
Adrianto Macribie, Freeport Indonesia's president-director told a
news conference.
	   Freeport Indonesia is a unit of New Orleans-based
Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc.
	   Suharto quit on May 21 after a wave of riots and protests
against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Opponents of the former leader allege he used his position to
enrich his family. New President B.J. Habibie has ordered an
investigation into corruption during the Suharto era.
	   Freeport Indonesia, which pays Indonesia's largest tax bill and
has been active in Irian Jaya since the 1960s, has long been dogged
by controversy and allegations of collusion with Suharto.
	   The company operates the world's single largest copper and gold
deposit mine in mineral-rich Irian Jaya.
	   It has also been criticized by international and Indonesian
groups for allegedly mistreating indigenous peoples and the
environment, charges the company vehemently denies. Freeport's
chairman, James Moffett, is an old and close friend of Suharto's.
	   Freeport McMoRan owns 81.28 percent of Freeport Indonesia and
the Indonesian government owns 9.36 percent of the company. A
minority stake in the company is controlled by a charitable
foundation headed by Suharto.
	   Several foundations run by Suharto are now being investigated
for corruption, despite denials by the ex-president of any
wrongdoing.
	   Collusion allegations were further fueled in December when
Freeport Indonesia was granted government approval to nearly triple
the capacity at the mine. Critics charge the close links between
Freeport and Suharto explain why the expansion went through without
a hitch.
	   Freeport says it prepared extensive environmental impact studies
to earn the approval, however. It also repeatedly points to its
contribution to Indonesia - and to Irian Jaya in particular - as
well as to the fact that it has to comply with U.S. investment law,
as evidence that its business dealings are entirely above board.
	   Adrianto said the company's operations haven't been affected by
the change of government in Indonesia, despite its perceived links
with the former president.
	   ``I don't see that the rules of the game have changed,'' he
said. ``The rules operating our business, and many others haven't
changed.''
	   He said the company was eager to counter any claims to the
contrary. ``We're only trying to set the record straight because so
many things have been published in the past based on erroneous
facts,'' he said.

Four children killed by explosives in one week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)- Mines and other explosives left
strewn over Bosnia in wake of its war have killed four children in
a week, the worst toll this year, the United Nations said on
Friday.
	   The youngest victim was a 3-year old, killed with his 7-year-old
brother when a hand grenade they were playing with exploded, said
U.N. spokesman Andrea Agneli. Two of the deadly explosions occurred
at Gracanica, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Tuzla.
	   The U.N. Mine Action Center says more than 1,000 people have
been killed or injured by mines and other explosives in the
aftermath of the Bosnian war.
	   The Center estimates that about three million mines were planted
before the war ended in 1995. Only about 50,000 have been removed
or made harmless in the past two years.

Germany expands border guards' authority to search without
</HEADLINE>
suspicion &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Border guards searching for illegal
immigrants may check people's identity papers on any train and at
any station or airport _ even without any firm suspicions, under a
law passed by parliament's upper house Friday.
	   Previously, guards could check someone's identity papers only if
they had reason to suspect he or she entered Germany illegally, or
if the person was still within 30 kilometers (20 miles) of the
border.
	   Germany's major political parties said the legislation, already
passed by the lower house, was needed to boost security now that
many European Union nations have eliminated border controls with
neighboring EU countries.
	   The upper house, or Bundesrat, passed the law by a wide margin
during its last session Friday before its summer break.
	   The chamber also gave its expected approval for other
legislation already passed by the lower house, including a bill to
curtail welfare payments for certain refugees, and another to set
up a database of DNA from convicted criminals.

Thailand tries applying ISO standards to education
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand hopes to improve the quality
of its school system by applying the same system of independently
audited standards that has become widely used in business and
industry, an education ministry official said Friday.
	   A pilot project to apply ISO 9002 standards to 18 schools around
the country was begun in February and could be applied to all
schools by 2002 if successful, said Vipark Rojanapattaya, an expert
at the ministry's General Education Department.
	   In November, the initial results will be reviewed, he said.
	   The International Organization for Standardization _ ISO _ is a
specialized international agency which sets internationally
accepted guidelines for quality assurance in a number of
industries.
	   ISO 9002 certification requires audits by third-party registrars
for continued compliance.
	   The pilot project begun in February is meant to boost parents'
confidence in the school's administration as well as ensure the
quality of education, said Vipark. Singapore is another Asian
country that applies ISO 9002 to its school system, he said.
	   ``School administration has never followed a specific model,''
said Vipark. ``If we create a clear model with regular checking and
improvement, it will result in a good education.''
	   TISO, the Thai International Standards Organization, is expected
to inspect and issue certification to schools that meet the
standard.

Bulgaria won't close controversial reactors, premier says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria will not close four
controversial reactors at its only nuclear plant despite western
pressure, the prime minister said Friday.
	   Ivan Kostov told lawmakers Bulgaria would rather improve the
reactors' safety to use them until the expiry of their
technological lifespans between 2005 and 2012.
	   ``Our power engineering strategy for the next three years
doesn't envisage shutdowns of nuclear reactors,'' Kostov said
answering to a lawmaker's question.
	   Bulgaria wants to review a 1993 agreement with the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development under which it must close the
four reactors this year in exchange of dlrs 26 million the bank has
lent for short-term safety improvements at the plant.
	   The units in question are four Soviet designed 440-megawatt
pressurized-water reactors without safety encasements, installed
between 1974 to 1982 at the Kozlodui plant.
	   The plant, 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Sofia has also
two newer 1,000 megawatt units with encasements.
	   The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency has long
described the four older units as safety risk.
	   Bulgaria has invested over dlrs 100 million to upgrade the
reactors' safety systems and repeatedly balked at calls from the
West to close them down.
	   The plant provides some 40 percent of the country's electricity.

Kohl talks with Yeltsin, Clinton about conflict in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl spoke by telephone
to Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Friday and to U.S. President
Bill Clinton on Wednesday about the crisis in the Serb-led
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo.
	   Kohl also discussed Russia's economic situation with the two
leaders.
	   ``It was agreed to maintain close co-ordination over both
issues,'' a spokesman said Friday at the government's regular press
conference. He declined to give more details.
	   After meeting in Bonn on Wednesday, the six-nation Contact Group
on the Balkans _ with diplomats from Germany, the United States,
Russia, France, Britain and Italy _ demanded an immediate ceasefire
in the rebellious Kosovo province.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and independence-seeking ethnic
Albanian rebels has killed hundreds of people since February, and
the major powers fear a continuation of violence could disrupt
neighboring countries with large Albanian populations.
	   Kohl's spokesman stressed there was ``no link'' between German
support for Russia in its economic upheaval and Russia's policy
towards the Kosovo. Russia, a longtime ally of Yugoslavia, opposes
outside military intervention in Kosovo.

Faldo recovery is a race against time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Nick Faldo will travel with the
European tour's medical team for intensive treatment to his injured
elbow in a bid to be fit for the British Open next week.
	   The three-time British Open titlist withdrew from the Loch
Lomond tournament Wednesday after aggrevating an elbow injury in
practise and is desperately trying to recover for the Royal
Birkdale event.
	   Faldo, who has not missed a British Open since his debut in
1976, suffered a condition called ``golfer's elbow'' and is
receiving treatment from the tour's physiotherapy unit.
	   Tour physio Guy Delacave said Faldo's treatment was continuing
in Scotland and would continue when he arrived at Birkdale on
Sunday.
	   In the meantime, the 40-year-old is receiving regular
ultra-sound, electrotherapy and ice treatment and is wearing a
fibreglass cast to aid the healing process.
	   Practise has been ruled out, further reducing his preparation
for the major.
	   Faldo said he felt twinges in the elbow over the past month but
felt a ``boom'' when he was practising before the first round at
Loch Lomond.
	   He is expected to leave a decision on his fitness for the
British Open until as late as possible.

Australian meat to save Indonesian tigers starving because of
</HEADLINE>
financial crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian zoos will fund an
emergency shipment of 16 (metric) tons of meat to feed 70 tigers at
an Indonesian zoo which are starving because of the Asian financial
crisis, a spokeswoman said Friday.
	   The Taman Safari Indonesia usually buys its meat supplies from
Australia, but the devaluation of the Indonesian currency and a
drop in tourist numbers has left it struggling to feed its animals,
the Australian Broadcasting Corp. has reported.
	   The Australasian Regional Association of Zoological Parks and
Aquaria, the organization representing all of Australia's public
zoos, will send the 16 ton shipment to Indonesia on July 17,
spokeswoman Judith Ainsworth Henke said.
	   A smaller shipment, bought with a flood on donations from
Australians after the tigers' plight was broadcast on television
last week, will be sent sooner to sustain the safari park's 45
Bengal and 25 Sumatran Tigers.
	   The normal zoo diet for big cats consist of one or two ``starve
days'' between feeds, to mimic natural hunting patterns, Ainsworth
Henke said.
	   She said the Indonesian tigers were very stressed, existing on
three starve days a week and the bare minimum on feed days.
	   Fewer than 500 Sumatran tigers are believed to survive in their
native Indonesian habitat.
	   Melbourne Zoo's director Leo Oosterweghel said the zoo was
working with other major Australasian zoos on a breeding program
for Sumatran Tigers.
	   ``It's important to provide this immediate assistance to the
tigers at Taman Safari,'' he said. ``Other major zoos around the
world are also participating in this emergency effort.''

Iron Age tombs found in northern Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Archeologists excavating an ancient
settlement in northern Greece have discovered a major burial ground
containing about 1,000 tombs, an expert said Friday.
	   The size of the site and the wide variety of artifacts could
offer researchers important insights into village life during the
Iron Age in the 6th or 7th centuries BC.
	   ``We did not know that this particular cemetery existed,''
Vassiliki Misailides, an archeologist working at the site in Nea
Philadelphia, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Salonica.
	   The tombs, first identified last year, contain copper, iron and
some gold jewelry and daggers alongside the skeletons.
	   ``The tombs were very organized. People were buried side by side
and there are very clear boundaries between each tomb,'' Misailides
said.
	   The skeletons will be studied by anthropologists and at the
archeological museum in Salonica.

BMW, Fiat deny they're talking about alliance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background on BMW attempt to buy Rolls-Royce, announcing
end to engine deliveries &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German carmaker BMW and Italy's Fiat
denied British reports Friday that they were discussing forming a
strategic alliance.
	   ``It's complete rubbish,'' said BMW spokesman Juerg Dinner. A
Fiat spokesman in Turin also denied the report.
	   British media reports said the two carmakers had been holding
talks at the highest levels for weeks, in response to the growing
consolidation in the automotive industry.
	   But BMW denied there were any talks at all.
	   BMW recently was outbid by rival Volkswagen in its attempt to
buy Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of Britain from Vickers PLC.
	   On Thursday, BMW said it will stop delivery of motors and all
other auto components to Rolls Royce on July 9, 1999, in accordance
with its contract.
	   BMW supplies German-built BMW engines to the current range of
Rolls-Royce and Bentley automobiles. In bidding to buy the company,
BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder had repeatedly said the group
would pull out of the engine-supply contract at short notice if it
lost.
	   However, VW's acquisition of Vickers' Cosworth high-performance
engine maker will secure some engine supplies for Rolls-Royce cars,
because Cosworth already delivers engines for the latest Bentley
model. The Cosworth deal is expected to be finalized this month.
	   Also, VW has indicated it will extend Cosworth's product range
to cover other Rolls models.

Big powers say Kosovo should have autonomy, not independence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The United States and European nations trying to
stop the fighting in Serbia's Kosovo province have agreed that
Kosovo should have a significant degree of autonomy _ but not
independence, British officials said Friday.
	   The six-nation Contact Group that coordinates international
policy in the Balkans set out a number of principles that could
form part of a blueprint for resolving the question of Kosovo's
status at what British officials described as a ``difficult''
meeting in Bonn, Germany, on Wednesday.
	   One principle states that all citizens _ 90 percent are ethnic
Albanians _ should be able to exercise their democratic rights and
be represented at every level on government, the officials said,
speaking with customary anonymity.
	   Part of any settlement would also require a commitment that
neither Kosovo authorities nor Belgrade would seek to change the
territory's status unilaterally, the officials said.
	   Another principle states that there will be no change in the
national boundaries of Kosovo's neighbors, the spokesman said.
	   The Contact Group's backing for significant autonomy for Kosovo
will disappoint the increasing number of ethnic Albanian militants
fighting for independence.
	   In its final communique Wednesday, the group _ the United
States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia _ said it had
begun ``work to define possible further elements for the future
status of Kosovo.''
	   These new elements would be made available to authorities in
Belgrade and leaders of the Kosovo Albanian community ``for a
dialogue with international involvement,'' the group said.
	   British officials said the possibility of making Kosovo a
separate republic within Yugoslavia has been floated. That would
put Kosovo on a par with Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics
that currently make up Yugoslavia.
	   The possibility of a constitution for Kosovo that would give the
province significant legislative, executive and judicial powers,
including local control of policing, was also raised, the officials
said.
	   The Contact Group demanded an immediate cease-fire in Kosovo,
where clashes between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian
militants have grown increasingly violent since late February,
resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people and forcing thousands
of others to flee.
	   For the first time, the group also called on governments to
crack down on the flow of funds to ethnic Albanian rebels, and
warned that sanctions could be applied to militants of the Kosovo
Liberation Army if they stand in the way of a resumption of
negotiations.
	   British officials said there was ``a wide range of opinion''
during the Contact Group meeting on whether to involve the KLA in
negotiations and, if so, how to involve it. There also were
differences on how to deal with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, the officials said.
	   Russia has strong ethnic and religious ties to Yugoslavia, and
Moscow has opposed sanctions against Belgrade imposed by the
Contact Group.

US Fed chairman Greenspan to meet Bank of Japan governor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will
meet his Japanese counterpart Masaru Hayami Monday in Tokyo,
Japan's central bank said Friday.
	   Greenspan will be in Tokyo to attend a monthly meeting of the
Bank for International Settlements, hosted by the Japanese central
bank.
	   On Tuesday, Greenspan will meet with Japan's Finance Minister
Hikaru Matsunaga, who is also scheduled to meet with German
Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer separately.
	   The monetary leaders are expected to focus on Japan's policy on
resolving its bad debt problems and revitalizing its financial
system.
	   Japan has been under increasing pressure from the United States
and other trading partners to get its economy in order and create a
market for goods from other troubled Asian neighbors.
	   Last week, Japan announced a plan for a ``bridge bank,'' a
scheme modeled after the U.S. bailout strategy for savings and loan
institutions in the 1980s, designed to keep credit flowing to
healthy corporate borrowers as the government takes over insolvent
banks.
	   On Wednesday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto gave his first
clear indication that he will seek permanent tax cuts to revive
Japan's recession-bound economy.

Aftershocks shake Azores Islands as quake clean-up begins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HORTA, Azores (AP) _ Some 1,700 minor aftershocks rumbled
through Portugal's Azores Islands in the Atlantic Ocean overnight
after a 5.8-magnitude quake that killed eight people and left about
1,500 homeless, officials said Friday.
	   The aftershocks caused no injuries or damage, according to
officials.
	   Emergency services and local people began removing rubble and
repairing infrastructure on Faial, the hardest-hit of the
archipelago's nine volcanic islands.
	   ``We're cleaning up now,'' said Helena Vaz, spokeswoman for the
Azores Civil Protection Service. ``The homeless people are in army
tents and we're getting back to normal.''
	   Authorities said about 500 houses were destroyed on Faial in
Thursday's quake. Damage was estimated at 12 billion escudos (dlrs
64 million).
	   Vaz said eight people were killed in rural villages on the
island's eastern coast, the area nearest to the epicenter which was
15 kilometers (nine miles) away, at sea. The dead included a
seven-month-old baby and four people aged between 82 and 90 years,
Vaz said.
	   Emergency aid flown in from the Portuguese mainland, 1,200
kilometers (800 miles) to the east, was being distributed to the
island's 5,000 inhabitants.
	   Visiting the island Thursday, Prime Minister Antonio Guterres
said he was ``deeply moved'' by the scenes of destruction and
distraught local people.
	   About 250,000 live in the archipelago, most of whom make their
living from agriculture and fishing.

Finnair equips fleet with defibrillators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ The Finnish national carrier, Finnair,
announced Friday that it will put portable heart defibrillators on
its long-distance fleet by the end of the year.
	   Finnair is the first European airline to include such devices in
its aircraft.
	   ``The introduction of the device is necessary from a medical
point of view and economically the right thing to do,'' said
airline physician Pekka Oksanen.
	   The battery-operated device, manufactured by the Seattle-based
company Heartstream, weighs about 2 kg (4.5 lbs). It can be used to
monitor a patient's heart and can deliver an electrical shock to
restore heart rhythm.
	   The devices will be placed on Finnair's heavier fleet, four
MD-11s and four Boeing 757s.
	   Several U.S. airlines have introduced defibrillators this year.
Australian-based Qantas has carried the devices the longest, since
1991.
	   Finnair, founded in 1923, is one of the world's oldest airlines.
It flies to 70 destinations, including 40 in Europe.

Report: Israeli security fears attacks by Jewish extremists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's domestic security service has warned
that Jewish right-wing extremists may try to assassinate Israeli
officials if the government decides to hand over territory to the
Palestinians, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   In the past the Shin Bet security agency has warned that Jewish
hardliners might attack Palestinians in an attempt to block
implementation of peace accords, but this was the first time it has
predicted such attacks on Israelis, the daily Haaretz said.
	   In 1995, a right-wing Jewish extremist assassinated Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin after he signed the Oslo peace accords and
handed over almost all the cities in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip to Palestinian control.
	   If the long-delayed second Israeli troop redeployment in the
West Bank takes place, Israel will cede land surrounding Jewish
settlements to the Palestinian Authority.
	   The Shin Bet said this will be a much more painful process than
the withdrawal from Palestinian cities _ especially if it becomes
necessary to evacuate any settlements, increasing the chance of
armed resistance, the newspaper said.
	   In the wake of the Rabin assassination, the Shin Bet greatly
increased security around his successor Shimon Peres. In recent
months, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly received a
number of death threats from the extreme right.

German-Bosnian joint venture to conquer southeast Europe car market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Restoring a partnership put
on hold during the war, Volkswagen signed a joint-venture into life
on Friday with a Sarajevo company that will inject economic muscle
into the country's recovery.
	   ``This is one of the most significant projects that reached
post-war Bosnia,'' said Faruk Smailbegovic, general director of
UNIS-Holding, after signing the contract meant to ensure
first-phase production worth some 48 million German marks (dlrs
26.6 million).
	   The beginning of the war ended 20 years of Volkswagen production
in Bosnia. Like the new venture, the TAS factory _ another joint
company between the German auto maker and UNIS - was located in the
Sarajevo suburb of Vogosca.
	   The company hopes to sell 90 percent of its production in
southeastern Europe. Volkswagen will hold a 58 percent stake and
UNIS the remaining 42 percent.
	   The company is expected to assemble some 4,000 cars by the end
of 1998, with production steadily growing toward the year 2000.
	   Cars from another Volkswagen-owned company, Skoda, will
initially be assembled from parts shipped in from elsewhere in
Europe.
	   By 2001, Smailbegovic hopes the Vogosca factory and others in
Bosnia will enter full and independent production of Skoda vehicles
and parts and move into a second phase, worth up to 200 million
marks (dlrs 111 million).
	   The deal, expected to produce first vehicles by the end of
August, is one of the biggest steps forward in regenerating the
war-torn Bosnia economy. It initially provides for 100 jobs and up
to 1,500 in its final phase.
	   The production cost of cars produced in Vogosca will be 10
percent lower then the same cars produced elsewhere, Smailbegovic
said.
	   ``This contract will convince others in Germany to cooperate
with Bosnian companies,'' Smailbegovic said.

Bidding for Russian oil company extended until October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With investors pulling out of the Russian economy
for now, the government has extended until Oct. 27 the deadline for
bidding on the state-owned Rosneft oil company.
	   Rosneft is the largest oil company that has not been privatized,
but the country's financial crisis has scared away both local and
foreign investors.
	   The government canceled one attempt to sell the company earlier
this year when no one bid the minimum asking price of dlrs 2.1
billion for a 75 percent stake in the company.
	   The price was lowered to dlrs 1.6 billion in early June, but
there is still little interest. Officials say they will not drop
the price any further.
	   ``We decided to extend the deadline in order to sell Rosneft at
the planned price, since today, given the drop in world oil prices,
we can't get a good price for it,'' First Deputy State Property
Minister Alexander Braverman said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Last week Royal Dutch-Shell and British Petroleum said they were
no longer interested in Rosneft. Shell had been expected to bid for
the company with two Russian companies _ natural gas monopoly
Gazprom and oil giant Lukoil.

Indonesian opposition: Malaysia won't implode
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Indonesia's most outspoken
opposition leader Friday said Malaysia was unlikely to slip into
the kind of turmoil that gripped its southeastern neighbor
Indonesia.
	   ``There is corruption here and there. There is cronyism here and
there. But not as bad as Indonesia,'' said Amien Rais, 54, who was
in the forefront of the recent campaign to oust President Suharto.
	   Malaysia was lucky to have some control over its economy and its
currency, he said after separate meetings with Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``Indonesia is the sickest man in Asia. You (Malaysia) aren't
very healthy either,'' he told reporters. ``But at least you are
out of intensive care.''
	   Nearly 1,200 people were killed in riots over price increases in
Jakarta in May. The upheaval eventually led to Suharto's
resignation.
	   Rais said he had given Mahathir and Anwar his assessment of the
politician situation in Jakarta. ``We talked about similarities
between Indonesia and Malaysia.''
	   Rais, the leader of Muhammadiyah, a 28 million-member Islamic
group in Indonesia, is on a two day visit to Malaysia at the
invitation of a local volunteer group. He flies to Singapore
Saturday.
	   While both Malaysia and Indonesia are fighting the Asian
currency and stock market tumbles, leaders in Kuala Lumpur have
denied internal conditions in the two nations are similar.
	   Mahathir, 72, who has become Asia's longest-serving leader since
Suharto was forced out, has bristled at comparisons between his
rule and Suharto's. He has vehemently denied that corruption and
nepotism, the main charges against Suharto, were rampant in
Malaysia.
	   ``There is no nepotism and cronyism in Malaysia. Only foreigners
and the foreign media are making such allegations of nepotism and
cronyism,'' Mahathir said Thursday.
	   Speaking about Indonesia, Rais said: ``There is no element of
optimism on the horizon.'' Suharto's ouster was the first step of
the reform process that, he said, was not progressing under
President B.J. Habibie.
	   ``The reforms have a long way to go.''
	   While Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea appeared to be on the
road to recovery, Indonesia was sinking further, said the political
science professor who earned a doctorate at Chicago University.
	   ``Malaysia is fortunate that the Malaysian currency is not that
unstable (as the Indonesian rupiah),'' he said.

Disappointed parade characters suspending walkout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Mickey and Minnie are going back to work.
	   Disappointed by a lack of support from the government, parade
performers at Disneyland Paris said Friday they're suspending their
strike, which began more than two weeks ago.
	   ``We'll probably go back to work tomorrow,'' said striker
Giovanni Savoia, speaking in a telephone interview during a meeting
with fellow strikers. ``But we'll continue to fight from within. We
won't make it easy for the company.''
	   Basically, he said, the strikers needed the money, after no pay
for more than two weeks. Also, they were keenly disappointed by the
lack of support they got when they met Thursday afternoon with
Labor Ministry officials.
	   It wasn't clear exactly how many performers were on strike.
	   The performers said about 80 had walked off the job, but
management said it was only 40.
	   The huge theme park outside Paris is one of France's most
popular tourist attractions.
	   The performers, who gross around 7,000 francs a month (roughly
dlrs 1,200), want pay raises. But more broadly, they want to be
reclassified, to what translates as ``artists'' rather than
``extras.'' That would not only raise their pay but give them a
more prestigious status.
	   Euro Disney, which runs the park, has offered to give artist
status to those who successfully audition _ a proposal that the
performers have rejected, at least until now.
	   Company spokeswoman Isabelle Clap said Friday that Euro Disney
hadn't been officially informed that the workers are coming back.
	   But she said ``the door is always open,'' and that she expected
new talks soon.

EU mulls tighter visa restrictions on Belarus officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more details, CLARIFIES that EU has
already imposed some visa restrictions on Belarus officials &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union is considering
tighter visa restrictions to limit the movement of Belarusian
government officials, EU officials said Friday.
	   EU foreign ministers are expected to impose the tighter
restrictions when they meet Monday in Brussels. The EU has already
imposed curbs to prevent Belarusian government officials entering
the 15-nation Union on official business.
	   The restraints were in retaliation for orders from the
Belarusian government that several nations vacate ambassadors'
residences in a diplomatic compound in Minsk, the capital of
Belarus.
	   Tighter restrictions under consideration could prevent
Belarusian diplomats stationed in EU nations from moving from
country to country within bloc, EU officials said.
	   A French proposal for the EU to sever diplomatic relations with
Belarus had little support from other nations and would not be
adopted, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The Belarusian government says the foreign ambassadors have to
leave the diplomatic compound in Minsk so repairs can be made to
the plumbing. The ambassadors say the order for them to move out
violates international law.
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, Japan, Bulgaria and Poland have all left Minsk in
protest.
	   Last September, the EU halted most of its aid projects for
Belarus and froze preparations for a trade and cooperation
agreement in protest at the authoritarian rule of President
Alexander Lukashenko.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Heavy rainstorms accompanied by strong
winds damaged dozens of settlements across Ukraine over the past
two days, officials said Friday.
	   As many as 28 towns and villages were without electricity Friday
in the Odessa, Cherkasy and Lviv regions, the Emergency Situations
Ministry said.
	   Some 19 settlements were flooded and 7 bridges also were
destroyed in the western Lviv region, it said. In the Zakarpattya
region in the west, almost 800 houses were flooded, according to
the report.
	   Last month, rainstorms flooded nearly 200 settlements in western
Ukraine, damaging more than 5,600 houses and large agricultural
areas.

Esso begins production from new platform in South China Sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Esso Production Malaysia Inc., an
affiliate of Exxon Corporation, has begun production from an
unnamed platform 275 kilometers (165 miles) off the coast of
Trengganu in the South China Sea.
	   In a statement issued here Friday, EPMI said the platform called
Raya A was built at a cost of about dlrs 60 million.
	   EPMI, as operator, is developing the Raya field on behalf of
Petronas, Malaysia's national petroleum corporation, Petronas
Carigali Sdn Bhd and for itself. EPMI has an 80 percent share.
	   Raya A, is an unmanned satellite platform designed and
constructed by Malaysian companies, the statement said.
	   The first well was completed in early June.
	   Seven dual production wells are expected to be drilled on Raya
A, with a forecast peak production rate of 24 thousand barrels of
oil daily, anticipated in 1999, the statement said.
	   EPMI is a major crude oil producer in Malaysia with daily
production exceeding 300,000 barrels.
	   It is also a major supplier of natural gas to Peninsular
Malaysia, with production in excess of 900 million standard cubic
feet of gas per day.
	   EPMI has production sharing contracts with Petronas in five
areas offshore Trengganu, Peninsular Malaysia and currently
operates 30 platforms in 11 fields.

Russian prime minister says `social tension' rising

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's financial crisis has sparked an increase
in ``social tension'' and the government needs to swiftly implement
its economic stabilization package, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
told parliament Friday.
	   With economic problems mounting, the Russian government is
seeking parliament's approval for a series of new tax laws and it
also wants dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in fresh loans from the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders.
	   Kiriyenko, who has been battling assorted economic woes since he
took over as prime minister in March, laid out a bleak picture of
Russia's finances in his address to Parliament's upper house, the
Federation Council.
	   ``The financial market has practically ceased to exist,''
Kiriyenko said. ``Social tension is growing in society, which
naturally is not helpful to stabilization.''
	   Strikes by coal miners and other workers have been on the rise
as millions of workers go months without receiving their pay. Coal
miners have been blocking freight trains on the Trans-Siberian
railway for the past week, similar to a protest staged in May.
	   After speaking to the Federation Council, Kiriyenko said the
government and the upper house were generally in agreement about
what must be done.
	   ``We are in the same boat and must make decisions jointly,'' he
said.
	   Kiriyenko also insisted that the ruble would not be devalued.
``Never,'' he told reporters who asked when a devaluation might
take place.
	   The government's greatest fear is that the currency will be
devalued, forcing up prices and inflicting more economic pain on
all Russians. The government has fiercely defended the ruble, which
has remained relatively steady and is trading at around 6.2 rubles
to the U.S. dollar.
	   President Boris Yeltsin spoke by telephone Thursday with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
French President Jacques Chirac, all of whom voiced support for
Russia's anti-crisis economic program, the Kremlin said.
	   The financial crisis has been worsening over the past two months
due to the government's chronic inability to collect taxes, a
reduction in oil export revenues, and an exodus of foreign
investors.
	   The economy shrank by 0.2 percent for the first half of the
year, returning to negative territory after growing a modest 0.8
percent last year, the first year of growth this decade.
	   The stock market has fallen by more than half this year, and
investors are so wary of Russian government debt that interest
rates are now over 100 percent, and buyers are still scarce.
	   Russia has been holding talks with the IMF and the World Bank on
a new loan package, and there are signs that a preliminary
agreement could be reached within days.
	   But IMF and the World Bank may be reluctant to conclude a loan
deal before Russia's parliament approves an economic stabilization
package that tightens tax collection. The lending agencies consider
improved tax revenues to be the key to a Russian recovery.
	   Parliament's lower house is not scheduled to meet again until
July 15, and the Communists and other opposition members have
strong reservations about measures that would raise taxes.

Chechen president decides to serve as prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of the breakaway republic of
Chechnya said he would also take on the job of prime minister, news
reports said Friday.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov already holds the title of prime
minister, but for the last six months he turned over the
responsibilities of the office to former guerrilla fighter Shamil
Basayev.
	   Basayev recently submitted his resignation and Maskhadov
accepted it this week, according to the Interfax news agency and
other news reports.
	   Maskhadov wasn't going to make any immediate changes in the
cabinet, said presidential spokesman Mairbek Vachigayev.
	   Basayev lost to Maskhadov in Chechnya's presidential elections
last year but has retained a broad popular support in the southern
republic that has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew following the 1994-96 war.
	   His appointment as acting premier in December 1997 annoyed
Russia, where he faces criminal charges for leading a
hostage-taking raid during the war that left more than 100 people
dead in a Russian town near Chechnya.
	   Maskhadov and Basayev have pledged to work together to rein in
rampant crime and improve the moribund economy shattered by the
war. But they have failed to achieve any significant progress.

Hard-line Protestants test police lines at Drumcree, warn of worse
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Blair saying the law will be enforced &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Leaders of Northern Ireland's
new Assembly sought Friday to drum up support for compromise over a
blocked Protestant march, but a spokesman for the marchers said he
feared the impasse would lead to a lethal clash pitting Protestant
hard-liners against police and soldiers.
	   Four police officers were hospitalized Friday morning after
surgery for injuries from bomb shrapnel and a fifth was admitted
after being hit by ball bearings fired from a crowd of 20,000 or
more massed near a rural church outside Portadown, 25 miles (40
kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   Police fired plastic bullets at demonstrators who breached
security barriers, and arrested nine people. It was the fifth night
of violence since authorities stopped a march by the Orange Order
from passing through a hostile Catholic neighborhood.
	   ``The incidents last night are deplored by ourselves, but it is
understandable. People see that peaceful protest isn't getting them
anywhere,'' said David Jones, a spokesman for the Orange Order,
Northern Ireland's largest Protestant brotherhood.
	   ``Is (Prime Minister) Tony Blair really prepared to have another
Bloody Sunday, only this time in Portadown, County Armagh?'' Jones
said, referring to the 1972 clash in which British soldiers killed
13 unarmed Catholic demonstrators in Londonderry.
	   Blair said in a television interview that the law would be
enforced, and that he would not tolerate attacks on security
forces.
	   David Trimble, the newly elected first minister of Northern
Ireland's Assembly, and his deputy, Seamus Mallon, were meeting
with religious, business and labor leaders hoping to drum up
support for compromise.
	   ``We haven't given up, nor will we give up. We will endeavour to
see what we can do to reach an accommodation,'' said Trimble, a
member of the Orange Order and leader of the Ulster Unionist Party,
which gets most of the Protestant vote in Northern Ireland.
	   The long-dreaded confrontation over the Drumcree march has
provoked the worst violence in Northern Ireland since eight parties
agreed on a new government sharing power between Catholics and
Protestants in April, which was approved by Northern Ireland
residents in a referendum the next month.
	   ``I hope everyone remains calm and peaceful and realizes that we
must not let this process, which has been agreed by the people in
the referendum, agreed by people through their votes for the new
Assembly, to be hijacked by extremists from any side,'' Blair said.

Government considers plan to halt recurrent floods in Venice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The government is considering a plan drawn up by a
team of international experts to protect Venice from the recurrent
floods that are slowly destroying its centuries-old monuments.
	   The plan, presented to the government Thursday, foresees the
construction of a 20-meter(yard)-wide and 30-meter(yard)-deep
movable barrier on the outskirts of the Venice lagoon.
	   The structure would normally sit below the water surface, then
when the tide rises too high it would be lifted into place,
blocking the water from entering the lagoon.
	   Last year, downtown Venice and scenic St. Mark's Square were
flooded more than 80 times _ a record for this century. The high
waters inconvenience residents and tourists, who are forced to wear
rubber boots to stay dry, as well as damage monuments and canals in
the city.
	   ``This project is the right solution to save Venice from the sea
and high water without damaging the environment or the economic and
social fabric of the city,'' said Raffaele Costa, minister of
public works.
	   Other initiatives to save Venice from floods _ such as imposing
speed limits on boats and blocking large ones from entering the
canals _ have had little effect.
	   Italy's Environmental Impact Assessment Committee now has 90
days to examine the plan before it passes to the government for
final approval.
	   Philippe Bordeau, president of the scientific committee of the
European Union's environment agency, led the panel of experts who
devised the plan, which is expected to take eight years to complete
at a cost of 4.44 trillion lire (dlrs 2.4 billion).

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Department of Labor assumed
jurisdiction Friday over a dispute involving ground personnel at
troubled Philippine Airlines, effectively blocking their option to
strike next Monday.
	   ``We are being forced to negotiate with management with our
hands tied behind our back,'' said Alex Barrientos, president of
the ground personnel union. ``We are grudgingly accepting the order
but we have other legal options to air our protests.''
	   Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said the labor department
assumed jurisdiction of the dispute because a strike could damage
the country and its economy.
	   The airlines' 625 pilots went on strike for 22 days last month,
aggravating financial losses caused by Asia's currency storm and
scuttling an ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program. PAL
fired all the striking pilots after they ignored a government
return-to-work order.
	   At the height of the pilots' walkout, the airline laid off 5,000
of its more than 13,000 workers to scale down its operations and
stave off more losses, causing the ground personnel to file a
strike notice as well.
	   A mandatory 15-day ``cooling off'' period following the notice
ends Monday, after which the union would have been able to strike.
	   Laguesma said his order stops the ground personnel from
proceeding with a strike and also prevents management from
dismissing more employees.
	   Under a rehabilitation plan, PAL is slashing its work force,
disposing of 40 of its 54 planes, suspending more than two-thirds
of its routes and selling some subsidiaries.
	   President Joseph Estrada said the labor problems were ``doing a
lot of damage to our country because PAL is the flag carrier,'' and
told reporters he is urging the airline's main owner, Lucio Tan, to
reduce the number of layoffs and flight cutbacks.
	   ``He's only willing to fly 14 airplanes and I'm trying to
convince him to fly 21,'' Estrada said.
	   Barrientos declined to say what the union's options now are.
``Just watch out for further developments. It will just happen,''
he said.
	   PAL officials say the company lost more than 2 billion pesos
(dlrs 50 million) in revenue because of the pilots' strike.

Commander: Sierra Leone rebels running low on supplies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Rebel in remote southeastern
Sierra Leone are running low on ammunition and food, a West African
intervention force commander said.
	   ``Rebel activities have been curtailed and contained to a large
extent,'' said Col. Rauf Laure Apata, the acting commander of a
coalition force fighting in Sierra Leone on behalf of President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
	   The Nigerian-led force, known as ECOMOG, drove a military junta
from power earlier this year, but continue to battle the remnants
of the renegade army who fled into the bush near the Liberian and
Guinean borders.
	   Speaking to reporters late Thursday, Apata said intercepted
rebel messages indicated they were low on ammunition, food and
morale.
	   Ousted junta fighters and their allied rebels have been blamed
for horrific atrocities, including murder, mutilation and rape.
	   Thousands of civilians have been driven from their homes, while
scores have had hands and arms amputated, or have been tortured or
killed by the rebels, aid workers and ECOMOG commanders have said.
	   At the United Nations in New York, Security Council members on
Thursday agreed to establish an observer mission for Sierra Leone
to help disarm members of the former junta.
	   A resolution that would authorize the 70-member team could be
approved Monday, said council President Sergey Lavrov of Russia.

Chinese police chief refutes reports of crime mob cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Accusing foreign media of plotting to disrupt
relations with Macau, a Chinese police chief has denied allegations
his officers are linked to a wave of gang-related violence in the
Portuguese enclave.
	   Chen Shaoji, chief of police in southern Guangdong province,
said the foreign reports about reputed Macau crime boss Wan
Kuok-koi sought to give the ``mistaken impression'' that his
officers supported criminal gangs in Macau.
	   Chen said the reports ``sought to drench Guangdong police
leaders in dirty water,'' the official Yangcheng Evening News
reported in its Thursday edition.
	   Guangdong police are not allowed contacts with foreign crime
mobs ``except for work requirements,'' the newspaper paraphrased
Chen as saying.
	   Wan, also known as ``Broken Tooth'' Koi, was arrested in May
after a bomb exploded beneath the car of Dr. Antonio Marques
Baptista, director of Macau's Judicial Police.
	   The bombing was part of a wave of violence in Macau, off
Guangdong's southeast coast. Three Macau government employees,
including the No. 3 official in the gambling inspection agency,
have been killed since March.
	   The violence is believed to be part of gang warfare over payoffs
from Macau's legal casinos and has strained relations between
Chinese and Portuguese officials preparing for China's takeover of
the colony on Dec. 20, 1999.
	   Chen, the police chief, said that by blaming the Macau violence
on Guangdong police, media reports about Koi were trying to
``create suspicions between Guangdong and Macau police, causing
chaos,'' the newspaper said. He did not say which media
organizations made the reports.
	   ``These people's plots will absolutely never prevail,'' Chen
said.

World Cup: Faking fouls latest problem for soccer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Shirt-pulling and taking a dive to try to draw a
foul are the latest plagues of soccer, and World Cup referees said
Friday that they need help to get them under control.
	   Ali Mohamed Bujsaim, who took charge of the Brazil-Netherlands
semifinal, and Voelker Roth, a member of FIFA's referee committee,
both said the problem had grown since a crackdown in the World Cup
all but eliminated dangerous tackles.
	   ``They aren't tackling from behind, but now the players are
pulling and simulating'' fouls, Roth said. ``This is a danger to
soccer. It's impossible for the referee to see it all.''
	   Bujsaim said he and other referees had succeeded in applying
FIFA's crackdown against tackling from behind, one of the most
dangerous tactics in soccer. But now, he said, it's the fouls that
don't happen that are causing problems.
	   ``We've been studying this problem for a long time, but the
players have a lot of tricks,'' the official from the United Arab
Emirates said. ``We can ignore it, which is punishment because the
ball belongs to the other team, or we can give a yellow (warning)
card. We can see if it's a simulation or a real foul.''
	   The players know when they are caught taking a dive, Bujsaim
said.
	   ``We'll see a player go down like he's dying,'' the referee
said. ``We go up to him and say, `Get up! You're OK,' and they get
right up.''
	   As long as soccer has been played, some players have taken dives
to try to draw a foul. But the art of the air tackle has reached
new heights in France this summer.
	   And the issue has moved to center stage as the final between
Brazil and France nears on Sunday. France will play without
defender Laurent Blanc, suspended for shoving the face of Croatia's
Slaven Bilic in Wednesday's semifinal. Contact appeared to be made
but perhaps not to the extent Bilic indicated as he clutched his
chest, eyes and throat in full view of referee Jose-Manuel Garcia.
	   Shirt-grabbing _ FIFA president Sepp Blatter this week called it
``textile testing'' _ also was in the spotlight on one hotly
debated penalty that helped give Norway a first-round victory over
Brazil. TV replays showed the call, blocked from general view, was
correct.
	   In an hour-long news conference, a rare opportunity to question
a World Cup referee about his job, Bujsaim said officials are human
with human limits and want to bring out the best in soccer.
	   ``It's a very fast game and we might make mistakes. There might
be one mistake that lasts 100 years,'' he said. ``But we want to
allow the players to show their talents.''
	   Bujsaim and Roth, who coordinates officials in Germany's
Bundesliga, said there had been no pressure from Blatter's call
early in the Cup to crack down on dangerous tackles, and that a
subsequent flood of ejections was coincidental.
	   But Roth singled out one of those games, in which two players
from Denmark and one from South Africa were ejected, as being
poorly officiated by John Jeiro Toro Rendon of Colombia. Roth added
that the red cards were properly handed out.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Russian vessel was suspected of releasing
a large amount of fuel oil into the Azov Sea near the Ukrainian
port of Mariupol, a newspaper said Friday.
	   The spill created a slick 1.5 kilometers (one mile) wide and 6
kilometers (3.7 miles) long, with a depth of about 2 centimeters
(0.8 inches), said Mykola Afanasyev, chief Azov Sea preservation
inspector.
	   Afanasyev did not say how much fuel oil was thought to have
spilled, the daily Fakty reported.
	   He said four Russian oil ships belonging to the Samara-based
Volgatanker company were about 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) offshore,
awaiting permission to enter Mariupol harbor, when one of them
released the oil.
	   The ships were detained pending financial estimates of the
damage, Afanasyev added.
	   He said the slick hadn't reached shore and was moving to the
southwest, passing several resort areas. But if wind direction
changes, it could reach the resort area of Berdyansk, return to
Mariupol or even reach Crimea, meteorologists said.
	   The spill was the most serious pollution accident on the Azov
Sea in the past 30 years, the newspaper said.

Russia seeks to rebuild sports reputation with World Youth Games

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's once-mighty sports program has been
crippled by funding cuts, but Moscow hopes the first-ever World
Youth Games will help to rebuild the country's rich athletic
tradition.
	   The games, which begin Saturday and run through July 19, are
expected to draw 5,000 participants from 130 countries. The
athletes, ages 12 to 17, will compete in 15 medal events, such as
track and field and soccer. There will also be demonstration sports
such as American football, street basketball, and mountain biking.
	   Moscow's ambitious Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who appointed himself
chairman of the games organizing committee, has staged a media
blitz to drum up support, casting it as an event that will help
unite the nation.
	   The games appear well-organized, but there are no big-name
performers and the events are not expected to draw large crowds or
much interest outside Moscow.
	   On Friday, Luzhkov complained to President Boris Yeltsin that
Russia's three main television stations are not planning to
broadcast the Youth Games.
	   Luzhkov has sunk 200 million rubles (more than dlrs 30 million)
into the games, according to organizers. He has also spent large
sums on stadium renovations and infrastructure repair around the
city.
	   ``Things have exceeded our expectations so far,'' said Bill
Wenninger, the spokesman for the U.S. team. ``The Olympic village
has been great, and the venues are in excellent shape.''
	   Unlike the rest of Russia, Moscow is relatively rich and Luzhkov
said he was not concerned about whether the city would recoup its
large investment.
	   ``The World Youth Games will be conducted absolutely free of
mercantilism,'' the mayor said Thursday.
	   The benefit, city officials say, will be in demonstrating that
Russia is again capable of handling a large sporting event.
	   ``One of the reasons for these games is to show that Moscow is
ready to hold such events, despite a number of problems,'' said
Rudolph Nevetsky, a spokesman for the games' press service. ``If
these go normally, then Moscow will make (an Olympic) bid.''
	   Russia's second largest city, St. Petersburg, made a bid to host
the 2004 Olympics, but didn't make it to the final round. The
city's poor infrastructure and facilities played a large part in
its failure.
	   Russia is still producing world-class athletes, but many of its
best hockey players, figure skaters and tennis players have fled to
the West to perform professionally or find better training
facilities.
	   The Youth Games also are partly sponsored by the International
Olympic Committee, and Luzhkov has played up this connection.
	   The Olympic rings adorn billboards all over the city, the
Olympic flame is making it's way from Athens, and past Olympic
champions will take part in the opening ceremonies.
	   Despite all the fanfare, the games haven't generated much
enthusiasm among Russian sports fans, and there's been conflicting
information about ticket sales.
	   At the games' information bureau, one spokesman said tickets
would be available at the event venues for a small price. Another
said they would be distributed free throughout the city.
	   A third official promised to call back with details. And a
fourth, angry at the imposition, said adults would not be admitted
to events.
	   ``These tickets have all been given to children,'' said a
spokeswoman, who refused to give her name. ``Why do you want to go?
There will be nothing for adults to do there.''

Esso begins production from new platform in South China Sea

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Esso Production Malaysia Inc., an
affiliate of Exxon Corporation, has begun production from an
unmanned platform 275 kilometers (165 miles) off the coast of
Trengganu in the South China Sea.
	   In a statement issued here Friday, EPMI said the platform called
Raya A was built at a cost of about dlrs 60 million.
	   EPMI, as operator, is developing the Raya field on behalf of
Petronas, Malaysia's national petroleum corporation, Petronas
Carigali Sdn Bhd and for itself. EPMI has an 80 percent share.
	   Raya A, is an unmanned satellite platform designed and
constructed by Malaysian companies, the statement said.
	   The first well was completed in early June.
	   Seven dual production wells are expected to be drilled on Raya
A, with a forecast peak production rate of 24 thousand barrels of
oil daily, anticipated in 1999, the statement said.
	   EPMI is a major crude oil producer in Malaysia with daily
production exceeding 300,000 barrels.
	   It is also a major supplier of natural gas to Peninsular
Malaysia, with production in excess of 900 million standard cubic
feet of gas per day.
	   EPMI has production sharing contracts with Petronas in five
areas offshore Trengganu, Peninsular Malaysia and currently
operates 30 platforms in 11 fields.

France and Britain preparing Security Council resolution on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France and Britain are preparing a draft Security
Council resolution aimed at securing a cease-fire in Serbia's
Kosovo province, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   The draft resolution would clearly indicate that additional
measures aimed at ending the fighting would be taken if Serb forces
and ethnic Albanian rebels did not take steps to halt hostilities,
according to a statement ready by spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
	   The draft resolution is intended to implement a declaration made
following a meeting Wednesday in Bonn by the six-member Contact
Group that coordinates international policy on the Balkans.
	   The French Foreign Ministry statement said the draft resolution
in preparation would remind both parties of the obligations they
had made to try to ease tension in Kosovo province.
	   The resolution will remind Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
of his promise made in talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on June 16 to resume talks with Albanians in Kosovo and guarantee
free access to international monitors and aid groups.
	   The Albanians also have promised to allow international
observers into the province. At their Bonn meeting, the Contact
Group warned militants of the Kosovo Liberation Army that they
could face sanctions if they impeded new talks.
	   The draft resolution will spell out to both sides that they face
possible sanctions. However, further authorization from the
Security Council would be needed before such measures were enacted,
the French Foreign Ministry statement said.
	   Hundreds of people have died this year in clashes between Serb
security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels, and thousands have fled
the fighting.
	   Albanians, who made up 90 percent of the province, want greater
autonomy for the province, which is located in southern Serbia, the
dominant of the two republics that make up Yugoslavia.

Swiss win satellite phone contract worth more than dlrs 75 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss telecommunications group Ascom
said Friday a U.S. company has chosen it to develop and manufacture
a satellite telephone for a global communications system.
	   Ascom was awarded the sub-contract by United States-based Hughes
Space and Communications Company, which holds the prime contract
for the dlrs 1 billion Thuraya satellite-based voice, data and fax
communications system, Ascom said.
	   Hughes is developing the system for the Abu Dhabi-based Thuraya
Communications Corporation.
	   Hughes, whose parent company Hughes Electronics Corporation has
its headquarters in Maryland, chose Ascom as supplier because of
its experience in cordless telephone technologies, Ascom said.
	   An Ascom spokesman refused to specify Ascom's share of the
contract, but indicated it was more than 115 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 75 million). The firm has initially been asked to make
118,000 telephones.
	   The system is scheduled to begin serving the Indian
subcontinent, Central Asia, the Middle East, North and Central
Africa and Europe in 2000.

Violence jars Lagos, elders urge restraint among rival groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS increase in ethnically-motivated attacks in Lagos and
elsewhere. ADDS background, quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Blind rage over the death of political
prisoner Moshood Abiola may be turning more calculated, pitting
Nigeria's ethnic rivals against one another in a potentially deadly
battle.
	   For the third day, outraged youths stormed through the streets
on Friday in parts of Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos,
setting fires, smashing windows and blocking roads.
	   The bodies of nine people from the northern Hausa ethnic group
that were discovered in various parts of a predominantly southern
Yoruba neighborhood indicated the violence may not be so random.
	   A senior police commander in Lagos described many of the
rampaging youths in Lagos as out of work, disenfranchised
southerners from the Yoruba ethnic group.
	   The death of Abiola _ a Yoruba and the apparent winner of
annulled presidential elections in 1993 _ has infuriated his
supporters who say the northern- and Hausa-dominated military is to
blame.
	   Abiola died Tuesday while still in the custody of his military
captors, who had kept him imprisoned for the past four years.
	   The army says he died of a heart attack, but some of Abiola's
relatives say he was killed by the military even as they prepared
to set him free.
	   The ruling junta says it has completed an autopsy, but hasn't
released the results. A second, independent autopsy to be conducted
by a team of foreign pathologists, was scheduled for Friday.
	   At least 24 people have been killed in three days of violence
following Abiola's death. Many of the victims were members of the
Hausa and related Fulani groups, says military junta commander Col.
Hamed Ali.
	   ``Counsel your subjects on the need for peaceful co-existence,''
Ali told a joint meeting of Yoruba, Hausa and Ibo elders in Lagos
late Thursday.
	   Yoruba leaders have been calling for restraint from their own
members, but have also appealed to the military to help stop
reprisal attacks.
	   Earlier, Yorubas armed with knives, clubs, bows and arrows,
battled Hausas in several Lagos neighborhoods.
	   Nigeria's horrific 1960s Biafran war flourished out of ethnic
hatreds and attacks between northern and southern tribes. More than
a million people died in that civil war as southern Ibos waged a
futile battle to establish an independent homeland in southeastern
Nigeria.
	   Since independence from British rule in 1960, Nigeria has been a
splintered country of ethnic fault lines.
	   The junta, meanwhile, was trying to set a tone of reconciliation
in the face of ongoing violence. The military on Thursday commuted
death sentences handed down to six people, including a former
military leader, accused of trying to overthrow late dictator Gen.
Sani Abacha.
	   Although triggering much anger, it is the military and its
iron-fisted central rule that is often and ironically credited with
keeping fractious Nigeria in one piece.
	   Bowing to enormous pressure, the junta announced it will set up
a commission of top officials to sketch out the broad outline for a
transition to democracy.
	   The country's new military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar says
he will address the nation on the plan next week.
	   The country's leaders met late Thursday night to discuss plans
to hand over power to civilians and release Nigeria's remaining
political prisoners.
	   Nigeria was in the midst of a flawed transition to democracy
when Abacha died early last month. Abubakar has vowed to complete
the transition, but he has not said how or when.

Turkey warns of increase in military power on Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey may increase its military power in
the Turkish area of Cyprus if Greek Cypriots deploy anti-aircraft
missiles, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said.
	   ``If they deploy missiles, so will we,'' Yilmaz said in an
interview with private television Kanal D late Thursday.
	   ``If they deploy them, the tension will increase in Cyprus and
an armed conflict could arise, and we won't be the losers,'' Yilmaz
said. The semi-official Anatolia news agency provided a transcript
of the interview Friday.
	   Ankara ardently opposes Greek Cypriot plans to station Russian
missiles on the island, saying that the advanced S-300 systems
would give Cyprus the offensive capability to strike aircraft
flying over southern Turkey.
	   Cyprus on Thursday suggested the creation of a no-fly zone over
the island to reduce tension. Turkey rejected the proposal, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli said Friday.
	   U.S. and European officials have been pressuring Cyprus to
cancel the purchase, saying it needlessly increases tension between
NATO partners Greece and Turkey.
	   Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi, chief of the Turkish general staff,
visited the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state Friday to assess
military options.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Turkish and Greek sectors since
1974, when Turkey sent in troops following an abortive coup by
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
	   Some 30,000 Turkish troops are deployed in the Turkish Cypriot
state, which is only recognized by Ankara.

Aftershocks shake Azores Islands as quake clean-up begins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS new 7thgraf to clarify that authorities had previously
put the death toll at nine &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HORTA, Azores (AP) _ Some 1,700 minor aftershocks rumbled
through Portugal's Azores Islands in the Atlantic Ocean overnight
after a 5.8-magnitude quake killed eight people and left about
1,500 homeless, officials said Friday.
	   The aftershocks caused no injuries or damage, according to
officials.
	   Emergency services and local people began removing rubble and
repairing infrastructure on Faial, the hardest-hit of the
archipelago's nine volcanic islands.
	   ``We're cleaning up now,'' said Helena Vaz, spokeswoman for the
Azores Civil Protection Service. ``The homeless people are in army
tents and we're getting back to normal.''
	   Authorities said about 500 houses were destroyed on Faial in
Thursday's quake. Damage was estimated at 12 billion escudos (dlrs
64 million).
	   Vaz said eight people were killed in rural villages on the
island's eastern coast, the area nearest to the epicenter which was
15 kilometers (nine miles) away, at sea. The dead included a
seven-month-old baby and four people aged between 82 and 90 years,
Vaz said.
	   Authorities said communications difficulties on Thursday had led
them to put the death toll incorrectly at nine.
	   Emergency aid flown in from the Portuguese mainland, 1,200
kilometers (800 miles) to the east, was being distributed to the
island's 5,000 inhabitants.
	   Visiting the island Thursday, Prime Minister Antonio Guterres
said he was ``deeply moved'' by the scenes of destruction and
distraught local people.
	   The archipelago has a total population of about 250,000, most of
whom make their living from agriculture and fishing.

Tire store burned down in Bahrain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Fire destroyed a tire store in a
commercial district of Bahrain's capital, Manama, newspapers
reported Friday. There were no injuries.
	   Authorities are investigating the cause of the fire, which broke
out after midnight Wednesday, the English-language Gulf Daily News
and its sister paper Akhbar al-Khaleej reported. Officials did not
immediately comment.
	   No other details were availble. It was not clear if arson was
the cause.
	   Arson attacks are a regular weapon in the Shiite Muslim-led
campaign for political and social reforms. More than 40 people have
been reportedly killed in the violence since December 1994.
	   Shiites form a slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens,

Man gunned down in bar, police see connection to Yugoslav mafia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Gunmen opened fire in a crowded bar,
killing a 37-year-old man in what police said Friday appeared to be
an assassination connected to the killing of a Yugoslav organized
crime leader.
	   Police did not give the name of the victim of Thursday night's
shooting, but police spokesman Kurt Hansson said he was a part of
the same circle as Dragan Joksovic, who was gunned down in February
at a Stockholm horse-racing track.
	   Joksovic was a close associate of Zeljko Raznjatovic, or
``Arkan,'' a wartime paramilitary leader of Serb forces in Bosnia
and Croatia. Police said at the time that Joksovic was a main
figure in the smuggled-cigarette trade and ``Arkan's man'' in
Sweden.
	   Last month, an Iraqi man also believed to be part of the same
organized-crime circles was shot to death on a Stockholm street.
	   No arrests were made in the latest shooting, which took place
before about 60 customers in a pub in the popular nightlife
district of Soedermalm.

	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ At least two people died in border
clashes Friday between Albanian arms smugglers and the Yugoslav
army, Serbs reported. Tensions built in a central village, with
hundreds of armed Albanians dug in against feared attack.
	   The deaths, reported by the pro-government Serbian Media Center,
occurred near the border village of Vrbnica, about 75 kilometers
(45 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Large quantities of arms and ammunition were confiscated after
army troops were fired on and returned fire, said the center.
	   It also reported an unspecified number of Albanians killed and
wounded in a separate clash near the border village of Kosare, and
another exchange of fire near the border outpost of Gorozup, west
of Prizren.
	   In northern Kosovo, a Serbian policeman was wounded in an attack
by ethnic Albanians on a checkpoint on the road between Kosovska
Mitrovica and Srbica, said the center. None of the reports could be
independently confirmed.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Egypt's health minister, Ismael Salam,
arrived in Baghdad Friday, leading a delegation of doctors who will
perform operations in Iraqi hospitals during their week-long stay.
	   Salam, a heart surgeon, told reporters on arrival that he also
will conduct surgery if authorities agree.
	   ``If they let me do an operation, I will be grateful,'' he said.
	   Salam said his 40-member delegation includes representatives of
Egyptian pharmaceutical companies, which have recently increased
the sale of medicines to Iraq under its oil-for-food deal with the
United Nations.
	   Salam will also inaugurate a health fair organized by Egyptian
pharmaceutical companies.
	   Egypt has taken the second position among Arab countries after
Jordan in trade with Iraq since the United Nations allowed it in
December 1996 to export limited amounts of oil to use the money for
buying humanitarian goods.
	   Iraq is banned under U.N. economic sanctions to do trade with
the outside world. The embargo has crippled the country's economy
and has been blamed for the drastic fall in the living standards of
Iraqis.

Veterans give Australia victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Veterans Tony Ronaldson and Andrew
Vlahov kept their cool down the stretch to guide Australia to a
70-68 victory over Canada Friday in game three of their
international series.
	   Ronaldson scored six from six from the foul line in the last
three minutes while Vlahov also scored his two foul shots.
	   Canada had twice come back from 13-point deficits in the second
half before Australia's composure gave it a 2-1 lead in the
four-match series.
	   While Australia's starters struggled against the determined
Canadians, its bench players provided 41 points.
	   Australia led by 12 at half-time but Canada opened with a 16-5
run, reducing the deficit to one point.
	   ``We had a chance to win it and after coming from 13 down twice
I thought that showed a lot of character,'' said Canadian coach
Steve Konchalski. ``We do not have our NBA guys with us so we have
to get it done as a team.''
	   Konchalski said Canada was hurt by poor transition defense in
the first half but it improved in the second.
	   ``The guys have come together very well but we are not a good
enough team to have any lapses against quality opposition like
Australia,'' Konchalski said. ``Once we eliminate those lapses then
we are capable of playing against most teams.''
	   Australian coach Barry Barnes was not concerned about the
collective nine points of his starting back court of former NBA
players Andrew Gaze and Shane Heal.
	   ``The pleasing thing about tonight was that young players Frank
Drmic and Brett Maher stepped up and did very well for us,'' said
Barnes. ``Chris Anstey had his best game for us tonight and while
we still have some ways to go I think we are getting there.''
	   Both teams will compete at the world championships in Athens
later this month.

Land mines kill two people a week after peace deals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Land mines are killing two people and
dozens of livestock each week in central Somalia as people venture
into mined areas once fighting has stopped, regional officials said
Friday.
	   Heavy rains have uncovered buried mines, increasing the threat
of accident, especially among children, said Yussuf Hassan Eyow,
governor of the central Somali Galgudud region.
	   Eyow said at least two people and dozens of livestock,
especially camels, were being killed in land mine explosions each
week in Galgudud and neighboring Hiran regions.
	   Eyow told reporters in Mogadishu that most of the mines were
buried in 1992 during the height of clan-based fighting that has
ravaged Somalia since 1991.
	   Many mines were planted on roads closed during the worst of the
clashes. Ironically, peace deals between warring clans in the
central regions have led to the reopening of key roads laid with
mines.
	   The United Nations estimated that more than 1 million land mines
were were buried in Somalia since clan-based factions conspired to
oust President Siad Barre in 1991, then fought among themselves.
	   Somalia has been without a central government since then.
	   Eyow said mine explosions occurr daily on roads linking major
towns. He said there were no maps indicating where the mines were
laid.
	   More than 250 mines are believed to have been laid on a
10-kilometer (7-mile) strip of road linking the commercial town of
Belet Huen, 100 kilometers (65 miles) north of Mogadishu, and the
next town of Gobane.
	   Abdi Musa Assir, a Galgadud district commissioner, appealed to
the international community to help with demining.
	   Foreign countries have been reluctant to send aid to Somalia
after a U.N. aid mission in 1992 ended in fiasco three years later.
The United States withdrew from the operation in 1994 after losing
42 troops.
	   More than U.N. 100 peacekeepers died and more than dlrs 1.66
billion was spent before the United Nations finally pulled out the
last of the peacekeepers in 1995.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Blind rage over the death of political
prisoner Moshood Abiola may be turning into something more
calculated, pitting Nigeria's ethnic rivals against one another in
a deadly, ages-old battle.
	   For the third straight day, outraged young people stormed
through the streets Friday in parts of Nigeria's commercial capital
of Lagos, setting fires, smashing windows and blocking roads.
	   The discovery of the bodies of nine people from the northern
Hausa ethnic group, found in various parts of a predominantly
southern Yoruba neighborhood, indicated the violence may not be so
random.
	   A senior police commander in Lagos described many of the rioting
young people in Lagos as out of work, disenfranchised southerners
from the Yoruba ethnic group.
	   The death of Abiola _ a Yoruba and the apparent winner of
annulled presidential elections in 1993 _ has infuriated his
supporters, who say the northern- and Hausa-dominated military is
to blame.
	   Riot police and paramilitary troops have been ordered to protect
Muslim mosques in Lagos, which could be a target for attacks by the
predominantly Christian and animist southerners.
	   More than 400 people have been arrested since Tuesday night,
when violence first broke out in Lagos, police say.

<SLUG> Fugitive Australian tycoon to appeal denial of residency extension </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A lawyer representing fugitive Australian
tycoon Christopher Skase said Friday he would appeal a Spanish
judge's refusal to extend his residency permit.
	   Attorney Juan Pina said the court papers might be filed as early
as later in the day Friday.
	   ``We have all afternoon,'' Pina said from Palma de Mallorca,
where Skase leaves in a seaside mansion. ``We definitely plan to
exercise our right to appeal.''
	   A judge in Mallorca this week turned down Skase's request for an
extension of his residency permit, and gave him 15 days to leave
the country.
	   Since 1994, Australia has been seeking Skase's extradition from
Mallorca, where he fled after being charged in 1992 in relation to
the U.S. dlrs 930 million (1.5 billion Australian dollars) collapse
of his Qintex group of companies.
	   He avoided the 1994 extradition attempt when a Spanish court
ruled that he was too ill to return to Australia.
	   Another lawyer for Skase, Antonio Coll, has said Skase was told
his application was turned down because he no longer held a
passport. It was handed over to the Australian government in May
when he reapplied for residency.
	   Australian Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said Wednesday that
even if Spain expels Skase there is no guarantee he will be forced
to head home.
	   Vanstone said Skase may try to go to another country.
	   ``I would hope that Mr. Skase would simply decide that enough is
enough and come home and face Australian justice. After all, he
claims he's innocent of any wrongdoing,'' Vanstone said.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The official spokesman for the Spanish
government resigned Friday
	   Miguel Angel Rodriguez, a key adviser to Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar, surprised a post-cabinet-meeting press conference by
announcing his own resignation.
	   Rodriguez has been criticized as somewhat of a loose gun in
commenting on Spanish politics, most recently for locking horns
with Catalan nationalists on how children in Catalonia should be
taught the Spanish language.
	   Rodriquez had been spokesman since Aznar and the Popular Party
took office in May 1996.
	   Industry Minister Josep Pique will take over temporarily as
government spokesman, officials said.

Rwandan rebels escape with kidnapped nuns to Uganda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with officials saying the rebels crossed
into Uganda; details; RECASTS; ADDS byline.
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Aided by Hutu sympathizers, Rwandan rebels
slipped into neighboring Uganda with a Canadian and two Rwandan
Roman Catholic nuns they abducted earlier, officials said Friday.
	   The nuns were abducted Tuesday after the rebels robbed a bank
and a health center at Bungwe, 60 kilometers (35 miles), north of
Kigali, where the nuns often worked with the patients.
	   Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rebels
had crossed into Uganda, only 11 kilometers (6 miles) away, where
they were being pursued in a joint Rwandan-Ugandan operation.
	   No other details were immediately available.
	   In Kigali, a Canadian diplomat said he was hoping for a quick
release of the nuns who appeared to had been taken by the rebels to
care for their wounded.
	   One local official was killed and medicines and money were
stolen in the attack, officials and residents said.
	   The attackers were a group of former Hutu soldiers who used
their friends and families for shelter, food and money, officials
said, adding they had been hiding in Bungwe for weeks before the
attack.
	   ``It's a very delicate situation,'' said David Foxall, the
Canadian chief of mission. ``We're in contact with the authorities.
We hope they (the nuns) will be released soon.''
	   In a similar incident in March, the rebels held two Spanish nuns
captive for six days to care for rebels wounded in clashes with the
Tutsi-led army. They were released unharmed.
	   The rebels are usually attacking from the volcanic mountains of
the heavily forested Ruhengeri Prefecture in northwestern Rwanda, a
traditional Hutu strongold. Lately, they had been sighted on the
Ugandan side of the border which they use for crossing in and out
of Rwanda.
	   Foxall said the family of the Canadian nun, who is from Quebec,
had requested that her name be withheld until her release.
	   No contact with the rebels has been established, Foxall said.
	   Former Hutu soldiers and militiamen were involved in the 1994
genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically
moderate Hutus.
	   Additional thousands have died in rebel attacks since the return
in November 1996 of more than 1 million Hutu refugees from exile,
where they fled in fear of reprisals for the massacres.
	   Tutsi-led rebels overthrew the Hutu extremist government in July
1994 and stopped the killing.

Eyadema officially declared winner of Togo election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Togo's Constitutional Court on Friday formally
announced that incumbent Gen. Gnassingbe Eyadema won last month's
disputed presidential elections.
	   The announcement said Eyadema, 61, who has ruled this small
French-speaking country for 31 years, won the June 21 vote with
52.07 percent.
	   His main challenger, Gilchrist Olympio, came second with 34.17
percent, according to official results.
	   Hundreds of youths took to the streets in protest a few days
after after the government announced Eyadema's re-election prior to
Friday's official confirmation.
	   Togo's top chief electoral officer, Awa Nana, and four
subordinates resigned, in the middle of vote counting complaining
of harassment.
	   The United States and European Union also criticized the
elections as flawed, with observers saying the vote counting had
been stopped before a clear winner could be determined.

Chinese dissident arrested, state secrets cited
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of charges against Chen in graf 6, other
dissident detained and released in grafs 10-12

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese dissident detained nearly seven weeks
ago has been formally charged with unspecified crimes and prevented
from seeing his lawyer, a group of exiled democracy campaigners
said Friday.
	   Police cited no charges and gave no reasons when notifying Chen
Zengxiang's family last week of his arrest, the U.S.-based Chinese
Democratic Justice Party said.
	   While the family hired a lawyer as instructed, the lawyer has
not been allowed to see Chen because police said his case ``touched
on state secrets,'' the group reported.
	   The Chinese Democratic Justice Party said cases like Chen's
belie assertions made recently by U.S. President Bill Clinton and
others that China's human rights situation has improved.
	   Under Chinese law, suspects are supposed to be given timely
access to lawyers. That right is often denied with lawyers and
clients sometimes allowed less than a week before trial to prepare
a defense.
	   The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement
in China, based in Hong Kong, said Chen faced charges of plotting
to subvert the government and that his case was sent to prosecutors
this week.
	   Chen was detained May 23 in the eastern port city of Qingdao in
a seasonal roundup of dissidents before the anniversary of the
military's violent quelling of the Tiananmen Square democracy
demonstrations on June 4, 1989. Chinese leaders fear commemorations
will be used to challenge their rule.
	   Some of the most prominent student leaders of the 1989 protests
who are now living in exile have launched a project to compile
accounts of the movement for next year's 10th anniversary, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center said.
	   The group, headed by Wang Dan, who was released from prison and
sent to the United States in April, issued an appeal Friday for
participants in the movement to contribute recordings, journals,
protest posters and other materials to the project, the group said.
	   Meanwhile, a dissident taken from his home Thursday for trying
to join an illegal opposition party was detained for 10 hours and
then released, the group said.
	   Yu Tielong telephoned fellow democracy campaigner Wang Youcai
Wednesday night to say he was interested in joining Wang's China
Democracy Party. Three police officers showed up at Yu's home in
eastern Hangzhou city at 10 a.m. Thursday and forcibly took him
away, the group said.
	   Despite several requests by Wang, authorities have refused to
register the China Democracy Party as required by law, and Yu
Tielong is at least the third person connected with the group to
have been detained.

Fugitive Australian tycoon to appeal denial of residency extension
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: retransmitting to restore cycle designator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A lawyer representing fugitive Australian
tycoon Christopher Skase said Friday he would appeal a Spanish
judge's refusal to extend his residency permit.
	   Attorney Juan Pina said the court papers might be filed as early
as later in the day Friday.
	   ``We have all afternoon,'' Pina said from Palma de Mallorca,
where Skase leaves in a seaside mansion. ``We definitely plan to
exercise our right to appeal.''
	   A judge in Mallorca this week turned down Skase's request for an
extension of his residency permit, and gave him 15 days to leave
the country.
	   Since 1994, Australia has been seeking Skase's extradition from
Mallorca, where he fled after being charged in 1992 in relation to
the U.S. dlrs 930 million (1.5 billion Australian dollars) collapse
of his Qintex group of companies.
	   He avoided the 1994 extradition attempt when a Spanish court
ruled that he was too ill to return to Australia.
	   Another lawyer for Skase, Antonio Coll, has said Skase was told
his application was turned down because he no longer held a
passport. It was handed over to the Australian government in May
when he reapplied for residency.
	   Australian Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said Wednesday that
even if Spain expels Skase there is no guarantee he will be forced
to head home.
	   Vanstone said Skase may try to go to another country.
	   ``I would hope that Mr. Skase would simply decide that enough is
enough and come home and face Australian justice. After all, he
claims he's innocent of any wrongdoing,'' Vanstone said.

France and Britain preparing Security Council resolution on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Fixes typo in second graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France and Britain are preparing a draft Security
Council resolution aimed at securing a cease-fire in Serbia's
Kosovo province, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   The draft resolution would clearly indicate that additional
measures aimed at ending the fighting would be taken if Serb forces
and ethnic Albanian rebels did not take steps to halt hostilities,
according to a statement read by spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
	   The draft resolution is intended to implement a declaration made
following a meeting Wednesday in Bonn by the six-member Contact
Group that coordinates international policy on the Balkans.
	   The French Foreign Ministry statement said the draft resolution
in preparation would remind both parties of the obligations they
had made to try to ease tension in Kosovo province.
	   The resolution will remind Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
of his promise made in talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on June 16 to resume talks with Albanians in Kosovo and guarantee
free access to international monitors and aid groups.
	   The Albanians also have promised to allow international
observers into the province. At their Bonn meeting, the Contact
Group warned militants of the Kosovo Liberation Army that they
could face sanctions if they impeded new talks.
	   The draft resolution will spell out to both sides that they face
possible sanctions. However, further authorization from the
Security Council would be needed before such measures were enacted,
the French Foreign Ministry statement said.
	   Hundreds of people have died this year in clashes between Serb
security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels, and thousands have fled
the fighting.
	   Albanians, who made up 90 percent of the province, want greater
autonomy for the province, which is located in southern Serbia, the
dominant of the two republics that make up Yugoslavia.

Prosecutors appeal acquittal of Miura for 1981 Los Angeles murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors filed an appeal with the Supreme Court
on Friday to dispute a lower court ruling that freed a man accused
of masterminding the 1981 murder of his wife in Los Angeles,
according to a report.
	   The Tokyo High Public Prosecutors Office appealed the Tokyo High
Court's acquittal of Kazuyoshi Miura on grounds the court made
mistakes in identifying facts and violated precedent in the way it
chose evidence, Kyodo News Reported.
	   Prosecutors said the High Court ruling violated a Supreme Court
precedent that evidence be chosen with common sense based on
experience, Kyodo said.
	   Court officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   On July 1, the High Court overturned a 1994 lower court's
finding that Miura planned to kill his wife, Kazumi, then 28, in
conspiracy with a friend in Los Angeles. Miura was released later
that day after serving 13 years in prison.
	   In Japan, trial sessions are held once or twice a month, and
complicated cases can easily drag on for a decade. Human rights
activists and lawyers criticize the slow proceedings as a violation
of the defendants' Constitutional right to a fair and speedy trial.
	   Miura, now 50, and his wife were visiting Los Angeles in Nov.
18, 1981, when they were shot in a parking lot. Miura was hit in
the right leg, while his wife was shot in the head.
	   She remained in a coma until she died in a hospital in Japan a
year later.
	   The case gained nationwide media attention in Japan in the early
1980s.
	   Throughout his trial, Miura maintained his innocence, saying he
and his wife had been shot in an attack by robbers.
	   On Friday, lawyers for Miura called the appeal ``groundless and
unlawful,'' and said they are planning to file a damages suit
against the government, Kyodo reported.
	   The prosecution can appeal when a defendant is acquitted in a
criminal case.
	   The prosecutors did not appeal the High Court's acquittal of
Yoshikuni Okubo, 46, Miura's friend and the man the prosecution
alleged was the shooter.

UN cancels flights to Afghan capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ After two weeks of almost daily
rocket attacks on the Kabul airport in neighboring Afghanistan, the
United Nations announced Friday it was suspending its flights to
Kabul.
	   In a statement issued in neighboring Pakistan, the U.N. said
rockets hit the airport on Thursday while its plane was parked on
the tarmac. This was the second time in as many weeks that a rocket
has hit the airport while a U.N. plane was parked there, the
statement said.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance has been pounding the airport and
nearby residential areas with almost daily rocket barrages.
	   The U.N. accused the opposition of breaking an earlier promise
not to rocket the airport for one hour on Sunday, Tuesday and
Thursday mornings while the U.N. flies in aid workers and supplies.
	   ``That agreement has now been violated,'' the U.N. statement
said.
	   The U.N. will fly to Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan and aid
workers and supplies will be ferried to Kabul by road, it said.
	   Opposition troops say they are hitting the airport to prevent
Taliban jet fighters from using it to bomb their positions, as well
as civilian areas under their control, north of the capital.
	   The Taliban religious army controls about 85 percent of
Afghanistan, where it has imposed a harsh form of Islamic law. The
remaining 15 percent is ruled by the anti-Taliban alliance, a
collection of small groups that represent the country's minority
ethnic groups.

Ruling party just hopes to break even in Sunday's elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hurt by embarrassing policy flip-flops and an
ailing economy, members of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's
ruling party said Friday they will consider it a victory if their
party manages to break even in key elections this weekend.
	   Just last week, Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers were boldly
predicting that their party would win 69 of the 126 seats up for
grabs in Sunday's elections for the upper house of Japan's
bicameral Parliament
	   That's the number the LDP would need to gain control of the
chamber for the first time since 1989.
	   But on Friday, LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato said his party
would claim victory if it holds onto its current 61 seats.
	   ``We're going to do what we can to keep those seats,'' Kato was
quoted as saying Friday morning by Japanese newspapers.
	   Even if the party does worse than expected, it is in little
danger of losing power because it wields firm control over the more
powerful lower house, holding 264 of 500 seats.
	   Still, the elections are widely seen here as a referendum on
Hashimoto's management of the economy, which is mired in its
severest recession since World War II.
	   To make matters worse, Hashimoto has appeared to vacillate on
one of the most important issues of the campaign: whether to cut
taxes to revive economic growth.
	   At one point last week, the prime minister said he supported
``permanent tax reforms'' and then seemed to backtrack two days
later by saying the reforms wouldn't reduce the nation's overall
tax revenues.
	   On Wednesday, Hashimoto finally came out in favor of income tax
cuts, though he stopped short of saying how big they'd be.
	   Analysts said Hashimoto's hand may have been forced as opinion
polls showed opposition parties such as the Japan Communist Party
gaining popularity by calling for tax cuts.
	   The July 12 elections are the first upper house elections since
Hashimoto came to power in early 1996. As a member of the more
powerful lower house, Hashimoto himself does not stand for
reelection.
	   Still, the prime minister's less-than-stellar performance is
also raising the question of how big a blow his party would have to
suffer at the polls for him to step down.
	   The national Asahi newspaper reported Friday that Hashimoto may
have to resign if his party wins less than 61 seats. It said
several leading LDP lawmakers such as Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi
are already jockeying for position to replace him.
	   If so, polls show Hashimoto could be in for a tight race this
Sunday.
	   The Nihon Keizai, Japan's largest business daily, released a
poll on Tuesday of 37,600 voters showing the party will win only 60
seats. As with most Japanese polls, the Nihon Keizai didn't give a
margin of error.
	   But most analysts agree even if the ruling party loses ground,
it won't slip too far. That's because the opposition is too
fragmented and has failed to offer a clear alternative message.
	   ``I don't know if any of the (opposition) parties have the
policies to get Japan out of its problems,'' said Chuck Lambert,
strategist at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo.
	   ``As bad as the LDP may be, I don't think there is a better
option.''

Coulthard, Hakkinen 1-2 in free practice at British GP
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with Friday free practice times &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ David Coulthard turned the quickest
time in Friday's free-practice session for Sunday's British Grand
Prix, edging McLaren-Mercedes teammate and Formula One leader Mika
Hakkinen.
	   Coulthard clocked 1 minute 25.640 seconds, just in front of
Hakkinen in 1:25.764. Williams-Mecachrone, in the midst of a poor
season, got third with Heinz-Harald Frentzen in 1:26.107 and
teammate Jacques Villeneuve in 1:26.114.
	   Michael Schumacher's Ferrari was seventh fastest in 1:26.884.
	   Hakkinen leads the series standings with 50 points to 44 for
two-time series champion Schumacher and 30 for Coulthard.
	   The official qualifying is Saturday.
	   This is the ninth F1 of the season and one of the McLaren cars
has taken the pole in every race. Hakkinen has claimed five and
Coulthard three.
	   Sunday's British Grand Prix, which kicks off the second half of
the season, is 60 laps on the 5.140-kilometer (3.194-mile)
Silverstone circuit, known for its mix of high-speed turns.
	   French-Canadian Villeneuve, last year's series champion, has won
the last two British GPs but looks like a longshot to repeat.
	   He has only 11 points this season and has yet to finish in the
top three. Williams _ winners of five of the last six constructors'
titles _ has slipped behind McLaren and Ferrari in the new
grooved-tire era of F1.
	   On Thursday, Villeneuve and Schumacher turned down a suggestion
that Formula One needs a code of driving conduct.
	   Villeneuve, who says Schumacher's driving puts others ``at
risk,'' suggested, instead, he might take matters into his own
hands.
	   ``I think it would be very difficult to have a written code of
conduct,'' he said. ``It's very difficult from the outside to know
what someone is doing inside his car. You just need mutual respect.
Once you know what people do, then you just pay them back.''
	   Villeneuve, sitting three feet (one meter) away from Schumacher,
left little doubt about who he was referring to.
	   The Canadian criticized Schumacher's driving tactics in last
month's Canadian Grand Prix. In that race, Villeneuve's Williams'
teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen was nearly forced off the track by
Schumacher.
	   ``Taking risks for yourself is one thing, putting other people
at risk is another thing,'' Villeneuve said about that race. ``It
goes beyond what I believe is acceptable.''
	   The last big episode in the Schumacher-Villeneuve feud goes back
to the 1997 season-ending race. In that race, Schumacher
intentionally rammed Villeneuve as the Canadian tried to overtake.
Schumacher's car spun off the track and Villeneuve went on to take
the series championship.
	   The governing body of motor sport _ the FIA _ later slapped
Schumacher on the wrist, stripping him of his second-place finish
in the final standings. Some suggested he should have been banned
for a season, or at least a few races.
	   Schumacher said Thursday the FIA should better enforce its
rules. Ironically, some observers said it was the FIA's lax
enforcement that let Schumacher off the hook last season.
	   ``Some of the drivers I can imagine don't know now what is the
rule and what isn't the rule. And that's what has to happen,'' said
Schumacher, a two-time world champion.
	   ``The rule is the FIA _ and they have to give us the
guidelines.''

Bilic: Don't blame me
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Croatia's Slaven Bilic, branded by the media as
the villain of the soccer World Cup, says he should not be blamed
for French star Laurent Blanc missing the final.
	   Bilic, who plays for English Premier League team Everton,
dropped to the ground clutching his face after Blanc pushed him
during a tense semifinal on Wednesday.
	   Blanc was subsequently sent-off and suspended for two games but
the English and French media are calling for Bilic to be punished
for taking an obvious ``dive''.
	   France won the semifinal and advanced to the World Cup final
against Brazil on Sunday but Blanc will miss his country's greatest
ever moment in soccer and has vowed to get revenge on Bilic.
	   And while Bilic told the Mirror newspaper on Friday he would
give evidence on Blanc's behalf to persuade FIFA to give the
Frenchman a repreive, he refused to take any blame for the
incident.
	   He also defended himself in a Daily Telegraph column.
	   ``As a fellow professional I feel sad for Blanc. But the bottom
line is that I don't feel blame and I don't deserve to be blamed
for his predicament,'' he said.
	   ``He hit me intentionally in the face _ he has admitted he lost
control _ and technically that is a sending-off.
	   ``French commentators are all agreed that there was reason
enough for Blanc to be sent off. None of them is slaughtering me as
friends in England...are.''
	   In the Daily Telegraph column, Bilik said he had grabbed Blanc's
shirt immediately before the incident.
	   ``He reacted by hitting me across the chin with his hand. He
didn't hit me that hard but I fell on the floor when I saw the
referee coming because I had one booking from the previous game and
didn't want to miss a possible final appearance.
	   ``It was not an isolated case. The French players were doing it
all game.''
	   In the Mirror newspaper article, Bilic admitted he may have
``over reacted a little'' but did not deserve to be called a cheat
or treated like a criminal.
	   ``It's a good job I'm a qualified lawyer because, at this rate,
I will be defending myself in (court) soon,'' he said.
	   ``The fact is that Blanc pulled me towards him with one arm and
slapped me on the jaw with the other.
	   ``I admit it's not as if I was punched by Mike Tyson but I went
down more out of shock.
	   ``TV pictures show quite clearly what happened and if it had
been the other way round _ with a Croatian player sent off _ I
don't think anyone would be making an issue out of it.''

EU seeks to calm Greek anger over envoy's report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union officials struggled
Friday to minimize the impact of a leaked report by the EU's former
envoy to Turkey which has provoked outrage in Greece.
	   ``This was a informal, personal view,'' said European Commission
spokesman Nigel Gardner. ``It has no bearing whatsoever on the
nature of our position.''
	   Greek anger was prompted by a report written by Michael Lake at
the end of his seven-year mission as the European Commission's
representative in Turkey. Lake reportedly took a pro-Turkish stance
over Cyprus while criticizing Greece for undermining the Union's
interests in the region.
	   EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek called Greek
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos to ``ensure that there was no
misunderstanding about the nature of the report,'' said a statement
from the Commission, the EU's executive body.
	   Gardner said the Commission was investigating how Lake's report
was leaked to Greek newspapers.
	   Greek diplomats said Athens was considering lodging a formal
complaint to seek disciplinary action against Lake, who has since
been posted to the EU's mission in Budapest, Hungary.
	   ``It is not possible for Commission officials ... to operate
against the Commission, promoting the interests of a particular
country...'' Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
Thursday.
	   Greeks were particularly offended by Lake's alleged criticism of
Greece's 1981 entry into the EU, which he reportedly described as
creating a regional imbalance working against the West's strategic
and economic interests.
	   The Athens daily Ethnos accused Lake of being ``a Turkish agent
within the Commission.''
	   Greece was also stung by Lake's reported comments on the divided
island of Cyprus.
	   ``Are we ready to put Cyprus' interests before Turkey? Which of
the two is more important for our long-term strategy and economic
interests?'' Lake's report was quoted as saying.
	   The EU opened membership talks in March with Cyprus that could
see the island joining the 15-nation Union by the middle of the
next decade.
	   That decision infuriated Turkey because the talks do not include
the breakaway Turkish Cypriot government in the north of the
island, and because Turkey itself was excluded from a list of
potential EU members.

Vajpayee determined to present women's bill to parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
intends to introduce legislation next week that would reserve a
third of India's parliament seats for women, local news agencies
reported.
	   Vajpayee said Friday he would go ahead with the bill despite
opposition from some of the parties in his governing coalition.
	   The Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janta Dal party wanted
quotas for minorities and lower classes within the proposed 33
percent of set-aside seats, an amendment Vajpayee was unwilling to
make, according to news agencies.
	   The influential Congress party, Vajpayee's main opposition, said
it would support the proposal. The bill is to be presented Monday
for discussion by lawmakers.
	   The bill was first introduced in 1996 by a previous government,
but met such opposition it was never put to a vote. Women leaders
accused men in parliament of being unwilling to surrender any
control.
	   Despite Vajpayee's assurances of getting the bill passed, it is
uncertain whether it will come to a vote this time.
	   A similar measure was passed in 1995 for local councils in India
as a means of increasing women's participation in democracy, in a
society in which religion and tradition favor men.
	   Results have been mixed at the local level. Some women
politicians are merely fronts for husbands or fathers, or have been
ousted in no-confidence votes.

Boston Marathon organizer gives new medal to theft victim: Report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nearly 50 years after his victory, the first
Japanese winner of the Boston Marathon was awarded a replacement
medal Friday after the original was stolen.
	   Shigeki Tanaka, 67, the 1951 Boston Marathon winner, was awarded
a new champion's medal by the Boston Athletic Association at a
hotel in Utsunomiya, north of Tokyo.
	   The original medal was stolen from his house on May 5, according
to Kyodo news.
	   Then a college student, Tanaka won the race with a time of 2
hours, 27 minutes, 45 seconds. Tanaka, who is from Hiroshima, the
world's first city to have suffered an atomic bombing at the end of
World War II, was hailed by the U.S. media as ``Atom Boy.''
	   After learning of the theft, the association decided to award a
new medal to Tanaka for his achievement as the first Japanese to
win the race, Kyodo said.
	   In a message given with the medal, Frank Porter, head of the
group, told Tanaka that his victory was the beginning of Japan's
strength in the Boston Marathon. Eight Japanese have won the annual
race.

Red Cross says kidnapped workers freed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Committee of the Red Cross said
Friday that six of its workers abducted two weeks ago by gunmen in
southeastern Ethiopia have been freed.
	   The six, five Ethiopians and a Swiss delegate, are safe and well
and should soon be reunited with their families, the Red Cross said
in a brief statement.
	   The group were released earlier Friday and were picked up by
colleagues, the statement said. They are due to arrive at the ICRC
office in Gode later Friday, it said.
	   The group disappeared June 25 in the southeastern region of
Ogaden, which is largely populated by ethnic Somalis.
	   The workers were released without conditions, the statement
said. It didn't give any further details.

Havel will name Zeman premier, advisor says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ONDREJ HEJMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel will name
Milos Zeman premier next week despite doubts about a tolerance pact
struck between Zeman and the former premier, a presidential advisor
said Friday.
	   On Thursday, Havel said he would ``most probably'' name Zeman
premier but would seek outside counsel on whether the agreement
between the head of the Social Democrats and former Premier Vaclav
Klaus violates the constitution.
	   Under the agreement, Klaus' party will permit the formation of
the new minority government under Zeman by leaving parliament
during the vote on approval.
	   In exchange, Klaus' party will be allowed to appoint the
speakers of both chambers of Parliament and the chairmen of key
parliamentary committees.
	   Both parties also agreed not to initiate a non-confidence vote
during the lower chamber's four-year term and not to push to
dissolve the chamber before the term's end.
	   Each side also promised not to form a coalition or an alliance
with a third party to the detriment of each other's party.
	   Havel called the deal a ``non-standard solution'' adding he was
worried the two leaders could share power in the country for a long
time, obliterating the influence of small parties and limiting
political pluralism.
	   Under the agreement Zeman and Klaus control 137 seats in the
200-seat legislature.
	   ''It seems to me that despite the doubts he (Havel) will name
Milos Zeman premier,'' said Jiri Pehe, Havel's chief political
advisor.
	   At a press conference Friday, Zeman dismissed Havel's worries as
unfounded.
	   ``Usually many issues are debated within a (coalition)
government,'' Zeman said explaining the nature of the deal. ``In
this case, they will be debated in parliament,''
	   Zeman said the pact would in no way change the program of Social
Democrats published before the elections.
	   The program endorses membership in European Union and NATO and
continuation of free market reforms as his party's main priorities,
similarly to most other parties in parliament.

Retired Sao Tome coup officers stick with ultimatum, but negotiate

<TEXT>
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ Retired army officers who
tried to seize power in 1995 refused to withdraw an ultimatum for
the government to comply with a deal on retirement terms by Sunday,
but said they were willing to negotiate and would not take military
action.
	   The group of about 40 retired officers, who were involved in the
failed coup, issued the deadline last month, saying the government
had not kept its promise to give them financial compensation and
farmland as part of a deal to end the coup attempt in this former
Portuguese colony off the coast of West Africa.
	   The officers did not say what they might do if their demands
were not met.
	   A spokesman for the group said late Thursday they would not
withdraw the ultimatum because they believed it was the only way of
keeping the government at the negotiating table.
	   ``We won't do anything that threatens peace or dialogue,''
retired Lt. Mario Macedo told a news conference.
	   Macedo had met earlier Thursday with government-appointed
negotiator Lt. Antonio Taty da Costa, but neither side would give
details of the talks.
	   President Miguel Trovoada appealed for calm and said the dispute
``must be resolved through dialogue, not threats.''
	   The 1995 coup bid saw Trovoada arrested, held prisoner in his
own offices for a week and parliament disbanded.
	   The rebels surrendered a week later after the United States and
the European Union threatened to cut off vital aid.
	   A coalition government was installed and is still in power.
	   Never charged with the mutiny, the officers are regarded as
influential figures in the top ranks of an army which in recent
months has been unsettled by disputes over low pay.
	   General elections are scheduled for October in this twin-island
African nation, located about 200 kilometers (125 miles) off the
West coast of Gabon. It gained independence in 1975.
	   Since Trovoada was elected president in the nation's first
democratic elections in 1991, Sao Tome's economy has slumped. About
65 percent of the population of 130,000 live in abject poverty and
45 percent are unemployed.

India's prime minister keen to meet Pakistani counterpart
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said
Friday he looks forward to meeting with his Pakistani counterpart
later this month, when the two will discuss the issues that led
their countries into two wars and a nuclear arms race.
	   ``India and Pakistan have to live together. We can't change the
geography and will have to live like good neighbors,'' United News
of India news agency quoted Vajpayee as telling parliament.
	   Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will meet in
the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, during a regular summit of a
seven-nation regional group.
	   Vajpayee told parliament that India is prepared for talks with
Pakistan _ without the involvement of any other nation _ in
resolving their disputes, chiefly their competing claims to the
Himalayan state of Kashmir.
	   He renewed his call on Pakistan to enter into a no-first-use
nuclear weapons accord with India.
	   Vajpayee also said India is keen to resolve a border dispute
with China that has chilled relations between both nations.
	   India detonated a series of underground nuclear tests in May,
saying it needed a nuclear deterrence because of security threats
from China and Pakistan. Pakistan responded with its own tests.
	   The United States, Britain, Japan and other industrialized
nations imposed economic and military sanctions on both India and
Pakistan. They urged both to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
	   India says the treaties are flawed because they allow nations
with sophisticated nuclear weapons to keep their arsenals.
	   On Friday, Vajpayee said India is prepared to discuss the test
ban treaty.
	   ``However, nobody should feel that we are ready to participate
because we are weak,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, India's envoy Jaswant Singh met with U.S. counterpart
Strobe Talbott in Frankfurt, Germany, on Thursday, for the second
round of talks on their nuclear differences. Details of the talks
were not made public.
	   Also Thursday, the U.S. Senate voted unanimously to exempt
agriculture credits from nuclear sanctions imposed on Pakistan and
India. The move will help U.S. farmers who are desperate for
markets sell wheat and other products in South Asia.

Thai housing authority to bail out property projects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda
said Friday that the government would inject funds into state-owned
National Housing Authority to bail out troubled property projects.
	   Tarrin told reporters the authority has allocated 10 billion
baht (dlrs 240 million) for investment in the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1, part of which can be spent buying projects from private
developers now short of cash.
	   The funds would amount to a lifeline to parts of the property
sector, which has been battered by a year-old economic crisis that
ended a period of speculation leaving Bangkok with one of the
world's most overbuilt property markets.
	   The authority is an enterprise under the Interior Ministry
responsible for developing residential units for people with low
income. Tarrin said priority for the bailout would be given to
projects near completion.
	   The authority has reported receiving requests for financial
assistance from 345 projects, with a combined 39,220 units. It said
it would need 25 billion (dlrs 600 million) to bail out all of
them.
	   The current recession had dried up funds for developers to
complete projects, leaving many buildings unfinished.
	   Tarrin said he would ask commercial banks to extend the terms of
their housing loans from the current maximum of 20 years to 30
years.
	   The government is also studying amending laws to lift the ban on
foreigners owning land and to raise the number of units foreigners
can own in a condominium building above the current 40 percent.

Mandela to address South American trade bloc
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela will
address heads of state of six Latin American countries when he
attends an economic summit in Argentina this month, the foreign
ministry said Friday.
	   The South African president will be the first head of state from
outside Latin America to address the heads of state of Brazil,
Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia and Chile when he speaks
before the Mercosur summit, to be held in Ushuaia, Argentina, from
July 19 to 25, the foreign ministry said.
	   Mercosur is a trading block formed by Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay
and Argentina. Chile and Bolivia are associate members.
	   Mandela, 79, is stepping down next year and is making a flurry
of foreign trips to cement political and economic links after
decades of isolation during apartheid.
	   South Africa was negotiating bilateral agreements with Latin
American countries, including Brazil and Argentina, involving
commerce, science, culture, sport and security, the foreign
ministry said.
	   Mandela will also pay official visits to Brazil and Argentina
for the first time. Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
and President Carlos Menem of Argentina visited South Africa in
1997 and 1995 respectively and invited Mandela to their countries.

Prince's publicity may be scaring off applicants for navy unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ News coverage of Crown Prince
Frederik's arduous training in the Danish Navy's elite frogman unit
may be scaring off applicants for the corps, the navy fears.
	   In the early 1990s, about 500 candidates applied every year for
the 24 positions available in the corps. This year, that number
fell to 60.
	   ``Our theory is that the huge publicity around the crown
prince's training has accentuated the myth how hard it is to become
a frogman,'' Commander Mogens Christens was quoted as saying in the
Berlingske Tidende newspaper on Friday.
	   ``Nowadays young people want ... activities like bungee-jumping
where they pay, jump and it's over. They want to try things but
they don't want to give too much up,'' Christens said.
	   The heir to the Danish throne started the eight-month training
course in 1995, and TV showed extensive footage of him undergoing
the rigors.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A government agency meant to build
bridges between indigenous Indonesians and the ethnic Chinese
minority said Friday it was investigating 468 cases of Chinese
women allegedly raped when riots broke out in May.
	   During the riots, which helped oust former President Suharto
from office, mobs attacked Chinese homes and businesses in their
search for scapegoats for the country's worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   The National Unity Development Board said it had interviewed
many victims, their families and witnesses.
	   Some victims had testified that they had been raped in front of
their parents, said Rosita Noer, the board's chairwoman. A number
had been hospitalized, many had been traumatized, and at least one
later committed suicide.
	   Women's groups have said that rape was used as a method of
intimidation against Chinese families during the riots, in which as
many as 1,200 people died.
	   Mostly Christian and Buddhist Chinese make up only a fraction of
Indonesia's largely Muslim 202 million population. They dominate
commerce and industry, and are often targeted in bad times.
	   On Thursday the National Human Rights Commission described the
pattern of rapes as ``systematic.''
	   It castigated the military for being slow to stop the violence
and demanded the government apologize for not protecting its
citizens.
	   Following complaints official inaction, Suharto's successor
President B.J. Habibie formed a task force to investigate rape
allegations.
	   The official Antara news agency reported the military had also
ordered the police to launch a separate investigation.
	   Social workers say many rape victims are too shamed or afraid to
go to the police.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's once-mighty sports program has been
crippled by funding cuts, but Moscow hopes the first-ever World
Youth Games will help to rebuild the country's rich athletic
tradition.
	   The games, which begin Saturday and run through July 19, are
expected to draw 5,000 participants from 130 countries. The
athletes, ages 12 to 17, will compete in 15 medal events, such as
track and field and soccer. There will also be demonstration sports
such as American football, street basketball, and mountain biking.
	   Moscow's ambitious Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who appointed himself
chairman of the games organizing committee, has staged a media
blitz to drum up support, casting it as an event that will help
unite the nation.
	   The games appear well-organized, but there are no big-name
performers and the events are not expected to draw large crowds or
much interest outside Moscow.
	   On Friday, Luzhkov complained to President Boris Yeltsin that
Russia's three main television stations are not planning to
broadcast the Youth Games.
	   Luzhkov has sunk 200 million rubles (more than dlrs 30 million)
into the games, according to organizers. He has also spent large
sums on stadium renovations and infrastructure repair around the
city.
	   ``Things have exceeded our expectations so far,'' said Bill
Wenninger, the spokesman for the U.S. team. ``The Olympic village
has been great, and the venues are in excellent shape.''
	   Unlike the rest of Russia, Moscow is relatively rich and Luzhkov
said he was not concerned about whether the city would recoup its
large investment.
	   ``The World Youth Games will be conducted absolutely free of
mercantilism,'' the mayor said Thursday.
	   The benefit, city officials say, will be in demonstrating that
Russia is again capable of handling a large sporting event.
	   ``One of the reasons for these games is to show that Moscow is
ready to hold such events, despite a number of problems,'' said
Rudolph Nevetsky, a spokesman for the games' press service. ``If
these go normally, then Moscow will make (an Olympic) bid.''
	   Russia's second largest city, St. Petersburg, made a bid to host
the 2004 Olympics, but didn't make it to the final round. The
city's poor infrastructure and facilities played a large part in
its failure.
	   Russia is still producing world-class athletes, but many of its
best hockey players, figure skaters and tennis players have fled to
the West to perform professionally or find better training
facilities.
	   The Youth Games also are partly sponsored by the International
Olympic Committee, and Luzhkov has played up this connection.
	   The Olympic rings adorn billboards all over the city, the
Olympic flame is making it's way from Athens, and past Olympic
champions will take part in the opening ceremonies.
	   Despite all the fanfare, the games haven't generated much
enthusiasm among Russian sports fans, and there's been conflicting
information about ticket sales.
	   At the games' information bureau, one spokesman said tickets
would be available at the event venues for a small price. Another
said they would be distributed free throughout the city.
	   A third official promised to call back with details. And a
fourth, angry at the imposition, said adults would not be admitted
to events.
	   ``These tickets have all been given to children,'' said a
spokeswoman, who refused to give her name. ``Why do you want to go?
There will be nothing for adults to do there.''

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Committee of the Red Cross said
Friday that six of its workers abducted two weeks ago by gunmen in
southeastern Ethiopia have been freed.
	   The six, five Ethiopians and a Swiss delegate, are safe and well
and should soon be reunited with their families, Red Cross
spokesman Michael Kleiner said from the organization's Geneva
headquarters.
	   The group were released earlier Friday at a prearranged
countryside location in the region and were picked up by
colleagues, said Kleiner.
	   The abducted workers had contacted the Red Cross by telephone on
Thursday to say they were to be released Friday, Kleiner said.
	   The group is due to arrive at the ICRC office in Gode later
Friday.
	   The group disappeared June 25 in the southeastern region of
Ogaden, which is largely populated by ethnic Somalis.
	   Kleiner said the workers were released without conditions. He
said the ICRC hasn't any details about the identity of the
abductors or their motives.
	   The ICRC tightened up the security of its operations in the
region after the group was abducted, including reducing the number
of movements of Red Cross workers.
	   Kleiner said the organization would consider whether any further
measures were needed after meeting with the six released workers.

	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ More than 70 people have died this
week in floods caused by heavy runoff from melting glaciers along
the border of ex-Soviet republics of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan,
officials said on Friday.
	   In Uzbekistan alone, rescuers have recovered 71 bodies from the
Shakhimardan-Sai river in Uzbekistan that flooded villages in the
Ferghan Valley, local emergency officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on the number of victims in
Kyrgyzstan, where the Ak-Suu river also swelled after a spell of
hot weather, destroying six villages.

Marie-Jose Perec pulls out of European Championships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Track star Marie-Jose Perec, suffering from a
severe virus, has pulled out of the European Championships in
Budapest next month.
	   The three-time Olpymic champion told the Le Parisien daily she
was diagnosed with the Epstein-Barr virus in Los Angeles, and has
been virtually bedridden for the past month.
	   Perec said she's coughing hard, can't run and is in no condition
to prepare for event in Budapest Aug. 18-23.
	   She said the virus has affected her heartbeat, boosting it to 90
_ twice its normal rate.
	   ``That's much too fast,'' Perec told reporters.
	   ``I'm sleeping all the time,'' she said, adding her doctors have
forbidden her to compete.
	   Perec said she hopes to be back on the track by the end of year,
and to compete until 2001.

Thailand bans antibiotic imports after Japanese chicken flap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand announced a ban Friday on an
antibiotic used as a growth agent in chicken feed after Japan said
it had found a potentially lethal bacteria linked to the additive
in imported Thai chicken.
	   Somchai Suntorawat, deputy minister of agriculture, told a news
conference that a letter has been sent to the Japanese government
assuring officials that Thailand's chicken processors do not use
the agent, Avoparcin, in feed.
	   Avoparcin has been banned in the European Union and Japan after
being linked to the development of Vancomycin Resistant
Enterococus, an intestinal bacteria resistant to antibiotics that
can kill people who are old or have weak immune systems.
	   The Thai ban was aimed at reassuring Japan, the largest importer
of Thai chicken. Somchai said an investigation had been launched
into how traces of Avoparcin came to be found in chicken exported
to Japan.
	   ``I will lead the delegation to Japan as soon as the Japanese
government agrees, to explain the matter to Japan's authorities and
assure them of the quality of Thai chickens,'' Somchai said.
	   Anan Sirimongkolkasem, president of the Thai Broiler Processing
Exporters Association, said Thai producers haven't used Avoparcin
for five years because it is too expensive.
	   Only one company in Thailand _ Roche Co., a unit of the
antibiotic's developer Roche Holding AG of Switzerland _ now
imports Avoparcin into Thailand.
	   Thailand is expected this year to export 144,004 tons of chicken
to Japan this year, about 60 percent of Thai chicken exports.

Red Cross says kidnapped workers freed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; ADDS name of region and further background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Committee of the Red Cross said
Friday that six of its workers abducted two weeks ago by gunmen in
southeastern Ethiopia have been freed.
	   The six, five Ethiopians and a Swiss delegate, are safe and well
and should soon be reunited with their families, Red Cross
spokesman Michael Kleiner said from the organization's Geneva
headquarters.
	   The group were released earlier Friday at a prearranged
countryside location in the southeastern Ogaden region and were
picked up by colleagues, said Kleiner.
	   The abducted workers had contacted the Red Cross by telephone on
Thursday to say they were to be released Friday, Kleiner said.
	   The group is due to arrive at the ICRC office in Gode later
Friday.
	   The group disappeared June 25 in the region, which is largely
populated by ethnic Somalis.
	   Kleiner said the workers were released without conditions. He
said the ICRC hasn't any details about the identity of the
abductors or their motives.
	   Strict security surrounds Red Cross operations in the region,
where Ethiopian troops and fighters of the Islamic fundamentalist
group Al-Itihad Al-Jihad have clashed.
	   The ICRC further tightened up the security of its operations
after the group was abducted, including reducing the number of
movements of Red Cross workers.
	   Kleiner said the organization would consider whether any further
measures were needed after meeting with the six released workers.
	   An Austrian student held hostage in the Ogaden for more than two
months was freed in April.
	   A splinter group of the independence-seeking Ogaden National
Front claimed responsibility for taking her hostage, but its
motives were unclear.

Coulthard, Hakkinen 1-2 in free practice at British GP
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Hakkinen fined for speeding in pit lane; adds speed &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ David Coulthard turned the quickest
time in Friday's free-practice session for Sunday's British Grand
Prix, edging McLaren-Mercedes teammate and Formula One leader Mika
Hakkinen.
	   Coulthard clocked 1 minute 25.640 seconds, just in front of
Hakkinen in 1:25.764. Coulthard's average speed was 216.067 kph
(134.262 mph).
	   Williams-Mecachrone, in the midst of a poor season, got third
with Heinz-Harald Frentzen in 1:26.107 and teammate Jacques
Villeneuve in 1:26.114. Michael Schumacher's Ferrari was seventh
fastest in 1:26.884.
	   Hakkinen leads the series standings with 50 points to 44 for
two-time series champion Schumacher and 30 for Coulthard.
	   The official qualifying is Saturday.
	   Some of the edge came off Hakkinen's day as he was fined dlrs
3,250 for speeding in the pit lane.
	   This is the ninth F1 of the season and one of the McLaren cars
has taken the pole in every race. Hakkinen has claimed five and
Coulthard three.
	   Sunday's British Grand Prix, which kicks off the second half of
the season, is 60 laps on the 5.140-kilometer (3.194-mile)
Silverstone circuit, known for its mix of high-speed turns.
	   French-Canadian Villeneuve, last year's series champion, has won
the last two British GPs but looks like a longshot to repeat.
	   He has only 11 points this season and has yet to finish in the
top three. Williams _ winners of five of the last six constructors'
titles _ has slipped behind McLaren and Ferrari in the new
grooved-tire era of F1.
	   On Thursday, Villeneuve and Schumacher turned down a suggestion
that Formula One needs a code of driving conduct.
	   Villeneuve, who says Schumacher's driving puts others ``at
risk,'' suggested, instead, he might take matters into his own
hands.
	   ``I think it would be very difficult to have a written code of
conduct,'' he said. ``It's very difficult from the outside to know
what someone is doing inside his car. You just need mutual respect.
Once you know what people do, then you just pay them back.''
	   Villeneuve, sitting three feet (one meter) away from Schumacher,
left little doubt about who he was referring to.
	   The Canadian criticized Schumacher's driving tactics in last
month's Canadian Grand Prix. In that race, Villeneuve's Williams'
teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen was nearly forced off the track by
Schumacher.
	   ``Taking risks for yourself is one thing, putting other people
at risk is another thing,'' Villeneuve said about that race. ``It
goes beyond what I believe is acceptable.''
	   The last big episode in the Schumacher-Villeneuve feud goes back
to the 1997 season-ending race. In that race, Schumacher
intentionally rammed Villeneuve as the Canadian tried to overtake.
Schumacher's car spun off the track and Villeneuve went on to take
the series championship.
	   The governing body of motor sport _ the FIA _ later slapped
Schumacher on the wrist, stripping him of his second-place finish
in the final standings. Some suggested he should have been banned
for a season, or at least a few races.
	   Schumacher said Thursday the FIA should better enforce its
rules. Ironically, some observers said it was the FIA's lax
enforcement that let Schumacher off the hook last season.
	   ``Some of the drivers I can imagine don't know now what is the
rule and what isn't the rule. And that's what has to happen,'' said
Schumacher, a two-time world champion.
	   ``The rule is the FIA _ and they have to give us the
guidelines.''

Britain tightens controls on nuclear-related exports to India,

Pakistan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain announced Friday it is tightening its
already strict controls on the export of nuclear-related goods to
India and Pakistan following their recent nuclear tests.
	   Under new measures announced by Foreign Office Minister Tony
Lloyd, Britain will deny all export license applications for items
that are on the international Nuclear Suppliers Group's dual-use
list.
	   ``We will also consider export license applications for military
items and other dual-use equipment to either country with
particular vigilance,'' he said in a written answer to a
Parliamentary question.
	   Indians and Pakistanis will also be banned from visiting British
nuclear facilities, and contacts by British nuclear scientists and
personnel with Indians and Pakistanis will be discouraged, Lloyd
said.
	   ``Both countries have demonstrated their lack of commitment to
the principles of nonproliferation and damaged the stability of
South Asia,'' he said. ``Under these regrettable circumstances, it
is right that we should deny the export of nuclear-related goods to
India and Pakistan where they could assist their nuclear
programmes.''

Hard-line Protestants test police lines at Drumcree, warn of worse

 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from Blair, UPDATES with comment from union
leader, police figures on incidents &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Leaders of Northern Ireland's
new Assembly sought Friday to drum up support for compromise over a
blocked Protestant march, but a spokesman for the marchers said he
feared a lethal clash pitting Protestant hard-liners against police
and soldiers.
	   Four police officers were hospitalized Friday morning after
surgery for injuries from bomb shrapnel and a fifth was admitted
after being hit by ball bearings fired from a crowd of 20,000 or
more massed near a rural church outside Portadown, 25 miles (40
kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   Police fired plastic bullets at demonstrators who breached
security barriers, and arrested nine people. It was the fifth night
of violence since authorities stopped a march by the Orange Order
from passing through a hostile Catholic neighborhood.
	   ``The incidents last night are deplored by ourselves, but it is
understandable. People see that peaceful protest isn't getting them
anywhere,'' said David Jones, a spokesman for the Orange Order,
Northern Ireland's largest Protestant brotherhood.
	   ``Is (Prime Minister) Tony Blair really prepared to have another
Bloody Sunday, only this time in Portadown, County Armagh?'' Jones
said, referring to the 1972 clash in which British soldiers killed
13 unarmed Catholic demonstrators in Londonderry. He said 25
civilians were injured by plastic bullets at Drumcree overnight.
	   ``I understand that there are strongly held views on either
side, but the rule of law is paramount,'' Blair said in a
television interview. He remained in touch with Orange leaders in
hope of finding a compromise to end the crisis, his office said.
	   David Trimble, the newly elected first minister of Northern
Ireland's Assembly, and his deputy, Seamus Mallon, were meeting
with religious, business and labor leaders hoping to drum up
support for compromise.
	   ``We haven't given up, nor will we give up. We will endeavour to
see what we can do to reach an accommodation,'' said Trimble, a
member of the Orange Order and leader of the Ulster Unionist Party,
which gets most of the Protestant vote in Northern Ireland.
	   From Sunday to 6 a.m. Friday, police had logged 550 attacks on
police and army personnel, including 15 shooting incidents, 151
arrests, 548 gasoline bomb attacks, 103 attacks on homes, and 367
attacks on vehicles. Through Thursday morning, police said they had
fired 216 plastic bullets.
	   ``Jobs have been lost, property has been destroyed,'' said Tom
Gillen of the Irish Trades Union Conference, who met with Trimble
and Mallon. ``At a time we hoped young people would get work
through New Deal (a government program), they're out in the street
burning their prospects and their parents' prospects.''

Stock market hits new low, rupee further weakened

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The stock market tumbled 55 points _
hitting another all-time low _ and the beleaguered Pakistani rupee
lost 20 percent on the open market Friday.
	   Stock brokers and economists blamed the grim economic
performance on fears that Pakistan is on the brink of either
defaulting on this month's debt payment or seeking a moratorium.
	   Fears were heightened following a two-day visit to Pakistan by
International Monetary Fund director Paul Chabrier, who held a
joint press conference on Thursday with Finance Minister Sartaj
Aziz.
	   Chabrier said his visit found Pakistan in dire economic straits.
He said there were no guarantees that the Fund would restart loans
stalled after sanctions were imposed to punish Pakistan for
exploding six nuclear devices in May.
	   ``There is complete panic in the market,'' said Yasin Lakhani,
president of the Karachi Stock Exchange.
	   Earlier Friday, the market tumbled 80 points, but by the end of
the day it had made a slight recovery closing at 777.26, down 55
points from Thursday's close of 833.
	   At one point in the day the Pakistani rupee was trading at 66
rupees to the dollar on the open market, traders said.
	   The sanctions will stop dlrs 1.5 billion in loans to Pakistan
while India, which faces similar sanctions, will be denied dlrs 3
billion. The sanctions imposed by donor countries will also affect
loans given by the Asian Development Bank and World Bank.
	   Also affecting the market was a story in Pakistan's leading
business newspaper, The Daily Dawn, which said that the United
States would not offer Pakistan a bailout plan.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of that comment from the
State Department, but Lakhani said it was enough to send the stock
market in a tailspin.
	   Lakhani and several other economists also said that investor
confidence has been shattered by the rapidly changing policies
being spelled out almost daily by the State Bank of Pakistan.
	   The latest announcement on Thursday said that it would no longer
sell dollars at the official rate to Pakistanis traveling abroad.
Payments will be made on an emergency basis and dollar payments
that can be deferred will be.
	   Mudasir Malik, a stock broker, said investors want to get their
money out of Pakistan.
	   ``They are selling at any price and taking their money out of
the country through informal channels,'' he said.
	   Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves stand at about dlrs 800
million, which is barely enough to pay for six weeks of imports.
	   If Pakistan either defaults or declares a moratorium its imports
are likely to be the first casualty. A default means that
Pakistan's line of credit would not be honored and imports would
dry up. That covers everything from heating oil to cooking oil.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO security agents nabbed 10

documents.
	   The protesters, calling themselves citizen-inspectors, wanted
documents from NATO's Nuclear Planning Group. They claimed that a
ruling by the International Court of Justice in the Hague two years
ago said the use of nuclear weapons and threat of their use was
illegal.
	   The 10, from several European nations, were turned over to
Belgian police.
	   A NATO spokesman, who spoke on condition he not be identified,
declined to say how long the protesters were inside the perimeter
or how far they got before they were apprehended.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, asked about the state of
security at the 16-nation alliance's headquarters here, merely
laughed heartily and said: ``Ah, come on!''
	   A delegation from the protesting group, which used the name
Nuclear Weapons Abolition Days Network, visited NATO headquarters
on Wednesday and spoke with a member of the information department.
	   ``They wanted to see details of the weapons deployed by NATO
nuclear states,'' the spokesman said, adding that officials had
tried to explain NATO nuclear policy to the protesters.
	   ``It wasn't very clear what they wanted,'' the spokesman said.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Police used tear gas and batons Friday to
disperse some 5,000 farmers from across Poland who gathered in
downtown Warsaw to demand government protection for farms and fewer
imports.
	   Scuffles broke out when police moved to force open a main street
that had been blocked by the protesters, causing huge traffic jams.
No injuries or arrests were reported.
	   The farmers, with banners reading ``Foreign (European) Union
capital threatens the future of Poland's farming,'' and ``Buy
Polish Products,'' were angry about imports of grain and sugar and
demanded cheap credits and government guarantees that all grain
they produce this year will be bought.
	   ``We want the government to buy our products, but they let in
foreign products to destroy us,'' said Jan Groniec, 62, from the
northeastern region of Suwalki.
	   The protesters also demanded that at least 3 percent of state
spending be funneled to agriculture and wanted to meet with Finance
Minister Leszek Balcerowicz. Instead, a ministry official gave them
a receipt for a goat they offered the ministry, without
explanation.
	   On Tuesday, Agriculture Minister Jacek Janiszewski said the
government will introduce grain import quotas on Aug. 6. He also
said the government has approved increased subsidies for
agriculture.
	   Experts say Polish farms _ small and ill-equipped _ need to be
consolidated and made more efficient in preparation for Poland's
membership in the European Union. The powerful 4-million-strong
farmer lobby has resisted reforms.

Giants beat Tigers 5-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hideki Matsui hit a two-run homer in the bottom of
the eighth inning to lift the Yomiuri Giants to a 5-2 victory over
the Hanshin Tigers on Friday.
	   Matsui now leads the Central League with 17 home runs this
season.
	   With the victory, the Giants moved to half a game behind the
second-place Chunichi Dragons, who were idle Friday.
	   It was the third loss in a row for the last place Tigers.
	   At Hiroshima, Itsuki Asai hit a two-run homer in the bottom of
the fifth inning as the Hiroshima Toyo Carp beat the Yakult
Swallows 8-5 at home.
	   The victory was the Carp's fourth in a row.
	   Carp starter Shinichi Kato gave up nine hits, struck out six and
walked one in seven innings and picked up his fourth victory this
season.
	   In Pacific League action, Kazuya Fukuura hit a winning solo
homer in the bottom of the 10th inning as the Chiba Lotte Marines
ended a seesaw game, edging the front-running Nippon Ham Fighters
8-7 at home.
	   Marines' Kenji Morozumi singled to drive in a run for a 7-7 tie
in the eighth.
	   At Osaka Dome, the Kintetsu Buffaloes rapped out 14 hits,
overwhelming the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 11-2.
	   Phil Clark drove in three runs on a double before Tuffy Rhodes
doubled in another run in the bottom of a seven-run fourth inning.
Both Clark and Rhodes previously played for the Boston Red Sox.
	   Buffaloes starter Masaki Maki allowed five runs and walked two,
while striking out two in seven innings to pick up his second win
this season.
	   Friday's loss was the second in a row for the Hawks, which
slipped to the league's fourth place.
	   No other games were scheduled for Friday.

Cypriot defense minister meets Russian counterpart
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's defense minister congratulated Cyprus on
Friday for successfully training with the missile system Russia is
selling them, a news agency reported.
	   Igor Sergeyev, in meetings with Cypriot Defense Minister
Yiannakis Omerou, said S-300 anti-aircraft missile tests conducted
Thursday had gone smoothly, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The two ministers also reaffirmed their commitment to military
technology sharing, Interfax reported.
	   Russia's plans to sell the system to the Greek half of the
island have prompted denunciations from Turkey, which has
threatened military action. The missiles could reach targets over
southern Turkey.
	   Cyprus has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion sparked by
an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. The breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Turkey.
	   The United Nations has also voiced concern over Russia's sale of
the missiles to Cyprus, fearing they could escalate the conflict.

Red Cross says kidnapped workers freed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Committee of the Red Cross said
Friday that gunmen had freed six of its workers abducted two weeks
ago in southeastern Ethiopia.
	   The six, five Ethiopians and a Swiss, are in good health and
should soon be reunited with their families, Red Cross spokesman
Michael Kleiner said from the organization's Geneva headquarters.
	   The group, adbucted on June 25 were released earlier Friday in
the southeastern Ogaden region and were picked up by colleagues,
said Kleiner.
	   The abducted workers had contacted the Red Cross by telephone on
Thursday to say they were to be released Friday, Kleiner said.
	   The group is due to arrive at the ICRC office in Gode later
Friday.
	   Kleiner said the workers were released without conditions and
the ICRC has no details on the abductors or their motives.
	   Strict security surrounds Red Cross operations in the region,
where Ethiopian troops and fighters of the Islamic fundamentalist
group Al-Itihad Al-Jihad have clashed.
	   The ICRC further tightened up the security of its operations
after the group was abducted, including reducing the number of
movements of Red Cross workers.
	   Kleiner said the organization would consider whether any further
measures were needed after meeting with the six released workers.
	   An Austrian student held hostage in the Ogaden for more than two
months was freed in April.
	   A splinter group of the independence-seeking Ogaden National
Front claimed responsibility for taking her hostage, but its
motives were unclear.

Mounting losses for cargo handler; government to start

investigation
 &UR; Eds: ADDS financial secretary expects cargo problems to cut 0.1
percent off GDP in grafs 4-5
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Under increasing pressure over the worsening
cargo situation at the new airport, the government announced Friday
that an independent body would be set up to find out what went
wrong and who's to blame.
	   The move came after Chek Lap Kok's main cargo handler announced
a temporary halt on nearly all cargo shipments. Merchants were
suffering because of the cargo problems.
	   Chief Secretary Anson Chan, Hong Kong's top civil servant, said
the government would appoint two outside experts and an influential
figure from Hong Kong ``to establish what went wrong and where the
responsibility lies.'' The names of the commission members will be
announced later.
	   Cargo handling problems at the new airport could shave 0.1
percent off Hong Kong's Gross Domestic Product this year, Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang.
	   ``I would not be surprised that we would lose something like
point one percent of the GDP because of the stoppages,'' said
Tsang.
	   Problems started with the opening Monday of the territory's new
dlrs 20 billion airport, located on an outlying island about 30
kilometers (22 miles) west of the city center.
	   While passenger services have improved slowly but steadily after
a rocky start, it has become increasingly clear that the cargo
operation was not ready for the move from old, downtown Kai Tak
airport.
	   After shifting some operations back to Kai Tak and placing a
temporary embargo on some shipments, the main cargo handler, Hong
Kong Air Cargo Terminals, took more drastic action overnight.
	   The government said the handler had informed officials it was
halting nearly all cargo shipments through Hong Kong for nine days,
except for a few items including in-bound perishables, newspapers
and magazines, and lifesaving materials.
	   Anthony Charter, the main cargo handler's managing director,
said the embargo was needed to solve software and mechanical
problems.
	   He told reporters later Friday that the embargo will cost the
firm 5 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs. 641,000) a day. The
company handles 5,000 tons of freight daily, worth 1.7 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 217 million).
	   James Tien, chairman of Hong Kong's General Chamber of Commerce,
told Hong Kong radio that businessmen appreciated the cargo handler
giving a firm reopening date.
	   He also raised the pressure on Chan and Hong Kong Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa. The airport problems ``prompted investors
around the world to question the government's ability to administer
Hong Kong,'' Tien said.
	   He said he was surprised that neither Tung nor Chan had been to
the airport to show their concern. Chan was there when it opened
Monday morning.
	   On Friday morning, only one of 12 seafood stalls was open in one
of the markets in the tourist and shopping district of Tsimshatsui,
and that was only selling local fish.
	   Other stalls were hosed clean, their walk-in refrigerators
locked, garbage removed, and lights switched off. Where some of
Hong Kong's top chefs and discriminating housewives shopped for
fresh Norwegian salmon, Japanese tuna, and Australian oysters, less
than a handful of buyers were choosing only among the local fish.
	   Sandy Kwong, who sells U.S. cherries, New Zealand kiwis, and
Philippine mangoes at the same market, reported big losses due to
the disruption in cargo handling.
	   ``The system at the new airport is very disorganized,'' Kwong
said. ``If you want to order fresh artichokes now, you have to tell
me three days in advance.''
	   Hong Kong is one of the busiest air cargo centers in the world,
and the Tsimshatsui market one of the more impressive wholesalers
in the territory.
	   Although prices seemed stable, many flower vendors at the
Tsimshatsui market were eager to sell the few lilies and roses from
Holland _ wilting in the heat and brown at the edges _ that they
had left.
	   The Hong Kong Standard newspaper estimated the ban would cost
the territory at least 23 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 2.97
billion).
	   The government said it was ``gravely concerned'' that the
moratorium was necessary. ``This would clearly disrupt trade and
impact adversely on our economic performance in the short term,''
it said.

Turkey calls for military action in Kosovo if diplomacy fails
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin on Friday
reportedly called for a military intervention in Serbia's
rebellious Kosovo province if no diplomatic solution is found.
	   ``If we can't solve it with diplomatic means, we have to use our
forces,'' the semi-official Anatolia news agency quoted Sezgin as
saying before his meeting with Albanian Defense Minister Luan
Haydaraga.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and independence-seeking ethnic
Albanian rebels has killed hundreds of people since February, and
there are fears the conflict could disrupt the Balkans' fragile
stability.
	   ``If the incidents spread out of Kosovo, there will be no peace
and stability in the Balkans,'' President Suleyman Demirel said on
Friday.
	   Demirel is expected to visit Albania on July 14.
	   After meeting in Bonn on Wednesday, the six-nation Contact Group
on the Balkans _ with diplomats from Germany, the United States,
Russia, France, Britain and Italy _ demanded an immediate
cease-fire in the rebellious Kosovo province.
	   Turkey, which sees Albania as a natural ally because of its
predominantly Muslim population, also donated dlrs 5 million in
military aid to Albania Friday to help rebuild its army, whose
munition depots were looted during a popular revolt in March.
	   Turkey also trains some 600 Albanian soldiers here.

Iraqi Kurdish group chases Kurdish rebels in Iraq to help Turks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An Iraqi Kurdish group has been chasing
Turkish Kurdish rebels in Iraq to help Turkish troops in a new
offensive against the rebels, the semi-official Anatolia news
agency said Friday.
	   Reports of the operation by the Kurdistan Democratic Party, the
Iraqi Kurdish group, came just two days after Turkish warplanes
began bombing suspected rebel bases in the Turkish province of
Hakkari, at the convergence of the borders of Iraq, Iran and Turkey
meet.
	   Rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party were being encircled in
the Iraq's Amadiyah region, the report said.
	   The agency said Turkish jets were also shelling Amadiyah, but it
was not clear if the Turkish troops had crossed into Iraqi
territory.
	   The military and the representatives of the Iraqi group were not
available for comment.
	   Both private NTV television and the Anatolia said the rebels
suffered heavy casualties without providing any figures.
	   Turkey has carried out many cross-border offensives against
Turkish Kurdish guerrillas, who are fighting for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since 1984. The rebels often launch hit-and-run
attacks from their bases in northern Iraq.

Four Brazilians, four Frenchmen on FIFA All-Stars

	   PARIS (AP) _ Eight players who will appear in Sunday's World Cup
final, including Brazil's Ronaldo and France's Marcel Desailly,
made the FIFA All-Star Team for France 98.
	   The 16-man team, chosen by the FIFA Technical Study Group and
sponsored by MasterCard, also has three players from the
Netherlands, two from Paraguay and Denmark and one from Croatia.
	   Ronaldo, a striker for Inter Milan, and Desailly, a defender
from AC Milan, often have faced each other in Italian league play.
In the championship game, they'll be matched once again as Brazil
seeks its fifth title and France goes for its first.
	   ``We recognized players we think brought dimension to the
competition or added value to their teams' performances,'' Gerard
Houllier of the technical committee said at the announcement
Friday. ``We are aware many other players could have been in this
group.''
	   Joining Ronaldo from Brazil are defender Roberto Carlos and
midfielders Rivaldo and Dunga. The other French players were
goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, defender Lilian Thuram and midfielder
Zinedine Zidane, who was selected despite missing two games with a
suspension.
	   The Dutch selections were striker Dennis Bergkamp, midfielder
Edgar Davids and defender Frank de Boer.
	   Paraguay goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert and defender Carlos
Gamarra also were chosen, along with Danish brothers Michael
Laudrup, a midfielder, and Brian Laudrup, a striker, and Croatia's
Davor Suker.
	   Pele, a spokesman for MasterCard _ which will donate dlrs 50,000
in the names of the players to SOS Children's Village, FIFA's
official charity _ said the matchup of Ronaldo and Desailly
``should be wonderful'' because they have been such standouts
during the tournament.
	   ``Ronaldo started with physical problems, but his performance
has grown and he has showed that in the last two games,'' Pele
said. ``Desailly has been the best defender in the World Cup.''
	   Suker is tied for the goal scoring lead with five, while Ronaldo
has four. Bergkamp and Rivaldo each have three each, with Bergkamp
scoring perhaps the finest goal in the tournament on a long pass
from de Boer to beat Argentina in the dying moments.
	   Thuram had both of France's goals in the semifinal victory over
Croatia.
	   Pele mentioned the leadership of such players as Dunga, the
Brazilian captain, and de Boer, the Dutch captain, as being a
factor in choosing an all-star squad.
	   ``You need players who organize,'' he said. ``Dunga is like a
player who brings up the confidence in a team. He will shout at
players, fight with them to push them to do their best.
	   ``This is important to a team. You must have someone who takes
those opportunities.''
	   Dunga is the only repeat from the 1994 team, on which Bergkamp
was an honorable mention.
	   Six players were chosen as reserves and Houllier said the
committee had its eyes on the future when it made those selections:
goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar of the Netherlands; midfielders Jay
Jay Okocha of Nigeria and Juan Veron of Argentina; and strikers
Christian Vieri of Italy, Michael Owen of England and Thierry Henry
of France.

Trevor Rees-Jones sues French magazine for `fake' interview
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones has filed suit against
a French tabloid for publishing what he calls a ``fake'' interview
quoting him as blaming Dodi Fayed for the crash that killed
Princess Diana.
	   His lawyer, Christian Curtil, who represents the sole survivor
of the crash that killed the princess, Fayed and their driver last
year, has demanded 1 million francs (dollars 163,000) in damages.
	   The article appeared in Voici, a glossy photo magazine that
concentrates mainly on the private lives of the rich and famous.
	   Earlier this month, Rees-Jones issued an angry statement in
which he denied giving the interview.
	   ``Mr. Trevor Rees-Jones wishes to make it clear that he has
never met a journalist from the French magazine ``Voici,''' the
statement said.
	   The magazine said it had no immediate comment.
	   A civil court is to hear the case July 23.

Red Cross says workers abducted in Ethiopia freed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Six Red Cross workers abducted two weeks
ago by gunmen in southeastern Ethiopia were released Friday and are
in good health, both the Red Cross and their captors said.
	   The one Swiss and five Ethiopians were set free after they made
radio contact with the International Committee of the Red Cross on
Wednesday and again on Thursday and were able to communicate their
location, ICRC spokeswoman Nina Galbe said.
	   ``It was dramatic. For two weeks we didn't know if they were
even alive. Then two days ago we got the first radio contact and
now, today, they were released,'' she said.
	   Galbe identified the Swiss man as Laurent Giger, 30, from
Neufchatel, who has worked for the Red Cross for seven years in
Somalia, Sudan, Afghanastan, and most recently, Ethiopia.
	   The identities of the five Ethiopians were not revealed upon
request of their families, Galbe said.
	   Galbe said the six aid workers were picked up by colleagues in
an unspecified location and were to arrive by vehicle later Friday
at the ICRC office in the southeastern Ethiopian town of Gode.
	   Galbe said she would not identify the kidnappers until the six
aid workers were debriefed.
	   But Al-Itihad Al-Islam, an armed Muslim group fighting for the
unification of southeastern Ethiopian Ogaden region with Somalia,
has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and on Friday
announced it released them after two weeks of ``investigation.''
	   Ibrahim Sheikh Omar, a spokesman for the group in the Somali
capital, Mogadishu, said the six ``were found guilty of conducting
business outside their duties, including the transportation of
money and fuel to government workers'' in Ogaden.
	   Omar said his group released the aid workers for humanitarian
reasons ``despite the guilty status proven on them.''
	   He said the hostages were freed at 14:00 (11:00 GMT) Friday and
were transferred to the custody of men he described as Somali
elders for handover to the Red Cross.
	   He did not say where the handover took place.
	   He said the hostages had been treated well during their
captivity were allowed to telephone home.
	   Omar said the only condition set for their release was that in
the future they must notify Al-Itihad officials in the region of
their movements in areas where the rebels are fighting Ethiopian
troops.
	   Galbe said neither money nor goods were involved in the release.
	   ``Although we are relieved, we are naturally concerned that
humanitarian agencies are targeted and workers are being taken
hostage,'' Galbe said.
	   She said the men would spend the night in Gonde and travel
Saturday to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa for debriefing before
further information was released.
	   The six Red Cross workers disappeared June 25 in the Ogaden,
which is largely populated by ethnic Somalis.

State security officer sentenced to eight years for killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A secret police officer was convicted
of murder on Friday and sentenced to eight years in prison after he
fatally shot two people during a 1991 riot.
	   After a three-year trial, Maj. Vasile Gabor was found guilty of
killing a woman and a student in Sept. 1991 in the square outside
the government headquarters, which was besieged by coal miners
demanding higher pay.
	   Gabor was defending the government building and fired a tear gas
pistol into the crowd, news agency Mediafax reported. He denied
shooting the two people.
	   Three people were killed during the three days of miners' riots,
which led to the resignation of Prime Minister Petre Roman and his
government.
	   The miners were said to have been manipulated by former
President Ion Iliescu to get rid of Roman, who was considered too
reformist for Iliescu, a former Communist party chief.
	   The state security service was also ordered to pay a total of
lei 230 million (dlrs 26,500) to the victims' families.
	   Eight prosecutors and nine judges resigned from the case. The
trial, considered politically sensitive, had 66 hearings.

Olympic swimming star to undergo new marijuana test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Additional testing of a urine sample from
suspended Olympic gold medalist Gary Hall Jr. will be done on
Wednesday, his lawyer says.
	   Ed Hendricks said the test will be performed at an International
Olympic Committee laboratory in Montreal.
	   Hall, 23, was suspended temporarily by the international
swimming federation FINA, which said he tested positive for
marijuana during a recent competition.
	   He and Hendricks contend FINA lacks authority to impose a
suspension for a ``non-performance enhancing substance'' for a test
taken at a non-sanctioned event. Hall said the test was conducted
May 15 at the U.S. West-Nortel Swimfest in Phoenix.
	   ``We're going to fight it, whatever it takes,'' Hendricks said
Thursday.
	   FINA's honorary secretary Gunnar Werner confirmed Hall has been
temporarily suspended, pending the testing of his ``backup'' B
sample and a hearing.
	   Werner also said this was Hall's second marijuana offense. The
first came during the Atlanta Games and resulted in a warning. FINA
added marijuana to its banned list just before the Atlanta Games,
but the rule did not take effect until after the competition.
	   Werner said that if the backup B sample shows positive, the case
will go to the FINA doping panel for a hearing.
	   FINA's rules call for a maximum three-month suspension for a
first marijuana offense and up to two years for a second.
	   Hall has withdrawn from this month's Goodwill Games, where he
had hoped to renew his intense rivalry with Russia's Alexander
Popov.
	   If Hall still is on suspension in August, and if the U.S.
championships that month are considered an international meet by
FINA, he would be banned from that competition.
	   The August championships will determine most of the U.S. roster
for 1999 international competition. However, rules could allow Hall
to be added to the U.S. contingent later.
	   Hall won gold medals as part of the U.S. 400-meter freestyle and
400 medley relay teams in the Atlanta Games. He also won silver
medals, finishing second to Popov in the 50 and 100 freestyle.

Turkey warns of increase in military power on Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with quotes from top Turkish general. No pick up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey may increase its military power in
the Turkish area of Cyprus if Greek Cypriots deploy anti-aircraft
missiles, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said.
	   ``If they deploy missiles, so will we,'' Yilmaz said in an
interview with private television Kanal D late Thursday.
	   ``If they deploy them, the tension will increase in Cyprus and
an armed conflict could arise, and we won't be the losers,'' Yilmaz
said. The semi-official Anatolia news agency provided a transcript
of the interview Friday.
	   Ankara ardently opposes Greek Cypriot plans to station Russian
missiles on the island, saying that the advanced S-300 systems
would give Cyprus the offensive capability to strike aircraft
flying over southern Turkey.
	   Cyprus on Thursday suggested the creation of a no-fly zone over
the island to reduce tension. Turkey rejected the proposal, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli said Friday.
	   U.S. and European officials have been pressuring Cyprus to
cancel the purchase, saying it needlessly increases tension between
NATO partners Greece and Turkey.
	   Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi, chief of the Turkish general staff,
flew to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state Friday to assess
military options. His jet was accompanied by six Turkish F-16s in
an apparent show of force, private NTV television said.
	   ``(Greek Cypriot) Efforts to get armed should not worry Turkish
Cypriots,'' the NTV quoted Karadayi on his arrival. ``The necessary
measures against them are being taken.''
	   ``Turkey will never allow the 1974 massacres of Turkish Cypriots
to happen again,'' he added in reference to claims by Turkish
Cypriots that Greek Cypriots engaged in a campaign of ethnic
cleansing before Turkey sent in troops to the island.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Turkish and Greek sectors since
1974, when Turkey invaded the northern third of the island
following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
	   Some 30,000 Turkish troops are deployed in the Turkish Cypriot
state, which is only recognized by Ankara.

Venues decided; Scheduling, ticketing, marketing remain for Japan,
</HEADLINE>
South Korea &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The opener and final have been decided. Venues have
been decided. The worrisome things remaining for the co-organizers
of the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea are issues like
marketing, scheduling and avoiding the big problem that France 98
encountered _ ticketing.
	   ``There are no special ideas about ticketing. France had
difficulty,'' said Choi Chang-shin, secretary general of the Korean
organizing committee or KOWOC. ``It was a lesson to us. We must
study this. We must organize a system and structure on ticketing.''
	   France's problems grew out of its location in Europe and the
high demand for tickets from people in neighboring countries. With
about 38 percent of the 2.6 million reserved for the French public,
another 25 percent for commercial affiliates and VIPs, less than
950,000 were available to fans in the rest of the world.
	   That led to scandals, one resulting in three employees of a
French subsidiary of FIFA's marketing company, including its
president, being arrested for fraud.
	   Choi also notes that matters such as information,
telecommunications, accommodations and transportation also must be
decided.
	   So far, both sides say the acrimony that existed between the two
nations before FIFA forged their co-hosting has not recurred.
	   ``Both wanted to be the single host,'' Japanese organizing
committee (JAWOC) spokesman Ryo Nishimura said. ``After the
decision was made to co-host, Japan and Korea have changed their
minds. They are cooperating on building a great World Cup. Even the
minds of the general public have changed gently.
	   ``In Seoul last year, when Japan went to Seoul for the second
leg of its qualifying series, and Korea already had qualified and
Japan had not yet, there was a big sign in the stadium from the
Korean people: 'Let's Go To the World Cup Together.' It showed the
Korean people's attitudes have changed.''
	   At least the matter of where the games will be played has been
settled.
	   Beside the opener in Seoul and the final in Japan, both Japan
and South Korea will use 10 stadiums each, with the eight
first-round groups divided evenly: four in Japan, four in South
Korea.
	   Japan has decided to use the cities of Sapporo, Miyagi, Niigata,
Ibaraki, Saitama, Yokohama, Shizuoka, Osaka, Kobe, and Oita. South
Korea will play games at Seoul, Inchon, Suwon, Taejon, Taegu,
Chonju, Ulsan, Kwangju, Pusan and Sogwipo.
	   For the second round, the eight second-placed teams that advance
will travel to the other country; four teams will travel again for
the quarterfinals, and two more for the semifinals.
	   Japan still has to decide between 70,000 capacity Yokohama
International Sports Stadium on the central eastern coast and the
63,000-seat Saitama Prefectural Stadium in the Tokyo suburbs for
the final.
	   South Korea is building all 10 stadiums it will use for the
World Cup at a cost of 1.3 trillion won (dlrs 990.6 million),
according to Choi.
	   Japan is building seven stadiums and renovating three more.
	   Despite the cost and the even more important Asian economic
crisis, Choi and Nishimura played down any impact the region's
financial woes would have on the World Cup.
	   ``Many people have asked about this,'' Choi said. ``As far as
we're concerned, it will take such a small part of our national
economy, it will not be affected.''
	   ``It has not caused any damage,'' Nishimura said. ``Of the new
stadiums, two already are completed.''
	   FIFA apparently is not as convinced. After earlier in the World
Cup dismissing any potential problems, president Sepp Blatter said
Friday that a fact-finding team will be sent to the region in
September and issue a report to the executive committee in
December.
	   ``The governments and football authorities must guarantee to
FIFA the stadia, infrastructure, technical resources and other
logistics, including hotels'' Blatter said. ``So far, none of these
areas have become a problem. We will send a group this fall to
assess it.''
	   The schedule of games still has to be determined as well as
certain marketing decisions, such as a mascot or mascots.
	   ``Scheduling is a big issue,'' Nishimura said. ``Urgent
decisions are needed. We hope to have them by the end of this
year.''

Romania has stagnated in its reforms says EU official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania has not made any economic
progress in the last year, a European Union official said on
Friday.
	   ``The European Commission is worried about slow rhythm of reform
in Romania,'' said Gunter Burghardt, head of the foreign relations
department at the European Committee.
	   He said of any EU applicants, formerly Communist Romania had the
worst performance over the past year. Reforms have been stalled by
political bickering, corruption and bureaucracy.
	   ``A strong political authority is needed for development of a
strong and dynamic private economic system,'' said Burghardt in a
statement at the end of a two-day visit to Romania.
	   Burghardt said at the end of this year the EU will reevaluate
countries seeking membership. The European Committee is the
executive board of the European Union.

Malaysia, Taiwan in talks to use local currencies for trade, report
</HEADLINE>
says

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia and Taiwan have begun
talks on using each others' currencies to conduct bilateral trade
in a step aimed at reducing their dependence on the U.S. dollar, a
news report said Friday.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told a group of visiting
Taiwanese journalists that Malaysia is willing to use their
country's currency.
	   ``It is a matter of setting up a clearing house and putting up
the mechanisms which are not in place yet,'' the prime minister was
quoted as saying by the national Bernama news agency.
	   Mahathir said Asia should use its own currencies to avoid a
repeat of last year's financial crisis, which was triggered as
local currencies plunged in value against the dollar.
	   Mahathir said that while Malaysia conducted only 18 percent of
its trade with the United States, his country used the U.S.
currency in 70 percent of its total international trade.
	   ``The problem is that we use too much U.S. dollars in conducting
international trade,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   The prime minister also warned that relying on international aid
agencies can leave Asian markets exposed to powerful Western
companies.
	   ``If we accept an IMF package we would have to open up our
market for the corporate giants from the Western countries,'' he
said.
	   Mahathir told the journalists that Malaysia was no worse off
than its neighbors, despite having refused aid from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   ``People still go shopping; business goes on as usual;
development projects are still carried out and not a single bank
was closed,'' he said.
	   Speaking on Japan's economic slump, Mahathir also told the group
that the biggest problem was a lack of confidence by Japanese
people in their government, Berma said.
	   ``Due to this, whatever the government does, the people are not
trusting the government,'' he was quoted as saying by the news
agency.

Tribal leaders appeal to Indian government to restore peace in
</HEADLINE>
northeast &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comments from separatist leader. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GUAHATI, India (AP) _ Naga tribal leaders in India's troubled
northeast said Friday two of the region's separatist groups were
ready to stop fighting.
	   M. Vero, president of the Naga Hoho, an umbrella group for
tribal leaders, said Hoho envoys met recently with members of the
Naga National Council and the National Socialist Council of
Nagaland.
	   ``We believe they will give up arms if a cease-fire is extended
and army operations withdrawn immediately,'' Vero said.
	   He called on the Indian government, which has opened peace talks
with an NSCN faction, extend a cease-fire to the NNC and the main
NSCN and hold talks with them as well.
	   Thuingaleng Muivah, leader of the NSCN faction engaged in peace
talks, cast doubt on the talks in an interview with The Hindustan
Times newspaper Friday.
	   Muivah, interviewed in the Thai capital of Bangkok, said the
government had offered little besides repeated extensions of the
cease-fire called to make talks possible.
	   ``But we will of course say that if the government of India is
prepared to abide by all the agreements then we will not back out
of the peace process,'' Muivah was quoted as saying.
	   The separatist movement began after India gained independence
from Britain in 1947, when Naga chieftains claimed they were forced
to join India. The situation in the state is exacerbated by
fighting among different rebel groups.
	   The Naga Hoho has refused to take a formal position on
independence, instead calling on the government and militants to
resolve the dispute peacefully.

China attacks Taiwanese effort to join U.N.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Friday condemned Taiwan's latest bid for
U.N. membership and said it would fail.
	   On Wednesday, a small pool of Taiwan's dwindling number of
diplomatic allies launched a renewed bid for U.N. membership for
the island.
	   The bid is certain to be blocked again by China, which claims
Taiwan as a renegade province. Since 1971, the United Nations has
accepted the Beijing government's claim to be the only legitimate
government of China, including Taiwan.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said the U.N.
bid was clearly aimed at creating ``two Chinas, or one China and
one Taiwan,'' the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   ``This is a brutal interference in China's internal affairs,''
Xinhua quoted him as saying. ``We strongly condemn this.''
	   Tang accused Taiwan ``of again buying a few countries to raise
this issue, revealing that Taiwan authorities are sticking to their
stubborn stand of splitting the motherland.''
	   This is the sixth straight year that Taiwan has pushed for U.N.
membership.
	   Tang said that like those before it, the bid ``also will fail
and come to an end.''
	   Taiwan officials say that while they are prepared for failure,
they hope the bid will highlight their island's efforts to win a
greater space on the international stage.
	   Just 27 countries recognize Taiwan over China. Taiwan is the
seat of the Nationalist government that fled the communist takeover
of the Chinese mainland in 1949. China considers Taiwan a renegade
province with no right to its own foreign relations.

World Food Program appeals for international action to stop Sudan
</HEADLINE>
fighting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The head of the World Food Program urged
the international community Friday to help end the rebellion in
southern Sudan that has complicated efforts to distribute food to
millions of malnourished people.
	   Eruptions of fighting in the last month forced the U.N. agency
to repeatedly evacuate its food distribution teams and quickly
redirect food drops, said the program's executive director,
Catherine Bertini.
	   ``We ask the international community to take urgent measures and
do everything it can to persuade all the combatants to put down
their weapons and end this senseless suffering,'' Bertini said in a
statement.
	   ``Until there is peace, our job in feeding the needy will
continue to remain extremely difficult and many people will
continue to suffer severe malnutrition in southern Sudan,'' Bertini
said.
	   Sudanese rebels have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy and
development in the predominantly Christian, animist and African
south, which is traditionally dominated by the Muslim and Arab
north.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
accompanying famine.
	   During a recent clash between rebels and government soldiers in
Leer, in western Upper Nile province about 800 kilometers (435
miles) southwest of Khartoum, the main aid facility was looted and
destroyed, Bertini said.
	   Some of the 25,000 malnourished Sudanese at the aid center fled
and walked two days to reach another aid station near Nyal.
	   In another incident, attackers looted food stocks and set fire
to what they couldn't carry away after advancing on Maper, in the
southern Bahr el-Ghazal state. The attackers threw the bodies of
those they had killed onto the burning pile of food, the statement
said.
	   Bertini also appealed for more food aid, saying the WFP needed
another dlrs 78.6 million to feed Sudanese through April. Donors
have pledged dlrs 59 million of the dlrs 137.6 needed.

Venues decided; Scheduling, ticketing, marketing remain for Japan,
</HEADLINE>
South Korea &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT slug to conform to Sports Digest. &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The opener and final have been decided. Venues have
been decided. The worrisome things remaining for the co-organizers
of the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea are issues like
marketing, scheduling and avoiding the big problem that France 98
encountered _ ticketing.
	   ``There are no special ideas about ticketing. France had
difficulty,'' said Choi Chang-shin, secretary general of the Korean
organizing committee or KOWOC. ``It was a lesson to us. We must
study this. We must organize a system and structure on ticketing.''
	   France's problems grew out of its location in Europe and the
high demand for tickets from people in neighboring countries. With
about 38 percent of the 2.6 million reserved for the French public,
another 25 percent for commercial affiliates and VIPs, less than
950,000 were available to fans in the rest of the world.
	   That led to scandals, one resulting in three employees of a
French subsidiary of FIFA's marketing company, including its
president, being arrested for fraud.
	   Choi also notes that matters such as information,
telecommunications, accommodations and transportation also must be
decided.
	   So far, both sides say the acrimony that existed between the two
nations before FIFA forged their co-hosting has not recurred.
	   ``Both wanted to be the single host,'' Japanese organizing
committee (JAWOC) spokesman Ryo Nishimura said. ``After the
decision was made to co-host, Japan and Korea have changed their
minds. They are cooperating on building a great World Cup. Even the
minds of the general public have changed gently.
	   ``In Seoul last year, when Japan went to Seoul for the second
leg of its qualifying series, and Korea already had qualified and
Japan had not yet, there was a big sign in the stadium from the
Korean people: 'Let's Go To the World Cup Together.' It showed the
Korean people's attitudes have changed.''
	   At least the matter of where the games will be played has been
settled.
	   Beside the opener in Seoul and the final in Japan, both Japan
and South Korea will use 10 stadiums each, with the eight
first-round groups divided evenly: four in Japan, four in South
Korea.
	   Japan has decided to use the cities of Sapporo, Miyagi, Niigata,
Ibaraki, Saitama, Yokohama, Shizuoka, Osaka, Kobe, and Oita. South
Korea will play games at Seoul, Inchon, Suwon, Taejon, Taegu,
Chonju, Ulsan, Kwangju, Pusan and Sogwipo.
	   For the second round, the eight second-placed teams that advance
will travel to the other country; four teams will travel again for
the quarterfinals, and two more for the semifinals.
	   Japan still has to decide between 70,000 capacity Yokohama
International Sports Stadium on the central eastern coast and the
63,000-seat Saitama Prefectural Stadium in the Tokyo suburbs for
the final.
	   South Korea is building all 10 stadiums it will use for the
World Cup at a cost of 1.3 trillion won (dlrs 990.6 million),
according to Choi.
	   Japan is building seven stadiums and renovating three more.
	   Despite the cost and the even more important Asian economic
crisis, Choi and Nishimura played down any impact the region's
financial woes would have on the World Cup.
	   ``Many people have asked about this,'' Choi said. ``As far as
we're concerned, it will take such a small part of our national
economy, it will not be affected.''
	   ``It has not caused any damage,'' Nishimura said. ``Of the new
stadiums, two already are completed.''
	   FIFA apparently is not as convinced. After earlier in the World
Cup dismissing any potential problems, president Sepp Blatter said
Friday that a fact-finding team will be sent to the region in
September and issue a report to the executive committee in
December.
	   ``The governments and football authorities must guarantee to
FIFA the stadia, infrastructure, technical resources and other
logistics, including hotels'' Blatter said. ``So far, none of these
areas have become a problem. We will send a group this fall to
assess it.''
	   The schedule of games still has to be determined as well as
certain marketing decisions, such as a mascot or mascots.
	   ``Scheduling is a big issue,'' Nishimura said. ``Urgent
decisions are needed. We hope to have them by the end of this
year.''

Environmental experts chart pollution's deadly effects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ At least 11 million of the world's
children die avoidable deaths every year because of toxins in their
homes, their drinking water and their air, according to an
international study released Friday in New Delhi, one of the
world's most polluted cities.
	   Inside houses, 4 million people _ mostly children under 5 years
old _ die of acute respiratory infections caused by the smoke of
primitive stoves, according to the World Resources Report for
1998-99. The biennial report is compiled by the World Resources
Institute, the U.N. Development Program, U.N. Environment Program
and the World Bank.
	   ``At least 1.4 billion people are exposed to polluted air and
nearly 25 percent of all deaths worldwide are caused by
environmental degradation,'' Karim Ahmad, an expert with the World
Resources Institute in Washington, told reporters in the Indian
capital.
	   Of the world's 15 most polluted cities, 13 _ including New Delhi
_ are in Asia.
	   Indian studies have found that New Delhi has the world's highest
concentration of airborne particulates. Carbon monoxide and nitrous
oxide levels also are above acceptable limits. One in five
residents in the capital suffers from breathing problems, doctors
say, compared to one in 20 nationwide.
	   Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu, India's minister for environment and
forests, estimated that treating the illnesses caused by pollution
costs 240 billion rupees (dlrs 5.7 billion) each year in India.
	   ``We can save this huge amount if we cut down on pollution
levels, and one way of reducing pollution is reducing the
population, one of our most critical environment degraders,'' he
told a meeting of scientists after releasing the report. India,
with its population set to touch a billion people, is the world's
second most populous country after China with 1.3 billion.
	   Prabhu said a government panel had been formed on Thursday to
suggest means to fight the effects of pollution on citizen's
health.
	   Pollution hazards do not remain confined to the poor nations of
the world, the report said. There has been a 50 percent increase in
asthma cases in the last 10 years, and the respiratory disorder
caused partially through environment pollution has risen
dramatically throughout developed countries, the report said.
	   It pointed out that even in the richest nations in the world,
the poor continued to suffer far worse health than the wealthy.
	   ``Although the Unites States ranks as one of the healthiest
countries in the world, infants born in parts of Mississippi Delta
region or the inner cities of Washington, D.C., or Baltimore,
Maryland, have life expectancies similar to those in such
developing countries as Namibia, Lesotho, or India,'' it said.

Talks on teeth for germ-warfare pact crawl ahead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Basic negotiations to beef up the 1972 treaty to
ban biological weapons could drag on well into next year despite
calls for speedier progress from U.S. President Bill Clinton and
others, the chairman of the talks said Friday.
	   Negotiators in Geneva are trying to improve the pact by adding
some of the verification features of the chemical weapons treaty,
adopted after the Gulf War under the specter of Iraq's arsenal of
poison gas.
	   Currently the germ-warfare treaty is little more than a pledge
not to develop or stockpile biological weapons, but it lacks
provisions to catch or punish those who do.
	   Fundamental issues that remain open include the facilities to be
inspected, who would inspect and how little notice the inspectors
would have to give, said the chairman, Tibor Toth of Hungary.
	   Some 3,000 points are disputed in the current draft text, Toth
said.
	   The draft text has grown from 140 to 250 pages this year, he
said. But negotiations are going at a rate of around two pages per
day.
	   ``Time is oxygen,'' Toth told a news conference as negotiators
wrapped up their latest three-week session. ``We need some oxygen
for these negotiations to proceed.''
	   Toth conceded that it is ``physically impossible'' to negotiate
away that many points, but said the text would remain the basis of
talks at least this year.
	   A joint statement by 29 European, North American and Asian
countries Friday said negotiators should ``demonstrate leadership
by intensifying (their) efforts toward the successful and early
adoption of a legally binding protocol.''
	   They referred to Clinton's urging of progress on the accord in
his State of the Union speech to Congress earlier this year.
	   ``We must act to prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war
and terror,'' said Clinton. ``The Biological Weapons Convention has
been in effect for 23 years now. The rules are good, but the
enforcement is weak. We must strengthen it with a new international
inspection system to detect and deter cheating.''
	   During Clinton's visit to China last month, he and President
Jiang Zemin issued a statement supporting a stronger accord.
	   Negotiations at the United Nations' European headquarters
started in 1994. Toth has said that so far the best overall
agreement is that they must be finished by the year 2001.
	   Some 140 nations, including Iran and Libya, have ratified the
biological weapons treaty, and another 18 countries have signed it.
The accord was approved during the height of the Cold War when no
one seriously thought germ warfare was a possibility.
	   Negotiations start again in September, when a decision must be
made on next year's schedule.
	   Toth dampened expectations for that session, saying only that he
expected it to achieve ``clarity on where the differences lie.''

European court finds against Britain in Catholic workers' case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Britain must pay damages totaling
25,000 pounds (dlrs 40,700) to six Northern Ireland Catholics who
claimed they were denied public contracts because of their religion
and political opinions, the European Court of Human Rights ruled
Friday.
	   A panel of nine judges at the court based in Strasbourg France,
ruled unanimously that Britain had infringed European Human Rights
Convention.
	   The cases date back to the mid-1980s, when British authorities
in Northern Ireland said John Tinnelly and Sons Ltd. had been
refused a contract to carry out demolition work on a power station
in 1985 for reasons of ``national security or the protection of
public safety.''
	   The firm's directors complained they'd been discriminated
against and took their case to Northern Ireland's Fair Employment
Agency. The case was thrown out when British authorities blocked
the disclosure of documents relating to police security checks on
the company and its employees.
	   The European court said the Britain had violated the rights of
Patrick and Gerard Tinnelly under Article 6 of the Human Rights
Convention which states ``everyone is entitled to a fair and public
hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal.''
	   A similar ruling was made in favor of four self-employed
joiners. Kevin, Michael, Paddy and Barry McElduff were refused a
tender for work at the Northern Ireland Department of the

Bulgarian president pitches for NATO membership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov made
a fresh pitch for Bulgaria's membership in NATO Friday, saying the
crisis in Kosovo further illustrates his country's strategic
importance in the Balkans.
	   Anxious as Bulgaria may be to get into the alliance in the next
wave of enlargement, however, there was no indication NATO is ready
to have them any time soon despite rising tensions in the Serbian
province of Kosovo.
	   ``I didn't miss the chance to emphasize another argument in
favor of NATO membership,'' Stoyanov told reporters after his
meeting with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana.
	   ``It is precisely the dramatic situation in Kosovo which makes
our claim and our aspiration for membership even more valid because
membership in NATO will make our position clearer and bring about
stability,'' he said.
	   ``Of course this does not diminish the criteria and the need for
us to meet the criteria for NATO membership,'' he said,
acknowledging Bulgaria has a way to go in preparing itself
politically, militarily and economically.
	   Solana said he and Stoyanov were very concerned about the
situation in Kosovo. NATO is refining several plans for possible
military intervention in or around the province which is peopled
largely by ethnic Albanians.
	   ``Again we would like to make an appeal so a diplomatic solution
can be found,'' the secretary-general said.
	   The Bulgarian president said he also raised the issue of NATO
support for a project to build a second bridge across the Danube
River ``because this is a way to get around the possibility of
keeping Bulgaria hostage to the deterioration of the situation in
Yugoslavia.''
	   That situation makes it dangerous for Bulgaria to send exports
across the border to Yugoslavia, but at the same time, there is
only one bridge crossing the river that forms the border between
Bulgaria and Romania.

Japanese phone giant takes big hit on losses at mobile phone
</HEADLINE>
subsidiary

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Japan's
domestic phone giant, said Friday it will take a 41 billion yen
(dlrs 290 million) hit to absorb losses from a foundering mobile
phone subsidiary.
	   NTT said its personal handyphone, or PHS, business had suffered
from falling subscriptions as regular cellular phone service has
become more affordable.
	   PHS started as low-cost but less-dependable alternative to
regular cell phones.
	   NTT said the loss would cover the cost of transferring its PHS
operations to its cell phone subsidiary, NTT Mobile Communications
Network.
	   Total losses at the PHS subsidiary will likely exceed 255
billion yen (dlrs 1.8 billion) by this December, NTT said.
	   The phone company said it will spend 4 billion yen (dlrs 30
million) to buy out shares held by other companies in the PHS
subsidiary.
	   NTT said the loss wouldn't affect this year's earnings forecast.
	   The phone company expects profit before taxes of 285 billion yen
(dlrs 2 billion), down from 357 billion yen (dlrs 2.6 billion) last
year.

Sri Lanka arrives with a warning for England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ World Cup cricket champions Sri Lanka arrived in
England Friday determined to prove _ in the home of cricket _ they
are a new force in the game.
	   Sri Lanka, which has never been invited to contest a test series
in England, will play South Africa and England in the triangular
limited-overs series starting August 14 and a one-off test against
England at Lord's.
	   The 18-man squad is without leading fast bowler Chimanda Vaas,
but contains internationally rated off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan
and batsmen Aravinda de Silva and Sanath Jayasuruja.
	   Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga said England's batting
collapses against South Africa in the current test series had given
his side encouragement.
	   ``We are a very positive side but we don't want to start off
saying we want to trash everyone. That's not the right thing,''
Ranatunga said.
	   Sri Lanka, which won the World Cup over more highly favored
Australia, the West Indies and Pakistan, has only played three
tests in England after 18 years in the international arena.
	   The previous tests were played in 1984, 1988 and 1991 but Sri
Lankan officials are targeting 2003 for a series.
	   Ranatunga played in the 1984 and 1988 tests at Lord's and has
captained Sri Lanka for the bulk of the last 10 years.
	   The 34-year-old batsman said he had not been keen to play
another one-off test in England but decided it was necessary
because England was hosting the World Cup next year.
	   ``It is very important to us to get used to the conditions,'' he
said.
	   ``We are given two or three Tests by other countries. It's a
pity we only get one Test here. You just get used to the conditions
and the Test is gone.''

Japan's Isuzu, GM close to deal on engine plant in U.S.: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Isuzu Motors Ltd. is close to a final agreement
with General Motors Corp. on building a diesel engine plant in the
United States, Kyodo News reported Friday, citing Isuzu officials.
	   The facility would start producing eight-cylinder
direct-injection engines in mid-2000 for use in a new GM
sport-utility vehicle, Kyodo quoted the officials as saying.
	   General Motors, the world's largest automaker, is Isuzu's top
stockholder, with a 37 percent stake in the Tokyo-based midsize
automaker.
	   Isuzu hopes to put up more than 50 percent _ and perhaps 100
percent _ of the capital for the engine production facility which
is expected to be built at one of GM's plants in the United States,
the report said.
	   Isuzu also plans to produce cylinder heads for the new engines
at its Tomakomai plant in Japan's northernmost prefecture of
Hokkaido, the officials were quoted as saying.

 &UR; Four thousand Muslims in Serbia stage protests

<TEXT>
	   NOVI PAZAR, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Some 4,000 Muslims in southern
Serbia staged a rally Friday to protest a year-old government
decision to dismiss municipal politicians they elected.
	   The brief protests in Novi Pazar, a town in southern Serbia's
predominantly Muslim region of Sandzak, ended without incident.
	   ``Respect our election will,'' and ``We want out rights,'' read
banners at the rally, organized by the local branch of the Party of
Democratic Action, the Sandzak branch of Bosnia's main Muslim-led
party.
	   An SDA-led coalition, representing Serbia's 300,000-strong
Muslim community, won local elections in Sandzak in November 1996,
but the Serbian authorities revoked their municipal rule eight
months later and imposed a Belgrade-run local government. They
cited alleged mistakes in governing the region.
	   The leader of Serbia's Muslims, Sulejman Ugljanin said the aim
of the rally was to let off steam so that protesters would not
``take up arms'' to demand their rights.
	   Ugljanin also said Muslims serving in the Yugoslav army should
not be sent to fight in Kosovo province, where Yugoslav forces are
battling ethnic Albanian militants, most of them also Muslims.
	   Ugljanin said his party would consider fellow Muslims forcefully
taken to Kosovo to fight as ``prisoners of war,'' of the Yugoslav
army.
	   In 1993 Yugoslav authorities raised charges against Ugljanin for
allegedly plotting the secession of Sandzak from the country, which
includes Serbia and Montenegro. The charges were revoked in 1996.

Long wait for drinks might be over for booze-cruise salvagers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MANS HULDEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ The undersea sommeliers laboring to
lift a shipload of antique champagne from the bottom of the Baltic
Sea expect to finally be able to pop the corks Saturday.
	   Claes Bergvall, the Swedish head of the team salvaging a
schooner laden with champagne, cognac and port, told The Associated
Press that ``the job should be finished Friday night or Saturday.
	   ``There are a few variables, especially weather, that may affect
the schedule, but we're not counting minutes,'' he said by
telephone from the salvage operation off Finland's western coast
near Rauma, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) northwest of Helsinki.
	   The schooner, the 66-foot Joenkoeping, turned into a watery
wine-cellar in 1916 when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat while
carrying the consignment of alcohol ordered by the Russian army.
	   Divers from Bergvall's C-Star consortium found the Joenkoeping
(pronounced yeun-sheu-ping) wreck 64 meters (210 feet) below the
surface in June 1997; a month later, they raised a few bottles of
champagne, which Bergvall pronounced ``superb.''
	   Others who want to try it could end up with a huge bar tab. The
cargo of 44 crates of champagne, 67 barrels of cognac and 17
barrels of port wine, if intact, could be worth some dlrs 2
million, Christies auction-house wine expert Duncan McEuen said in
an interview with the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet.
	   Finnish businessman Peter Fryckman has entered a competing claim
for the Joenkoeping's cargo. Fryckman, whose divers have receovered
hundreds of bottles from the wreck, claims the treasure because the
company of his great-grandfather, Sven Gustav Fryckman, was
involved in delivering the order.
	   But a Finnish court ordered him to remove his divers and vessel
from the salvage site, allowing Bergvall's operation to continue
until the end of the year.
	   Fryckman has criticized Bergvall's attempt to raise the entire
vessel at once, saying the hull may break in the process,
destroying the cargo.
	   Bergvall said he has not decided where to take the cargo should
the lifting succeed. Both Finland and Sweden impose some of the
world's highest duties on alcohol imports.

Schumacher nears new contract; Williams' changes coming soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Michael Schumacher is close to
singing a new three-year contract with Ferrari, reported to be
worth a whopping 25 million pounds (dlrs 41 million) a year.
	   Schumacher, one of the world's highest paid athletes, joined
Ferrari in 1996 and is trying to bring the storied Italian racing
team its first series champion since 1979.
	   ``There's good reason that (new contract) could happen,'' the
29-year-old German said on the eve of Sunday's British Grand Prix.
	   Ferrari is being pressed by McLaren-Mercedes, which is reported
trying to lure away the German.
	   McLaren-Mercedes' Mika Hakkinen leads the series standings
through eight races with 50 points to 44 for Schumacher and 30 for
McLaren's David Coulthard.
	   ``He doesn't want to win the world championship for McLaren, he
wants to do it at Ferrari,'' said Schumacher's teammate Eddie
Irvine. ``He hasn't spent three years here just for the money.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WILLIAMS CHANGES: &LR;  Williams owner Frank Williams declined to
confirm reports he's signed IndyCar champion Alex Zanardi, was
about to drop Heinz-Harald Frentzen, and has given Jacques
Villeneuve a deadline to re-sign.
	   ``I'll keep out of it and when we're ready we'll announce our
drivers when we've singed them,'' Williams said Friday.
	   He did, however, confirm the changes will be made in a few
weeks. ``That's correct,'' he said. ``Sometime soon.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   UN-GROOVY: &LR;  Drivers are less than enthusiastic about the switch
to grooved tires this year in Formula One. It was meant to slow the
cars, decrease the grip and lead to more passing.
	   But overtaking has become more difficult and the cars are just
as fast.
	   ``It a little bit more difficult to race with and take liberties
with than they were before,'' Hill said.
	   ``Before you were sideways a few times and now you're sideways
every two corners, so your bound to go off more often even though
the speed is similar to last year,'' Villeneuve said.
	   ``All you can think is how nice it would be with slicks,''
Villeneuve added. ``It's definitely more difficult. You are relying
more on the aerodynamics.''
	   ``For overtaking it's pretty clear,'' Schumacher said. ``Less
grip from the tires means more grip aerodynamically. The
relationship is the wrong way from what we want for competing.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TIRE TALK: &LR;  Despite rumors to the contrary, Goodyear is still
set to leave Formula One after this season, leaving Bridgestone as
the lone supplier.
	   ``Nothing has changed since they made the announcement last
November,'' said Goodyear spokesman Dermot Bambridge. ``We said our
goal was to win this year, and that's where the focus has been.''
	   ``But while the heart is still beating, the beast is still
alive,'' he added. ``But I don't really think it will happen.''
	   Goodyear is getting out, largely because it says the new grooved
tires are used only in F1 and don't lend themselves to developments
in other types of racing.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MCLAREN SLIPPING? &LR;  Villeneuve figures McLaren will be caught if
the team keeps making mistakes.
	   ``The way McLaren started the season you wouldn't have expected
anybody to fight back,'' Villeneuve said. ``They still have the
upper hand, the best machinery with the best engine and the drivers
drive it pretty well.
	   ``But somehow they managed not to get the points they should
have gotten and Michael (Schumacher) has managed to get back in
that fight. So it makes it interesting.''
	   The favorite? ``It depends if McLaren keep making mistakes.''

Dutch bank and insurer to merge within three years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch bank Rabobank NV and insurer
Achmea Holding NV said Friday they plan to merge within three
years.
	   The combined company should be a leader in virtually all
financial sectors of the Netherlands, the companies said.
	   As a first step, Rabobank and Achmea will establish a 50-50
joint venture effective Jan. 1, 1999. The venture will involve
asset management, pensions, life insurance and health insurance.
	   Rabobank, which is among the top five banks in the country, had
total assets of 423 billion guilders, or dlrs 211 billion, at the
end of last December. Achmea had total assets of 63 billion
guilders, or dlrs 31 billion.
	   The combination of the two companies is part of a wave of
consolidation of the financial sector.
	   Over the past year, Dutch banking and insurance company ING
bought U.S. investment bank Furman Selz and insurer Equitable of
Iowa, as well as Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert.
	   Last month, Belgian-Dutch financial services group Fortis won a
bid for Generale Bank of Belgium, and earlier this week, leading
Dutch bank ABN Amro Holding NV said it will buy Brazil's Banco
Real.

World Cup: Saint Aime already, but Jacquet wants one more win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Even ahead of the final, France
already canonized him Saint Aime. Looking at what Aime Jacquet has
gone through over the past months, some might just call him a
martyr who has converted masses of disbelievers.
	   When he took the helm four years ago, the future looked bleak.
Now he has one game ahead of him to win France's first World Cup,
with a team that has stuck together and stood by him, known better
for its cohesion than individual stars.
	   ``Now, we have the energy that can move mountains,'' said
Jacquet and the only mountain left is Brazil in Sunday's final at
Saint-Denis.
	   Whatever happens, the 57-year-old bows out after the final,
drained by unceasing criticism and the enormity of the task of
turning a bunch of losers into World Cup finalists.
	   First, the goal was to reach the final four, then it was to
reach the final, and when the final whistle went after the 2-1 come
from behind win against Croatia, he could not even celebrate. He
just stood there, dazed.
	   ``I was knocked out, standing up,'' he said. When he realized
the achievement, with France throwing the biggest party in decades,
he broke down crying.
	   Outside France, Jacquet basically was a no-name coming into the
World Cup finals. French coaching was identified with Arsene
Wenger, who turned England's Arsenal around and into this season's
league and cup double winner.
	   Jacquet was bookish, boorish, talked a convoluted, lousy game
and could not produce flair for Les Bleus in his first years as
coach. He looks wiry and exudes no aura. He became a soft target
for critics and it has taken a long time to prove them wrong.
	   And in as unpredictable and irrational a game a soccer, he
relied on a technical four-year masterplan that, in retrospect
brought him right into the Championship game.
	   After all, he was the coach who decided against using greats
Eric Cantona and David Ginola, when both were at their prime, a
brave move when he was already criticized for producing dull
soccer.
	   But team unity prevailed, and the flashy forwards didn't fit in.
	   First he harnessed the team into the stringent defensive
straightjacket that yielded a 1996 semifinal loss at the European
Championships and loads of media criticism.
	   And during the last two years without a competitive game on the
schedule, his experimenting often dumbfounded observers and rarely
produced encouraging results.
	   Few understood these were not mad-scientist schemes. ``It would
have been easy just to pick the best 11 and prepare the World Cup
with them,'' he said. The World Cup though is more complicated than
that.
	   When his star playmaker Zinedine Zidane was suspended for two
games, something that would have crippled many a team, Jacquet
simply went to Plan B he had long prepared with those
badly-understood experiments and France went through.
	   ``To be on top, nothing can be left to chance,'' he said. Even
if it took him off the beaten path. When all the teams arrived for
the World Cup, Jacquet took his men to Finland instead and was one
of the last to arrive ahead of the big kickoff.
	   He refused to settle on a fixed team, preferring to use the
energy of inner competition to keep everyone sharp. In the first
three games, he used 20 of 22 players, a World Cup record.
	   Now in the final, even his sharpest critic, L'Equipe sports
paper, is scaling back.
	   ``You can always discuss the methods, but you have to admire the
result,'' said the sports daily's deputy chief editor Gerard Ejnes.
	   ``You can only congratulate Aime Jacquet, since he has reached
the goal he had set himself: making France play the World Cup
final,'' he said.

Red Cross says workers abducted in Ethiopia freed

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Six Red Cross workers abducted two weeks
ago by gunmen in southeastern Ethiopia were released Friday and are
in good health, both the Red Cross and their captors said.
	   The one Swiss and five Ethiopians were set free after they made
radio contact with the International Committee of the Red Cross on
Wednesday and again on Thursday and were able to communicate their
location, ICRC spokeswoman Nina Galbe said.
	   ``It was dramatic. For two weeks we didn't know if they were
even alive. Then two days ago we got the first radio contact and
now, today, they were released,'' she said.
	   Galbe identified the Swiss man as Laurent Giger, 30, from
Neufchatel, who has worked for the Red Cross for seven years in
Somalia, Sudan, Afghanastan, and most recently, Ethiopia.
	   The identities of the five Ethiopians were not revealed upon
request of their families, Galbe said.
	   Galbe said the six aid workers were picked up by colleagues in
an unspecified location and were to arrive by vehicle later Friday
in the southeastern Ethiopian town of Gode.
	   In Geneva, spokesman Michael Kleiner said the ICRC had tightened
security of its operations in the southeastern Ogaden region after
the group was abducted, including reducing the number of movements
of Red Cross workers.
	   Kleiner said the organization would consider whether any further
measures were needed after meeting with the six released workers.
	   In the Somali capital, Mogadishu, a spokesman for Al-Itihad
Al-Islam, an armed Muslim group fighting for the unification of
Ogaden with Somalia, claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and
Friday said it released the six men after two weeks of
``investigation.''
	   Ibrahim Sheikh Omar said the six ``were found guilty of
conducting business outside their duties, including the
transportation of money and fuel to government workers'' in Ogaden.
	   Omar said his group released the aid workers for humanitarian
reasons ``despite the guilty status proven on them.''
	   He said the hostages had been treated well during their
captivity and were allowed to telephone home.
	   Omar said the only condition set for their release was that in
the future they must notify Al-Itihad officials in the region of
their movements in areas where the rebels are fighting Ethiopian
troops.
	   Both Galbe and Kleiner said the six men had been released
without conditions.
	   ``Although we are relieved, we are naturally concerned that
humanitarian agencies are targeted and workers are being taken
hostage,'' Galbe said.
	   The six Red Cross workers disappeared June 25 in the Ogaden,
which is largely populated by ethnic Somalis.

EU gives dlrs 7.5 million to Cuba, 1.1 million to Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union approved 7 million
European currency units (dlrs 7.5 million) in humanitarian aid for
Cuba Friday and 1 million ecus (dlrs 1.1 million) for
Guinea-Bissau.
	   The European Commission, executive arm of the EU, said the money
for Cuba, to be managed by the European Community Humanitarian
Office, would enable nongovernmental organizations to carry out
health programs targeted at the most vulnerable to the shortcomings
of the Cuban system.
	   ``The economic crisis in Cuba has had very serious repercussions
on public health,'' the Commission said in a statement.
	   The funding covers food aid, medicines, production of medicines
locally and medical and other supplies for hospitals.
	   The money for Guinea-Bissau is aimed at helping those directly
affected by the month-long rebellion by a military faction seeking
to overthrow the government.
	   The Commission said in a statement that 250,000 people have fled
the fighting in the capital of the former Portuguese colony on the
West African coast.

Turkey warns of increase in military power on Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: CLARIFIES 9th graf, ``Turkey will etc, that ethnic cleansing
allegedly began after Turkish troops invaded the island. No pick
up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey may increase its military power in
the Turkish area of Cyprus if Greek Cypriots deploy anti-aircraft
missiles, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said.
	   ``If they deploy missiles, so will we,'' Yilmaz said in an
interview with private television Kanal D late Thursday.
	   ``If they deploy them, the tension will increase in Cyprus and
an armed conflict could arise, and we won't be the losers,'' Yilmaz
said. The semi-official Anatolia news agency provided a transcript
of the interview Friday.
	   Ankara ardently opposes Greek Cypriot plans to station Russian
missiles on the island, saying that the advanced S-300 systems
would give Cyprus the offensive capability to strike aircraft
flying over southern Turkey.
	   Cyprus on Thursday suggested the creation of a no-fly zone over
the island to reduce tension. Turkey rejected the proposal, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli said Friday.
	   U.S. and European officials have been pressuring Cyprus to
cancel the purchase, saying it needlessly increases tension between
NATO partners Greece and Turkey.
	   Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi, chief of the Turkish general staff,
flew to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state Friday to assess
military options. His jet was accompanied by six Turkish F-16s in
an apparent show of force, private NTV television said.
	   ``(Greek Cypriot) efforts to get armed should not worry Turkish
Cypriots,'' the NTV quoted Karadayi on his arrival. ``The necessary
measures against them are being taken.''
	   ``Turkey will never allow the 1974 massacres of Turkish Cypriots
to happen again,'' he added in reference to claims by Turkish
Cypriots that Greek Cypriots engaged in a campaign of ethnic
cleansing after the Turkish invasion of the island.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Turkish and Greek sectors since
1974, when Turkey invaded the northern third of the island
following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
	   Some 30,000 Turkish troops are deployed in the Turkish Cypriot
state, which is only recognized by Ankara.

Turkey calls for military action in Kosovo if diplomacy fails
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to add cycle designator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin on Friday
reportedly called for a military intervention in Serbia's
rebellious Kosovo province if no diplomatic solution is found.
	   ``If we can't solve it with diplomatic means, we have to use our
forces,'' the semi-official Anatolia news agency quoted Sezgin as
saying before his meeting with Albanian Defense Minister Luan
Haydaraga.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and independence-seeking ethnic
Albanian rebels has killed hundreds of people since February, and
there are fears the conflict could disrupt the Balkans' fragile
stability.
	   ``If the incidents spread out of Kosovo, there will be no peace
and stability in the Balkans,'' President Suleyman Demirel said on
Friday.
	   Demirel is expected to visit Albania on July 14.
	   After meeting in Bonn on Wednesday, the six-nation Contact Group
on the Balkans _ with diplomats from Germany, the United States,
Russia, France, Britain and Italy _ demanded an immediate
cease-fire in the rebellious Kosovo province.
	   Turkey, which sees Albania as a natural ally because of its
predominantly Muslim population, also donated dlrs 5 million in
military aid to Albania Friday to help rebuild its army, whose
munition depots were looted during a popular revolt in March.
	   Turkey also trains some 600 Albanian soldiers here.

Australian arrested near border in connection with ticket fraud

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss police have asked for the extradition of a
man from France to Switzerland in connection with the fraudulent
sale of hundreds of World Cup tickets, Geneva police said Friday.
	   French police acting on information from their Geneva
counterparts arrested a 54-year-old Australian resident of Geneva
on Wednesday at the railway station in the town of Bellegarde,
located near the French-Swiss border.
	   Police say an international warrant was issued for the man's
arrest after several hundred people paid for tickets but never
received them. They said the total value of the tickets is several
hundred thousand Swiss francs (dlrs).
	   The man is being held at a prison in Lyon, France and hasn't
opposed his extradition to Switzerland, police say.

Germany's Ullrich back in Tour de France-winning shape
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Germany's Jan Ullrich looks fighting fit
to defend his title when the 85th Tour de France begins Saturday in
Dublin.
	   The 24-year-old redhead appears to have worked off every ounce
of the extra baggage that had him looking more like Helmut Kohl
than the ``Tourminator'' who won last year's epic competition at
only his secod attempt.
	   ``My goal again is to reach Paris in the yellow jersey,'' said
Ullrich, who will wear the winner's symbol when he starts last
among the 189 competitors in the opening 3.5-mile (5.6-kilometer)
time trial through downtown Dublin.
	   He admitted that his trainers were annoyed about his off-season
celebrations, which had left him tipping the scales above 210
pounds (85 kgs) in January _ compared with his 1997 Tour-conquering
173 pounds (73 kgs) _ and laying low from German paparazzi. But he
insisted that slimming down had been ``no problem.''
	   ``My weight is all right now. I will not have one kilogram more
than at the same time last year,'' he said, thanking his minders
for ensuring ``that I was not exposed to my critics.''
	   Ullrich doesn't have to look far to see his competition
considering 1996's Tour winner, 34-year-old Bjarne Riis, is a
colleague on the Deutsche Telekom team.
	   The first two stages Sunday and Monday will take the cyclists
237 miles (381 kms) from Dublin via the humble Wicklow Mountains to
Ireland's second city, Cork, by which time it should be clearer
whether Ullrich or Riis is really Telekom's No. 1.
	   Alex Zuelle of Switzerland, a potential Tour winner from the
French Festina team, predicted that Ullrich will be ``attacked from
all sides to see if he has weakened'' during the course of the
2,393-mile (3,850-kilometer) race to Paris on Aug. 2.
	   The heart of normally traffic-clogged Dublin was shut down
Friday to permit the racers to explore the route of Saturday's time
trial, which starts at Trinity College, passes Merrion Square and
St. Stephen's Green, crosses the River Liffey and finishes in the
capital's broad, statue-lined O'Connell Street.
	   While the Irish government aggressively courted the Tour and
predicts it will bring more than 30 million pounds (dlrs 45
million) in tourist trade, downtown business people complained
about having access to their shops restricted on key shopping days
in a city already full of tourists.
	   Declan Martin, economic director of Dublin's Chamber of
Commerce, said the Tour's two days in Dublin would cost businesses
5 million pounds (dlrs 7 million) in lost trade. ``There are severe
problems of access, and we were told to take it or leave it,'' he
said.
	   Some racers, in turn, complained that the Irish hadn't put up
enough signs for them to identify where Saturday's route was.
	   Zuelle, who led much of this year's Tour of Italy before
dropping out ill, said he's arrived in Dublin in ``possibly the
worst shape'' of his professional career _ but then noted that he
has a record of doing well after being sick.
	   While Ullrich, Riis and Zuelle aim to win the whole tour, the
only American-sponsored team among the Tour's 21 squads arrived in
Dublin determined just to have a player win one of the 21 stages.
	   The United States Postal Service team is led by U.S. national
champion George Hincapie, who finished 104th overall in last year's
Tour.
	   Hincapie _ a native of Framingham, N.Y., who resides in
Charlotte, North Carolina _ said the fact that the U.S.-based
cyclists have known since January they had qualified for the Tour
means they have ``arrived here in top fitness.'' Last year, the
team had to pursue a more punishing schedule to be nominated as a
wild card in June.
	   ``We definitely have a shot at having someone on the team finish
in the top 10,'' said Mark Gorski, the team's director who won
Olympic Gold as a sprint cyclist in 1984. ``Last year we were in
it, going for the win, at several stages.''

Poland on flood alert, still recovering from last year's deluge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with recovery efforts from last year's
floods &QL;

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Dozens of towns and villages are on flood
alert. Farms are soaked with centimeters (inches) of water. Rivers
are rising and more rain is predicted.
	   And Poland has yet to recover from last year's floods.
	   This time last year, rain-swelled rivers started overflowing
their banks across Poland's southwest. The deluge, which lasted
through August, killed 55 people, swamped 46,000 homes and caused
an estimated 12 billion zlotys (dlrs 3.4 billion) in damage.
	   Now, heavy rainfall has caused minor flooding on farmland in the
southeast along the Wislok river and its tributaries. By Friday,
three provinces _ Krosno, Rzeszow and Przemysl, all about (320
kilometers) 200 miles southeast of Warsaw _ were on flood alert. No
evacuations have been necessary.
	   ``People call us and ask about the situation, especially those
who live near the river. We are prepared for the worst,'' said
Wlodzimiez Kowalski, a flood prevention official in Krosno
province, where the river is 47 centimeters (20 inches) above the
alarm level and waters have covered farms and roads.
	   Last year's floods caught an unprepared Poland off-guard, and
slow rescue efforts helped contribute to the devastation. Learning
from its mistakes, the government has assigned emergency tasks to
firefighters, police and the army.
	   But it will be several years before Poland is really prepared
for another big flood, says Jerzy Widzyk, the government official
in charge of disaster recovery. It will take years, too, for the
country to recover from the damages of the 1997 disaster. Repair
efforts, to be half-finished by the end of 1998, won't be completed
until 2001.
	   The government has earmarked 2 billion zlotys (dlrs 588 million)
this year for repairs of houses, roads, bridges, factories and
sewage systems. Another 3.5 billion zlotys (dlrs 1 million) is
expected from international aid organizations and local budgets.
	   Part of the repairs involve using dirt, stones and gravel to
patch and strengthen the dikes along the Oder River, which acts as
a natural border between Germany and Poland and which flooded last
summer.
	   In Germany, a massive sand-bagging effort by soliders and
volunteers kept the Oder dike from breaking. The floods caused no
fatalities in Germany, and the damage was less severe than in
Poland.
	   German Red Cross workers estimate their repair work should be
finished in another year.
	   Across the border in Poland's historic city of Wroclaw, 394
families still live in boarding houses, hotels or with relatives
because of flood damage. Buildings with about 270 apartments must
be torn down _ some dating from the 18th century.
	   Of 4,600 damaged apartments, about 1,850 have been renovated,
says Eugeniusz Szumiejko, in charge of the southwestern city's
flood recovery.
	   Barbara Baran, a doctor from a hospital in the southwestern town
of Kedzierzyn-Kozle, was quoted in a women's magazine as saying she
still cries when she thinks of the tomography scanner, worth dlrs
44,000, damaged in the flood.
	   At home, she replaced the damp oak floors with ceramic tiles.
	   ``It will be easier to clean up, in case water comes again,''
she told the magazine Twoj Styl.
	   The southern city of Klodzko is still waiting for dikes to be
built to protect against the Neisse River. Flooding last year
destroyed 1,100 homes and caused 90 million zlotys (dlrs 26.4
million) in damages, according to Mayor Malgorzata Kwiatkowska.
	   Now, when it rains, the mayor says, hundreds of people go Neisse
to check the water level.

House of Commons ratifies land mine treaty in tribute to Diana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Under pressure to show support for Princess
Diana's final campaign before the first anniversary of her death,
the House of Commons on Friday rushed through a bill ratifying the
international treaty banning land mines.
	   The bill, which was approved without a vote in less than five
hours, now goes to the House of Lords, where its passage is
assured.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government had not scheduled
time to debate the bill in the current session of Parliament. But
after protests by the public and the media that Labor was ignoring
Diana's most famous cause, the government added an extra
Parliamentary session Friday to debate all stages of the bill at
once.
	   More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa
Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but it needs to be
ratified by 40 countries to take effect. So far, it has been
ratified by 23 governments.
	   The Britons who pressed for swift government action want to
ensure that their country is among the 40 initial signatories as a
tribute to Diana, who traveled to Angola and Bosnia to publicize
the devastation caused by land mines.
	   They also are pushing for Parliament to ratify the treaty before
Aug. 31, the first anniversary of her death in a Paris car crash.
	   Noting that 60 million land mines are scattered around the globe
in 70 countries, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the bill was the
best way to honor Diana's ``immense contribution'' to the work of
organizations campaigning for an international ban.
	   Micahel Howard, the opposition Conservative Party spokesman on
foreign affairs, called the princess' role ``invaluable'' and said
``in many ways the progress made on this issue is a worthier
memorial to her than some of the other projects which have received
so much recent attention.''
	   Those include a memorial garden, a new coin, a Diana medal for
schoolchildren involved in community service and a nursing program
for seriously ill and disabled children.

Talks on teeth for germ-warfare pact crawl ahead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Talks aimed at strengthening a 1972 treaty banning
biological weapons could drag on far into 1999, despite calls for
speedier progress from U.S. President Bill Clinton and others, the
chairman of the negotiations said Friday.
	   Negotiators in Geneva are trying to improve the pact by adding
some of the verification features of the chemical weapons treaty,
adopted after the Gulf War under the specter of Iraq's arsenal of
poison gas.
	   Currently, the germ-warfare treaty is little more than a pledge
not to develop or stockpile biological weapons. It lacks provisions
to catch or punish those who do.
	   Fundamental issues that remain open include the facilities to be
inspected, who would inspect and how much notice the inspectors
would have to give, said the chairman, Tibor Toth of Hungary.
	   About 3,000 points are disputed in the current draft, Toth said.
	   The draft text has grown from 140 to 250 pages this year, he
said. But negotiations are going at a rate of around two pages per
day.
	   ``Time is oxygen,'' Toth told a news conference as negotiators
wrapped up their latest, three-week session. ``We need some oxygen
for these negotiations to proceed.''
	   Toth conceded it is ``physically impossible'' to negotiate away
that many points, but said the text would remain the basis of talks
at least this year.
	   A joint statement by 29 European, North American and Asian
countries Friday said negotiators should ``demonstrate leadership
by intensifying efforts toward the successful and early adoption of
a legally binding protocol.''
	   They referred to Clinton's urging of progress on the accord in
his State of the Union speech to Congress earlier this year.
	   During Clinton's visit to China last month, he and President
Jiang Zemin issued a statement supporting a stronger accord.
	   Negotiations at the United Nations' European headquarters
started in 1994. Toth has said talks should end by 2001.
	   Some 140 nations, including Iran and Libya, have ratified the
biological weapons treaty, and another 18 countries have signed it.
The accord was approved during the height of the Cold War, when few
seriously thought that germ warfare was a possibility.
	   Negotiations start again in September, when a decision must be
made on next year's schedule.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Serious flooding has killed 234 people in two
Chinese provinces, state media said Friday. The reports pushed the
death toll in this year's deadly annual flood season to beyond 650.
	   The floods caused by unusually heavy rains have hit 27 cities
and 158 counties in Zhejiang in the east and Sichuan in the
southwest since June, the Xinhua News Agency said, quoting the
Ministry of Civil Affairs.
	   Flood waters have destroyed 100,000 houses and left more than
90,000 people homeless, and affected more than 1 million hectares
(2.47 million acres) of crops, it said.
	   The floods also caused serious damage to irrigation facilities,
communications, power links and highways, and caused direct losses
of 4.6 billion yuan (dlrs 555 million).
	   Xinhua already had reported Thursday that floods caused by
torrential rains that began June 27 had killed 170 people and
injured more than 1,750 others in Sichuan.
	   Meanwhile, air force planes and helicopters have flown more than
30 missions in five flood-hit provinces, including flying supplies
in treacherous winds, rains and clouds to people trapped by
flooding in southeastern Fujian province, Xinhua said.
	   As of Sunday, 23 of China's 30 provinces, regions and major
cities had been hit by flooding, and more rains, as well as
possibly one or two typhoons or tropical storms, were expected, the
China Business Times said.
	   Meanwhile, weeks of flooding and sweltering summer heat prompted
authorities in a southern Chinese city to ban raw seafood and
sashimi, Japanese-style sliced raw fish, in an effort to combat an
increase in cholera, dysentery and other intestinal diseases, the
China Daily said.
	   Violators of the three-month ban in Guangzhou ``will be severely
punished,'' the official newspaper said.

Hard-line Protestants test police lines at Drumcree, warn of worse

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Leaders of Northern Ireland's
new Assembly sought Friday to drum up support for compromise over a
blocked Protestant march, but a spokesman for the marchers said he
feared a lethal clash pitting Protestant hard-liners against police
and soldiers.
	   Four police officers were hospitalized Friday morning after
surgery for injuries from bomb shrapnel and a fifth was admitted
after being hit by ball bearings fired from a crowd of 20,000 or
more massed near a rural church outside Portadown, 25 miles (40
kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   Police fired plastic bullets at demonstrators who breached
security barriers, and arrested nine people. It was the fifth night
of violence since authorities stopped a march by the Orange Order
from passing through a hostile Catholic neighborhood.
	   ``The incidents last night are deplored by ourselves, but it is
understandable. People see that peaceful protest isn't getting them
anywhere,'' said David Jones, a spokesman for the Orange Order,
Northern Ireland's largest Protestant brotherhood.
	   ``Is (Prime Minister) Tony Blair really prepared to have another
Bloody Sunday, only this time in Portadown, County Armagh?'' Jones
said, referring to the 1972 clash in which British soldiers killed
13 unarmed Catholic demonstrators in Londonderry. He said 25
civilians were injured by plastic bullets at Drumcree overnight.
	   ``I understand that there are strongly held views on either
side, but the rule of law is paramount,'' Blair said in a
television interview. He remained in touch with Orange leaders in
hope of finding a compromise to end the crisis, his office said.
	   David Trimble, the newly elected first minister of Northern
Ireland's Assembly, and his deputy, Seamus Mallon, were meeting
with religious, business and labor leaders hoping to drum up
support for compromise.
	   ``We haven't given up, nor will we give up. We will endeavour to
see what we can do to reach an accommodation,'' said Trimble, a
member of the Orange Order and leader of the Ulster Unionist Party,
which gets most of the Protestant vote in Northern Ireland.
	   From Sunday to 6 a.m. Friday, police had logged 550 attacks on
police and army personnel, including 15 shooting incidents, 151
arrests, 548 gasoline bomb attacks, 103 attacks on homes, and 367
attacks on vehicles. Through Thursday morning, police said they had
fired 216 plastic bullets.
	   ``Jobs have been lost, property has been destroyed,'' said Tom
Gillen of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, who met with Trimble
and Mallon. ``At a time we hoped young people would get work
through New Deal (a government program), they're out in the street
burning their prospects and their parents' prospects.''

Parties divided over Basque issue a year after councilor's killing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A year to the day after Basque separatists
sent shock waves through Spain by kidnapping and murdering a young
ruling party politician, the country's leaders appear more divided
than ever over how to resolve the northern region's bloody
conflict.
	   People across Spain were asked Friday to commemorate the killing
of Popular Party councilor Miguel Angel Blanco, 29, by the armed
separatist group ETA.
	   ETA kidnapped Blanco on July 10th last year. The group shot him
in the head and left him by the roadside two days later, despite
the unprecedented display of public outrage triggered by the
abduction.
	   But while Blanco murder briefly united Spaniards against ETA in
huge demonstrations, 12 months down the road political leaders are
snared in disagreement over how to end to violence.
	   Some parties within the troubled northern region are calling for
a negotiated solution along Northern Ireland lines which would
require a softening of the current policies against ETA and their
political allies Herri Batasuna (HB).
	   ``The solution will never come via those who say `never' to
talks with ETA or HB,'' said Xabier Arzalluz, the head of the
Basque Nationalist Party, in a direct challenge to the Madrid
government's frequently repeated rejection of a negotiated
solution.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos hit out at
Arzalluz saying it was ``a serious mistake to consider dialogue
with HB as long as ETA continue to brandish pistols.''
	   ETA, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has
killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for
independence of northern Spain's three Basque provinces. The
organization has killed eight people, including five councilors,
since the Blanco murder.
	   Alvarez Cascos denied that the dispute would affect the alliance
that provides the Popular Party's minority government in Madrid
with the support of the Basque Nationalist Party's five
parliamentary deputies.
	   Leading opposition Socialist Party chief Joaquin Almunia also
jumped into the fray Friday urging Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
to caution Arzalluz.
	   Last week disagreement over the talks issue prompted the
Socialists to quit the three-party alliance, headed by Arzalluz's
group, that has controlled the semiautonomous Basque regional
authority since 1994.
	   On Thursday, the Basque region's bishops issued a statement
saying it was ``shameful and discouraging'' that political parties
were unable to agree on how to confront ETA.
	   Many observers believe the negotiations issue is being used by
all sides as a vote catcher in view of regional elections later
this year.
	   Recent surveys indicated that a majority of Basques believed the
problem can only be solved through talks, and that the matter
cannot be combated solely with police measures.
	   Herri Batasuna has urged Spanish political leaders to take the
lead offered by their British and Irish counterparts in seeking
talks with all sides, including the IRA-linked Sinn Fein group, to
try to resolve the Northern Ireland conflict.

Satellite news network makes debut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's pioneer pay-TV company Telepiu on Friday
announced the debut of a pay satellite network which will deliver
regional news 24 hours a day.
	   The INN (Italia Network News) network will go on the air at the
beginning of September as part of the digital facilities of TV
Telepiu, the pay-TV operation that is part of the media empire of
former Premier Silvio Berlusconi.
	   Telepiu is known primarily now for sports broadcasts and movies.
	   ``We expect to deliver news to those who live outside their
region, as well as to Italians who live abroad,'' said INN official
Giacomina Valenti.
	   Telepiu's digital network has 400,000 subscribers, and it
expects to have 1 million by 2000.
	   Telepiu said it will invest 10 billion lire (dlrs 5.6 million)
in the project within the year. It will use Hot Bird 2, one of
Europe's largest TV satellites.
	   Digital television delivers better picture and sound quality
than the current analog system.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union approved 7 million
European currency units (dlrs 7.5 million) in humanitarian aid for
Cuba on Friday and 1 million ecus (dlrs 1.1 million) for
Guinea-Bissau.
	   The European Commission, executive arm of the EU, said the money
for Cuba, to be managed by the European Community Humanitarian
Office, would enable nongovernmental organizations to carry out
health programs targeted at the most vulnerable to the shortcomings
of the Cuban system.
	   ``The economic crisis in Cuba has had very serious repercussions
on public health,'' the Commission said in a statement.
	   The funding covers food aid, medicines, production of medicines
locally and medical and other supplies for hospitals.
	   The money for Guinea-Bissau is aimed at helping those directly
affected by the monthlong rebellion by a military faction seeking
to overthrow the government.
	   The Commission said in a statement that 250,000 people have fled
the fighting in the capital of the former Portuguese colony on the
West African coast.

EU reports rise in tourism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The 15 European Union nations earned
dlrs 155.2 billion from tourism last year, with Greece, France and
Finland enjoying a ``remarkable increase'' in foreign vacationers,
the EU's statistics office reported Friday.
	   In Greece the number of nights spent by non-residents rose by
12.2 percent in 1997, in France and Finland by just over 10
percent, said the Eurostat report.
	   That compared to a average rise of 3.1 percent across the EU.
Tourism receipts were up across the Union from dlrs 153.2 in 1996.
	   All 15 EU nations saw more foreign vacationers, expect Italy
with a fall of 4.3 percent, Austria with a 3.7 percent decline and
Sweden down 0.5 percent.
	   However, Italy continued to earn more money from tourism that
any other EU nation with a yearly total of dlrs 28.5 billion,
closely followed by France and Spain.

At least two dead in spate of border clashes

<TEXT>
	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Albanian arms smugglers and Yugoslav
troops traded fire at several Kosovo border points Friday, leaving
at least four smugglers dead, Serb sources and witnesses said.
	   Serb and Albanian sources also reported scattered clashes
elsewhere in the rebellious province, where ethnic Albanians are
fighting for independence from Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.
	   The government confiscated large quantities of arms and
ammunition following clashes in the border village of Vrbnica, 70
kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Pristina, the pro-government
Serbian Media Center said.
	   In another clash, Yugoslav army troops battled Albanian arms
smugglers near the border village of Kosare and near the border
outpost of Gorozup to the south.
	   AP-Television cameraman Dejan Mladenovic, who visited the site
of the Kosare clash, said the gunbattle lasted until Friday
morning. The bodies of two smugglers lay in the grass near the
cache of weapons which troops said were seized from the Albanians.
	   The weapons included semi-automatic rifles and land mines.
Troops told Mladenovic that it was the first time they had seized
land mines from ethnic Albanian smugglers.
	   Troops also captured one smuggler, Zef Kqiraj, who claimed he
bought the weapons from a soldier in the Albanian army. Troops said
they believed he was bringing the weapons to arm ethnic Albanians
in his home village in Kosovo.
	   In northern Kosovo, a Serbian policeman was wounded in an attack
by ethnic Albanians on a checkpoint on the road between Kosovska
Mitrovica and Srbica, the center said.
	   Serb sources also reported Albanian extremists attacked police
Friday morning in the village of Dolac, 45 kilometers (28 miles)
west of the provincial capital Pristina, but were driven off with
``significant losses.''
	   The reports could be independently confirmed. The independent
Beta news agency quoted police as saying Albanian rebels had staged
663 attacks in the province this year, including 262 against
policemen or police stations.
	   British officials speaking in London on Friday said the United
States and European nations trying to stop the fighting have agreed
that Kosovo should have a significant degree of autonomy, but not
independence.
	   But that has been the official position of the major powers
since violence escalated in Kosovo in February. The United States
and European powers have so far not found a formula for uniting the
various Albanian factions to negotiate with the Yugoslav
government.
	   The Albanians, including the moderate leader favored by the
Americans and Europeans, all support independence rather than
autonomy. With no fresh ideas, the major powers are hoping to place
enough pressure on the Albanians to get a cease-fire and peace
talks started.
	   The six-nation Contact Group that coordinates international
policy in the Balkans set out a number of principles that could
form part of a blueprint for resolving the question of Kosovo's
status at what British officials described as a ``difficult''
meeting Wednesday in Bonn, Germany.
	   One principle states that all citizens _ 90 percent are ethnic
Albanians _ should be able to exercise their democratic rights and
be represented at every level of government, the officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Meanwhile, France and Britain were preparing a draft Security
Council resolution aimed at securing a cease-fire, a French Foreign
Ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   The draft resolution would indicate that additional measures
would be taken to end the fighting if Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian rebels did not take steps to halt hostilities, spokesman
Yves Doutriaux said in Paris.
	   Northwest of Pristina, the provincial capital, about 400 Kosovo
Albanians _ many of them armed _ fortified their village, Pantina,
against expected Serb attacks Friday.
	   Villagers in Pantina said Serbs in nearby Svinjare had burned
down four Albanian houses after their occupants had fled. Serb
civilians, some toting rifles, blocked reporters from entering
Svinjare.

Next World Cup will be different, for sure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY190-192 of July 8 &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Sake instead of champagne. Kimchi in place of
crepes. Rather than views of the Seine from the Eiffel Tower,
glances at North Korea over the DMZ.
	   The next World Cup will be as different from the edition that
ends Sunday as East from West _ the places it's held, the cultures
involved, the way the teams are picked, even the nature of the
host.
	   Two countries, not one, will stage the soccer's 17th world
championship in 2002, and they're not exactly friends.
	   Japan and South Korea, the twin turbines that drove Asia's
economic boom and are now going through hard times, were chosen to
share the World Cup in a decision born of soccer politics and
global marketing.
	   FIFA made the unprecedented choice of co-hosts because it was
growng weary of the bitter bidding war between Japan and South
Korea, long-time Asian rivals stemming from Japan's occupation of
the Korean peninsula during World War II.
	   It also was concerned about offending either side as FIFA is
trying to spread from its traditional strongholds in Europe and
Latin America. Officials have made it clear that this is a one-time
alternative to the one-country tradition.
	   Japan and South Korea break tradition, too, because neither is a
soccer power, unlike France, where the idea for the World Cup was
born in the 1920s.
	   The Koreans played in their fifth World Cup this summer, while
Japan made its debut. Neither ever have won a World Cup game.
	   Both were eliminated in the first round in France 98, although
they showed signs of better things to come.
	   ``The only difference is that we lack experience,'' said Hong
Myung-bo, a South Korean defender. ``Of course, the level of
football in Asia is still inferior to that in Europe.''
	   Because they are hosts, Japan and South Korea automatically are
in the tournament. That puts a strain on Asian participation.
	   Asia was guaranteed three spots in France 98, and received a
fourth when Iran beat out Oceania champion Australia.
	   If the present allotment is maintained, it means the rest of
Asia would go through qualifying to chose only one guaranteed team,
possibly two.
	   Oceania is seeking a guaranteed berth, rather than having to
compete in a playoff with a nation from another confederation.
	   Europe, with 15 teams this time, and Africa, with five, want
more.
	   Sepp Blatter, FIFA's new president, said the continental
qualifying system will be decided by the end of the year. He said
it would be the trickiest piece of the 2002 puzzle.
	   ``The fact that there are two hosts, and the defending champion,
who get in automatically makes this especially difficult,'' he
said. ``It will require a very diplomatic solution.''
	   Whoever is in the field better have their passports ready. There
will be plenty of hopscotching over the Sea of Japan.
	   For the first round, the field will be split down the middle,
with 16 teams in four groups playing in South Korea and the same
number in Japan. Blatter said he would like to maintain the French
practice of teams playing their three first-round games in
different cities.
	   ``The teams say it is better for them,'' he said. ``They are not
stuck in one place. They get to travel. They get to see things.''
	   With the second round, the international travel begins. Half the
Korea-based teams will go to Japan, and half the Japan-based teams
to Korea. That pattern stays through the semifinals, before the
winners travel to Tokyo for the title game. The opening game will
be played in South Korea's capital, Seoul.
	   A third country could come into this mix. The Seoul government
has given organizers permission to talk with North Korea about
fielding a joint team and staging some games in the communist
capital of Pyongyang.
	   While the field may not shrink, the length of the tournament
might. France 98, with an extra eight teams, lasted 33 days. While
that's just two days longer than the 1994 tournament, Blatter would
like to tighten the first round to reduce it by about a week.
	   ``It's very difficult to attract the interest of the world over
five weeks,'' the FIFA president said.

World Cup: Passion for soccer drives Brazil's aging coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ For every decision, Mario
Zagallo has 160 million second-guessers back home. He takes
tranquilizers for stress. His critics call him obtuse, outdated and
worse.
	   He can't get enough.
	   ``Soccer is passion,'' the Brazilian coach said. ``It's my life.
I embraced it, and do it for pleasure even though it's my job.''
	   Perhaps only love can explain what drives Zagallo at 66 to seek
a fifth World Cup title when it plays against France on Sunday. And
he's already talking about a sixth.
	   ``I'm old because of time,'' he said. ``My hair is white, but I
have the desire and the determination for another cup.''
	   It's not like he has anything to prove. Zagallo has a guaranteed
place in soccer's pantheon as the only four-time winner of the
World Cup _ as a player in 1958 and 1962, coach in 1970 and
assistant in 1994. Not even Pele can make that claim.
	   Still, Zagallo is anything but a consensus in Brazil. Many feel
he's too old-fashioned or conservative for today's soccer. Every
time the team doesn't win _ although it usually does _ Zagallo is
blamed.
	   Sometimes it gets to him.
	   ``I accept criticism, but what hurts is mockery,'' he said. ``In
Germany, I was elected the best coach in the world. In Brazil, I'm
ridiculed.''
	   The only time he seemed above reproach was as a player in the
1950s and 1960s, the golden era of Brazilian soccer. On the
legendary Botafogo team of Garrincha, Didi and Nilton Santos,
Zagallo was a gifted left winger with a rare notion of tactics.
	   Very early he saw how vulnerable the team was on the attack. So
Zagallo created the ``worker ant'' style, scurrying back and forth
from the front line to the midfield. Soon all the teams were doing
it.
	   After retiring as a player, Zagallo was a natural to become
coach. That's when the consensus ended.
	   In 1970, with Brazil under a brutal military dictatorship,
Zagallo was named to replace a popular coach who had displeased the
ruling generals. Brazil won the Cup, but many fans still give
Zagallo's predecessor the credit.
	   Zagallo was back in 1974, but Brazil lost in the semifinals to
the Dutch ``Clockwork Orange'' of Johan Cruyff. It was the only
World Cup he didn't win, and it began a 20-year exile from the
national team.
	   Zagallo worked for various teams in the Middle East, where he
made his fortune. In Brazil, he coached at the top club level,
where his unfashionable concern with defense won titles but not
enthusiasts.
	   Still, in 1994, he was back as assistant to Carlos Alberto
Parreira, and took over as coach after the cup was won.
	   Promising to revive ``art soccer,'' Zagallo enjoyed a second
honeymoon with fans as his team played brilliantly, winning the
1997 Copa America for the first time outside Brazil.
	   But a poor performance in the Gold Cup this year and an uneven
showing in the run-up to the World Cup were enough to sour the
romance again.
	   Patriotic, superstitious _ his lucky number is 13 _ Zagallo
can't avoid the spotlight. But he considers himself pre-destined,
and doesn't plan to leave it soon.
	   ``I thrill when I see our green and yellow,'' he said. ``I am
here representing my country and the Americas. I know the
responsibility on my shoulders. And I know I am giving the country
something positive.''
	   Returning to the continent where he helped Brazil to its first
Cup makes it doubly special.
	   ``I've lived soccer for 50 years, and this is my happiest
moment,'' he said, his voice trembling. ``After 40 years, our flag
will fly again in Europe. The World Cup is safe in our hands.''

France and Britain preparing Security Council resolution on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from British Foreign Office; Adds
background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France and Britain are preparing a draft U.N.
Security Council resolution aimed at securing an immediate
cease-fire in Serbia's Kosovo province, French and British
officials said Friday.
	   The draft resolution would clearly indicate that additional
measures would be taken if Serb forces and ethnic Albanian rebels
do not take steps to halt hostilities, according to a statement
from French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
	   However, further authorization from the Security Council would
be needed before any sanctions were enacted, the French statement
said.
	   The resolution is intended to implement a statement issued by
the six-member Contact Group that coordinates international policy
on the Balkans after their meeting Wednesday in Bonn, Germany. Its
members are France, Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy and
Russia.
	   ``It's only at its preliminary stages at the moment,'' a British
Foreign Office spokesman said in London, speaking on customary
anonymity.
	   ``It will set in stone undertakings the Contact Group set out
for (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic and that he gave in
Moscow. It will call for protection of international monitors and
for immediate cease-fire,'' the British spokesman said.
	   In the communique, the Contact Group said it would seek a
Security Council resolution underlining the need for a cessation of
hostilities ``to permit a meaningful dialogue between the
parties.''
	   The resolution will also require authorities in Belgrade and
Kosovo to ensure the safety of international observers and keep
pledges made by Milosevic during talks with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin in Moscow on June 16, the communique said.
	   During that meeting, Milosevic promised to resume talks with
Albanians in Kosovo and guarantee free access to international
monitors and aid groups.
	   ``Should the required steps not be taken, the Contact Group will
consider further action under the United Nations Charter, including
action that may require the authorization of a U.N. Security
Council resolution, to bring about compliance by those who block
the process,'' the communique said.
	   At the Bonn meeting, the Contact Group warned militants of the
Kosovo Liberation Army that they could face sanctions if they
impeded new talks.
	   Hundreds of people have died this year in clashes between Serb
security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels, and thousands have fled
the fighting.
	   Albanians, who made up 90 percent of the province, want greater
autonomy for the province, which is located in southern Serbia, the
dominant of the two republics that make up Yugoslavia.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Travelers suffered delays of up to five
hours Friday at Athens airport because of air traffic control
problems.
	   At least two domestic flights were canceled and dozens of
international flights suffered delays.
	   Airport officials said they expected delays to continue
Saturday.
	   Air traffic controllers blamed the delays on scheduling
conflicts with the Eurocontrol system, which regulates air traffic
at European Union airports.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a blunt and gloomy report, the prime minister
warned parliament on Friday that social tension was rising in
Russia and financial markets have ``practically ceased to exist.''
	   Since Russia's economy began spiraling downward this year,
volume on the stock market has declined from about dlrs 110 million
a day to as little as dlrs 10 million a day.
	   In his address to the Federation Council, the upper house of
parliament, Sergei Kiriyenko also said the government's proposed
new economic program represented a wholesale change in economic
policy.
	   Still, the program _ demanded by Western lending agencies _
received only a lukewarm response from the legislators.
	   Kiriyenko delivered his speech as President Boris Yeltsin was
beseeching Western leaders for support and a senior official of the
International Monetary Fund was en route to Moscow, presumably to
put the finishing touches on an agreement for an IMF bailout.
	   Yeltsin spoke by telephone with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques
Chirac, all of whom voiced support for Russia's anti-crisis
economic program, the Kremlin said. He was also expected to speak
to U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   The government's chief negotiator with Western lending agencies,
Anatoly Chubais, prepared to meet with John Odling-Smee of the IMF,
who was expected to arrive sometime Friday night.
	   Russia is seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in loans
from the agency. Any agreement would likely be contingent on
approval by IMF headquarters and on passage of the government's
economic plan in parliament _ no small hurdle.
	   The Russian economy was just beginning to show signs of growth
when it sharply retrenched this year in response to a variety of
pressures, including the Asian financial crisis, a drop in world
oil prices and growing signs of impatience and unrest among
Russia's long-suffering workforce.
	   In the past week, striking miners have shut down the
Trans-Siberian Railway for the second time this year and unpaid
defense workers have picketed in several Russian cities.
	   ``Social tension is growing in society, which naturally is not
helpful to stabilization,'' Kiriyenko said in his speech.
	   His harshest words Friday came in his assessment of the shrunken
financial markets.
	   ``The financial market has practically ceased to exist,''
Kiriyenko said. ``There is in fact no financial market in Russia
now.''
	   However, the prime minister _ a former banker _ dug in his heels
when asked if the ruble would be devalued. ``Never,'' he said.
	   Kiriyenko leaves Monday for an official visit to Japan. News
reports have said the Japanese government may extend substantial
loans to Russia.
	   Kiriyenko had gone to the Federation Council to ask its approval
of the government's economic stabilization program, which would
overhaul the country's tax laws and cut spending.
	   He said it would fundamentally change the economy, in part by
shifting the tax burden from producers to consumers. He also said
it would allow the government to pump an immediate 200 billion
rubles (dlrs 33 billion) into industry.
	   The Federation Council overwhelmingly passed a resolution that
partly praised the government's approach, but sharply criticized
important aspects of the plan.
	   ``The program does not contain measures to revive industrial
production, raise investment activity, increase the competitiveness
of national industrial output, strengthen currency controls, ensure
the ruble's stability or provide social protection for the
population,'' the resolution said, according to the Interfax news
agency.

Mexico frees former Guatemalan guerrillas, flies them home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) _ Shedding tears of joy and
sadness, eight former Guatemalan guerrillas were released from a
Mexican prison Friday and flown to freedom in their homeland.
	   Hundreds of inmates and guards at the Cerro Hueco prison in this
southern Mexican state capital applauded and hooted as the
Guatemalans were taken under heavy guard from the prison compound
into four vans for their trip to the airport.
	   There, they boarded a 12-seat Cessna airplane for the flight to
Guatemala City's Aurora airport, where former colleagues waited to
greet them.
	   ``I feel a great excitement combined with sadness,'' Rene
Dolores Martinez, one of the prisoners, told The Associated Press.
``Excitement because we're going home, but sadness to leave behind
the Mexican people who treated us like their sons.''
	   Guatemala's civil war, Latin America's longest and deadliest,
ended with peace treaties in December 1996. Guerrillas in Guatemala
have been freed and disarmed, but the eight rebels remained in
Mexican prisons.
	   They were arrested on Oct. 3, 1992, by Mexican soldiers as they
transported a heavy weapon in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas,
which borders Guatemala. They were sentenced to prison terms
ranging from 10 to 17 years for weapons violations.
	   They were freed under a special agreement between Mexico and
Guatemala; even the prisoners said they didn't know the details.
	   ``I think this opens another door to demand our real rights as
former members of the Guatemalan guerrillas and as beneficiaries of
the peace accords,'' Dolores Martinez said.
	   He hadn't seen his family in nine years, but combined with the
joy of the impending reunion was the sadness over what he was
leaving behind.
	   ``I feel sad because I'm leaving a great family, the hundreds of
inmates with whom I have lived for six years,'' he said. ``I'm
leaving many friends in what has been my home for five years and
nine months, in the prison.''
	   Six of the Guatemalans _ Dolores Martinez; Samuel Elias Chavez
Chiquin; David Gonzalez Perez; Martin Carmona Armas; Miriam Lopez
Garcia and Alma Xochilt Gonzalez Lopez _ were held in the Cerro
Hueco prison here.
	   Two others _ Jose Matias Armida and Cesar Mauricio Garcia _ were
held in a prison in the central state of Puebla.

French lay cornerstone for Berlin embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ France's foreign minister laid the cornerstone
Friday for a new French embassy in Berlin, to be built on the site
where the old, baroque French embassy stood before it was bombed in
World War II.
	   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine noted the symbolism of the
rebuilding during a ceremony Friday. While Germany and France were
enemies through much of the 19th and 20th centuries, he said, the
two are firmly joined today in progress toward a united Europe.
	   Next year, the German capital will move from Bonn back to
Berlin, the center of government power before the war.
	   Britain held groundbreaking ceremonies for its embassy in June.
The United States embassy, to be located near the British and
French, is still in the planning stages.
	   The French embassy, designed by French architect Christian de
Porzamparc, will stand near the Brandenburg Gate on what used to be
the communist East German ``no man's land'' of the Berlin Wall.

Reggae, rock and rhetoric: junta radio is on the air

<TEXT>
	   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ The bumping beat of a reggae hit
fades off the air, replaced by a flourish of rolling Portuguese:
``Rrrrrrrradio Bombolon! You're listening to the voice of the
junta.''
	   At the voice of the junta radio, they are speaking the language
of the people _ rock, reggae and rhetoric.
	   On the air for only about three weeks, rebel radio _ controlled
by Guinea-Bissau's breakaway military leaders _ has become a
regular part of the day for most everyone with a receiver.
	   Sure, it's full of propaganda and polemic, but it's the music
that keeps many tuned in.
	   And it's a heck of a lot better than the news bulletins and
local classical and folk tunes that the radio station played before
the coup attempt.
	   Spinning hits by Guinea-Bissau's hit duo ``Iva and Ichy,'' along
with a mix of tunes from the West and elsewhere in Africa, Radio
Bombolon for many is a brief escape from their daily diet of war
reports and the sound of gunfire.
	   ``I'm a communicator,'' says Radio Bombolon disc jockey Issidoro
Alfonso Rodrigues. ``I like what I'm doing, I like what the junta
is doing and want to speak to the people.''
	   Rodrigues fumbles through a stack of compact discs, then cues
his selection up on the player. All the while he chatters,
uninterrupted, about justice, democracy, freedom _ Rodrigues knows
all the right buttons to push.
	   ``This is the voice of justice,'' he barks into the microphone
in staccato Portuguese. ``Justice is for the people. We are not
bandits, we are not criminals, we are a group of men for justice
just like you.''
	   Following the junta line, Rodrigues says the coup mounted last
month by former chief of army staff Brig. Ansumane Mane was aimed
only at ousting President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   The intention, he says, is not to establish military rule in
this tiny West African enclave.
	   ``Vieira is a crook. He's stolen from you, the people and left
you with what?'' he says into the microphone.
	   Vieira, widely accused of rampant corruption, amassed a personal
fortune during his 18 years in power. While most people earn less
then dlrs 200 a year in Guinea-Bissau, it was not uncommon for
Vieira to jet off to Paris and Lisbon for personal vacations.
	   For his part, however, Vieira, the legitimately elected
president, says Mane and his military co-conspirators are a bunch
of outlaws, taking the law into their own hands.
	   Shortly before his coup attempt, Mane was sacked after being
accused of smuggling guns to separatist rebels in neighboring
Senegal.
	   Whatever the truth between the escalating and increasingly
violent struggle between Mane and Vieira, the voice of the junta
radio has struck a chord with the people.
	   The radio station is the sole source of news for most local
residents, said Beto N'funta, a displaced person from Bissau. And
the lively music helps him make it through the day, N'funta said as
he rode in the back of a minibus that was blaring Radio Bombolon.
	   A civilian who believes in the rebel cause, Rodrigues was
trained in radio and communications at Guinea-Bissau's
state-controlled broadcasting authority, where he worked for four
years before the coup.
	   Known better by his on-air nickname ``Nuno,'' Rodrigues was
quick to join the rebel radio station when renegade troops captured
its broadcasting outlet on the northern side of Bissau. Now he
works a blend of DJ magic, mixing talk with music.
	   Inside Radio Bombolon's two-story building, upstairs, past
window panes shattered by bullets and scattered tins of surplus
Russian army meals, Rodrigues sits by himself for 12-hour shifts in
a bunkerlike studio.
	   The glassless windows to the studio covered with protective wood
panels and a military generator pumping electricity into the
station, he works with microphone like a seasoned pro.
	   ``...if the boat doesn't reach the shore, it'll be destroyed,''
he says, ending off with his trademark. ``This is Rrrrrrrradio
Bombolon.
	   With a flick of a switch the microphone goes dead, giving way to
gyrating, toe-tapping thump of ``Super Mama Jambo's'' local hit
``Bring the boat to shore.''

Australian arrested near border in connection with ticket fraud

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss police have asked for the extradition of a
man from France to Switzerland in connection with the fraudulent
sale of hundreds of World Cup tickets, Geneva police said Friday.
	   French police acting on information from their Geneva
counterparts arrested a 54-year-old Australian resident of Geneva
on Wednesday at the railway station in the town of Bellegarde,
located near the French-Swiss border.
	   Police say an international warrant was issued for the man's
arrest after several hundred people paid for tickets but never
received them. They said the total value of the tickets is several
hundred thousand Swiss francs (dlrs).
	   The man is being held at a prison in Lyon, France and hasn't
opposed his extradition to Switzerland, police say.

Government refuses to register three opposition publications
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The government on Friday refused to
register three opposition publications that have been extensively
covering alleged high-level corruption.
	   Registrar General Omondi Mbago notified Finance magazine, and
the Star and Post on Sunday newspapers that they their applications
for registration have been rejected, making it illegal for them to
continue publishing.
	   The official, who operates out of the Attorney General's office,
is not required to explain his decision.
	   Tony Gachoka, editor and publisher of Post on Sunday, said the
move was intended ``to deny both Kenyans and international
observers information about the true state of the country's
economic and political realities and to keep the Kenyan people
unaware.''
	   Gachoka told The Associated Press he was in hiding after police
raided the offices of the Post on Sunday July 2.
	   He said he already had a certificate of registration for the
newspaper.
	   Star editor Magayu Magayu appeared in court last week to answer
charges he was publishing ``an alarming publication.''
	   A magistrate's court on Friday set bail, but police picked
Magayu up again as soon as he left court.
	   Finance publisher Njehu Gatabaki, who is also an opposition
member of parliament, has a history of problems with the government
of President Daniel arap Moi since he first began putting out
Finance in 1986. The publication has never been registered.
	   The first edition of the Post on Sunday appeared last Dec. 21,
eight days before general elections in which Moi was re-elected and
his Kenya African National Union party managed to hold on to a slim
majority in parliament.
	   All three editor-publishers have complained of police
harrassment because they are publishing stories about alleged
high-level corruption and politically motivated ethnic violence
that do not appear in the mainstream press.
	   ``Kenya has been taken back today to the days before the 1992
elections when media intimidation led to the closure of various
publications, including Society and the Nairobi Law Monthly,''
Gachoka said.
	   Moi reluctantly agreed to multiparty elections in 1992, the
first in Kenya since 1966.
	   Gachoka said he would appeal the registrar's decision in court
but said the process would be ``long and laborious.''
	   ``Other remaining media will see the drastic action of the
government and be cowed by it,'' he said.

Lawsuit looms over rights to stinking refuse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A foodstore chain and city authorities are
locked in an unusual dispute over the groceries' garbage. Both
sides want the refuse.
	   The Haakon Group claims it owns the trash produced by its Rimi
grocery stores in Oslo, and wants to profit and protect the
environment by recycling the rubbish on its own. The company said
Thursday it's preparing to go to court to stake its claim.
	   The city sanitation department, on the other hand, says it owns
the offal, and that Rimi has to pay to have it hauled away and
burned.
	   Nils Henrik Petterson, attorney for the Haakon Group, says the
company believes it will be cheaper and better to recycle the trash
on its own.
	   ``We think we will be able to achieeve a greater degree of
reuse,'' he said. ``What happens how is that the city, to a very
great extend, burns the refuse they collect, and that is not very
future-oriented.''
	   City officials said they could not comment because of the
expected court case. Newspapers said the case could set an
important precedent, partly because the private-recycling industry
is expanding rapidly in Norway, which could make trash a valuable
resource.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The Pretoria High Court on Friday
dismissed an application by three Christian organizations to
declare abortion illegal.
	   The Christian groups wanted the Choice on Termination of
Pregnancy Act declared unconstitutional, arguing that the life of a
human being started at conception.
	   But Judge S.W. McCreath found that whatever the status of the
fetus may be under the common law, which was at present somewhat
uncertain, he believed that under the Constitution the fetus was
not a legal person with rights.
	   McCreath also pointed out that under the law, everyone has the
right to make decisions concerning reproduction and to control over
their bodies.
	   ``Nowhere is a woman's rights in this respect qualified in terms
of the Constitution in order to protect the fetus,'' the judge
said.
	   Wits University's Women's Health Project said it was delighted
the challenge to the Act had been rejected.
	   ``It is a relief for the many women who are choosing to
terminate their pregnancies to know that the Act is in place and
that they will not have to turn to unsafe methods,'' said Project
spokeswoman Marion Stevens.
	   The Christian organizations said they first wanted to study the
judgment before deciding on an appeal or a possible amendment to
the particulars of claim.

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Burkina's main opposition party
announced Friday it would boycott upcoming presidential elections.
	   In a statement issued in the capital, Ouagadougou, the Party for
Democracy and Progress said the decision was taken after a party
meeting not to field any candidates.
	   In May, opposition lawmakers boycotted a vote to create an
independent electoral commission to oversee the elections scheduled
for December, saying it was not truly independent.
	   President Blaise Campaore won presidential elections in 1991 as
the only candidate after coming to power in a bloody coup four
years earlier.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ South African telecommunications company
MTN and the state-owned RwandaTel Friday announced the launch of
the first cellular telephone operator in Rwanda.
	   The GSM cellular phone network, operated by the joint venture
RwandaCell, will be fully operational in September. At first the
network will only cover the capital, Kigali, but will later be
expanded to four other towns in the central African nation.
	   RwandaCell spokesman Francois du Plessis said he estimated 5,000
customers will subscribe within the first year under two price
plans: the contract service with a deposit and a pre-paid service
based on monthly cards.
	   MTN operates cellular phone systems in South Africa, Swaziland
and Mozambique and in September will enter the highly competitive
market in Uganda.
	   Du Plessis said the MTN-run digital networks in Uganda and
Rwanda will not be compatible with the analog systems in
neighboring Congo and Burundi.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ President Robert Mugabe's government
will scrap a controversial 2.5 percent increase in sales tax aimed
at raising 4.5 billion Zimbabwe dollars (U.S. dlrs 250 million) for
ex-guerrillas in its October annual revenue measures.
	   Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro made the
announcement to the state-controlled media on Thursday.
	   The Zimbabwe Congress of Trades Unions has threatened to call a
five-day national strike to protest high prices and extra taxes
they say were levied because of chronic corruption and economic
mismanagement.
	   The ZCTU will meet Tuesday to decide whether to go ahead with
its strike call.

	   SEBOKENG, South Africa (AP) _ Hopes that the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission's amnesty hearing into the 1992 Boipatong
massacre would reveal a full account of who planned and carried it
out have not yet been met.
	   Little new information has emerged about the June 17, 1992,
attack which left 46 people dead and caused widespread outrage.
	   Sixteen Inkatha Freedom Party members, who were convicted for
the murders in 1994, have applied for amnesty for their part in the
attack.
	   On Friday the committee heard more testimony by the first of the
applicants, Victor Mthandeni Mthembu, 29, who continued to deny
involvement of high-ranking IFP officials and the security forces
in the killings.
	   Mthembu has denied knowing any of the high-ranking IFP officials
in the area at the time. Fighting between supporters of the IFP and
the African National Congress resulted in widespread killings in
the years before the 1994 elections.

Rawlings commends South African whites who stayed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings on Friday commended whites who decided to make South
Africa their home, saying they were investing in the country.
	   Rawlings, who visited the Hector Petersen memorial in Soweto,
told journalists that Africa knew that during the times of
apartheid some whites treated blacks badly.
	   ``However, the most important thing is that after apartheid,
most whites decided to stay on and make South Africa their home.
That means they decided to invest in the country,'' Rawlings said.
``That is why South Africa is such a great country.''
	   Rawlings also urged support for President Nelson Mandela's drive
for reconciliation.
	   Rawlings' five-day state visit ends Sunday.

Tottenham dismisses Kluivert deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Premier League soccer team Tottenham Hotspur
Friday dismissed reports linking the club with a 7.5 million-pound
(dlrs 12.45 million) offer for Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert.
	   Tottenham director David Pleat said the Spurs had not negotiated
a deal for Kluivert with his Italian club AC Milan.
	   But Pleat drew immediate criticism from Spurs fans by saying
Ronald De Boer, the only Dutch international he wanted to sign, was
``ungettable''.
	   The Tottenham Action Group said Pleat's attitude was not good
enough and that every player had their price.
	   ``The fact that Pleat admits defeat shows the lack of ambition
of the club and gives us reason to fear another season of
mediocrity,'' an action group spokesman said.

Sweden*s Gustafsson now only two steps from writing clay classic
</HEADLINE>
history &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden came within
two steps of winning an unprecedented fourth title in the Swedish
Open ATP claycourt classic Friday, and he did not have to work as
hard as expected for it.
	   The 31-year-old claycourt specialist had dropped the first set
6-7 (7-9) to low-ranked Jerome Golmard when the Frenchman was
forced to retire after losing the first game of the second set
complaining of back pain. Top seed Gustafsson moved into the semis
where he faces Thomas Johansson, the only other remaining of eight
Swedish entries to survive the eights.
	   Should Gustafsson, who won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, go all
the way again, he will not only improve upon his current 26th
ranking but also be one up on such greats as Bjorn Borg and Mats
Wilander, the only others to win three titles in this seaside
tourney.
	   Sixth-seeded Johansson, a 23-year-old currently ranked 41st,
squeezed by talented Italian Davide Sanguinetti in a match
completed Friday after being interrupted by rain Thursday. The
tally was 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Johansson, who won his first two ATP tour titles at Copenhagen
in Denmark and at St. Petersburg in Russia last year, was scheduled
also to play Moroccan Karim Alami in the quarters Friday but got by
with a walk over. Alami hurt his right wrist in a fall late in his
match the previous day.
	   In other quarterfinals action, seventh seed Dominic Hrbaty of
Slovakia advanced into the semis on the lower half by ousting
unseeded Czech opponent Jiri Novak 3-6, 6-4, 6-4. The fast-rising
21-year-old from Bratislava , currently 44th in the rankings, in
1996 was the youngest ever player to finish in the top 100 and is
gunning for his first ATP title.
	   Hrbaty on Saturday faces seasoned 25-year-old Andrei Medvedev of
Ukraine, who has gone the other way. Among the top five in the
world less than five years ago, Medvedev is currently at the 100
fringe, making a comeback after injuries.
	   Medvedev, unseeded here, had to finish two matches Friday to
make it to the semis. He first completed a tough see-saw battle
with Australian Richard Fromberg, Swedish Open winner here in 1990,
7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 7-6 (7-2). The Ukrainian, who lost the final at
Bastad in 1966 to Gustafsson, in the afternoon went on to dispose
of third-seeded Italian Andrea Gaudenzi in straight sets 6-3, 6-4.
	   In the doubles South African pair Lan Bale and Piet Norval
advanced to the final by knocking out top seeded Swedes Nicklas
Kulti and Mikael Tillstrom 6-4, 6-3. Kulti is set to play doubles
for Swdeen in the Davis Cup semifinal against Germany next week,
then teaming with Jonas Bjorklund.

Prince Charles told to go public with relationship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Being heir to the British throne means that you're
never short of advice.
	   ``Show us you love her,'' The Sun, Britain's biggest selling
tabloid, told Prince Charles on the newspaper's front page Friday,
telling him - in a typically blunt editorial - to go public with
his relationship with longtime companion, Camilla Parker Bowles.
	   ``For goodness sake, get on with it'' the newspaper said.
``Neither of you is getting any younger,'' referring to the prince,
who will be 50 in November, and Mrs. Parker Bowles, 50.
	   Attempts by Prince Charles to introduce the British public to
Mrs. Parker Bowles, blamed by Princess Diana for the breakup of her
marriage to Prince Charles, were put on hold last August after
Diana's death in a Paris car crash.
	   After that, Mrs. Parker Bowles, who has two children by a
previous marriage, disappeared from public view, fearful that the
public would use her as a scapegoat.
	   But earlier this week, Prince Charles' spokesman admitted that
Mrs. Parker Bowles had met Charles' eldest son, Prince William, 16,
and got on with him. As memories of Diana fade, The Sun says that
the time is right for Charles to be seen with Mrs. Parker Bowles in
public - and support from Britain's powerful tabloid newspapers
could be key in successfully making Mrs. Parker Bowles a public
figure.
	   ''It is time for Charles to put public opinion to the test,''
the newspaper said. ``Clearly, a love that lasts more than two
decades - and survives both marrying someone else along the way -
is very, very special,'' The Sun said.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair
offered to arrange contacts between Protestant marchers and
Catholic protesters Friday as a tense and violent week slid into a
potentially explosive weekend.
	   Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, offered to hold
``indirect contact talks,'' starting Saturday morning, between the
Orange Order and representatives of Catholic residents on the
Garvaghy Road in Portadown.
	   Neither side immediately responded. The Orange Order has refused
to have any direct contact with the residents, insisting it has a
historic right to march on any public highway.

Three murderers publicly executed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Ismaray one word is correct &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Three convicted murderers were
executed in a football field in the Afghan capital by family
members of the men they killed.
	   Please from the men's own families were ignored.
	   Before the three men, Mohammed Zabair, Ismaray and Mohammed
Hashim, were shot they begged for mercy. Their wives and children
also pleaded with the family members of their victims to spare
their lives.
	   A Saudi Arabian diplomat, who attended the execution, offered to
pay dlrs 6,500 to the victims' families, but they declined.
	   Under strict Islamic law family members of murder victims can
spare the life of a convicted murderer and accept money instead.
	   The three men were shot to death. They had been found guilty of
ambushing and killing three men one year earlier near Ghorband,
some 60 kilometers (36 miles) north of the city.
	   The hardline Taliban religious army conducts public punishments
almost every week. Since taking control of the capital of Kabul,
the Taliban religious army has imposed a strict brand of Islamic
law that imposes the death penalty for murder, amputations for
theft and public beatings for lesser crimes.
	   The Taliban rules in 85 percent of Afghanistan and the
opposition in the remaining 15 percent.

World Cup: Suker seeks sixth World Cup goal in battle for third
</HEADLINE>
place &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After losing a chance to play in the World Cup
Final, pride is usually too bruised to worry about third place.
	   At least Davor Suker has something more to play for Saturday
when Croatia meets the Netherlands.
	   With five goals, Suker shares the World Cup scoring lead with
Italy's Christian Vieri and Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta.
	   A goal Saturday would put Suker in the company with Just
Fontaine, Eusebio and Gerd Mueller as players who have led a World
Cup in scoring.
	   With Italy and Argentina eliminated at the quarterfinal stage,
Suker is well-placed to end the tournament ahead of the pack.
	   The only other realistic contender for top spot is Ronaldo, who
goes into Sunday's final against France with four goals.
	   Players with three goals likely to play this weekend include
Brazil's Bebeto, Cesar Sampaio and Rivaldo, France's Thierry Henry
and Dennis Bergkamp of the Netherlands.
	   At the start of the World Cup, Suker was only 33-1 to finish as
top World Cup goalscorer _ not even among the top ten candidates.
	   Suker will take the field with a relatively full-strength
Croatia team, while the Netherlands has several players doubtful
because of injury.
	   Marc Overmars is still troubled by the hamstring injury that
kept him out of Tuesday's semifinal loss against Brazil; Aaron
Winter has an infected toe; and Michael Reiziger is suffering from
a painful right shoulder.
	   Winston Bogarde already is out of the tournament with a
fractured right fibula.
	   Croatia's only injury problem is playmaker Zvonimir Boban, who
was bothered by a leg muscle pull against the Dutch and is
questionable at best.
	   But the Dutch remain 5-6 favorites, with Croatia at 5-2.
	   ``We want to make this a better match than the final,''
Netherlands coach Guus Hiddink said. ``Losing the semifinal on
penalty kicks was hard to take, but we want to end up in third
place. We must not throw away the good impression that we have made
in the World Cup.''
	   The Dutch team flew out of its base in Roquebrune Cap-Martin,
close to the Italian border, for the last time Friday.
	   Before heading for Paris, Hiddink and the players said goodbye
to the Netherlands' newest fan, Prince Albert of Monaco.
	   The prince presented each player with a collection of rare
stamps, and in return received an orange Netherlands jersey from
the team.

Saturday; company officially informed, quotes, byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Theirs ears may be drooping a bit, but Mickey and
Minnie are going back to work.
	   Disappointed by a lack of support from the government, parade
performers at Disneyland Paris said Friday they are suspending
their strike, which began June 24.
	   ``There's no point in staying on strike,'' said performer
Giovanni Savoia, who plays a 1920s-style film director in the daily
parade down Main Street U.S.A.
	   ``We'll be back on the job tomorrow,'' he said after a meeting
of all the strikers. ``But we'll continue to fight from within. We
won't make it easy for the company. We are not ending the strike,
just suspending it.''
	   Basically, he said, they need the money, after more than two
weeks of no pay. Also, the strikers were keenly disappointed by the
lack of support they got when they met Thursday afternoon with
Labor Ministry officials.
	   Savoia said the strikers have filed suit in the French courts,
and that the case should be heard in the fall.
	   It wasn't clear how many performers were on strike at the huge
theme park outside Paris, one of France's most popular tourist
attractions.
	   The performers said about 80 walked off the job, but management
said it was only 40.
	   The strikers, who on average gross about 7,000 francs (dlrs
1,200) a month, want pay raises. But they also want to be
reclassified to the more prestigious status of ``artists'' rather
than ``extras'' _ as they say is mandated in a 1996 French law
governing theme parks.
	   That would give them more money but also increase their career
options, they say.
	   Euro Disney, which runs the park, has offered to give artist
status to those who successfully audition _ a proposal the
performers have rejected, at least until now.
	   The company claims its workers have it better than at other
theme parks in France, where work is only seasonal. At Disneyland
Paris, they have permanent contracts, better benefits, and an extra
month's bonus, the company says.
	   Spokeswoman Isabelle Clap said Euro Disney received official
notification Friday that the strike is over for now.
	   As for resolving the pay dispute, she said, ``the door is always
open'' _ and new talks are expected soon.

Istanbul's spice market reopens after deadly explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Tourists were back in Istanbul's
17th-century spice bazaar Friday, a day after a powerful explosion,
blamed on a cooking stove, killed seven people and injured more
than 100, including foreign vacationers.
	   Tourists wandered through the small streets of the covered
market, although the bazaar's main entrance remained blocked off by
police.
	   The explosion, apparently caused by a faulty gas container used
in the kitchen stove of a small food stand, ripped through four
stalls at the entrance.
	   A criminal attack seemed to have been ruled out, but police was
still investigating Friday, Interior Minister Murat Basesgioglu
told reporters.
	   The spice market -- which offers exotic foods, spices and dried
fruit -- overlooks The Golden Horn inlet of the Marmara Sea and is
in the heart of Istanbul's tourist area.
	   Two of the 11 injured tourists remained in hospitals Friday.
	   Three French, three Germans, two Norwegians, two Iraqis and a
Romanian national were injured in the blast.
	   ``If it had been a bomb, it would have definitely affected us,''
said Christine Evaniuk, who was strolling with her husband Perry,
through the market. The couple, from Seattle, Wash, were making a
four-week trip to Turkey.

Prince's publicity may be scaring off applicants for navy unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ News coverage of Crown Prince
Frederik's arduous training in the Danish Navy's elite frogman unit
may be scaring off applicants for the corps, the navy fears.
	   In the early 1990s, about 500 candidates applied every year for
the 24 positions available in the corps. This year, that number
fell to 60.
	   ``Our theory is that the huge publicity around the crown
prince's training has accentuated the myth how hard it is to become
a frogman,'' Commander Mogens Christens was quoted as saying in the
Berlingske Tidende newspaper on Friday.
	   ``Nowadays young people want ... activities like bungee-jumping
where they pay, jump and it's over. They want to try things but
they don't want to give too much up,'' Christens said.
	   The heir to the Danish throne started the eight-month training
course in 1995, and TV showed extensive footage of him undergoing
the rigors.

Nuclear protesters arrested for breaking into NATO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO security agents nabbed 10
anti-nuclear protesters Friday after they cut a hole in the fence
surrounding the alliance's headquarters and attempted to find
documents.
	   The protesters, calling themselves citizen-inspectors, wanted
documents from NATO's Nuclear Planning Group. They claimed that a
ruling by the International Court of Justice in the Hague two years
ago said the use of nuclear weapons and threat of their use was
illegal.
	   The 10, from several European nations, were turned over to
Belgian police.
	   A NATO spokesman, who spoke on condition he not be identified,
declined to say how long the protesters were inside the perimeter
or how far they got before they were apprehended.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, asked about the state of
security at the 16-nation alliance's headquarters here, merely
laughed heartily and said: ``Ah, come on!''
	   A delegation from the protesting group, which used the name
Nuclear Weapons Abolition Days Network, visited NATO headquarters
on Wednesday and spoke with a member of the information department.
	   ``They wanted to see details of the weapons deployed by NATO

tried to explain NATO nuclear policy to the protesters.
	   ``It wasn't very clear what they wanted,'' the spokesman said.

Havel will name premier soon, government in several weeks

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel will
appoint Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman as prime minister
without delay will wait several weeks to approve the rest of his
government, a presidential spokesman said Friday.
	   Havel is expected to designate Zeman after the current
government of Josef Tosovsky resigns next week at the end of the
first parliamentary session.
	   Zeman has proposed formation of a one-party minority Cabinet of
Social Democrats with tacit support of the Civic Democratic Party,
led by former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
	   But Havel does not like the idea of a minority government, his
aides have said.
	   According to presidential spokesman Ladislav Spacek, the
president has no reason to rush the Cabinet's appointment since the
current government is working ``effectively,'' CTK news agency
reported.
	   Following a complicated case of ruptured colon earlier this
year, Havel is scheduled for further abdominal surgery on July 27.
It is, therefore, likely he will name the new cabinet until after
he recovers.
	   That would mean Tosovsky would serve as a caretaker prime
minister during the period between Zeman's appointment and Havel's
approval of the new Cabinet.

India's leaders call for united action against sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan can reduce the impact
of Western economic sanctions by reducing government expenditure,
wooing foreign private investors and stepping up trade between
themselves, experts said Friday.
	   Although India has enough economic resilience to withstand the
effect of the sanctions, Pakistan feel the pinch because its
foreign exchange reserves are very low and its economy is in a
shambles, said speakers at a seminar on the effects of sanctions
imposed following the nuclear tests by the two countries.
	   ``The sanctions are unwarranted, unjustified and may even hurt
us,'' said India's former Finance Minister Manmohan Singh. ``But we
have the resilience to face it through a coherent and consistent
policy.''
	   The United States slapped economic and military sanctions after
India and Pakistan tested nuclear devices two months ago. Japan and
Germany cut off international assistance.
	   But bowing to pressure from American farm lobbies that said
cutting food aid would only hurt its own farmers, the U.S. Senate
on Thursday unanimously passed a legislation exempting agriculture
credits from the sanctions. The move will help American farmers
with a glut of wheat to bid for Indian and Pakistani markets, which
Australia is eyeing.
	   In recent weeks, Indian politicians and business leaders have
lobbied with American, German and Japanese governments and
industrialists to water down the sanctions.
	   On Thursday, India's envoy Jaswant Singh met with U.S.
counterpart Strobe Talbott in Frankfurt, Germany, for the second
round of talks on their nuclear differences. ``Both sides have
agreed that these very useful and constructive contacts will
continue,'' the Indian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Talbott is scheduled to visit New Delhi on July 20.
	   While India could feel the effect of reduction of direct foreign
aid by Germany and Japan, or even the deferral of loans by the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, it could scare away
foreign private industrialists, said former Finance Minister Singh.
	   Singh, who was widely praised for opening up India's economy in
1991 urged the government to aggressively court foreign investors.
	   Kuldip Nayyar, a former ambassador to Britain and a tireless
campaigner for better relations with Pakistan, said India and
Pakistan should both cut down their military expenditure and use
the money for development work such as building roads and
hospitals.
	   He said both nations should also immediately step up trade
between themselves while simultaneously working to resolve their
50-year-old differences over the Himalayan state of Kashmir.
	   Nayyar said the two countries should also seize the initiative
to tell the five nuclear powers _ China, France, Britain, Russia
and the United States _ that they should set a deadline for
destroying all their atomic weapons.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Jana Novotna continued her winning
streak at home Friday by beating France's Sarah Pitkowski 6-2, 6-3
and advancing into semifinals of the dlrs 160,000 Skoda Czech Open.
	   Novotna, the tournament's top seed played a near-perfect serve

	   ``I am beginning to get in the right pace on clay,'' Novotna
said. ``Hopefully it will get even better in the semifinals.''

Roland Garros, winning tournaments on grass at Eastbourne and
Wimbledon in a series of fourteen victories to date.
	   In the first semifinal Saturday, Novotna will play Henrietta

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Two Dutch marines and seven
civilians have been arrested for smuggling cocaine from the
Caribbean to the Netherlands, a defense ministry spokesman said
Friday.
	   Authorities have seized a total of 355 kilograms (781 pounds) of
cocaine, some were discovered aboard a Lockheed Orion
anti-submarine patrol aircraft from the Dutch Navy.
	   Ironically, the aircraft is used to patrol the Caribbean for
drug trafficking as part of the Netherlands Antilles coast guard.
	   Police discovered up to 125 kilograms (275 pounds) of cocaine
stashed away in personnel's bags on the plane, which returned to a
military base in the Netherlands from Curacao Thursday.
	   Raids were also conducted at various locations in Curacao and in
the Netherlands. All the suspects were arrested in the Netherlands,
including four other conscripts from the Netherlands Antilles.
	   The amount of cocaine is valued at 60 million guilders (dlrs 30
million).
	   Navy spokeswoman Annette van der Kaay said authorities had
earlier suspected that military personnel in the Netherlands
Antilles were involved in drugs smuggling to the Netherlands.
	   The transport was described as a ``controlled action,'' she
said.
	   ``Authorities let it happen to catch the people ... the purpose
was to get the evidence,'' she added.
	   The two men from the Dutch Marine Corps, a 48 year-old sergeant
major and a corporal, will be discharged.
	   Dutch Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve called the incident
``scandalous.''
	   The Dutch Navy has up to 1,000 personnel stationed in the
Netherlands Antilles. One of their tasks is to help American
authorities fight drug trafficking in the region, said Van der
Kaay.

Parties divided over Basque issue a year after councilor's killing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Exactly a year after Basque separatists
sent shock waves through Spain by kidnapping and murdering a young
ruling party politician, the country's leaders appear more divided
than ever over how to resolve the northern region's bloody
conflict.
	   People across Spain were asked Friday to commemorate the killing
of Popular Party councilor Miguel Angel Blanco, 29, by the armed
separatist group ETA.
	   ETA kidnapped Blanco on July 10th last year. The group shot him
in the head and left him by the roadside two days later, despite
the unprecedented display of public outrage triggered by the
abduction.
	   But while Blanco murder briefly united Spaniards against ETA in
huge demonstrations, 12 months down the road political leaders are
snared in disagreement over how to end to violence.
	   Some parties within the troubled northern region are calling for
a negotiated solution along Northern Ireland lines which would
require a softening of the current policies against ETA and their
political allies Herri Batasuna (HB).
	   ``The solution will never come via those who say `never' to
talks with ETA or HB,'' said Xabier Arzalluz, the head of the
Basque Nationalist Party, in a direct challenge to the Madrid
government's frequently repeated rejection of a negotiated
solution.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos hit out at
Arzalluz saying it was ``a serious mistake to consider dialogue
with HB as long as ETA continue to brandish pistols.''
	   ETA, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has
killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for
independence of northern Spain's three Basque provinces. The
organization has killed eight people, including five councilors,
since the Blanco murder.
	   Alvarez Cascos denied that the dispute would affect the alliance
that provides the Popular Party's minority government in Madrid
with the support of the Basque Nationalist Party's five
parliamentary deputies.
	   Leading opposition Socialist Party chief Joaquin Almunia also
jumped into the fray Friday urging Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
to caution Arzalluz.
	   Last week disagreement over the talks issue prompted the
Socialists to quit the three-party alliance, headed by Arzalluz's
group, that has controlled the semiautonomous Basque regional
authority since 1994.
	   On Thursday, the Basque region's bishops issued a statement
saying it was ``shameful and discouraging'' that political parties
were unable to agree on how to confront ETA.
	   Many observers believe the negotiations issue is being used by
all sides as a vote catcher in view of regional elections later
this year.
	   Recent surveys indicated that a majority of Basques believed the
problem can only be solved through talks, and that the matter
cannot be combated solely with police measures.
	   Herri Batasuna has urged Spanish political leaders to take the
lead offered by their British and Irish counterparts in seeking
talks with all sides, including the IRA-linked Sinn Fein group, to
try to resolve the Northern Ireland conflict.

EU reports slight rise in tourism in 1997

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union nations collected dlrs
155.2 billion in receipts from non-resident tourism last year, up
1.3 percent from dlrs 153.2 billion a year earlier, the EU's
statistics office reported Friday.
	   Twelve of the 15 EU nations had more foreign vacationers,
according to the Eurostat report. But the number of foreign
vacationers fell 4.3 percent in Italy, 3.7 percent in Austria and
0.5 percent in Sweden.
	   Despite the decline in foreign vacationers, Italy earned more
from tourism that any other EU nation with a yearly total of dlrs

Coulthard wakes up in free practice; Williams has good day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS throughout; ADDS quotes from Coulthard,
Villeneuve, Irvine, Dennis &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ David Coulthard, with only a point
from his last three races, awakened Friday in practice for the
British Grand Prix.
	   In third place in the series standings behind McLaren-Mercedes
teammate Mika Hakkinen (50 points) and Ferrari's Michael Schumacher
(44), Coulthard needs to add to his 30 points on Sunday or,
perhaps, see McLaren focus on Hakkinen for the rest of the season.
	   ``Mika and Michael are my main rivals and my priority is to get
in front of them,'' said the 27-year-old Briton. ``It was a good
start today, but we have to make sure we stay ahead.''
	   ``I have got to try and start clawing back the points,'' he
added. ``It's still possible to do that if I can get a good
reliability run, but I'm going to need Mika and Michael to have
reliability problems as well.''
	   Coulthard, the winner of four GPs but never his home one, turned
the quickest time of 1 minute 25.640 seconds in Friday's
free-practice with a speed of 216.067 kph (134.262 mph).
	   Hakkinen was second in 1:25.764 followed by Heinz-Harald
Frentzen and Jacques Villeneuve, both in Williams-Mecachromes, with
Schumacher's Ferrari in seventh.
	   Qualifying is Saturday and it should be another McLaren day.
This is the ninth F1 of the season, and McLaren has taken the pole
in every race _ five for Hakkinen and three for Coulthard.
	   However, Coulthard has broken down in two of the last three
races and Schumacher's teammate Eddie Irvine has gotten in his digs
to add to the pressure.
	   ``They (McLaren) should have been a lot further ahead than they
are,'' said Irvine, fifth in practice Friday and fourth in the
series standings with 25 points. ``They've made strategy mistakes.
Over the season, I'd put my money on Michael.''
	   But McLaren owner Ron Dennis cracked right back Friday.
	   ``I have unusual respect for Grand Prix drivers, it is a pretty
difficult task,'' Dennis answered. ``But he's wrong. Most opinions
that drivers express are wrong.''
	   The Silverstone track, one of the quickest in Formula One with a
mix of high-speed turns and long straights, is home to many of the
British-based teams, including McLaren.
	   ``Here we're (Ferrari) going to have a hard time, there's no
doubt about it,'' added Irvine, whose teammate, Schumacher, is
coming off back-to-back victories as he pushes for his third series
championship and Ferrari's first since 1979.
	   ``It's like France in the World Cup. They're playing at home,
they've got the home advantage.''
	   Schumacher, cautious with his words, admitted winning here will
be trickier than Magny Cours, France, two weeks ago.
	   ``We should be able to improve tomorrow (Saturday) on seventh,
but I expect we will have a slightly more difficult job than we did
in Magny Cours.''
	   French-Canadian Villeneuve, last year's series champion, has won
the last two British GPs but, despite Williams' best free-practice
day so far this season, still looks like a longshot to repeat.
	   Villeneuve has only 11 points this season and has yet to finish
in the top three. Frentzen, rumored to be on his way out, has only
eight for Williams, which has won five of the last six
constructors' titles but has slipped behind McLaren and Ferrari in
the new grooved-tire era of F1.
	   ``Ask me tomorrow, but for sure it feels better than it did two
weeks ago,'' Villeneuve said. ``There are not many slow-speed
corners where you need good traction, so we don't forfeit as much
to Ferrari.''

Lawsuit looms over rights to stinking refuse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A foodstore chain and city authorities are
locked in an unusual dispute over the groceries' garbage. Both
sides want the refuse.
	   The Haakon Group claims it owns the trash produced by its Rimi
grocery stores in Oslo, and wants to profit and protect the
environment by recycling the rubbish on its own. The company said
Thursday it's preparing to go to court to stake its claim.
	   The city sanitation department, on the other hand, says it owns
the offal, and that Rimi has to pay to have it hauled away and
burned.
	   Nils Henrik Petterson, attorney for the Haakon Group, says the
company believes it will be cheaper and better to recycle the trash
on its own.
	   ``We think we will be able to achieeve a greater degree of
reuse,'' he said. ``What happens how is that the city, to a very
great extend, burns the refuse they collect, and that is not very
future-oriented.''
	   City officials said they could not comment because of the
expected court case. Newspapers said the case could set an
important precedent, partly because the private-recycling industry
is expanding rapidly in Norway, which could make trash a valuable
resource.

Greek Cypriots appeal to UN over antiquity theft in occupied north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek Cypriots protested to the United
Nations Friday about the theft of two statues of Greek gods from a
historic site in the Turkish-occupied part of the island.
	   ``You have to take immediate action and you must cease
tolerating Turkish barbarity,'' the protesters said in an open
telegram to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the ambassadors
in Nicosia of the five permanent members of the Security Council.
	   The letter followed reports in newspapers on the Turkish Cypriot
side of the divided island that two marble statues, each weighing
more than a ton, had been stolen from a stadium in the ancient
Greek city of Salamis on the outskirts of the modern port of
Famagusta, east Cyprus.
	   The letter was written by the displaced town council of
Famagusta, which has continued to meet in southern Cyprus ever
since the town's 50,000 Greek Cypriot inhabitants fled before
advancing Turkish troops during the invasion of 1974.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot south and a Turkish
Cypriot north since that year when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a coup by supporters of union
with Greece. Turkey maintains some 35,000 troops in the north and
is the only state to recognize north Cyprus' declaration of
independence.
	   Turkish Cypriot newspapers said the statues were found buried in
the sand near the stadium in what appeared to be a bid to hide them
before the thieves could smuggle them off the island.
	   Turkish Cypriot editors wondered how the heavy statues could
have been removed. They criticized the authorities for failing to
guard the ancient site adequately.
	   The Cypriot government has repeatedly accused the Turkish
Cypriot authorities of turning a blind eye to the looting and
destruction of antiquities, Christian churches and monasteries in
the occupied north. The Turkish Cypriot administration has blamed
the thefts on professional smugglers.
	   Earlier this year German police arrested a Turkish Cypriot art
smuggler who was found in possession of more than 100 icons and
other artifacts stolen from churches and ancient sites in the
north.

Havel will name premier soon, government in several weeks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel will
appoint Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman as prime minister
without delay will wait several weeks to approve the rest of his
government, a presidential spokesman said Friday.
	   Havel is expected to designate Zeman after the current
government of Josef Tosovsky resigns next week at the end of the
first parliamentary session.
	   Zeman has proposed formation of a one-party minority Cabinet of
Social Democrats with tacit support of the Civic Democratic Party,
led by former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
	   But Havel does not like the idea of a minority government, his
aides have said.
	   According to presidential spokesman Ladislav Spacek, the
president has no reason to rush the Cabinet's appointment since the
current government is working ``effectively,'' CTK news agency
reported.
	   Following a complicated case of ruptured colon earlier this
year, Havel is scheduled for further abdominal surgery on July 27.
It is, therefore, likely he will name the new cabinet until after
he recovers.
	   That would mean Tosovsky would serve as a caretaker prime
minister during the period between Zeman's appointment and Havel's
approval of the new Cabinet.

Rios, Becker to meet in semifinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) _ Semi-retired Boris Becker continued
his pursuit of a 50th career singles title _ and his first on clay
_ with a straight sets quarterfinal win over defending champion
Felix Mantilla on Friday at the dlrs 560,000 Swiss Open tennis
tournament.
	   Though ranked just 119 in the world, falling out of the top 100
this week for the first time in 13 years, the 30-year-old German
made quick work of the fifth-seeded Spaniard, winning 6-4, 6-4 to
reach his first semifinal of the season.
	   Becker will face top-seed and world number-two Marcelo Rios in
the semifinal, after the Chilean smoothly disposed of Spain's
Francisco Clavet 6-3, 7-5 in his quarterfinal match.
	   ``I'm surprised, I didn't expect to be in the semifinal,'' said
Becker, whose last title dates back to the 1996 Grand Slam Cup.
``But as long as I practice and give myself a chance I am still a
dangerous player.
	   ``I've proven that in the past few days.''
	   Becker's victory over Mantilla destroyed any hopes Rios had of
regaining the rank of world number one from Pete Sampras.
	   Rios, who has lost only seven matches in 1998 and briefly
replaced Sampras as world number-one earlier this year, needed
bonus points from wins over both Mantilla and Spaniard Alex
Corretja to reclaim the top rank.
	   ``For me it will be exciting to play Rios,'' said Becker, the
winner of six Grand Slam titles. ``I've played him a few times but
not since he was world number-one. Being a former number-one I will
be able to compare him with other number-one players and see
first-hand how good he is.''
	   In qualifying for the semifinal, Rios recorded his best result
in five appearances at the posh alpine tournament. His best
previous performances were quarterfinal appearances in 1994 and
1995.
	   ``I'm looking forward to trying to win this tournament,'' said
Rios, who has won only one of three previous matches against
Becker. ``I want to be the best.''
	   In a Spanish quarterfinal showdown, French Open finalist Alex
Corretja, seeded third, rallied back to defeat sixth seed and 1996
champion Albert Costa 5-7, 6-2, 6-2.
	   The Spaniard, who lost to compatriot Carlos Moya in the final of
Roland Garros, will meet Belgium's Filip Dewulf in the other
semifinal.
	   Dewulf, ranked 53 in the world, posted a 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback
win over eighth-seed Nicolas Kiefer of Germany to lock up his place
in the final four.
	   ``Last time I beat Dewulf at Roland Garros (quarterfinals),''
said Corretja. ``He'll be determined to play well and fast against
me this time. But I think I'm mentally stronger than him.''

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Two Dutch marines and seven
civilians have been arrested for smuggling cocaine from the
Caribbean to the Netherlands, a defense ministry spokesman said
Friday.
	   Authorities have seized a total of 355 kilograms (781 pounds) of
cocaine, some were discovered aboard a Lockheed Orion
anti-submarine patrol aircraft from the Dutch Navy.
	   Ironically, the aircraft is used to patrol the Caribbean for
drug trafficking as part of the Netherlands Antilles coast guard.
	   Police discovered up to 125 kilograms (275 pounds) of cocaine
stashed away in personnel's bags on the plane, which returned to a
military base in the Netherlands from Curacao Thursday.
	   Raids were also conducted at various locations in Curacao and in
the Netherlands. All the suspects were arrested in the Netherlands,
including four other conscripts from the Netherlands Antilles.
	   The amount of cocaine is valued at 60 million guilders (dlrs 30
million).
	   Navy spokeswoman Annette van der Kaay said authorities had
earlier suspected that military personnel in the Netherlands
Antilles were involved in drugs smuggling to the Netherlands.
	   The transport was described as a ``controlled action,'' she
said.
	   ``Authorities let it happen to catch the people ... the purpose
was to get the evidence,'' she added.
	   The two men from the Dutch Marine Corps, a 48 year-old sergeant
major and a corporal, will be discharged.
	   Dutch Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve called the incident
``scandalous.''
	   The Dutch Navy has up to 1,000 personnel stationed in the
Netherlands Antilles. One of their tasks is to help American
authorities fight drug trafficking in the region, said Van der
Kaay.

German police confirm British man dead after brawl during World Cup
</HEADLINE>
game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FREIBURG, Germany (AP) - Police in Freiburg on Friday confirmed
that a British man was critically injured and died after a brawl at
a beer festival in southern Germany that was showing the World Cup
game between Germany and Croatia.
	   A police spokesman said the 24-year-old man died on Monday, two
days after he and some fellow countrymen were involved in a fight
with visitors at a beer festival in Kippenheim, about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) north of Freiburg.
	   ``There was a lot of alcohol involved. The British were drunk,''
the spokesman said, requesting his name not be used.
	   He said the British group first had a fight with some people
outside, then entered a beer tent, where the German-Croatia game
was being shown on a large screen July 4.
	   A brawl again erupted with visitors in the tent and the
24-year-old fell to the floor unconscious, the spokesman said.
	   He said an investigation is still ongoing and it was not clear
who had injured the man, was identified as Ronny Redhead. Reports
from England said he was from Burradon, North Tyneside.
	   ``The investigation is very difficult,'' the spokesman said,
because hardly anyone was willing to give a witness account of what
happened. No one has been arrested.
	   Police said results of an autopsy may determine if the injuries
leading to the man's death were caused by blows during the
fighting, or from falling to the ground.
	   The World Cup games have also been marred by violence in France,
where the final between France and Brazil takes place in Paris on
Sunday. Dozens of soccer thugs have been arrested or expelled since
the games started last month.
	   On June 17, after the Germany-Yugoslavia game in Lens in
northern France, French policeman Daniel Nivel, 44, was hit on the
head with an iron bar when groups of German soccer thugs rampaged
through the city. Nivel remains hospitalized in a coma.
	   French police arrested two suspects shortly after the attack,
and a 24-year-old known soccer hooligan was arrested at his home in
Hamburg and jailed in investigative custody Monday in Germany as a
third suspect in the case.

Romanov pretender denounces czar's burial ceremonies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A descendant of Russia's ruling family sharply
criticized funeral ceremonies planned for Czar Nicholas II and his
family next week, and said she and her son would not attend, a news
agency reported Friday.
	   Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna Romanova claims that her
17-year-old son, Georgy, is the pretender to the throne abdicated
by Nicholas II before his execution in 1918.
	   The bones of Nicholas, his family and closest staff were found
buried in a pit near the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, and will be
interred in St. Petersburg next Friday in a cathedral where many of
Russia's czars are buried.
	   The funeral ``by its hastiness and unpreparedness is yet another
insult to the royal martyrs,'' Romanova told the Interfax news
agency.
	   ``Instead of becoming an act of national conciliation ... the
burial has provoked disputes and has become a new reason for
confrontation in Russian society,'' she said.
	   Instead of attending the burial in St. Petersburg, she said she
and her son would attend a requiem for the Romanovs at a monastery
outside Moscow.
	   The czar's funeral has been surrounded by growing controversy in
recent months. Patriarch Alexy II said he would not attend because
he had doubts about the bones' authenticity. President Boris
Yeltsin, respecting the patriarch's position, has also said he will
not attend.
	   Romanova's claim to the throne is disputed by other branches of
the exiled dynasty as well as the authoritative Almanac de Gotha on
European royal families.
	   At first planned with pomp and full regalia, disputes over the
bones and a shortfall in government funds has reduced the
ceremonies to a relatively modest affair.

<SLUG> Lithuanian president vetoes law denying former KGB employment </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ President Valdas Adamkus on Friday
vetoed a law denying a wide range of jobs to former KGB workers, a
decision underlining broad ideological tensions.
	   The law was drafted by Parliament Speaker Vytautas Landsbergis,
the hero of Lithuania's drive for independence from the Soviet
Union.
	   Landsbergis had argued that the law was necessary because the
onetime KGB workers could not be trusted, but Adamkus has urged the
country to overcome the suspicions and resentment that hang over
from Soviet rule.
	   The law is ``dubious from the point of view of the Constitution
or international law,'' Adamkus said in explaining his veto. ``I do
not feel I have the moral right to sign this law.''
	   Landsbergis has called a special session of the parliament for
July 15 to bring up the law for new consideration.
	   The parliament, the Seimas, passed the law 68-7 this month,
reflecting the deep resentment Lithuanians feel about the
half-century the country spent under Soviet rule.
	   The measure would have shut onetime KGB operatives out of most
government positions and a wide range of private-sector employment.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The semi-official Anatolia news agency
reported Friday that an Iraqi Kurdish group has been chasing
Turkish Kurdish rebels in Iraq in a new offensive by Turkish troops
but then retracted the report.
	   Anatolia give no explanation why it was retracting the report
that the Iraqi Kurds were helping the Turkish military.
	   Reports of the operation by the Kurdistan Democratic Party, the
Iraqi Kurdish group, came just two days after Turkish warplanes
began bombing suspected rebel bases in the Turkish province of
Hakkari, at the convergence of the borders of Iraq, Iran and
Turkey.
	   Rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party were being encircled in
the Iraq's Amadiyah region, the report said.
	   The agency also first reported that Turkish jets were also
shelling Amadiyah, but it was not clear if the Turkish troops had
crossed into Iraqi territory.
	   The military neither confirmed nor denied the report and the
Iraqi group was not available for comment.
	   Anatolia had said the rebels suffered heavy casualties.
	   Turkey has carried out many cross-border offensives against
Turkish Kurdish guerrillas, who are fighting for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since 1984. The rebels often launch hit-and-run
attacks from their bases in northern Iraq.
	   The war between Turkish troops and the Kurdish guerrillas has
killed 37,000 people.

 &UR; Lithuanian president vetoes law denying former KGB employment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ President Valdas Adamkus on Friday
vetoed a law denying a wide range of jobs to former KGB workers, a
decision underlining broad ideological tensions.
	   The law was drafted by Parliament Speaker Vytautas Landsbergis,
the hero of Lithuania's drive for independence from the Soviet
Union.
	   Landsbergis had argued that the law was necessary because the
onetime KGB workers could not be trusted, but Adamkus has urged the
country to overcome the suspicions and resentment that hang over
from Soviet rule.
	   The law is ``dubious from the point of view of the Constitution
or international law,'' Adamkus said in explaining his veto. ``I do
not feel I have the moral right to sign this law.''
	   Landsbergis has called a special session of the parliament for
July 15 to bring up the law for new consideration.
	   The parliament, the Seimas, passed the law 68-7 this month,
reflecting the deep resentment Lithuanians feel about the
half-century the country spent under Soviet rule.
	   The measure would have shut onetime KGB operatives out of most
government positions and a wide range of private-sector employment.

Long wait for drinks might be over for booze-cruise salvagers

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ The undersea sommeliers laboring to
lift a shipload of antique champagne from the bottom of the Baltic
Sea expect to finally be able to pop the corks Saturday.
	   Claes Bergvall, the Swedish head of the team salvaging a
schooner laden with champagne, cognac and port, told The Associated
Press that ``the job should be finished Friday night or Saturday.
	   ``There are a few variables, especially weather, that may affect
the schedule, but we're not counting minutes,'' he said by
telephone from the salvage operation off Finland's western coast
near Rauma, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) northwest of Helsinki.
	   The schooner, the 66-foot (20-meter) Joenkoeping, turned into a
watery wine-cellar in 1916 when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat
while carrying the consignment of alcohol ordered by the Russian
army.
	   Divers from Bergvall's C-Star consortium found the Joenkoeping
(pronounced yeun-sheu-ping) wreck 64 meters (210 feet) below the
surface in June 1997; a month later, they raised a few bottles of
champagne, which Bergvall pronounced ``superb.''
	   Others who want to try it could end up with a huge bar tab. The
cargo of 44 crates of champagne, 67 barrels of cognac and 17
barrels of port wine, if intact, could be worth some dlrs 2
million, Christies auction-house wine expert Duncan McEuen said in
an interview with the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet.
	   Finnish businessman Peter Fryckman has entered a competing claim
for the Joenkoeping's cargo. Fryckman, whose divers have receovered
hundreds of bottles from the wreck, claims the treasure because the
company of his great-grandfather, Sven Gustav Fryckman, was
involved in delivering the order.
	   But a Finnish court ordered him to remove his divers and vessel
from the salvage site, allowing Bergvall's operation to continue
until the end of the year.
	   Fryckman has criticized Bergvall's attempt to raise the entire
vessel at once, saying the hull may break in the process,
destroying the cargo.
	   Bergvall said he has not decided where to take the cargo should
the lifting succeed. Both Finland and Sweden impose some of the
world's highest duties on alcohol imports.

 &UR; Four thousand Muslims in Serbia stage protests

<TEXT>
	   NOVI PAZAR, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Some 4,000 Muslims in southern
Serbia staged a rally Friday to protest a year-old government
decision to dismiss municipal politicians they elected.
	   The brief protests in Novi Pazar, a town in southern Serbia's
predominantly Muslim region of Sandzak, ended without incident.
	   ``Respect our election will,'' and ``We want out rights,'' read
banners at the rally, organized by the local branch of the Party of
Democratic Action, the Sandzak branch of Bosnia's main Muslim-led
party.
	   An SDA-led coalition, representing Serbia's 300,000-strong
Muslim community, won local elections in Sandzak in November 1996,
but the Serbian authorities revoked their municipal rule eight
months later and imposed a Belgrade-run local government. They
cited alleged mistakes in governing the region.

World court draft statute calls for independent prosecutor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A U.N. conference Friday produced a draft treaty on
a world criminal court that would grant the prosecutor sweeping
authority, a measure vigorously opposed by the United States.
	   The draft also did away with proposals to declare the use of
nuclear weapons, blinding lasers and anti-personnel mines as war
crimes.
	   It said the court could have jurisdiction over internal
conflicts -- these days the major source of crimes against
humanity. The draft left the door open for including state
``aggression'' as a crime -- if delegates could decide on what that
means by Monday.
	   The draft comes at the end of four weeks of negotiations by more
than 150 countries to establish a permanent body to pursue the
perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.
The draft represents the consensus so far on the treaty, and it
could change.
	   Delegates were called on by the conference leadership to send
the draft back to their governments before make-or-break
negotiations early next week. The conference ends next Friday.
	   The United States, though declaring itself in favor of such a
court, has sought strict limits on the power of the prosecutor,
including the right of countries to refuse to cooperate.
	   That issue was still up in the air. All agree that the
prosecutor could investigate genocide wherever it occurs; but as
for war crimes and crimes against humanity, debate was still open
whether the countries involved in investigations -- including that
of the suspect -- had to give permission for the prosecutor to move
forward.
	   The United States argues that failing to give countries that
power is a violation of sovereignty, and could jeopardize U.S.
forces abroad or its peacekeepers through politically motivated
investigations.
	   The independence of the prosecutor was another of the
fundamental issues.
	   Washington argues that giving the prosecutor unfettered freedom
-- without the check of U.N. Security Council permission -- would
lead to an avalanche of cases, put paralyzing pressure on the
prosecutor and ultimately weaken the court.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. delegation said the U.S. delegates were
still studying the draft and would have no immediate comment.
	   The issue could well mean the United States would not sign off
on the treaty. Some delegates and human rights lobbyists here have
suggested that a stronger, more independent court without the
world's superpower was better than a toothless court with it.
	   The independent prosecutor still would have to submit cases to a
pre-trial chamber. And the draft calls for discussion on
``additional safeguards'' before the prosecutor can act.
	   ``It's encouraging that (an independent) prosecutor is now
definitely in the statute,'' said Jelena Pejic, an attorney with
the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. But the
``additional safeguards'' measure could ``wreck the whole
prospect,'' she said.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Two Dutch marines, four members of
the Netherlands Antilles coast guard and seven civilians have been
arrested on charges of smuggling cocaine from the Caribbean to the
Netherlands, a defense ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   Authorities have seized a total of 355 kilograms (781 pounds) of
cocaine, some were discovered aboard a Lockheed Orion
anti-submarine patrol aircraft from the Dutch Navy.
	   Ironically, the aircraft is used to patrol the Caribbean for
drug trafficking as part of the Netherlands Antilles coast guard.
	   Police discovered up to 125 kilograms (275 pounds) of cocaine
stashed away in personnel's bags on the plane, which returned to a
military base in the Netherlands from Curacao Thursday.
	   Raids were also conducted at various locations in Curacao and in
the Netherlands. All the suspects were arrested in the Netherlands,
including the four conscripts from the Netherlands Antilles.
	   The amount of cocaine is valued at 60 million guilders (dlrs 30
million).
	   Navy spokeswoman Annette van der Kaay said authorities had
earlier suspected that military personnel in the Netherlands
Antilles were involved in drugs smuggling to the Netherlands.
	   The transport was described as a ``controlled action,'' she
said.
	   ``Authorities let it happen to catch the people ... the purpose
was to get the evidence,'' she added.
	   The two men from the Dutch Marine Corps, a 48 year-old sergeant
major and a corporal, will be discharged.
	   Dutch Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve called the incident
``scandalous.''
	   The Dutch Navy has up to 1,000 personnel stationed in the
Netherlands Antilles. One of their tasks is to help American
authorities fight drug trafficking in the region, said Van der
Kaay.

Whatever happened to a regular cup of coffee?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURENCE M. CRUZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Just what does it take to get a plain old cup of
coffee these days, anyway?
	   The gourmet coffee craze in the United States has spread far
beyond coffee bars and kiosks, reaching even chain restaurants. It
seems everywhere you go _ and not just in coffee-mad Seattle,
either _ someone is trying to sell you a fancy brew instead of a
good old diner-grade cup of ``joe.''
	   ``We are losing the choice of being able to get a real cup of
coffee in America today,'' says Rose Mary Crane, 57, of Hollister,
California. ``All my life, at my mature age, I've stopped at
Denny's for coffee, and it was always a good cup of coffee.''
	   But she says Denny's quit serving the coffee she was used to
about a year ago, and now she can't get it at McDonald's either.
	   ``I thought at first I'd hit a bad pot,'' she says.
	   For the record, Denny's spokeswoman Debbie Atkins insists the
restaurant chain has not changed the regular coffee it serves but
has added other flavors, such as French vanilla, to its menus.
	   But some McDonald's restaurants are indeed introducing gourmet
coffees in place of the regular stuff. Spokesman Bill Whitman says
McDonald's in the misty northwestern city of Seattle has been
testing a high-quality blend from Seattle's Best Coffee Co. for
several months.
	   The backlash against fancy coffees is nothing new to experts.
	   ``There's a militant part of the population that really likes
traditional commercial coffees,'' says Ted Lingle, executive
director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America in Long
Beach, California.
	   Lingle says most people who hanker for ``real'' or
``old-fashioned'' coffee probably are referring to the robusta
profile, a flat, mellow taste _ some might say bland _ derived
primarily from robusta beans.
	   What are sold as gourmet and specialty blends _ the terms are
inexact and sometimes used loosely _ often contain arabica beans,
which are more bitter, and added flavors such as hazelnut or
vanilla.
	   Seattle accountant Rick Robinson, 39, says he recognized the
switch at his local McDonald's immediately. ``Their newer coffee
just doesn't have as much flavor,'' he says. ``They say it's
better, but I don't think so.''
	   McDonald's sells so much coffee in the United States _ in excess
of 20 million pounds (9 million kilos) a year _ it has become for
many people the standard for what coffee is supposed to taste like.
	   ``So once you make any change, whether it's good or bad, it's
not often going to be well-received,'' Lingle says.
	   Pat and Elmer Yates, a retired couple from Irvine, California,
who spend their summers in Minneapolis, were enjoying coffee this
week at a McDonald's in Minneapolis, where coffee is still just
coffee. Their grandson runs a gourmet coffee shop back in Venice
Beach, California, but they don't drink that stuff.
	   ``It tends to be too strong for us,'' Yates says. ``We're not
used to that.''
	   Says his wife: ``I think it is a generational thing. The young
people seem to like the strong coffee.''

and Cooperation in Europe adopted a resolution on Kosovo after the
Russian delegation criticized a draft condemning the military
actions of Serbia, which traditionally is a Russian ally.
	   On the closing day of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly's annual
session, the 317 lawmakers appealed ``to all parties in the Kosovo
conflict to return to the principles of nonviolence and to distance
themselves from any provocation.''
	   The text ``denounces the policies of (the Serb) government for
its military aggression against the (ethnic) Albanian population''
but the assembly also ``reaffirmed (...) the principles of the
international law with regard to the inviolability of frontiers and
the territorial integrity of States.''
	   Legislators said NATO _ if endorsed by the U.N. Security Council
_ could take military steps to end the fighting and protect the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. ``Comprehensive and effective economic
sanctions'' could be taken by the European Union and the United
States against Belgrade ``until it halts aggression in Kosovo.''
	   The OSCE comprises European nations, former Soviet Asian
republics, the United States and Canada. Yugoslavia, which includes
Serbia and Montenegro, has had its OSCE membership suspended since
the Bosnia's war.

Clashes intensify along Yugoslav-Albanian border, Rugova says
</HEADLINE>
independence remains goal &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav troops battled arms
smugglers Friday along Kosovo's border with Albania, and the
province's leading Albanian politician appealed to major powers to
support independence _ which they have so far rejected.
	   Elsewhere, government and ethnic Albanian sources reported
scattered clashes throughout the rebellious province, where
Albanian rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army are fighting for
independence from Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of armed Kosovo Albanians fortified this village west
of the provincial capital Pristina, fearing attack from Serb
neighbors. Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9-to-1.
	   Both Serb and Albanian sources reported sharp fighting Friday in
several areas along the Albanian border, over which ethnic
Albanians smuggle weapons into the province.
	   Government sources and witnesses said at least four smugglers
were killed in two of the border clashes, which began Thursday
night and continued until after dawn Friday.
	   At the scene of one battle _ near the border town of Kosare,
about 85 kilometers (53 miles) southwest of Pristina _ reporters
saw bodies of two smugglers lying in the grass.
	   Yugoslav troops seized a large quantity of weapons, including
rifles, machine guns, ammunition and anti-tank mines. A captured
smuggler, Zef Kqiraj, claimed he bought the weapons in Albania from
an Albanian army sergeant.
	   Government soldiers said it was the first time they had seized
anti-tank mines from smugglers. That could mark a dangerous
escalation in the conflict, which intensified in February when
security forces launched their crackdown on Albanian militants.
	   An intensification of the conflict would threaten U.S. and
European efforts to halt the violence and arrange talks between the
Albanians and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the future
of the province.
	   In Paris, the French foreign ministry said Friday that France
and Britain would introduce a resolution in the U.N. Security
Council aimed at securing an immediate cease-fire in Kosovo.
	   Spokesman Yves Doutriaux said the resolution would threaten
additional measures _ presumably sanctions _ if Serb forces and
Albanian rebels do not stop the fighting.
	   The resolution would implement a declaration by the six-nation
Contact Group _ the United States, Russia, France, Britain, Germany
and Italy _ calling for a cease-fire to permit a ``meaningful
dialogue'' between the Serbs and Albanians.
	   Contact Group members also warned the KLA that they would crack
down on financial support the rebels receive from Albanian
communities abroad. Contact Group members oppose independence for
Kosovo but want Milosevic to restore self-rule he withdrew in 1989.
	   In Pristina, however, the province's leading Albanian
politician, Ibrahim Rugova, urged Contact Group nations Friday to
support independence for Kosovo.
	   The United States and Europeans want the KLA to accept Rugova,
who opposes violence, as the leader of Kosovo Albanians in future
talks with Milosevic.
	   ``We expect and demand from the Contact Group, whose involvement
we greatly value, to support our proposal on an independent
Kosovo,'' Rugova said.
	   He said the Contact Group should put more pressure on Milosevic
to accept international demands to halt the crackdown.
	   Northwest of Pristina, the provincial capital, about 400 Kosovo
Albanians _ many of them armed _ fortified their village, Pantina,
against expected Serb attacks Friday.
	   Villagers in Pantina said Serbs in nearby Svinjare had burned
down four Albanian houses after their occupants had fled.
	   Serb civilians, some toting rifles, blocked reporters from
entering Svinjare.
	   Elsewhere, a Serbian policeman was wounded in an attack by
ethnic Albanians on a checkpoint on the road between Kosovska
Mitrovica and Srbica, Serb sources said. Another policeman was
reported seriously wounded in the Decane area of western Kosovo.
	   Serb sources also reported Albanian extremists attacked police
early Friday in the village of Dolac, 45 kilometers (28 miles) west
of Pristina, but were driven off with ``significant losses.''

grafs 8-10. New to some points. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Russian vessel was suspected of releasing
a large amount of fuel oil into the Azov Sea near the Ukrainian
port of Mariupol, a newspaper said Friday.
	   The spill created a slick 1.5 kilometers (one mile) wide and 6
kilometers (3.7 miles) long, with a depth of about 2 centimeters
(0.8 inches), said Mykola Afanasyev, chief Azov Sea preservation
inspector.
	   Afanasyev did not say how much fuel oil was thought to have
spilled, the daily Fakty reported.
	   He said four Russian oil ships belonging to the Samara-based
Volgatanker company were about 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) offshore,
awaiting permission to enter Mariupol harbor, when one of them
released the oil.
	   The ships were detained pending financial estimates of the
damage, Afanasyev added.
	   He said the slick hadn't reached shore and was moving to the
southwest, passing several resort areas. But if wind direction
changes, it could reach the resort area of Berdyansk, return to
Mariupol or even reach Crimea, meteorologists said.
	   The spill was the most serious pollution accident on the Azov
Sea in the past 30 years, the newspaper said.
	   However, Petro Novikov, duty officer at the Civil Defense
headquarters in Mariupol, called the report ``exaggerated.'' He
said the spill, which occurred a week ago, amounted to 300
kilograms (660 pounds) of fuel oil.
	   ``In two days, the slick moved away to the sea and dissolved,''
he said, according to the Interfax news agency. The Russian ship
responsible for the spill was detained in Mariupol, Novikov said.
	   Ukraine's Emergency Situations Ministry said it had no
information about the spill, while spokesmen at the Environment
Defense and Nuclear Safety Ministry could not immediately be
reached Friday.

Ethnic violence jars Lagos, leaders try to stem ethnic attacks

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Riot police in helmets and flak jackets
milled around the city's mosques Friday, trying to forestall an
escalation in ethnic attacks against Nigeria's northern Hausa
Muslims.
	   Days after the death of the country's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola _ a southern ethnic Yoruba _ waves of
rioting and violence appear to be pitting Yoruba against Hausa,
northerner against southerner.
	   For the third straight day Friday, youths stormed through
streets in parts of Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos, setting
fires, smashing windows and blocking roads. Violence between Hausas
and Yorubas was also tearing at the southwestern city of Ibadan,
long an enclave of anti-junta sentiment.
	   Increasingly, Nigerian authorities fear the political violence
is rooted in Hausa-Yoruba enmity.
	   The bodies of nine Hausas discovered in a predominantly Yoruba
neighborhood backed up that fear, and a senior police commander
said many of the rampaging Lagos youths were unemployed Yorubas.
	   In reaction, Nigerian leaders have fanned out among Lagos'
jumble of ethnic communities, trying to stop political violence
from turning into mob ethnic attacks.
	   But just where political violence ends and ethnic violence
begins is not completely clear. And some of the violence suffusing
cities in Nigeria's southwest appears to simply be the random
outpouring of years of frustration.
	   Life in Nigeria became increasingly difficult during Abacha's
rule, as the economy and infrastructure crumbled under the weight
of neglect and corruption.
	   The death of Abiola _ the apparent winner of annulled
presidential elections in 1993 _ has infuriated his supporters who
say the military, which is dominated by Hausa and Fulani
northerners, is to blame.
	   The junta says he died of a heart attack, but some of Abiola's
relatives say he was killed by the military even as they prepared
to set him free.
	   The government has completed an autopsy, but hasn't released the
results. A second, independent autopsy to be conducted by a team of
foreign pathologists, was scheduled for Friday.
	   Trying to stave off further ethnic attacks, riot police and
paramilitary troops were protecting Muslim mosques in Lagos, some
of which have been targeted by the predominantly Christian Yorubas.
	   While a feared wave of attacks during Friday afternoon Muslim
prayers did not occur, authorities were afraid the violence was
still bubbling.
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, toured city mosque's Friday, appealing for Hausas not to
launch reprisals.
	   While Nigeria is a confused grid of more than 250 ethnic groups,
it is dominated by Hausas and Fulanis in the north, Yorubas in the
southwest and Ibos in the southeast.
	   Religious differences overlay the ethnic divisions, with Muslims
making up the majority in the north and Christianity _ along with a
strong current of animism _ dominating the south.
	   But the divisions are not always aligned neatly. Abiola, for
example, was a Muslim as well as a Yoruba.
	   Abiola died Tuesday, still in custody four years after his
arrest.
	   His freedom, though, had been widely hinted at in the four weeks
since the sudden death of Gen. Sani Abacha, who had brutally ruled
Nigeria for the past five years.
	   Abacha's successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has released a
group of political prisoners and promised to free the rest. He said
after Abiola's death that the opposition leader was on the brink of
release and has vowed _ albeit vaguely _ to return the country to
civilian rule.
	   Instead, Abiola's death has touched off three days of violence.
More than 400 people have been arrested since Tuesday night, when
violence first broke out in Lagos, police say, and at least 24
people have been confirmed killed. unconfirmed reports say the
death toll may be in the dozens.
	   Many of the victims were Hausas and Fulanis, said junta
commander Col. Hamed Ali.
	   ``Counsel your subjects on the need for peaceful co-existence,''
Ali told a joint meeting of Yoruba, Hausa and Ibo elders in Lagos
late Thursday.
	   These days, unemployment is rampant, roads are a mess and buying
gasoline can require 12 hours in line.
	   Nigeria has seen more than its share of brutal ethnic violence
since gaining independence from Britain in 1960. The Biafran war of
the late 1960s was spawned amid the ethnic hatreds and attacks
between northern and southern tribes. More than a million people
died in that civil war as southern Ibos waged a futile battle to
establish an independent homeland.
	   Although triggering much resentment, it is the military's
iron-fisted central rule that is often and ironically credited with
keeping Nigeria in one piece.
	   The junta, meanwhile, was trying to set a tone of
reconciliation. The military Thursday commuted death sentences
handed down to six people, including a former military leader,
accused of trying to overthrow Abacha.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Two Dutch marines and 11 others
have been arrested for smuggling cocaine from the Caribbean to the
Netherlands, a defense ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   Authorities have seized a total of 355 kilograms (781 pounds) of
cocaine, some were discovered aboard a Lockheed Orion
anti-submarine patrol aircraft from the Dutch Navy.
	   Ironically, the aircraft is used to patrol the Caribbean for
drug trafficking as part of the Netherlands Antilles coast guard.
	   Police discovered up to 125 kilograms (275 pounds) of cocaine
stashed away in personnel's bags on the plane, which returned to a
military base in the Netherlands from Curacao Thursday.
	   Raids were also conducted at various locations in Curacao and in
the Netherlands.
	   Besides the two Dutch marines, seven civilians and four military
personnel the Netherlands Antilles were all arrested in the
Netherlands.
	   The amount of cocaine is valued at 60 million guilders (dlrs 30
million).
	   Navy spokeswoman Annette van der Kaay said authorities had
earlier suspected that military personnel in the Netherlands
Antilles were involved in drugs smuggling to the Netherlands.
	   The transport was described as a ``controlled action,'' she
said.
	   ``Authorities let it happen to catch the people ... the purpose
was to get the evidence,'' she added.
	   The two men from the Dutch Marine Corps, a 48 year-old sergeant
major and a corporal, will be discharged.
	   Dutch Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve called the incident
``scandalous.''
	   The Dutch Navy has up to 1,000 personnel stationed in the
Netherlands Antilles. One of their tasks is to help American
authorities fight drug trafficking in the region, said Van der
Kaay.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A security alert in London's business district
disrupted rush-hour commuters Friday evening.
	   Few details about the cause of the alert were available. Office
workers and one police officer said a bomb had been defused and
several people were arrested on Holborn in central London. But
Scotland Yard police headquarters did not immediately release any
information about a bomb.
	   There was no indication of any connection with Northern Ireland.
	   Police evacuated several blocks along the road after what one
officer called ``a major security alert.'' One of the capital's
underground rail lines was closed and crowds were being kept behind
barricades.
	   ``A number of men have been arrested in London. An operation is
ongoing,'' a spokeswoman for Scotland Yard said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. She gave no further details.

Azerbaijan parliament agrees to two of three opposition demands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Azerbaijan's parliament yielded Friday on two
demands that have provoked an opposition boycott of the
presidential election, but stood firm on a third, news agencies
reported.
	   The political opposition in the former Soviet republic said it
was heartened by the partial victory, but would continue to boycott
the election until all of its demands are met.
	   A fifth opposition party, the Social Democrats, announced that
it would be joining the boycott, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
Previously, the Popular Front and the Musavat, Democratic and
Liberal parties had all said they would not take part in the
election this fall unless their demands were met.
	   The parties are all opposed to the rule of President Geidar
Aliev, who was Azerbaijan's Soviet-era Communist Party boss and
came to power in a bloodless military coup in June 1993. He is
running for re-election.
	   According to ITAR-Tass and the Turan news agency, parliament
agreed to the groups' demand that an election be declared valid if
25 percent of eligible voters participate. Previously, it required
50 percent.
	   It also agreed that voters can be allowed to sign more than one
candidate's nominating petition.
	   However, it refused to give in on another demand, that the
central election agency be independent.
	   The Turan agency quoted Isa Gambar, leader of the Musavat Party,
as saying the parliamentary decision on the first two demands was
``a great victory of the opposition.''
	   However, he said, ``The opposition will not be satisfied with
these changes and will insist on forming the central election
commission on an equal footing.''

Annan sees better cooperation with Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Friday
that Baghdad was cooperating well with U.N. weapons inspectors and
said he hoped that this ``spirit'' would last until the Security
Council reviews sanctions in October.
	   Baghdad still must turn over documentation proving it has
destroyed its banned weapons, and ``only time will tell'' if they
do so in time for the October review, Annan said in a wide-ranging
news conference ahead of his trip to Latin America.
	   But the question of U.N. access to sensitive presidential sites,
which ignited the last crisis with arms inspections, is no longer a
problem, said Annan, who negotiated the February agreement that
ended the standoff.
	   ``Tensions are less than they were before the February
agreement, and I hope that this spirit will prevail until the
council has to make a major review of the sanctions in October,''
Annan said.
	   The Security Council imposed sanctions on Baghdad after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which touched off the Gulf War. U.N. weapons
inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its long-range
missiles and biological, chemical and nuclear weapons before the
council will lift the sanctions.
	   The council has a regular review of the measures in October, and
is under increasing pressure _ from permanent council members
Russia, China, France and even Annan _ to speed up the inspections
and declare Baghdad in compliance.
	   But the United States has said that continued Iraqi defiance _
most recently regarding traces of the deadly nerve gas VX found in
Iraqi missile warheads _ proves that sanctions should stay in
place.
	   Iraq claims it has destroyed all illegal weapons and that the
United States and Britain are manipulating the U.N. Special
Commission and its leader, chief weapons inspector Richard Butler,
to maintain the measures indefinitely.
	   Last year, Iraq barred inspectors access to eight presidential
sites, citing national sovereignty. Annan negotiated an agreement
with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to admit U.N. inspectors,
accompanied by a team of diplomats.
	   ``They have not only gotten access to eight presidential sites
but to other sites,'' Annan said. ``And I think Mr. Butler himself
has made it clear that access is no longer a problem.''
	   ``The next phase is how quickly UNSCOM gets its work done, what
cooperation they get from the Iraqi authorities on the question of
the disarmament,'' Annan said. ``And I think cooperation has been
better than it was before.''
	   ``Whether they are going to get all the documentation and the
material needed _ only time will tell,'' Annan said.
	   But he noted that Butler had a good meeting with his
counterparts in Baghdad this spring that produced a work review
program that will be reviewed in August.
	   ``We will have a better sense with how things are progressing
then,'' he said.

Three tenors cap World Cup with Eiffel Tower extravaganza

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France is aiming for its first World Cup
championship, but the Three Tenors are old pros _ they've done two
World Cup extravaganzas already.
	   On Friday, the tenors were staging their third and biggest,
against the spectacular setting of the floodlit Eiffel Tower.
	   In what organizers enthusiastically billed as ``the most
ambitious classical concert ever staged,'' the tenors _ Luciano
Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras _ were entertaining a
crowd expected to be in the hundreds of thousands on the Champs de
Mars field.
	   They were being backed up by the Paris Orchestra, under the
direction of U.S. conductor James Levine. The program was kept a
strict secret before the concert.
	   Beamed live to over 75 countries, the concert was also being
recorded for a worldwide album release in August.
	   Organizers have said they expect the event to draw up to 800,000
people. Six huge screens were erected for faraway viewers.
	   The Three Tenors sang at Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles for the
1994 World Cup. Only 60,000 people attended, but the concert was
seen on television by an estimated 1.3 billion people around the
globe.
	   The trio made its debut at the 1990 World Cup, at the ancient
baths of Caracalla in Rome.
	   A heavy turnout would surely comfort the three soccer fans,
whose home teams _ Spain for Carreras and Domingo, Italy for

U.S. federal agents arrive to help solve bombing assassination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Eight FBI agents, including a profiler
and explosives experts, arrived Friday to help Hungarian police
investigate a car-bombing which killed four people, including a
police informant.
	   The July 2 bombing, in the heart of Budapest's fashionable
shopping district, was the latest in a series of attacks which
police blame on organized criminal gangs battling for control of
the city's underworld.
	   Police believe the target of the bombing was Jozsef Karoly
Boros, a businessman suspected of criminal links but who had turned
informant. Boros had survived four previous attempts on his life.
	   ``We have no suspects,'' police Lt. Col. Peter Dospot said of
the bombing. ``We hope to learn a great deal from the expertise of
the FBI agents.''
	   In February, police in this former Communist country used FBI
profilers to capture a suspected serial killer. Profilers attempt
to narrow suspects to specific personality types, based on an
analysis of the crime.
	   The latest bombing alarmed Hungarians because of its intensity
and the deaths of innocent bystanders _ two men and a woman.
Thirteen others were hospitalized.
	   The bomb also damaged 16 cars, hurling parts atop a six-story
building.

World Cup final, only partly about soccer, crowns King of the

	   PARIS (AP) _ In Sunday's dream-come-true World Cup final, Brazil
wants to emerge hands-down King of the World in the domain nearest
its soul and heart. France would just like to be King of the World.
	   Perhaps a third of the planet's population will see the match,
which is only peripherally about soccer.
	   ``That little ball has done a lot for humanity __ and for
France,'' said Philippe Debarge, a laid-back Parisian landscaper
who scoffs at blind patriotism but suddenly finds himself very
proud to be French.
	   Soccer for decades has personified Brazil, where it is a way of
life more than a sport. The French, suddenly within reach of the
treasured Cup, see it as a means to heal rifts and restore glory.
	   ``Reaching the finals has unified us,'' he said. ``Arab and
black slum kids share something with rich whites. I see now why
this game is so important to so many people everywhere.''
	   France's frenzy after its semifinal victory over Croatia was
heavily ``cocorico,'' a term imitating a rooster that means
celebrating Frenchness.
	   The victory energized a nation fraught with self-doubt over the
growing dominance of the European Union and American accents in an
old world the French did much to shape.
	   A grand beau geste, winning the golden trophy in their brand new
stadium, with the whole world watching, would please the French to
no end. And if they fail, at least they had the last crack at
Brazil.
	   ``Of course, we'd love to win at this time in our history,''
Debarge said, typifying a general mood. ``But to play such a
beautiful team is already something. Win or lose, it's wonderful.''
	   For Brazil, a loss is unthinkable. This is a century-ending
chance to win a fifth World Cup in a sport that Brazilian infants,
boys and girls, absorb with mother's milk.
	   The country stops dead during a match. After each of their
early-round victories, fans left the stadium looking troubled
amidst the jubilance. All else was preliminary to the final.
	   ``We stank,'' muttered Luciana Alvez, a Sao Paulo lawyer, after
Norway beat Brazil. Her team already had qualified for the next
round, but she was scared. ``If we play like this, we're dead.''
	   Brazilians flew over by the tens of thousands, and their yellow
shirts fill the stands. Their full-body cheers ripple like waves,
perfectly timed and choreographed, punctuated by deafening drums.
	   A referee's call, or an opponent's foul, is instantly chastised
by a stadium-wide chant that questions his parentage. Each fan has
strategic advice. Brazil is a nation of 120 million soccer coaches.
	   Before and after each game, joyful carnival music reminds
everyone else that soccer may be serious, but it is also fun.
	   The French always have been ambivalent toward soccer, more
intellectual than passionate about it. They have limited practice
at winning and a scant tradition of displaying popular passions.
	   After the Croatia game, team captain Didier Deschamps railed at
all the dark-suited French VIPs in the stadium who, he said, acted
as if they had just come from a funeral.
	   ``That better not happen Sunday,'' he said. ``We don't want to
hear only 90 minutes of samba.''
	   But, at this World Cup, Frenchmen outnumber the Brazilians
rather considerably, and wild support is assured in bars and cafes
and living rooms all over France.
	   If many people first looked with skepticism at a gigantic event
that would fill their streets with sandwich-eating foreigners, most
now have caught the fever. Grandeur is at stake.
	   Real French soccer lovers, from the beginning, dreamed of this
final showdown. Brazilians master skills they most admire: dazzling
footwork, daring assaults and thoughtful teamwork.
	   Above all, French fans believe it is finally now their turn.
	   ``This Cup belongs to us,'' midfielder Youri Djorkaeff declared
early on. ``Our team was born for this competition.''
	   Frenchmen remember that the record for most goals in a World Cup
_ 13 goals _ belongs to their own Just Fontaine. That was 1958,
when Brazil beat France in semifinals.
	   France scored the first World Cup goal back in 1930. A Frenchman
conjured up the idea of FIFA, and the French made it happen.
	   The last World Cup here was in 1938, when Mussolini's Italy
eliminated France, won the tournament and then helped Germany take
over the country.
	   ``This day is magic,'' sociologist Michele Tribalat said after
the semifinal, as she watched people pour into the streets. ``It's
the ideal incarnation of our melting pot.''
	   Anti-immigrant whites screamed praise for Lilian Thuram, the
black fullback who scored both goals. Arabs and blacks howled in
defense of a white guy named Laurent Blanc, who was expelled for a
dubious foul.
	   And in every city and a lot of villages, Frenchmen got together
and sang La Marseillaise like they meant it.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France is aiming for its first World Cup
championship, but the Three Tenors are old pros _ they've done two
World Cup extravaganzas already.
	   On Friday, the tenors were staging their third and biggest,
against the spectacular setting of the floodlit Eiffel Tower.
	   In what organizers enthusiastically billed as ``the most
ambitious classical concert ever staged,'' the tenors _ Luciano
Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras _ were entertaining a
crowd expected to be in the hundreds of thousands on the Champs de
Mars field.
	   They were being backed up by the Paris Orchestra, under the
direction of U.S. conductor James Levine. The program was kept a
strict secret before the concert.
	   Beamed live to over 75 countries, the concert was also being
recorded for a worldwide album release in August.
	   Organizers have said they expect the event to draw up to 800,000
people. Six huge screens were erected for faraway viewers.
	   The Three Tenors sang at Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles for the
1994 World Cup. Only 60,000 people attended, but the concert was
seen on television by an estimated 1.3 billion people around the
globe.
	   The trio made its debut at the 1990 World Cup, at the ancient
baths of Caracalla in Rome.
	   A heavy turnout would surely comfort the three soccer fans,
whose home teams _ Spain for Carreras and Domingo, Italy for
Pavarotti _ have been eliminated from the World Cup.
	   France plays Brazil in Sunday's final.

New state-run national television director appointed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Ivica Vrkic, who won international praise
for his treatment of minority Serbs in eastern Croatia, was
appointed Friday as director of the country's state-run television
network.
	   Vrkic, a member of President Franjo Tudjman's ruling party, was
previously the official in charge of Eastern Slavonia, a region
captured by Serb rebels in 1991 but returned to Croatian control
this year after two years of U.N. administration.
	   He won high marks from the United Nations for his treatment of
Serbs in the area during the transition period to Croatian rule.
	   Television is by far the most influential medium in Croatia, and
the state network is the only one which can be watched nationwide.
	   The United Nations and foreign governments have often criticized
Croatian television for anti-Serb propaganda and for downplaying
the political opposition.
	   Vrkic's appointment was seen as a possible first step toward a
more balanced approach.

Parties divided over Basque issue a year after councilor's killing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; MINOR editing throughout to tighten

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Exactly a year after Basque separatists
sent shock waves through Spain by kidnapping and killing a young
ruling party politician, the country's leaders appear more divided
than ever over how to resolve the northern region's bloody
conflict.
	   People across Spain were asked Friday to commemorate the killing
of Popular Party councilor Miguel Angel Blanco, 29, by the armed
separatist group ETA.
	   ETA kidnapped Blanco on July 10th last year. The group shot him
in the head and left him by the roadside two days later, despite
the unprecedented display of public outrage triggered by the
abduction.
	   But while Blanco's killing briefly united Spaniards against ETA
in huge demonstrations, 12 months down the road political leaders
disagree over how to end to violence.
	   Some parties within the troubled northern region are calling for
a negotiated solution along Northern Ireland lines which would
require a softening of the current policies against ETA and their
political allies Herri Batasuna (HB).
	   ``The solution will never come via those who say `never' to
talks with ETA or HB,'' said Xabier Arzalluz, the head of the
Basque Nationalist Party, in a direct challenge to the Madrid
government's frequently repeated rejection of a negotiated
solution.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos hit out at
Arzalluz saying it was ``a serious mistake to consider dialogue
with HB as long as ETA continue to brandish pistols.''
	   ETA, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has
killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for
independence of northern Spain's three Basque provinces. The
organization has killed eight people, including five councilors,
since the Blanco killing.
	   Alvarez Cascos denied that the dispute would affect the alliance
that provides the Popular Party's minority government in Madrid
with the support of the Basque Nationalist Party's five
parliamentary deputies.
	   Leading opposition Socialist Party chief Joaquin Almunia also
jumped into the fray Friday urging Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
to caution Arzalluz.
	   Last week, disagreement over the talks prompted the Socialists
to quit the three-party alliance, headed by Arzalluz's group, that
has controlled the semiautonomous Basque regional authority since
1994.
	   On Thursday, the Basque region's bishops issued a statement
saying it was ``shameful and discouraging'' that political parties
were unable to agree on how to confront ETA.
	   Many observers believe the negotiations issue is being used by
all sides as a vote catcher ahead of regional elections later this
year.
	   Recent surveys indicated that a majority of Basques believed the
problem can only be solved through talks, and that the matter
cannot be combated solely with police measures.
	   Herri Batasuna has urged Spanish political leaders to take the
lead offered by their British and Irish counterparts in seeking
talks with all sides, including the IRA-linked Sinn Fein group, to
try to solve the Northern Ireland conflict.

	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Albanian arms smugglers and Yugoslav
troops traded fire at several Kosovo border points Friday, leaving
at least four smugglers dead, Serb sources and witnesses said.
	   Serb and Albanian sources also reported scattered clashes
elsewhere in the rebellious province, where ethnic Albanians are
fighting for independence from Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.
	   The government confiscated large quantities of arms and
ammunition following clashes in the border village of Vrbnica, 70
kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Pristina, the pro-government
Serbian Media Center said.
	   In another clash, Yugoslav army troops battled Albanian arms
smugglers near the border village of Kosare and near the border
outpost of Gorozup to the south.
	   AP-Television cameraman Dejan Mladenovic, who visited the site
of the Kosare clash, said the gunbattle lasted until Friday
morning. The bodies of two smugglers lay in the grass near the
cache of weapons which troops said were seized from the Albanians.
	   The weapons included semi-automatic rifles and land mines.
Troops told Mladenovic that it was the first time they had seized
land mines from ethnic Albanian smugglers.
	   Troops also captured one smuggler, Zef Kqiraj, who claimed he
bought the weapons from a soldier in the Albanian army. Troops said
they believed he was bringing the weapons to arm ethnic Albanians
in his home village in Kosovo.
	   British officials speaking in London on Friday said the United
States and European nations trying to stop the fighting have agreed
that Kosovo should have a significant degree of autonomy, but not
independence.
	   But that has been the official position of the major powers
since violence escalated in Kosovo in February. The United States
and European powers have so far not found a formula for uniting the
various Albanian factions to negotiate with the Yugoslav
government.
	   The Albanians, including the moderate leader favored by the
Americans and Europeans, all support independence rather than
autonomy. With no fresh ideas, the major powers are hoping to place
enough pressure on the Albanians to get a cease-fire and peace
talks started.
	   The six-nation Contact Group that coordinates international
policy in the Balkans set out a number of principles that could
form part of a blueprint for resolving the question of Kosovo's
status at what British officials described as a ``difficult''
meeting Wednesday in Bonn, Germany.
	   One principle states that all citizens _ 90 percent are ethnic
Albanians _ should be able to exercise their democratic rights and
be represented at every level of government, the officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Meanwhile, France and Britain were preparing a draft Security
Council resolution aimed at securing a cease-fire, a French Foreign
Ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   The draft resolution would indicate that additional measures
would be taken to end the fighting if Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian rebels did not take steps to halt hostilities, spokesman
Yves Doutriaux said in Paris.

Blair offers to arrange indirect talks as volatile weekend looms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UDPATES with comment from residents and Orange Order, court
challenge to Drumcree march; edits throughout
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ With a tense and violent week
sliding into a potentially explosive weekend, Prime Minister Tony
Blair offered Friday to arrange contacts between Protestants who
want to march through a Catholic neighborhood and Catholic
residents who oppose it.
	   Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, offered to hold
``indirect contact talks'' beginning Saturday morning between
members of the Orange Order, who are attempting to defy a
government order blocking their march down the Garvaghy Road in
Portadown, and representatives of Catholic residents who want them
stopped.
	   The Orange Order accepted Blair's offer, but the residents did
not immediately respond.
	   The Protestant group has refused to have any direct contact with
the residents, insisting it has a historic right to march on any
public highway.
	   Blair's office said the aim was not only to resolve the current
standoff, but to reach an accommodation for future years. The talks
were to be held at a secret location, with no media coverage.
	   While accepting, the Orange Order said in a statement: ``It is
our objective to deliver the Portadown brethren safely on their
return down the Garvaghy Road. We intend to establish our
inalienable rights and freedom to express our culture.''
	   Indirect talks were attempted in 1996 and 1997, but both times
failed to resolve the conflict over the Garvaghy Road march. In
1996, police and soldiers stopped the march at Drumcree but backed
down after four nights of Protestant violence across Northern
Ireland. Last year, police clubbed protesters off the road to let
the Orangemen through.
	   Before Blair's initiative was announced, one of the Garvaghy
Road residents won a judge's permission to begin legal action
intended to force the Portadown Orange Order to comply with the
Parades Commission ruling. A hearing was set for Saturday morning.
	   Violence spread across the province after authorities enforced
an order Sunday preventing the Orangemen from following their
traditional route through a Catholic neighborhood on the Garvaghy
Road in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   Blair insisted Friday that the order will continue to be
enforced _ a determination visibly supported by army helicopters
swooping into the fields near Drumcree Anglican church, discharging
soldiers in riot armor.
	   Engineers repaired barbed-wire lines breached by demonstrators
and expanded ditches designed to keep the marchers from breaking
out of Drumcree.
	   Orange leaders said they regretted the attacks by their
supporters that sent five police officers to hospitals Friday
morning, including four injured by bomb shrapnel. But they also
said worse violence may develop.
	   ``People see that peaceful protest isn't getting them
anywhere,'' said David Jones, a spokesman for the Orange Order,
Northern Ireland's largest Protestant brotherhood.
	   ``Is Tony Blair really prepared to have another Bloody Sunday,
only this time in Portadown, County Armagh?'' Jones said, referring
to the 1972 clash in which British soldiers killed 13 unarmed
Catholic demonstrators in Londonderry. He said 25 civilians were
injured by plastic bullets at Drumcree overnight.
	   ``I understand that there are strongly held views on either
side, but the rule of law is paramount,'' Blair said in a
television interview.
	   The 12th of July, which falls on Sunday, is the biggest
Protestant holiday, celebrating the defeat of the Catholic King
James II by King William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne in
1690.
	   Hundreds of Orange marches are scheduled Monday, with the vast
majority expected to cause no trouble.
	   But Anglican Archbishop Robin Eames said he feared that
``nothing on Earth'' could control the crowds at Drumcree, which
had swollen to 20,000 or more Thursday night.
	   ``The protest is rapidly getting out of control. I would plead
with both sides to take the long view,'' said Eames, who joined
Catholic, Presbyterian and Methodist leaders at a meeting with
David Trimble, the newly elected first minister of Northern
Ireland's Assembly, and his deputy, Seamus Mallon.
	   From Sunday as of 6 a.m. Friday, police had tallied 550 attacks
on officers and soldiers, including 15 shooting incidents, 151
arrests, 548 gaoline bomb attacks, 103 attacks on homes, and 367
attacks on vehicles.
	   More than 50 families have been scared out of their homes, in
some cases by firebombing.
	   Through Thursday morning, police said they had fired 216 plastic
bullets.

Robbers dressed as police hold up armored car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEIDELBERG, South Africa (AP) _ Robbers wearing police uniforms
held up an armored car Friday and fled with an undisclosed amount
of cash, the latest in a string of similar robberies.
	   Two men wearing traffic officers' uniforms in a car with
flashing emergency lights and its siren whining pulled over the SBV
armored car near Heidelberg, 50 kilometers (31 miles) southeast of
Johannesburg, said company spokesman Gert Prinsloo.
	   The uniformed men accused the armored car driver of speeding and
requested his driver's licence as two SBV security guards
positioned themselves outside the vehicle to protect it.
	   A second car with three men in police uniforms and bullet-proof
vests pulled up behind the van. The supposed police officers
offered to mediate with the men in traffic uniforms, Prinsloo told
the South African Press Association.
	   The five uniformed men then pulled guns, locked the security
guards inside the armored car and drove it a kilometer (half-mile)
further, where another 14 bandits were waiting. By the time the
security guards got out of the armored car, the robbers had escaped
with the cash, Prinsloo said.
	   SBV said it is asking the government not to compel vehicles
transporting cash to stop when asked to do so by supposed police,
and instead to allow the vehicles to proceed to the nearest police
station.
	   On Wednesday, police Superintendent Eugene Opperman acknowledged
amid the spate of robberies that the decision to stop or not is a
difficult one.
	   ``Each situation must be judged on its own merits. People have
to decide if they should stop or continue slowly to the nearest
safe place,'' Opperman said.
	   Flip Schutte, 56, was shot dead Tuesday night after he stopped
for a white car with a blue emergency light mounted on its roof.
The robbers pulled his wife from the car and took her handbag and a
cellular phone.
	   Also Tuesday, in an apparently unrelated attack in another part
of the country, George Baloyi, 40, was wounded when he was pulled
over by a red car equipped with a flashing emergency light.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Two Dutch marines and 11 others
have been arrested for smuggling cocaine from the Caribbean to the
Netherlands, a defense ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   Authorities have seized a total of 355 kilograms (781 pounds) of
cocaine, some were discovered aboard a Lockheed Orion
anti-submarine patrol aircraft from the Dutch Navy.
	   Ironically, the aircraft is used to patrol the Caribbean for
drug trafficking as part of the Netherlands Antilles coast guard.
	   Police discovered up to 125 kilograms (275 pounds) of cocaine
stashed away in personnel's bags on the plane, which returned to a
military base in the Netherlands from Curacao Thursday.
	   Raids were also conducted at various locations in Curacao and in
the Netherlands.
	   Besides the two Dutch marines, seven civilians and four military
personnel the Netherlands Antilles were all arrested in the
Netherlands.
	   The amount of cocaine is valued at 60 million guilders (dlrs 30
million).
	   Navy spokeswoman Annette van der Kaay said authorities had
earlier suspected that military personnel in the Netherlands
Antilles were involved in drugs smuggling to the Netherlands.
	   The transport was described as a ``controlled action,'' she
said.
	   ``Authorities let it happen to catch the people ... the purpose
was to get the evidence,'' she added.
	   The two men from the Dutch Marine Corps, a 48 year-old sergeant
major and a corporal, will be discharged.
	   Dutch Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve called the incident
``scandalous.''
	   The Dutch Navy has up to 1,000 personnel stationed in the
Netherlands Antilles. One of their tasks is to help American
authorities fight drug trafficking in the region, said Van der
Kaay.

	   PARIS (AP) _ In Sunday's dream-come-true World Cup final, Brazil
wants to emerge hands-down King of the World in the domain nearest
its soul and heart. France would just like to be King of the World.
	   Perhaps a third of the planet's population will see the match,
which is only peripherally about soccer.
	   ``That little ball has done a lot for humanity __ and for
France,'' said Philippe Debarge, a laid-back Parisian landscaper
who scoffs at blind patriotism but suddenly finds himself very
proud to be French.
	   Soccer for decades has personified Brazil, where it is a way of
life more than a sport. The French, suddenly within reach of the
treasured Cup, see it as a means to heal rifts and restore glory.
	   ``Reaching the finals has unified us,'' he said. ``Arab and
black slum kids share something with rich whites. I see now why
this game is so important to so many people everywhere.''
	   France's frenzy after its semifinal victory over Croatia was
heavily ``cocorico,'' a term imitating a rooster that means
celebrating Frenchness.
	   The victory energized a nation fraught with self-doubt over the
growing dominance of the European Union and American accents in an
old world the French did much to shape.
	   A grand beau geste, winning the golden trophy in their brand new
stadium, with the whole world watching, would please the French to
no end. And if they fail, at least they had the last crack at
Brazil.
	   ``Of course, we'd love to win at this time in our history,''
Debarge said, typifying a general mood. ``But to play such a
beautiful team is already something. Win or lose, it's wonderful.''
	   For Brazil, a loss is unthinkable. This is a century-ending
chance to win a fifth World Cup in a sport that Brazilian infants,
boys and girls, absorb with mother's milk.
	   The country stops dead during a match. After each of their
early-round victories, fans left the stadium looking troubled
amidst the jubilance. All else was preliminary to the final.
	   ``We stank,'' muttered Luciana Alvez, a Sao Paulo lawyer, after
Norway beat Brazil. Her team already had qualified for the next
round, but she was scared. ``If we play like this, we're dead.''
	   Brazilians flew over by the tens of thousands, and their yellow
shirts fill the stands. Their full-body cheers ripple like waves,
perfectly timed and choreographed, punctuated by deafening drums.
	   A referee's call, or an opponent's foul, is instantly chastised
by a stadium-wide chant that questions his parentage. Each fan has
strategic advice. Brazil is a nation of 120 million soccer coaches.
	   Before and after each game, joyful carnival music reminds
everyone else that soccer may be serious, but it is also fun.
	   The French always have been ambivalent toward soccer, more
intellectual than passionate about it. They have limited practice
at winning and a scant tradition of displaying popular passions.
	   After the Croatia game, team captain Didier Deschamps railed at
all the dark-suited French VIPs in the stadium who, he said, acted
as if they had just come from a funeral.
	   ``That better not happen Sunday,'' he said. ``We don't want to
hear only 90 minutes of samba.''
	   But, at this World Cup, Frenchmen outnumber the Brazilians
rather considerably, and wild support is assured in bars and cafes
and living rooms all over France.
	   If many people first looked with skepticism at a gigantic event
that would fill their streets with sandwich-eating foreigners, most
now have caught the fever. Grandeur is at stake.
	   Real French soccer lovers, from the beginning, dreamed of this
final showdown. Brazilians master skills they most admire: dazzling
footwork, daring assaults and thoughtful teamwork.
	   Above all, French fans believe it is finally now their turn.
	   ``This Cup belongs to us,'' midfielder Youri Djorkaeff declared
early on. ``Our team was born for this competition.''
	   Frenchmen remember that the record for most goals in a World Cup
_ 13 goals _ belongs to their own Just Fontaine. That was 1958,
when Brazil beat France in semifinals.
	   France scored the first World Cup goal back in 1930. A Frenchman
conjured up the idea of FIFA, and the French made it happen.
	   The last World Cup here was in 1938, when Mussolini's Italy
eliminated France, won the tournament and then helped Germany take
over the country.
	   ``This day is magic,'' sociologist Michele Tribalat said after
the semifinal, as she watched people pour into the streets. ``It's
the ideal incarnation of our melting pot.''
	   Anti-immigrant whites screamed praise for Lilian Thuram, the
black fullback who scored both goals. Arabs and blacks howled in
defense of a white guy named Laurent Blanc, who was expelled for a
dubious foul.
	   And in every city and a lot of villages, Frenchmen got together
and sang La Marseillaise like they meant it.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Like tens of thousands of the Irish, Ken
McDonald can't wait for France's greatest sporting spectacle to
come flashing by Saturday _ in his case, right past his front door.
	   For others, capturing the best vantage point of the 85th Tour de
France during its three-day visit to Ireland has meant camping out
in the Wicklow Mountains south of Dublin, where cyclists will climb
its humble 540-meter summit Sunday before whizzing back into the
capital.
	   ``Nothing like this has ever been here before, and God knows
when it's coming back,'' said McDonald, whose bicycle shop sits on
the route of Saturday's 3.5-mile (5.6 km) time-trial. Like
buildings all along the circuit, McDonald is clearing the bikes off
his shop floor for a party.
	   English sprint specialist Chris Boardman remains the favorite to
take the opener, as he has done on two previous Tours, though he
complains that personal distractions have left him vulnerable to an
upset.
	   This will be the 13th time that the Tour de France has begun
outside French soil since its foundation in 1903.
	   It came to Ireland partly because of the need to avoid a
collision with soccer's World Cup, which concludes Sunday in Paris,
and also as a tribute to two of the Tour's outstanding racers of
the 1980s: Tipperary native Sean Kelly, who won the green jersey _
the competition's marker for the most consistent athlete _ a
record-setting four times, and Dublin-born Stephen Roche, who took
the winner's yellow jersey in 1987.
	   It's not lost on the Irish that the Tour arrives with the local
sport in the doldrums and not a single Irishman in the running.
Boardman, from Liverpool across the Irish Sea, is the closest they
have to a home favorite, with a certain underdog's interest in the
lone American-backed team, U.S. Postal Service.
	   ``Kelly and Roche were just outstanding people. Finding another
one of them would be as hard as finding a Pele,'' said McDonald.
``You can't make these people in a factory like a bike.''
	   Although 21 nine-member teams are taking part, this Tour looks
like shaping into a three-way fight among Germany's Telekom,
France's Festina and Spain's Banesto.
	   Telekom boasts last year's wunderkind winner, 24-year-old Jan
Ullrich, the 1996 victor Bjarne Riis, a national hero in his native
Denmark, and speedster Erik Zabel.
	   Festina's best hope lies in a Swiss cyclist, Alex Zuelle, a
strong all-rounder who is seeking redemption after his failure to
hold an early lead in this year's Tour of Italy.
	   Festina also posseses in Richard Verinque the undisputed No. 1
master mountain-climber. But this year's route _ though it dips
into both the Pyrenees starting July 21 and the Alps six days later
_ is considered to have too few steep sections to give Verinque the
edge he needs.
	   And Spain is still waiting for Banesto's Roberto Olano to
fulfill his billing as the successor to Miguel Indurain, who
dominated the Tour with five successive wins until 1995.
	   Dubliners may know few if any of the cycling stars, but they
were winning a certain lustful admiration from Friday's onlookers.
	   ``I just love the way their uniforms fit. They're tasty,'' said
Aoife O'Rawe, pausing from her shopping to admire a passing flock
of Italian cyclists on a practice run down O'Connell Street,
Dublin's main thoroughfare where Saturday's race will finish.
	   The Tour departs Ireland on Monday night after a 125-mile (200
kms) soujourn along its southern coast, finishing in the country's
second city of Cork, where three ferries will carry the bulk of the
athletes, supporters and equipment on to Roscoff, Brittany, where
the Tour resumes Tuesday.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Riot police in helmets and flak jackets
milled around the city's mosques Friday, trying to forestall an
escalation in ethnic attacks against Nigeria's northern Hausa
Muslims.
	   Days after the death of the country's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola _ a southern ethnic Yoruba _ waves of
rioting and violence appear to be pitting Yoruba against Hausa,
northerner against southerner.
	   For the third straight day Friday, youths stormed through
streets in parts of Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos, setting
fires, smashing windows and blocking roads. Violence between Hausas
and Yorubas was also tearing at the southwestern city of Ibadan,
long an enclave of anti-junta sentiment.
	   Increasingly, Nigerian authorities fear the political violence
is rooted in Hausa-Yoruba enmity.
	   The bodies of nine Hausas discovered in a predominantly Yoruba
neighborhood backed up that fear, and a senior police commander
said many of the rampaging Lagos youths were unemployed Yorubas.
	   In reaction, Nigerian leaders have fanned out among Lagos'
jumble of ethnic communities, trying to stop political violence
from turning into mob ethnic attacks.
	   But just where political violence ends and ethnic violence
begins is not completely clear. And some of the violence suffusing
cities in Nigeria's southwest appears to simply be the random
outpouring of years of frustration.
	   Life in Nigeria became increasingly difficult during Abacha's
rule, as the economy and infrastructure crumbled under the weight
of neglect and corruption.
	   The death of Abiola _ the apparent winner of annulled
presidential elections in 1993 _ has infuriated his supporters who
say the military, which is dominated by Hausa and Fulani
northerners, is to blame.
	   The junta says he died of a heart attack, but some of Abiola's
relatives say he was killed by the military even as they prepared
to set him free.
	   The government has completed an autopsy, but hasn't released the
results. A second, independent autopsy to be conducted by a team of
foreign pathologists, was scheduled for Friday.
	   Trying to stave off further ethnic attacks, riot police and
paramilitary troops were protecting Muslim mosques in Lagos, some
of which have been targeted by the predominantly Christian Yorubas.
	   While a feared wave of attacks during Friday afternoon Muslim
prayers did not occur, authorities were afraid the violence was
still bubbling.
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, toured city mosque's Friday, appealing for Hausas not to
launch reprisals.
	   While Nigeria is a confused grid of more than 250 ethnic groups,
it is dominated by Hausas and Fulanis in the north, Yorubas in the
southwest and Ibos in the southeast.
	   Religious differences overlay the ethnic divisions, with Muslims
making up the majority in the north and Christianity _ along with a
strong current of animism _ dominating the south.
	   But the divisions are not always aligned neatly. Abiola, for
example, was a Muslim as well as a Yoruba.
	   Abiola died Tuesday, still in custody four years after his
arrest.
	   His freedom, though, had been widely hinted at in the four weeks
since the sudden death of Gen. Sani Abacha, who had brutally ruled
Nigeria for the past five years.
	   Abacha's successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has released a
group of political prisoners and promised to free the rest. He said
after Abiola's death that the opposition leader was on the brink of
release and has vowed _ albeit vaguely _ to return the country to
civilian rule.
	   Instead, Abiola's death has touched off three days of violence.
More than 400 people have been arrested since Tuesday night, when
violence first broke out in Lagos, police say, and at least 24
people have been confirmed killed. Unconfirmed reports say the
death toll may be in the dozens.
	   Many of the victims were Hausas and Fulanis, said junta
commander Col. Hamed Ali.
	   ``Counsel your subjects on the need for peaceful co-existence,''
Ali told a joint meeting of Yoruba, Hausa and Ibo elders in Lagos
late Thursday.
	   These days, unemployment is rampant, roads are a mess and buying
gasoline can require 12 hours in line.
	   Nigeria has seen more than its share of brutal ethnic violence
since gaining independence from Britain in 1960. The Biafran war of
the late 1960s was spawned amid the ethnic hatreds and attacks
between northern and southern tribes. More than a million people
died in that civil war as southern Ibos waged a futile battle to
establish an independent homeland.
	   Although triggering much resentment, it is the military's
iron-fisted central rule that is often and ironically credited with
keeping Nigeria in one piece.
	   The junta, meanwhile, was trying to set a tone of
reconciliation. The military Thursday commuted death sentences
handed down to six people, including a former military leader,
accused of trying to overthrow Abacha.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Six people were arrested in London and
Ireland in a joint operation with British police against
anti-British militants, Irish police said.
	   It was not clear if there was any connection to a major
rush-hour security alert in central London.
	   Three men were arrested in London, Irish police said, and a
number of firebombs were seized. A man was also held in Dundalk, 5
miles (8 kms) south of the border with Northern Ireland, where
police also found shotguns and bomb parts. A man and a woman were
also arrested in Dublin.
	   London's Scotland Yard police headquarters did not immediately
confirm the three London arrests, and did not say if they were
connected to the security alert that closed several stations on the
London underground railroad Friday evening. Witnesses said a bomb
had been defused and several people were arrested , but Scotland
Yard released no information on a bomb.
	   ``A number of men have been arrested in London. An operation is
ongoing,'' a spokeswoman for Scotland Yard said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. She gave no further details.

Alert issued for Kurdish children missing from camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Police have issued a nationwide alert
for 17 missing Kurdish children amid suspicions they were spirited
away from a summer camp to become fighters for a Kurdish rebel
group.
	   Authorities have also contacted Interpol about the missing
children, Swedish media reported Friday.
	   The children have not been seen since going to a summer camp
under unclear circumstances in late June, the reports said.
	   Parents who reported that the children, aged 14 to 17, were
missing said ``they were contacted by people whom they possibly
knew, but they're not entirely sure of their identity. The people
said the children will go to a camp June 22-29,'' Stockholm county
police official Leif Jennekvist was quoted as saying in the
newspaper Dagens Nyheter.
	   ``The parents did not consider that this was something to
discuss or question,'' he said, according to the newspaper.
	   Another police official, Goesta Andersson, told the Swedish news
agency TT that officials were ``entirely sure'' that the Kurdish
rebel group PKK was involved in arranging the camp.
	   Police did not publicly speculate that the children were being
forced into working with the PKK.
	   But ``it's publicly known that the PKK has a system for forcibly
recruiting children. They make raids and kidnap children against
their and the parents' will,'' Henrik Haeggstroem of the Swedish
Save the Children charity, was quoted as telling TT.
	   A spokesman for the ERNK group, which supports the PKK in its
fight for Kurdish autonomy, told the agency ``I don't know why
people are blowing this matter up.''
	   Speaking anonymously, the spokesman said that many camps are
held for Kurdish children in Europe to help strengthen their
cultural identity and ``it can happen that some youths from these
camps want to go out and fight.''

	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav troops battled arms
smugglers Friday along Kosovo's border with Albania as a leading
Albanian politician appealed to major powers to support the
province's independence, which they have so far rejected.
	   Elsewhere, government and ethnic Albanian sources reported
scattered clashes throughout the rebellious province, where
Albanian rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army are fighting for
independence from Serbia. Serbia, with Montenegro, makes up
Yugoslavia.
	   In Patina, hundreds of armed Kosovo Albanians fortified the
village west of the provincial capital Pristina, fearing attack
from Serb neighbors. Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9-to-1.
	   Both Serb and Albanian sources reported fighting Friday in
several areas along the Albanian border, over which ethnic
Albanians smuggle weapons into the province. Government sources and
witnesses said at least four smugglers were killed in two of the
border clashes, which began Thursday night.
	   Near the border town of Kosare, about 85 kilometers (53 miles)
southwest of Pristina, reporters saw bodies of two smugglers lying
in the grass. Yugoslav troops seized a large quantity of weapons,
including rifles, machine guns, ammunition and anti-tank mines. A
captured smuggler, Zef Kqiraj, claimed he bought the weapons in
Albania from an Albanian army sergeant.
	   Government soldiers said it was the first time they seized
anti-tank mines from smugglers. That could mark a dangerous
escalation in the conflict, which intensified in February when
security forces launched their crackdown on Albanian militants.
	   The United States and Europe have been trying to halt the
violence and arrange talks between the Albanians and Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   In Paris, the French foreign ministry said Friday that France
and Britain would introduce a resolution in the U.N. Security
Council aimed at securing an immediate cease-fire. Spokesman Yves
Doutriaux said the resolution would threaten additional measures _
presumably sanctions.
	   The resolution would implement a declaration by the six-nation
Contact Group _ the United States, Russia, France, Britain, Germany
and Italy _ calling for a cease-fire to permit a ``meaningful
dialogue'' between the Serbs and Albanians.
	   Contact Group members also warned the KLA that they would crack
down on financial support from Albanian communities abroad. Contact
Group members oppose independence for Kosovo but want Milosevic to
restore self-rule he withdrew in 1989.
	   In Pristina, however, Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, who
opposes violence, urged Contact Group nations Friday to support
independence for Kosovo and put more pressure on Milosevic to
accept international demands to halt the crackdown.
	   ``We expect and demand from the Contact Group, whose involvement
we greatly value, to support our proposal on an independent
Kosovo,'' Rugova said.
	   The United States and Europeans want the KLA to accept Rugova as
the leader of Kosovo Albanians in future talks with Milosevic.
	   In Patina, villagers said Serbs in nearby Svinjare burned down
four Albanian houses after their occupants fled. Serb civilians,
some toting rifles, blocked reporters from entering Svinjare.
	   Elsewhere, a Serbian policeman was wounded in an attack by
ethnic Albanians on a checkpoint on the road between Kosovska
Mitrovica and Srbica, Serb sources said. Another policeman was
reported seriously wounded in the Decane area of western Kosovo.
	   Serb sources also reported Albanian extremists attacked police
early Friday in the village of Dolac, 45 kilometers (28 miles) west
of Pristina, but were driven off with ``significant losses.''

Baltic PMs pledge economic unity

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ Amid recent criticism about the
effectiveness of their cooperation, prime ministers from Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia said Friday they were forging ahead with plans
for a Baltic common market.
	   At a meeting in Sigulda, Latvia, the government leaders signed a
series of economic agreements, including one standardizing customs
procedures among the three countries.
	   Estonia's Mart Siimann, Latvia's Guntars Krasts and Lithuania's
Gediminas Vagnorius also agreed to next year draw up a treaty on
the free movement of labor.
	   Since becoming independent in 1991, the three countries have
aimed at having a unified position on foreign policy issues, but
have faltered on practical cooperation among themselves.
	   Red tape at border crossings and often-contradictory laws
discourage many investors.
	   Many businessmen say that because the countries are so small _
with a total of 8 million people _ creating a common market is

Barbados leader: IMF, World Bank should study problems of small

countries &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund should do more to alleviate the economic vulnerability of
small nations, Prime Minister Ower Arthur of Barbados said Friday.
	   He said many of these nations, which have relatively high
incomes compared to the world's poorest countries, are being pushed
to the sidelines by globalization of trade while international
financial institutions concentrate on the financial crisis in Asia
and Russia's economic difficulties.
	   ``There are new threats to the security of small states from
economic shocks, natural disasters, global warming, that make them
increasingly vulnerable,'' Arthur said. ``We want (the World Bank
and the IMF) to focus on these concerns and they have agreed to do
so.''
	   Arthur led a group of ministers from Lesotho, Mauritius, Fiji
and New Zealand that met with World Bank President James Wolfensohn
and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus.The group met Thursday
with senior State Department officials.
	   A member of the delegation said Wolfensohn enthusiastically
agreed with the objectives of the small states' mission. It was
established by the Commonwealth, which groups Britain and 53 of its
former colonies, at its summit meeting last October. Small nations
that are not members of the Commonwealth also are involved.
	   Arthur said the World Bank would try to establish a
``vulnerability index'' for small states that would be used along
with per capita income and credit worthiness when assessing how the
bank and the monetary fund can help them.
	   Generally, these countries do not have diversified economies and
often depend on a single export, such as bananas, sugar, textiles,
or tourism to generate foreign exchange earnings.
	   Arthur the group was trying to galvanize international support
and succeeded in getting the United States to look at the specific
concerns of small nations.
	   The group will hold talks in Europe next week with the World
Trade Organization and the 15-nation European Union.

Alert issued for Kurdish children missing from camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Police have issued a nationwide alert
for 17 missing Kurdish children amid suspicions they were spirited
away from a summer camp to become fighters for a Kurdish rebel
group.
	   Authorities have also contacted Interpol about the children,
ages 14 to 17, who were last seen on their way to a summer camp in
late June, Swedish media reported Friday.
	   The parents said ``they were contacted by people whom they
possibly knew, but they're not entirely sure of their identity. The
people said the children will go to a camp June 22-29,'' Stockholm
county police official Leif Jennekvist was quoted as saying in the
newspaper Dagens Nyheter.
	   ``The parents did not consider that this was something to
discuss or question,'' he said, according to the newspaper.
	   Another police official, Goesta Andersson, told the Swedish news
agency TT that officials were ``entirely sure'' that the Kurdish
rebel group PKK was involved.
	   Police did not publicly speculate the children were being forced
into working with the PKK in its fight for Kurdish autonomy.
	   But ``it's publicly known that the PKK has a system for forcibly
recruiting children. They make raids and kidnap children against
their and the parents' will,'' Henrik Haeggstroem of the Swedish
Save the Children charity, was quoted as telling TT.
	   A spokesman for the ERNK group, which supports the PKK, told TT
that ``I don't know why people are blowing this matter up.''
	   Speaking anonymously, the spokesman said many camps are held for
Kurdish children in Europe to help strengthen their cultural
identity, and ``it can happen that some youths from these camps
want to go out and fight.''

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ The Missionaries of Charity opposes
efforts to raise money in the name of Mother Teresa, either to
commemorate her first death anniversary or to build a statue in her
memory, the head of the order said Friday.
	   Sister Nirmala, who took over as superior general of the
Missionaries of Charity after Nobel-laureate Mother Teresa died
last year, told the newly formed ``Mother Teresa Memorial
Committee'' to stop their plans to build a statue of Mother Teresa,
name a street after her or to institute an award in her name.
	   The Mother Teresa Memorial Committee reportedly raised money
from corporate offices, opened a bank account and an office to
observe her first death anniversary on Sept. 5.
	   ``I appreciate your sentiments towards mother and your efforts
to honor her in different ways. But I disapprove of setting up this
committee and of its having its own office and bank account,''
Sister Nirmala told Arun Biswas, president of the All India
Minorities and Weaker Sections Council, the body that set up the
Memorial Committee.
	   Sister Nirmala asked the memorial be disbanded immediately.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatian lawmakers voted themselves a
nearly 300 percent pay increase Friday and approved a dlrs 93,700
annual salary for President Franjo Tudjman _ almost 20 times more
than the average Croat earns.
	   The pay hikes were included in a bill approved by the Chamber of
Deputies which also prescribes obligations and rights of all
government officials.
	   It requires officials to disclose all property acquired since
they entered government service were hired. The law also bans
government officials from serving on company boards of directors.
	   Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union, which controls the
parliament, proposed the legislation following complaints that
officials were enriching themselves at the taxpayers' expense.
	   But the bill also raises the net salary for parliament members
from the equivalent of about dlrs 1,000 a month to the equivalent
of dlrs 3,125 a month. Tudjman's previous salary has never been
disclosed.
	   That could trigger a backlash among the public in a country,
where the average monthly salary is the equivalent of dlrs 400.
Pensions for retired Croats are about half that figure.
	   Teachers, who are also paid by the government, were turned down
recently when they sought a 12 percent pay increase. Similar
requests by railway workers and pensioners were also turned down
because of the government's economic problems.
	   Marin Jurjevic of the opposition Social Democrats called the new
law ``morally unacceptable'' considering the increasing economic
hardships that most of Croats face. Journalist Helena Puljiz of the
daily Jutarnji dismissed the law as ``just a show.''
	   State media did not report totals in Friday's voting. But
Tudjman's party holds a clear majority in the 127-seat chamber. New
parliamentary elections are due in late 1999.

Trinidad plans to execute killer Tuesday, defying courts and

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Trinidad and Tobago intends to
hang a murderer on Tuesday, defying an international human rights
court and international pressure to ban the death penalty.
	   Authorities at the State Prison in Port of Spain confirmed
Friday that they read a death warrant, a notification of execution,
against Haniff Hillaire on Thursday.
	   Caribbean countries say executions help deter crime related to
the region's drug trade, and they are increasingly frustrated with
international attempts to block executions.
	   Thursday's execution order is a challenge to the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights, which is hearing an appeal from
Hillaire. In May, Trinidadian officials accused the court of
dragging its feet and shocked civil rights advocates by dropping
out of an Organization of American States human rights accord that
allows such appeals.
	   In an angry response to European pressure, Barbados, Trinidad
and Tobago, Guyana and Jamaica announced last week they were
changing their constitutions to free themselves of the British
Privy Council, the supreme court for most former British colonies
in the Caribbean.
	   The Privy Council ruled in 1993 that death row inmates must be
spared if their appeals drag on for more than five years.
	   Trinidad has not executed a killer in four years. A series of
last-minute legal motions blocked the execution last month of
29-year-old murderer Darrin Thomas.
	   Hillaire and two other men killed a man in 1991, claiming he had
been beating his common-law wife. Hillaire was convicted in May
1995 and lost an appeal to the Privy Council.

	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ The prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania on Friday signed an agreement standardizing customs
procedures, a step toward creating a Baltic common market.
	   Estonia's Mart Siimann, Latvia's Guntars Krasts and Lithuania's
Gediminas Vagnorius also agreed at a meeting in Sigulda, Latvia, to
next year draw up a treaty on the free movement of labor.
	   Since becoming independent in 1991, the three countries have
aimed at having a unified position on foreign policy issues, but
have faltered on practical cooperation among themselves.
	   Red tape at border crossings and often-contradictory laws
discourage many investors.

with a total of 8 million people _ creating a common market is
critical to long-term growth and investment.

Two North Korean diplomats arrested for attempted drug smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two North Korean diplomats were arrested
Friday for possession of more than half a million pills also known
as the ``date-rape drug,'' a senior Cairo airport customs official
said.
	   Customs officers detained Kim Hak Jon and Kim Sal Jo, accredited
to the North Korean Embassy in Damascus, Syria, when they arrived
on an EgyptAir plane from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the commander on
duty of airport customs, Fathi el-Zuheiri, told The Associated
Press.
	   El-Zuheiri said they were carrying six bags with a total of
about 504,000 tablets of Rohypnol, prescribed as a hypnotic and
muscle relaxant and widely sold to youngsters as a pleasure-giving
agent.
	   The drugs have a street value of some 5 million Egyptian pounds
(dlrs 1.47 million), according to airport officials speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The diplomats' passports revealed they arrived in Cairo last
Sunday and left the same day for Ethiopia, the officials said.
	   No one was available for comment at the North Korean Embassy in
Cairo. It was closed Friday for the Muslim Sabbath.

	   LONDON (AP)_ Police foiled a bombing attack in London on Friday
and arrested three men, Scotland Yard said.
	   There was no immediate indication of the target for the attack,
but Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, head of Scotland's
Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said the arrested men had explosive
devices that were intended to be used ``within minutes.''
	   ``This evening's arrests are the result of prolonged
investigation into dissident criminal Irish republican terrorist
groups, and a successful surveillance operation carried out by the
Metropolitan Police and MI5 which had thwarted an imminent planned
terrorist attack in London,'' Grieve said in a statement.
	   The three suspects, believed to be posing as students, were
taken to police stations for questioning.
	   Police said armed officers had been used but no shots were fired
and no one was injured during the operation. British police
normally do not carry guns.
	   Scotland Yard said the operation continued and a number of
addresses were being searched.
	   The London arrests followed raids by police in Dublin and
Dundalk, Ireland. There was a total of six arrests.
	   The Irish police operation targeted hardline organizations
determined to resist the Northern Ireland peace agreement.
	   In Dundalk, 5 miles (8 km) south of the Northern Ireland border,
police uncovered two shotguns, bomb components and false documents
in an apartment and arrested a man.
	   A woman and another man were picked up in Dublin.
	   The Irish police operation has been under way for some months.
Friday's events began with the Dundalk raid this morning, and the
arms find followed by the arrest.
	   Information uncovered there prompted Irish police to contact
their London counterparts and led to the arrests by anti-terrorist
officers.

Annan confident that Nigeria will release prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite the death this week of Nigeria's
most prominent political prisoner, the U.N. chief said Friday he
was optimistic that the government would follow through with a
pledge to release all other such captives unconditionally.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he spoke with the Nigerian
leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, most recently on Wednesday.
Abubakar indicated that the government would forge ahead with plans
to return the country to civilian rule and release all political
prisoners, Annan said.
	   ``I am quite confident that he's serious, he's well-intentioned,
he would want to move Nigeria on to democratic civilian rule,''
Annan told a news conference Friday.
	   Annan had announced the release of the prisoners _ including
Mashood Abiola _ during his visit to the West African country last
week. Abiola, who apparently won annulled 1993 presidential
elections and was imprisoned in 1994, died Tuesday after suddenly
falling ill during a meeting with U.S. diplomats.
	   Abiola's death set off violent riots that have killed at least
24 people.
	   The junta says he died of a heart attack, but some of Abiola's
relatives say he was killed by the military even as they prepared
to set him free.
	   Abubakar has said Abiola was on the brink of release. He has
already released a group of political prisoners and promised to
free the rest.

	    &UR; Mr. Rogers' Traveling Neighborhood
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Wishes are coming true for little and big fans
of Mr. Rogers: They finally have a chance to visit their favorite
neighborhood in person.
	   At the Pittsburgh Children's Museum, kids can play in King
Friday's castle, drive the red trolley and try on Mr. Rogers'
handmade cardigans and navy tennis shoes in an exhibit based on his
long-running children's show, ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.''
	   ``Television can be fairly passive. I've always said the best
time for our program is once it's over and the television is turned
off,'' Fred Rogers said Friday. ``Well, here's a setting where
they're really surrounded by reminders of the program, and they can
play about them.''
	   The exhibit will travel to 50 children's museums around the
country after leaving the program's hometown of Pittsburgh in
November. The Children's Museum is building a second, smaller
version of the 2,500-square-foot (230-square-meter) exhibit to
accommodate all the requests.
	   ``It's Mr. Rogers: It's hard not to sell it,'' said David Adair,
spokesman for the Pittsburgh museum.
	   On Saturday, 4-year-old Ally Ross waggled a Queen Sara hand
puppet from behind the blue castle stage while her brother,
Benjamin, 6, pointed an exhibit video camera at her.
	   ``I watch it all the time,'' Ally said of the 30-year-old
program on the public U.S. television network PBS. ``He wears
different sweaters every day. My little brother likes his red
one.''
	   Rogers, who grew up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Latrobe and
turns 70 this year, helped a team of designers create the exhibit
over nine months. The Grable Foundation gave the museum an dlrs
840,000 grant to pay for it.
	   For parents, some of whom grew up watching the show, the exhibit
offers plaques explaining the developmental benefits of play. A
reading area includes Rogers' family-help books.
	   Most parents seemed more interested in playing right along with
their children. Some helped their little ones dress up in costumes
in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, and others pretended to be
taking a ride in a life-sized trolley car while their children
drove.
	   ``I like particularly the quiet parts,'' Rogers said of the
exhibit. ``All children need times of quiet, just like all adults
do. We need to be able to reflect on what we've been through and
what we might be going to do.''
	   On the opening Saturday morning, however, his little fans were
too excited to sit still. A favorite area was a large pin screen
that children could lean against to make a full-body imprint.
	   ``In most children's museum exhibits, kids will be here for a
half hour and they'll move upstairs, but that first group of
kids... was here for seven hours,'' Adair said. ``Parents were
dragging them out of here.''

London bombing foiled, three arrested

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP)_ Police foiled a bombing attack in London on Friday
and arrested three men, Scotland Yard said.
	   There was no immediate indication of the target for the attack,
but Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, head of Scotland's
Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said the arrested men had explosive
devices that were intended to be used ``within minutes.''
	   Police have warned that a real threat remains to April's
Northern Ireland peace agreement from splinter groups which do not
recognise the cease-fires made by the province's major paramilitary
groups.
	   ``This evening's arrests are the result of prolonged
investigation into dissident criminal Irish republican terrorist
groups, and a successful surveillance operation carried out by the
Metropolitan Police and MI5 which had thwarted an imminent planned
terrorist attack in London,'' Grieve said in a statement.
	   The three suspects, believed to be posing as students, were
taken to police stations for questioning.
	   Police said armed officers had been used but no shots were fired
and no one was injured during the operation. British police
normally do not carry guns.
	   Scotland Yard said the operation continued and a number of
addresses were being searched.
	   The London arrests followed raids by police in Dublin and
Dundalk, Ireland. There was a total of six arrests.
	   The Irish police operation targeted hardline organizations
determined to resist the Northern Ireland peace agreement.
	   In Dundalk, 5 miles (8 km) south of the Northern Ireland border,
police uncovered two shotguns, bomb components and false documents
in an apartment and arrested a man.
	   A woman and another man were picked up in Dublin.
	   The Irish police operation has been under way for some months.
Friday's events began with the Dundalk raid this morning, and the
arms find followed by the arrest.
	   Information uncovered there prompted Irish police to contact
their London counterparts and led to the arrests by anti-terrorist
officers.
	   On May 23, Irish police arrested two men and seized two cars
containing bomb-making material near the Irish border with Northern
Ireland.
	   Irish Republican Army members opposed to the outlawed group's
July 1997 truce have broken away to form a rival command nicknamed
``RIRA,'' or Real IRA. Most of the dissidents come from the Irish
Republic.

Rome court gives back custody of child to ex-porn star
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An appeals court here has decided that ex-porn star
Ilona ``Cicciolina'' Staller should have custody after all of her
young son whom she had with her former husband, pop artist Jeffrey
Koons.
	   The court on Friday reversed a ruling in March that gave custody
of 5-year-old Ludwig to the father because Staller was judged by
the lower court to be ``too permissive.''
	   The boy will now be able to stay with his mother while the case
moves to Italy's supreme court, Italian news reports said.
	   ``I'm so happy, I don't know how to say it. I was desperate. I
didn't know what to do, but I would have done anything, anything,
so as not to lose Ludwig,'' the Italian news agency AGI quoted
Staller as saying by cellular phone.
	   A message left on her cellular phone was not returned.
	   Staller, who once served as a deputy in Italy's lower chamber of
Parliament, has been feuding for years with Koons over their son.
	   Ludwig ``needs a mother and a father, he needs both,'' Staller
was quoted as saying.
	   Staller and Koons met when he hired her to pose in sexually
explicit photos, paintings and sculptures.

Berlin expels 74 refugees from Bosnian war in city's first such
</HEADLINE>
move &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ In a move reaping criticism from church officials,
Berlin has expelled 74 refugees to Bosnia, because they have
declined to return home voluntarily, a city official confirmed
Friday.
	   Interior Senator Joerg Schoenbohm said the refugees must return
home under an agreement with the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina of
last year. Those who don't go voluntarily have to reckon with
expulsion, he said,
	   Schoenbohm's office said that 36 refugees were put on a flight
for Sarajevo on Thursday, and another 38 returned on Friday.
	   Elisabeth Reese, a refugee advisor from Berlin's Lutheran Holy
Cross Church, said that among those expelled were a traumatized
woman who was detained for at 5 a.m. Thursday, and a 72-year-old
Bosnian woman who was exempt from expulsion but for a time
arrested.
	   ``Such an action we have never experienced before,'' Reese said,
calling it ``a demonstration of power,'' by Schoenbohm's office,
which she said was ``inhuman.''
	   Schoenbohm played down the criticism, saying that in principle
city officials depended on the refugees to return voluntarily. But
he told Inforadio Berlin in an interview that thus far Berlin had
expelled 285 war refugees to Bosnia.
	   ``We are now putting on pressure,'' he told the station.
	   Since hostilities were largely stopped in Bosnia in late 1995,
only 9,000 war refugees have returned there from Berlin, with
20,000 remaining in the German capital. Scoenbohm said.
	   He said the refugees are needed at home to rebuild Bosnia, ``and
in most cases there are no longer grounds for them to accept
further Berlin's protection as guests.''
	   He said the expulsions would continue to ``send a meaningful
signal.''
	   Reese said that the majority of those expelled were not informed
they were scheduled to go, and therefore had no chance to take
legal action to stop it.
	   But Schoenbohm said that all of those returned had been informed
they would be expelled.
	   Germany took in some 350,000 refugees during the 3 1/2 year war
in Bosnia, more than any other country. Officials say that more
than 200,000 still remain.
	   Last week Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen said that the city's
capacity for refugees had been reached, and called for the federal
Interior Ministry to tighten its controls at Germany's borders.

Russian president appeals to IMF chief, Clinton, for financial

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin appealed directly to the
head of the International Monetary Fund on Friday, pledging to put
Russia's fiscal house in order if the fund comes through with a
financial bailout.
	   ``The president of Russia emphasized his firm intention to use
all his strength to implement the suggested government measures,''
the Kremlin said in a statement.
	   Yeltsin also spoke to a series of Western leaders on Friday,
including U.S. President Bill Clinton, beseeching them for support
to help Russia out of its economic crisis.
	   A senior IMF official was en route to Moscow Friday night,
presumably to put the finishing touches on a bailout agreement that
Russian officials have said is all but completed.
	   Russia is seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in loans
from the agency. Any agreement would likely be contingent on
approval by IMF headquarters and on passage of the government's new
austerity plan in parliament _ no small hurdle.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko delivered a blunt and gloomy
report to parliament Friday, warning that social tensions are
rising in Russia and financial markets have ``practically ceased to
exist.''
	   Since Russia's economy began spiraling downward this year,
volume on the stock market has declined from about dlrs 110 million
a day to as little as dlrs 10 million a day.
	   In his address to the Federation Council, the upper house of
parliament, Kiriyenko also said the government's proposed new
economic program represented a wholesale change in economic policy
_ sharp cuts in government spending combined with more stringent
system for collecting taxes.
	   Still, the program _ demanded by Western lending agencies
including the IMF _ received only a lukewarm response from the
legislators.
	   In their conversation, Clinton indicated ``that he supported
President Yeltsin's efforts to wind up these (negotiations)
successfully and also to bring the urgency of these matters to the
(State) Duma,'' said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
	   In its own statement, the Kremlin said Clinton agreed that
Russia's efforts to stabilizing its economy ``should be met with an
adequate response from the International Monetary Fund.''
	   In addition to Clinton, Yeltsin spoke by telephone with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
French President Jacques Chirac, all of whom voiced support for
Russia's anti-crisis economic program, the Kremlin said.
	   The government's chief negotiator with Western lending agencies,
Anatoly Chubais, prepared to meet with John Odling-Smee of the IMF,
who was expected to arrive sometime Friday night.

UEFA to overhaul Champions' League format

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The structure and semifinal format of the EUFA
Champions' League competition will be modified before the 1999-2000
season.
	   The UEFA committee, which met in Paris on Friday, revealed
semifinals will be decided by one-off matches at neutral venues
instead of the current two-game home and away format.
	   The 24 teams competing in the group stage will be divided into
four groups of six, with the top two sides in each group qualifying
for the quarterfinals _ decided on a home and away basis.
	   The committee also decided to enter the No.1 ranked European
team, based on World Cup performances, in the Confederation Cup in
Mexico next January.
	   If the No.1 team, France according to current performance, is
unable to participate, the position will be offered to the next
best team.

 &UR; Yugoslavs say anti-tank mines added to Kosovo rebels' arsenal &QL; 
 &UR; By DEJAN MLADENOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOSARE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels are apparently
adding land mines to their arsenal in the battle for independence
for Serb-ruled Kosovo province, Yugoslav army troops at this border
outpost say.
	   Troops on this rugged mountainside outpost _ 75 kilometers (46
miles) southwest of the provincial capital Pristina _ showed
reporters dozens of crates of weapons and ammunition seized from
smugglers after an hours-long gunbattle, which ended Friday
morning.
	   The weapons included anti-tank mines. Troops here said it was
the first time they had seized such mines from smugglers, who ferry
weapons and ammunition by mule train across the mountains from
Albania to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Other weapons included rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns,
semi-automatic rifles and crates of small arms ammunition.
	   A short distance away, the bloodsoaked bodies of two smugglers
as well as four carcasses of their pack animals lay in the grass.
	   Troops said the dead were among about 30 smugglers intercepted
by a Yugoslav border patrol late Thursday night. At least two
smugglers were killed and two were captured. The others apparently
fled back into Albania.
	   One of the prisoners was wounded and taken to hospital. The
other, Zef Kqiraj, said he entered Albania from his native Kosovo
to buy cigarettes and smuggle them back to Yugoslavia to sell on
the black market.
	   Yugoslavia consists of Montenegro and Serbia, of which Kosovo is
a province.
	   Unable to buy enough cigarettes, Kqiraj claimed he decided to
smuggle weapons, which he bought from an Albanian army sergeant.
Kqiraj said he paid 100 German marks (about dlrs 55) for each rifle
and 300 marks (dlrs 167) for each machine gun.
	   He told reporters he simply planned to sell the weapons to
anyone who would buy them. Weapons are a status symbol among
Kosovo's Albanian community.
	   But a Yugoslav officer, who spoke on condition he not be
identified, said he believed the weapons were for KLA fighters in
Kqiraj's home village Zup.
	   The KLA is battling Serb security forces for control of the
province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Riot police in helmets and flak jackets
milled around the city's mosques Friday, trying to forestall an
escalation in ethnic attacks against Nigeria's northern Hausa
Muslims.
	   Days after the death of the country's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola _ a southern ethnic Yoruba _ waves of
rioting and violence appear to be pitting Yoruba against Hausa,
northerner against southerner.
	   For the third straight day Friday, youths stormed through
streets in parts of Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos, setting
fires, smashing windows and blocking roads. That violence had ended
by late afternoon, but streets in some neighborhoods remained tense
and watched over by scores of police and soldiers. Violence between
Hausas and Yorubas was also tearing at the southwestern city of
Ibadan, long an enclave of anti-junta sentiment.
	   Increasingly, Nigerian authorities fear the political violence
is rooted in Hausa-Yoruba enmity. That antagonism was born after
Nigeria's 1960 independence from Britain, when northerners quickly
took control of the country and have held onto control _ other than
about four years when southerners held power _ ever since.
	   These days, Nigeria's pro-democracy movement is largely led by
southerners, particularly Yorubas.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The top anti-kidnapping cop in Mexico state
is under investigation for allegedly protecting the fugitive leader
of a bloody kidnapping ring, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The newspaper Reforma, citing unidentified prosecution sources,
said the federal attorney general's office received evidence that
Alberto Pliego Fuentes accepted dlrs 1,200 to protect Daniel
Arizmendi Lopez.
	   Spokespeople at the federal attorney general's office in Mexico
City and at the Mexico state attorney general's office refused to
comment on the report.
	   If prosecutors went ahead with the case, it would not be
unprecedented. Morelos state's former anti-kidnapping chief,
Armando Martinez Salgado, and a ranking federal police officer,
Jose Domingo Tassinari, are under arrest for alleged ties to
Arizmendi, who is a former policeman.
	   Authorities in Morelos, where the Arizmendi gang operated from,
told reporters Tuesday that Arizmendi and his brother Aurelio used
to work in the criminal division of the state police.
	   Daniel Arizmendi Lopez has been a fugitive for more than a
month. His brother Aurelio was captured June 30 after a brief
shootout in which Aurelio was wounded in both legs.
	   Daniel Arizmendi's wife, his son and daughter-in-law also have
been arrested and are awaiting trial on charges of organized crime
and being accomplices to kidnappings.
	   Aurelio Arizmendi's wife, Adriana Suarez Arista, turned herself
in Monday and helped authorities recover about dlrs 1 million in
ransom money. So far, police have recovered more than dlrs 2
million in cash from the gang, and seized at least a dozen houses
and other pieces of real estate gang members bought with the
ransoms.
	   The gang is best known for cutting off victims' ears and sending
them to relatives to speed up payment.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Police foiled a bombing attack in London on Friday
and arrested three men as part of a joint British-Irish operation
against militants opposed to the Northern Ireland peace agreement,
Scotland Yard said.
	   Four more suspects were arrested in the Irish Republic.
	   There was no immediate indication of the target for the attack,
but Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, head of Scotland's
Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said the men arrested in London had
explosive devices that were intended to be used ``within minutes.''
	   Police have warned that a real threat remains to April's
Northern Ireland peace agreement from splinter groups which do not
recognize the cease-fires made by the province's major paramilitary
groups.
	   ``This evening's arrests are the result of prolonged
investigation into dissident criminal Irish republican terrorist
groups, and a successful surveillance operation carried out by the
Metropolitan Police and MI5 which had thwarted an imminent planned
terrorist attack in London,'' Grieve said in a statement.
	   The three suspects, believed to be posing as students, were
taken to police stations for questioning.
	   Police said armed officers had been used but no shots were fired
and no one was injured during the operation. British police
normally do not carry guns.
	   Scotland Yard said the operation continued and a number of
addresses were being searched.
	   The London arrests followed raids by police in Dublin, Wexford,
and Dundalk, Ireland. There was a total of seven arrests.
	   The Irish police operation targeted hardline organizations
determined to resist the Northern Ireland peace agreement.
	   In Dundalk, 5 miles (8 km) south of the Northern Ireland border,
police uncovered two shotguns, bomb components and false documents
in an apartment and arrested a man.
	   A woman and another man were picked up in Dublin. A fourth
arrest was made in Wexford.
	   The Irish police operation has been under way for some months.
Friday's events began with the Dundalk raid this morning, and the
arms find followed by the arrest.
	   Information uncovered there prompted Irish police to contact
their London counterparts and led to the arrests by anti-terrorist
officers.
	   On May 23, Irish police arrested two men and seized two cars
containing bomb-making material near the Irish border with Northern
Ireland.
	   Irish Republican Army members opposed to the outlawed group's
July 1997 truce have broken away to form a rival command nicknamed
``RIRA,'' or Real IRA. Most of the dissidents come from the Irish
Republic.

Rios, Becker to meet in semifinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) _ Semi-retired Boris Becker, who has
not won a tournament in two years, resumed his bid for his first
clay-court title by beating defending champion Felix Mantilla 6-4,
6-4 Friday to reach the Swiss Open semifinals.
	   ``I didn't expect to be in the semifinal,'' Becker said. ``But
as long as I practice and give myself a chance I am still a
dangerous player. I've proven that in the past few days.''
	   Becker is aiming for his 50th career title. His last one came at
the 1996 Grand Slam Cup. Because of his limited schedule he is
ranked No. 119, falling from the top 100 this week for the first
time in 13 years.
	   In beating Mantilla, the No. 5 seed, Becker advanced to a
semifinal for the first time this season.
	   The 30-year-old German will face top seed Marcelo Rios in the
semis. Rios, ranked No. 2 in the world, defeated Spain's Francisco
Clavet 6-3, 7-5 in his quarterfinal.
	   Becker's victory over Mantilla eliminated any possibility of
Rios regaining the No. 1 ranking from Pete Sampras.
	   Rios, who has lost only seven matches in 1998 and briefly
replaced Sampras at No. 1 this year, needed bonus points from wins
over both Mantilla and Alex Corretja to reclaim the top ranking.
	   ``It will be exciting to play Rios,'' said Becker, the winner of
six Grand Slam titles. ``I've played him a few times but not since
he was world No. 1. Being a former No. 1 I will be able to compare
him with other No. 1 players and see firsthand how good he is.''
	   This is Rios' best showing in five appearances in this
tournament. His best previous result were quarterfinal appearances
in 1994 and 1995.
	   ``I'm looking forward to trying to win this tournament,'' said
Rios, who has won only one of three matches against Becker. ``I
want to be the best.''
	   In a Spanish quarterfinal, Corretja, the No. 3 seed, rallied to
a 5-7, 6-2, 6-2 victory over No. 6 seed Albert Costa, the 1996
champion.
	   Corretja, who lost to compatriot Carlos Moya in the French Open
final, will meet Belgium's Filip Dewulf in the other semifinal.
Dewulf won 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 to stop No. 8 Nicolas Kiefer of Germany.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Jana Novotna, finally adjusting to
clay after her Wimbledon triumph, moved into the Czech Open
semifinals with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over France's Sarah Pitkowski on
Friday.
	   Novotna, the top seed, has not lost a match since the
quarterfinals of the French Open, winning 14 matches on grass at
Eastbourne and Wimbledon.
	   ``I am beginning to get in the right pace on clay,'' she said.
``Hopefully, it will get even better in the semifinals.''
	   Novotna, showing an excellent serve-and-volley game in her home
country, next plays Slovakia's Henrietta Nagyova. Nagyova beat
Meghan Shaughnessy of the United States 6-1, 6-2.
	   In other quarterfinals, No. 2 seed Sandrine Testud of France
beat No. 6 Silvia Farina of Italy 2-6, 6-3, 6-2. Testud will play
Natasha Zvereva of Belarus, who downed wild card Amelie Mauresmo of
France 6-3, 6-2.

In sewer dispute, EU threatens to bar visits from Belarusian

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The European Union threatened Friday to
bar visits from state officials in retaliation for Belarus'
eviction of ambassadors from their homes in a diplomatic compound.
	   The government responded sharply, saying Western countries are
deliberately blowing the dispute out of proportion.
	   ``A private issue, a change of residence, is being used as the
basis for unprecedented, large-scale political pressure on
Belarus,'' the government said in a statement read late Friday on
state radio.
	   EU diplomats delivered a statement to the Foreign Ministry on
Friday but did not release it to the public. The government's radio
address said it informed Belarus that the union had taken a
decision to deny all Belarusian government officials entrance
visas.
	   However the ITAR-Tass news agency, citing diplomatic sources,
said the statement was only a threat. There was no immediate
comment or confirmation from EU headquarters in Brussels.
	   The United States is among nine countries that have protested
orders from the Belarusian government to vacate ambassadors'
residences in a diplomatic compound in the suburb of Drozdy.
	   Belarus has said it needs to repair the plumbing and sewage
system in the compound. The ambassadors say that under the Vienna
Convention on diplomatic relations, Belarus has no right to force
them out for any reason.
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, Japan, Bulgaria and Poland have all left Minsk in
protest.

	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav troops battled arms
smugglers Friday along Kosovo's border with Albania, and the
province's leading Albanian politician appealed to major powers to
support independence _ which they have so far rejected.
	   Elsewhere, government and ethnic Albanian sources reported
scattered clashes throughout the rebellious province, where
Albanian rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army are fighting for
independence from Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.
	   Serb police arrested 11 ethnic Albanians Friday for allegedly
organizing a secret guerrilla unit in the southern towns of
Urosevac and Kacanik. The Serb Media Center said 22 other suspected
KLA members eluded arrest in the dawn raids in the two towns.
	   Police blamed the unit for carrying out three ``terrorist
attacks'' against police. The center said maps of police and
military facilities were seized in the raids, as well as a machine
gun and 17 assault rifles.
	   Hundreds of armed Kosovo Albanians fortified this village west
of the provincial capital Pristina, fearing attack from Serb
neighbors. Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9-to-1.
	   Both Serb and Albanian sources reported sharp fighting Friday in
several areas along the Albanian border, over which ethnic
Albanians smuggle weapons into the province.
	   Government sources and witnesses said at least four smugglers
were killed in two of the border clashes, which began Thursday
night and continued until after dawn Friday.
	   At the scene of one battle _ near the border town of Kosare,
about 85 kilometers (53 miles) southwest of Pristina _ reporters
saw bodies of two smugglers lying in the grass. Troops said two
smugglers were captured and others fled back into Albania.
	   Yugoslav troops also seized a large quantity of weapons,
including rifles, machine guns, ammunition and anti-tank mines. One
smuggler, Zef Kqiraj, claimed he bought the weapons in Albania from
an Albanian army sergeant.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Police foiled a bombing attack in London on Friday

Scotland Yard said.
	   Four more suspects were arrested in the Irish Republic.

many devices had been found, or state their intended targets. A
police spokesman, speaking anonymously, said only that the men had
``a number of ready-made explosive devices.''
	   The men were arrested near university buildings. The areas were
sealed off as searches were made. Underground rail stations were

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin appealed directly to the
head of the International Monetary Fund on Friday, pledging to put
Russia's fiscal house in order if the fund comes through with a
financial bailout.
	   ``The president of Russia emphasized his firm intention to use
all his strength to implement the suggested government measures,''
the Kremlin said in a statement.
	   Yeltsin also spoke to a series of Western leaders on Friday,
including U.S. President Bill Clinton, beseeching them for support
to help Russia out of its economic crisis.
	   A senior IMF official was en route to Moscow Friday night,
presumably to put the finishing touches on a bailout agreement that
Russian officials have said is all but completed.
	   Russia is seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in loans
from the agency. Any agreement would likely be contingent on
approval by IMF headquarters and on passage of the government's new
austerity plan in parliament _ no small hurdle.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko delivered a blunt and gloomy
report to parliament Friday, warning that social tensions are
rising in Russia and financial markets are so moribund they have
``practically ceased to exist.''
	   Since Russia's economy began spiraling downward this year,
volume on the stock market has declined from about dlrs 110 million
a day to as little as dlrs 10 million a day.
	   In his address to the Federation Council, the upper house of
parliament, Kiriyenko also said the government's proposed new
economic program represented a wholesale change in economic policy
_ sharp cuts in government spending combined with a more stringent
system for collecting taxes.
	   Still, the program _ demanded by Western lending agencies
including the IMF _ received only a lukewarm response from the
legislators.
	   In their conversation, Clinton indicated ``that he supported
President Yeltsin's efforts to wind up these (negotiations)
successfully and also to bring the urgency of these matters to the
(State) Duma,'' said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
	   In its own statement, the Kremlin said Clinton agreed that
Russia's efforts to stabilizing its economy ``should be met with an
adequate response from the International Monetary Fund.''
	   In addition to Clinton, Yeltsin spoke by telephone with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
French President Jacques Chirac, all of whom voiced support for
Russia's anti-crisis economic program, the Kremlin said.
	   Yeltsin's telephone conversation with IMF chief Michel Camdessus
lasted more than a half hour. Meanwhile, the government's chief
negotiator with Western lending agencies, Anatoly Chubais, prepared
to meet with a top IMF official, John Odling-Smee, who was expected
to arrive sometime Friday night.

London bombing foiled, 10 arrested in Britain and Ireland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with two more arrested in London near library &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police foiled a bombing attack in London on Friday
and arrested 10 people in a joint British-Irish operation against
militants opposed to the Northern Ireland peace agreement, Scotland
Yard said.
	   Six London arrests followed raids by police in Dublin, Wexford,
and Dundalk, Ireland, where four arrests were made Friday.
	   There was no immediate indication of the targets, but Deputy
Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, head of Scotland's Yard's
anti-terrorist branch, said three men arrested in London had
explosive devices that were intended to be used ``within minutes.''
	   A fourth person _ a woman _ was arrested later near Oxford
Street, one of the capital's busiest shopping districts, police
said.
	   Another man and a woman were arrested near the new
multi-million-pound (dollar) British Library, Scotland Yard said,
bringing to six the number of people held in London by the
Anti-terrorist Squad. They have been taken to a London police
station for questioning.
	   Police have warned that a real threat remains to April's
Northern Ireland peace agreement from splinter groups which do not
recognize the cease-fires made by the province's major paramilitary
groups.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair described the operation as ``very
important and successful,'' and reflected the close cooperation
between Irish and British security forces.
	   ``This evening's arrests are the result of prolonged
investigation into dissident criminal Irish republican terrorist
groups,'' Grieve said in a statement. He called it a successful
surveillance operation carried out by the London's Metropolitan
Police and MI5, the British internal intelligence agency, had
thwarted an imminent planned terrorist attack in London,'' Grieve
said in a statement.
	   Scotland Yard would not elaborate on its statements, say how
many devices had been found, or state their intended targets. A
police spokesman, speaking anonymously, said only that the men had
``a number of ready-made explosive devices.''
	   The men were arrested near university buildings. The areas were
sealed off as searches were made. Underground rail stations were
also cleared.
	   Police said armed officers had been used but no shots were fired
and no one was injured during the operation. British police
normally do not carry guns.
	   Scotland Yard said the operation continued and a number of
addresses were being searched.
	   The Irish police operation targeted hardline organizations
determined to resist the Northern Ireland peace agreement.
	   In Dundalk, 5 miles (8 km) south of the Northern Ireland border,
police uncovered two shotguns, bomb components and false documents
in an apartment and arrested a man.
	   A woman and another man were picked up in Dublin. A fourth
arrest was made in Wexford.
	   The Irish police operation has been under way for some months.
Friday's events began with the Dundalk raid this morning, and the
arms find followed by the arrest.
	   Information uncovered there prompted Irish police to contact
their London counterparts and led to the arrests by anti-terrorist
officers.
	   On May 23, Irish police arrested two men and seized two cars
containing bomb-making material near the Irish border with Northern
Ireland.
	   Irish Republican Army members opposed to the outlawed group's
July 1997 truce have broken away to form a rival command nicknamed
``RIRA,'' or Real IRA. Most of the dissidents come from the Irish
Republic.

Two North Korean diplomats arrested for attempted drug smuggling
</HEADLINE>

diplomats' accreditation; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two men carrying North Korean diplomatic
passports were arrested Friday for possession of half a million
hypnotic pills, a senior Cairo airport customs official said.
	   Customs officers detained Kim Hak Jon and Kim Sal Jo after they
arrived on an EgyptAir plane from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the
commander on duty of airport customs, Fathi el-Zuheiri, told The
Associated Press.
	   They were carrying six bags containing a total of about 504,000
pills of Rohypnol, el-Zuheiri said.
	   Rohypnol is a prescribed hypnotic and muscle relaxant that has
been widely sold to youngsters as a pleasure-giving agent. In the
United States it has been called the ``date-rape drug.''
	   El-Zuheiri said Jon and Jo are accredited to the North Korean
Embassy in Damascus, Syria. But a diplomat at that embassy, who
refused to give his name or rank, denied any knowledge of the pair;
and their names do not appear on the Syrian diplomatic list.
	   It was not possible to explain the discrepancy Friday. The North
Korean Embassy in Cairo was closed for the Muslim sabbath. Egypt's
official Middle East News Agency described the men as diplomats
responsible for security at the North Korean Embassy in Damascus.
	   Airport officials said the diplomats' passports revealed that
they had arrived in Cairo last Sunday and left the same day for
Ethiopia.
	   The drugs had a street value of some five million Egyptian
pounds (dlrs 1.47 million), said the officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.

Ethnic violence jars Lagos, leaders try to stem ethnic attacks

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Riot police in helmets and flak jackets
milled around the city's mosques Friday, trying to forestall an
escalation in ethnic attacks against Nigeria's northern Hausa
Muslims.
	   Days after the death of the country's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola _ a southern ethnic Yoruba _ waves of
rioting and violence appear to be pitting Yoruba against Hausa,
northerner against southerner.
	   For the third straight day Friday, youths stormed through
streets in parts of Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos, setting
fires, smashing windows and blocking roads. That violence had ended
by late afternoon, but streets in some neighborhoods remained tense
and watched over by scores of police and soldiers. Violence between
Hausas and Yorubas was also tearing at the southwestern city of
Ibadan, long an enclave of anti-junta sentiment.
	   Increasingly, Nigerian authorities fear the political violence
is rooted in Hausa-Yoruba enmity. That antagonism was born after
Nigeria's 1960 independence from Britain, when northerners quickly
took control of the country and have held onto control _ other than
about four years when southerners held power _ ever since.
	   These days, Nigeria's pro-democracy movement is largely led by
southerners, particularly Yorubas.
	   The bodies of nine Hausas discovered in a predominantly Yoruba
neighborhood backed up that fear, and a senior police commander
said many of the rampaging Lagos youths were unemployed Yorubas.
	   In reaction, Nigerian leaders have fanned out among Lagos'
jumble of ethnic communities, trying to stop political violence
from turning into mob ethnic attacks.
	   But just where political violence ends and ethnic violence
begins is not completely clear. And some of the violence suffusing
cities in Nigeria's southwest appears to simply be the random
outpouring of years of frustration.
	   Life in Nigeria became increasingly difficult during Abacha's
rule, as the economy and infrastructure crumbled under the weight
of neglect and corruption.
	   The death of Abiola _ the apparent winner of annulled
presidential elections in 1993 _ has infuriated his supporters who
say the military, which is dominated by Hausa and Fulani
northerners, is to blame.
	   The junta says he died of a heart attack, but some of Abiola's
relatives say he was killed by the military even as they prepared
to set him free.
	   The government has completed an autopsy, but hasn't released the
results. A second, independent autopsy by a team of foreign
pathologists will not be conducted until Saturday at the earliest,
Abiola family members said Friday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Trying to stave off further ethnic attacks, riot police and
paramilitary troops were protecting Muslim mosques in Lagos, some
of which have been targeted by the predominantly Christian Yorubas.
	   While a feared wave of attacks during Friday afternoon Muslim
prayers did not occur, authorities were afraid the violence was
still bubbling.
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, toured city mosque's Friday, appealing for Hausas not to
launch reprisals.
	   While Nigeria is a confused grid of more than 250 ethnic groups,
it is dominated by Hausas and Fulanis in the north, Yorubas in the
southwest and Ibos in the southeast.
	   Religious differences overlay the ethnic divisions, with Muslims
making up the majority in the north and Christianity _ along with a
strong current of animism _ dominating the south.
	   But the divisions are not always aligned neatly. Abiola, for
example, was a Muslim as well as a Yoruba.
	   Abiola died Tuesday, still in custody four years after his
arrest.
	   His freedom, though, had been widely hinted at in the four weeks
since the sudden death of Gen. Sani Abacha, who had brutally ruled
Nigeria for the past five years.
	   Abacha's successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has released a
group of political prisoners and promised to free the rest. He said
after Abiola's death that the opposition leader was on the brink of
release and has vowed _ albeit vaguely _ to return the country to
civilian rule.
	   Instead, Abiola's death has touched off three days of violence.
More than 400 people have been arrested since Tuesday night, when
violence first broke out in Lagos, police say, and at least 55
people have been confirmed killed. Unconfirmed reports say the
death toll may be in the dozens.

Westwood recovers after rain to lead Loch Lomond
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Lee Westwood picked up where he left
off after rain interrupted play for more than two hours in the
850,000-pound (dlrs 1.41 million) Loch Lomond tournament Friday and
leads going into the final round.
	   The European No.2 was 6-under-par with five holes to play when
heavy rain saturated greens and halted play, but he added another
birdie after the break for a 68 to go to 7-under-par 206.
	   He shares the lead with Sweden's Dennis Edlund, runner-up in
last year's English Open, who birdied three of the last six holes
for a 67.
	   Westwood's playing partner Ross Drummond, the tournament's
halfway mark leader, fired a 72 round Friday to drop into second
place with David Howell at the 4-under total of 209.
	   Joint fifth a stroke further back are defending champion Tom
Lehman (69), Derrick Cooper (67), Australian Stephen Allan (72) and
another Swede Klas Eriksson (65), while European No.1 Colin
Montgomerie is in the group five behind.
	   Westwood is playing for his third win in four European tour
starts, while Drummond is staking his future on his success at Loch
Lomond by playing for the European tour card he lost last year.
	   The 41-year-old Scot was lucky to be contesting the British Open
tune-up event _ called up to play last Friday when American Davis
Love withdrew _ only a top placing will secure his future.
	   And Drummond has some powerful allies in the field, including
European No.1 Colin Montgomerie.
	   Montgomerie, currently 2-under-par on 211 after finishing the
third round in driving rain with a 68, said he wanted his fellow
countryman to win the dlrs 141,660 first prize.
	   ``He's obviously had a difficult time these last few years and
it's great he's been given the opportunity to play this week,'' he
said.
	   ``I feel for people in his position. It's not just a bad year,
it's the loss of a job if you don't keep your card.
	   ``I don't mind if he wins at my expense.''
	   Montgomerie started the day with a double bogey on the second to
go eight strokes behind the leaders but scored four birdies in the
next six holes and finished with two birdies to get back into
contention.
	   ``I'm right back in it. I'm in contention, which is where I try
to be with a round to go every week,'' he said.
	   First round leader Ian Woosnam fired ten successive pars and two
bogeys in the 14 holes he played and was even when rain stopped his
round but had another bogey and finished with a 72 to go 1-over.
	   American Craig Hainline is among a group of four players,
including Australia's Robert Allenby and Spain's Jose Maria
Olazabal on 1-under 212.

Yemeni pipeline blown up

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Tribesmen blew up an oil pipeline in northern
Yemen Friday, causing a prolonged fire but no casualties, a
security official said.
	   The explosion was the seventh such attack on oil and gas
pipelines since June 19 when tribesmen and city residents started
protesting a 40 percent rise in the price of fuel in Yemen. The
protests have often led to clashes with security forces.
	   The official said the fire was still burning 12 hours after the
explosion in Marib district, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast
of the capital, San`a.
	   The official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
pinned the blame on ``one of the tribes in Marib.''
	   The pipeline runs from Marib to the Red Sea province of
al-Hudaydah, 140 miles (225 kilometers) west of San`a.
	   The government raised the prices of gasoline, kerosene and
cooking gas to meet demands by the International Monetary Fund for
a sweeping removal of subsidies.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to use firearms in settling scores with rivals or to
express discontent with the government.

Blair offers to arrange indirect talks as volatile weekend looms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UDPATES with residents accepting, arrests of bombing suspects
in London
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ With a tense and violent week
sliding into a potentially explosive weekend, Prime Minister Tony
Blair offered Friday to arrange contacts between Protestants who
want to march through a Catholic neighborhood and Catholic
residents who oppose it. Both agreed to talk.
	   Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, offered to open
``indirect contact talks'' Saturday morning between members of the
Orange Order, who are attempting to defy a government order
blocking their march down the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, and
representatives of Catholic residents who want them stopped.
	   In London and Ireland, police arrested 10 people and said they
had foiled plans by Irish Republican Army dissidents to attack
targets in the British capital.
	   Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, head of Scotland's
Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said three men arrested in London had
explosive devices that were intended to be used ``within minutes.''
It wasn't clear whether the alleged attacks had anything to do with
the march standoff in Northern Ireland.
	   The Orange Order has refused to have any direct contact with the
residents in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of Belfast,
insisting it has a historic right to march on any public highway.
	   Blair's office said the aim was not only to resolve the current
standoff, but to reach an accommodation for future years. The talks
were to be held at a secret location, with no media coverage.
	   While accepting, the Orange Order said in a statement: ``It is
our objective to deliver the Portadown brethren safely on their
return down the Garvaghy Road. We intend to establish our
inalienable rights and freedom to express our culture.''
	   ``We have been down this road before with proximity talks, last
year and the year before,'' said Breandan MacCionnaith, leader of
the residents group. ``For our part we would view this as a small
first step towards what we would hope would be face-to-face
dialogue with the Orange Order.''
	   Indirect talks in 1996 and 1997 failed to resolve the conflict
over the Garvaghy Road march. In 1996, police and soldiers stopped
the march at Drumcree but backed down after four nights of
Protestant violence across Northern Ireland. Last year, police
clubbed protesters off the road to let the Orangemen through.
	   Before Blair's initiative was announced, one of the Garvaghy
Road residents won a judge's permission to begin legal action
intended to force the Portadown Orange Order to comply with the
Parades Commission ruling. A hearing was set for Saturday morning.
	   Violence spread across the province after authorities enforced
the Parades Commission order on Sunday.
	   Blair insisted Friday that the order will be enforced _ a
determination visibly supported by army helicopters swooping into
the fields near Drumcree Anglican church, discharging soldiers in
riot armor.
	   Engineers repaired barbed-wire lines breached by demonstrators
and expanded ditches designed to keep the marchers from breaking
out of Drumcree.
	   Orange leaders said they regretted the attacks by their
supporters that sent five police officers to hospitals Friday
morning, including four injured by bomb shrapnel. But they also
said worse violence may develop.
	   ``People see that peaceful protest isn't getting them
anywhere,'' said David Jones, a spokesman for the Orange Order.
	   ``Is Tony Blair really prepared to have another Bloody Sunday,
only this time in Portadown, County Armagh?'' Jones said, referring
to the 1972 clash in which British soldiers killed 13 unarmed
Catholic demonstrators in Londonderry.
	   The 12th of July, which falls on Sunday, is the biggest
Protestant holiday, celebrating the defeat of the Catholic King
James II by King William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne in
1690.
	   Hundreds of Orange marches are scheduled Monday, with the vast
majority expected to cause no trouble.
	   From Sunday as of 6 a.m. Friday, police had tallied 550 attacks
on officers and soldiers, including 15 shooting incidents, 151
arrests, 548 gasoline bomb attacks, 103 attacks on homes, and 367
attacks on vehicles.
	   More than 50 families have been scared out of their homes, in
some cases by firebombing.
	   Through Thursday morning, police said they had fired 216 plastic
bullets.

Canadian dollar sets another record low against U.S. currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The Canadian dollar fell to another record low
Friday against the U.S. dollar, in part because of
weaker-than-expected job figures.
	   The Canadian dollar hit an all-time low Thursday when it closed
at 67.78 U.S. cents. It opened Friday at 67.64 cents and fell as
low as 67.57 cents before closing at 67.63 cents.
	   Analysts linked the latest slide to June unemployment figures
that were released Friday.
	   Although the national jobless rate remained unchanged at 8.4
percent, there were about 36,000 fewer jobs in Canada last month.
The rate remained stable only because fewer people were looking for
jobs.
	   The weak Canadian dollar has enticed crowds of U.S. shoppers
into border towns to take advantage of the favorable exchange rate.
Conversely, it has made U.S. vacations more expensive for
Canadians.

Westwood recovers after rain to lead Loch Lomond
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: updates scores, corrects lead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Lee Westwood fired a 3-under-par 68
Friday to share the lead in the 850,000-pound (dlrs 1.41 million)
Loch Lomond tournament with Sweden's Dennis Edlund.
	   Rain interrupted play in the third round for more than two hours
Friday but the break worked for Westwood and Edlund who both
finished the with the 7-under-par total of 206.
	   Edlund, last year's English Open runner-up, shot a 67 to share a
three stroke lead with Westwood going into the final round
Saturday.
	   Westwood's playing partner Ross Drummond, the tournament's
halfway mark leader, fired a 1-over-par 72 Friday to drop into
second place with David Howell (70) at the 4-under total of 209.
	   Joint fifth a stroke further back are defending champion Tom
Lehman, who scored 69, Derrick Cooper (67), Australian Stephen
Allan (72) and Sweden's Klas Eriksson (65).
	   European No.1 Colin Montgomerie is in the group of five one
stroke further behind on 2-under after firing two birdies on the
last two holes in driving rain for a round of 68.
	   Westwood is playing for his third win in four European tour
starts, while Drummond is staking his future on his success at Loch
Lomond by playing for the European tour card he lost last year.
	   The 41-year-old Scot was lucky to be contesting the British Open
tune-up event _ called up to play last Friday when American Davis
Love withdrew _ only a top placing will secure his future.
	   And Drummond has some powerful allies in the field, including
Montgomerie, who said he didn't mind if his fellow countryman wins
at his expense.
	   American Craig Hainline is among a group of four players,
including Australia's Robert Allenby and Spain's Jose Maria
Olazabal, at the 1-under total of 212.
	   First round leader Ian Woosnam fired ten successive pars and the
finished with three bogeys in the last eight holes to finish with
72 and go to the 1-over total of 214.

Elijah Pitts dies; went to six Super Bowls with Packers, Bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Elijah Pitts, who spent 25 years in the
National Football League, playing for the Green Bay Packers and
helping to coach the Buffalo Bills, died Friday in a Buffalo
hospital. He was 60.
	   Pitts had been on medical leave from the Bills since being
diagnosed with abdominal cancer last October. He was undergoing
prolonged chemotherapy treatment.
	   Pitts spent 16 years as a Bills assistant. He became former
coach Marv Levy's assistant head coach in 1992. Pitts took over as
head coach for three games in 1995 season when Levy was diagnosed
with prostate cancer.
	   Pitts coached in four Super Bowls with the Bills and was part of
four AFC championship teams.
	   ``Eli was an outstanding human being. He always carried a smile
and was respected by all he came in contact with,'' said Bills
president and owner Ralph C. Wilson Jr.
	   ``The passing of Elijah Pitts is a great loss not only for the
Buffalo Bills but the entire National Football League,'' said
current coach Wade Phillips, who took over for Levy after the 1997
season. ``The number of players and coaches that he has touched
throughout the league are too many to name. His legacy will
certainly carry on through them.''
	   As a player, Pitts spent nine years with the Green Bay Packers
during their championship years under Hall of Fame coach Vince
Lombardi. The Packers won four NFL championships and two Super
Bowls during Pitts' career.
	   In 1967, he became the first player to rush for a touchdown in
the Super Bowl when he scored against the Kansas City Chiefs. He
also played for Chicago, Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans before
retiring in 1971. He was elected to Green Bay's Hall of Fame in
1979.
	   Levy said he was ``deeply saddened'' to learn of Pitts' death.
	   ``He will be remembered with great respect and affection,'' Levy
said.

Alamodome fight fourth match between Leija, Nelson
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) _ Their re-, re-, rematch promises to be just
as exciting as their first three fights.
	   And it could finally settle a 5-year-old score between Jesse
James Leija and Azumah Nelson, who fight Saturday night in a
12-round lightweight bout at the Alamodome.
	   ``We've had some classic battles,'' said Leija. ``I don't expect
the fourth to be any different.''
	   The match will be Nelson's first since he lost the WBC super
featherweight title on points to Genaro Hernandez in March 1997.
	   The America Presents promotion is billed as the Festival of
Champions.
	   Among the six fights on the undercard, Gabriel Ruelas, a former
WBC super featherweight champion, will fight Troy Dorsey, a former
IBF featherweight champ, in a junior lightweight title bout.
	   There also will be a junior lightweight nontitle match between
Goyo Vargas of Mexico, a former WBC featherweight champion, and
Tracy Harris Patterson, who held the WBC and IBF super
featherweight titles.
	   The 32-year-old Leija, of San Antonio, and the 38-year old
Nelson, of Ghana, first fought in September 1993 in the Alamodome
in a battle surrounded by controversy.
	   Though Leija took control in the middle rounds to forge a lead
over the defending champion, Nelson rallied to win the last four
rounds for an apparent victory. But the decision was changed to a
draw because a judge's scorecard was incorrectly tabulated.
	   ``I feel I won the fight,'' Nelson said. ``The people, they know
who won.''
	   Leija dominated the second match in May 1994 in Las Vegas as he
realized his dream of winning a world title.
	   Nelson won the third fight in Las Vegas in June 1996. The
referee stopped the fight in the sixth round after Leija suffered a
deep cut on his right eyelid.
	   This time may be the final time the two fight each other.
	   ``Unless something crazy happens,'' Leija said. ``Like another
draw.''

<TEXT>
	   LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Defending champion Germany got off
to an impressive start Friday in this season's final World Cup
regatta, qualifying sixteen boats for the next round.
	   Britain, just behind Germany in the overall standings, and
Australia qualified nine boats each for Saturday's semifinals on
the Rotsee course in Lucerne.
	   Britain's world champion men's coxless four, which includes
Atlanta Olympics gold medallists Steve Redgrave and Matt Pinsent,
won its heat comfortably although in a slower time than Romania and
Australia, the other heat winners.
	   The crew had Tim Foster fit again after recovering from a
serious hand injury. Australia won the event at the last regatta in
Brussels last month, helping it to win the event overall.
	   Following the Brussels event, the second of three World Cup
regattas, Germany tops the overall standings with 87 points, just
five points ahead of Britain. Denmark is third with 63.
	   In the individual events, Switzerland's 1996 Olympic champion
Xeno Mueller and World Cup leader Ali Ibrahim Ali of Egypt were
among those to qualify directly for the semifinals.
	   In Brussels Mueller, competing in his first event after a year

Indonesia asks US help in seeking billions more in aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Indonesia is asking the United States for help
in securing an additional dlrs 4 billion to dlrs 6 billion in
international aid to combat the Asian nation's worst financial
crisis in 30 years.
	   Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's senior economics minister,
said he had discussed with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin a U.S.
contribution to a possible package the International Monetary Fund
is arranging for Indonesia. Kartasasmita would not mention any
figures, however.
	   ``The United States has been very supportive'' of Indonesia,
Ginandjar said. ``Of course, we would like to see it translated
into concrete terms. ... The United States plays a major role in
the IMF.''
	   Pressed by reporters to provide specifics, Ginandjar said, ``The
IMF is coordinating the effort to get the sources together. I was
reassured they were developing in the right direction.''
	   Ginandjar said he expected the IMF to release dlrs 1 billion
more in aid to the country next week and to announce details of the
supplementary dlrs 4 billion to dlrs 6 billion package. Indonesia,
the world's fourth most populous nation, already has obtained a
dlrs 43 billion IMF bailout.
	   He also said disputed reports from Jakarta that the IMF release
of the dlrs 1 billion installment was contingent on an ally of
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie being elected chairman of the
ruling Golkar party. The party is expected to elect a new leader
this weekend.
	   Ginandjar spoke to reporters after two days of meetings with
high-level U.S., IMF and World Bank officials. He also held talks
this week with bankers in New York about rescheduling a portion of
dlrs 64 billion to dlrs 66 billion in private debt owed by
Indonesian corporations.
	   Ginandjar said similar repackaging talks would take place next
week in Frankfurt, Paris, Tokyo, Singapore and Seoul, South Korea.
	   The Indonesian government also has dlrs 50 billion in debt and
Ginandjar said rescheduling that burden might help resolve
Indonesia's financial difficulties.
	   ``It is an option,'' he said. ``It could be part of a
solution.''
	   Ginandjar said the government has had no problems in meeting its
debt obligation, which has always been a priority.
	   Indonesia expects its economy to contract by 13 percent to 15
percent this year, the first time the economy has shrunk since
1963. The country's currency, the rupiah, has lost 80 percent of
its value against the dollar.
	   Ginandjar said he expected the economy to post a zero growth
rate in 1999 and ``modest growth'' in 2000.
	   He said 80 million people, or 40 percent of the population, are
expected to slip below the poverty line, compared with to the 22
million, or 11 percent, before the crisis began. To alleviate
suffering, he said, the government was placing emphasis on social
programs such as food subsidies.

serious hand injury. Australia won the event at the last regatta in
Brussels last month, helping it to win the event overall.
	   Following the Brussels event, the second of three World Cup
regattas, Germany tops the overall standings with 87 points, just
five points ahead of Britain. Denmark is third with 63.
	   In the individual events, Switzerland's 1996 Olympic champion
Xeno Mueller and World Cup leader Ali Ibrahim Ali of Egypt were
among those to qualify directly for the semifinals.
	   Mueller, competing in his first event after a year off studying
in the United States, won the final by more than a length in front
of the Egyptian.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Police foiled a bombing attack in London on Friday
and arrested 10 people in a joint British-Irish operation against
militants opposed to the Northern Ireland peace agreement, Scotland
Yard said.
	   Six arrests in London followed raids by police in Dublin,
Wexford and Dundalk, all in the Republic of Ireland, where four
arrests were made, authorities said.
	   There was no immediate indication of the targets, but Deputy
Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, head of Scotland's Yard's
anti-terrorist branch, said three men arrested in London had
explosive devices that were intended to be used ``within minutes.''
	   A fourth person _ a woman _ was arrested later near Oxford
Street, one of the capital's busiest shopping districts, police
said.
	   Another man and a woman were arrested near the new
multimillion-pound (dollar) British Library, Scotland Yard said.
	   All six were taken to a London police station for questioning.
	   Police have warned that a real threat to April's peace agreement
remains from splinter groups that do not recognize the cease-fires
called by Northern Ireland's major paramilitary groups.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, congratulated the authorities Friday after the
arrests. Ahern added that his government ``will continue to
underpin the peace process by tackling the terrorist threat from
whatever source.''
	   ``This evening's arrests are the result of prolonged
investigation into dissident criminal Irish republican terrorist
groups,'' Grieve said in a statement from Scotland Yard.
	   The surveillance operation by London's Metropolitan Police and
MI5, the British internal intelligence agency, had thwarted ``an
imminent planned terrorist attack in London,'' he added.
	   Scotland Yard would not say how many devices had been found, or
state their intended targets.
	   No shots were fired and no one was injured during the operation.
	   The Irish police operation targeted hardline organizations
determined to thwart the peace accord, which sets up a new Assembly
in the province with power-sharing between Catholics and
Protestants.
	   In Dundalk, 5 miles (8 km) south of the Northern Ireland border,
police said they uncovered two shotguns, bomb components and false
documents in an apartment and arrested one man.
	   A woman and another man were picked up in Dublin. A fourth
arrest was made in Wexford.
	   The Irish police operation had been under way for some months,
authorities said. Information uncovered there prompted Irish police
to contact their London counterparts and led to the arrests here by
anti-terrorist officers.
	   Irish Republican Army dissidents have rejected the peace
agreement, even though the IRA called a truce in July 1997 and the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party was one of the eight political parties
that took part in the negotiations.
	   They have said they will settle for nothing short of a union
between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, with the British
relinquishing any oversight of the province.

Experience fights back heading into British Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ If the young guns of golf want to make
inroads this year, it will have to start at the game's oldest
championship.
	   When Justin Leonard celebrated his British Open victory last
year in Generation X fashion _ sharing a pizza with friends on the
17th green of Royal Troon under the glow of a Scottish night _ it
signaled a changing of the guard:
	   _ Tiger Woods, just three months past the legal drinking age,
who was crowned the youngest Masters champion ever.
	   _ Ernie Els, a two-time U.S. Open winner and still only 27.
	   _ And Leonard, at 25 playing with the concentration of Ben Hogan
in his prime.
	   One year later, the old guard is fighting back.
	   ``The old guys never went anywhere,'' said Tom Lehman, the
British Open champion and PGA player of the year in 1996, who turns
40 next year. ``It's just that the younger guys played a little
better last year.''
	   Chalk two up to experience.
	   Woods put the green jacket on 41-year-old Mark O'Meara at the
Masters. At The Olympic Club last month, nine-year veteran Lee
Janzen outdueled 41-year-old Payne Stewart at the U.S. Open.
	   Fred Couples, 38, let the Masters and the Byron Nelson Classic
slip away, but still has two PGA Tour victories and is enjoying his
best year since 1992.
	   John Cook and Scott Simpson, both in their 40s, also have won
this year. And don't count out Tom Watson, the five-time British
Open champion who showed at Colonial that he still has what it
takes to win at age 48.
	   ``I still believe that I can swing the golf club and hit the
ball straight,'' Watson said. ``I just hope that I can continue to
play the way I am playing, and make the decision about whether to
play the Senior Tour very difficult.''
	   The juniors have not exactly disappeared. Els, Woods and Leonard
have all won this year, but the only 20-something player who has
been a threat every time he tees it up is David Duval, a two-time
winner who finished a stroke behind O'Meara at the Masters.
	   ``There are so many good players now in the world, and a lot of
them happen to be young,'' O'Meara said. ``But the fact is, I've
actually played some of my best golf over the last three or four
years. Tom Watson has been playing some extremely good golf.
	   ``And I have said this before,'' he continued. ``The golf ball
is sitting out there on the ground. It really doesn't know how old
you are. It just kind of sits there, waiting to be struck. That's
what makes this game so special.''
	   And that's what could make the 127th British Open one for the
ages.
	   The Open returns this week to Royal Birkdale, a course where
virtually every hole is framed by sand dunes _ great for the
gallery, but grueling for the world's best players trying to gauge
the wind blowing in from the Irish Sea.
	   The fact that 14 players have won the last 14 majors speaks of
the depth in golf, especially with the emergence of so many young
players. But Generation X has not been as forceful this year _ the
30-and-over set has won 19 of 25 PGA Tour events.
	   Woods, the first dlrs 2 million player, has been in the 60s only
11 times in 36 rounds since the Florida swing began in March. Three
of those rounds came at the BellSouth Classic, his lone victory in
America this year and the only time he has been in Sunday
contention since Bay Hill.
	   ``I've been right there _ haven't been able to get over the
hump,'' Woods said. ``I think this second half of the year will be
better than it was last year. I'm playing better than I was at this
time. So, maybe I can carry that over, because last year I didn't
win at all'' after the Western Open.
	   Els was primed for a big year until he hurt his back at the
Buick Classic the week before the U.S. Open. He decided not to play
Loch Lomond before the British Open to give his back more rest.
	   Jim Furyk has 21 top-10 finishes in the past 18 months, best on
the PGA Tour, but he still hasn't won a tournament since the
Hawaiian Open in February 1996. Phil Mickelson has a victory in
each of the last six years _ the longest streak on tour _ but
hasn't contended in a major since he flamed out at the PGA
Championship two years ago.
	   Leonard, trying to become the first champion to repeat since
Watson in 1983 at Royal Birkdale, has only cracked the top five in
two tournaments this year, but one of those was a five-stroke
comeback at The Players Championship, more proof that he can raise
his game at the biggest events.
	   Except for the U.S. Open, where he has never finished higher
than 36th, the last time Leonard finished outside the top 10 in a
major was at the 1996 British Open.

History of previous British Opens at Royal Birkdale
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   A capsule look at the seven previous British Open championships
played at Royal Birkdale:
	   1954
	   Royal Birkdale was supposed to be the Open venue in 1940 until
World War II intervened.
	   Ben Hogan, who won his only Open in 1953 at Carnoustie, decided
against a Transatlantic trip to defend his title, but Peter Thomson
of Australian fast became a favorite.
	   Thomson was runner-up the past two years _ to Bobby Locke in
1952, and he joined Dai Rees, Antonio Cerda and Frank Stranahan in
finishing four strokes behind Hogan a year later.
	   Thomson finished at 283 for a one-stroke victory over Rees,
Locke and Sidney Scott. It was the first of three straight Open
championships for Thomson, the first to do that since Bob Ferguson
from 1880-82.
	   1961
	   A year after Arnold Palmer made his debut in the British Isles
with a runner-up finish at St. Andrews, he helped to re-establish
the importance of golf's oldest championship by winning at
Birkdale.
	   It wasn't easy.
	   The wind blew so hard in the first round that it toppled most of
the tented village. If that wasn't enough, Palmer called a penalty
stroke on himself when his ball, unseen by others, moved in a
bunker.
	   He won the tournament on the 16th hole, where a plaque
commemorates the kind of shot that defined Palmer's career. His
ball buried in the willow scrub and buckthorn, he lashed at it with
a 6-iron and flew the ball to the green, where he saved par.
	   He finished with a 284 and a one-stroke victory over Dai Rees,
who birdied three of the last four holes but had to settle for his
second runner-up finish at Birkdale.
	   1965
	   Americans were coming over to the British Open in droves when it
returned to Birkdale four years later, but the stage again belonged
to Peter Thomson of Australia.
	   Thomson won his fifth Open in a span of 12 years, joining James
Braid and J.H. Taylor with five titles, one behind the record six
of Harry Vardon.
	   The 35-year-old Thomson took control with a 68 in the second
round and went on to finish with a 285 and a two-stroke victory
over Brian Huggett and Christy O'Connor Jr.
	   Thomson's main concern was Tony Lema, the defending champion.
Lema was just one stroke back with five holes to play, but took
bogey on the last two holes and wound up tied for fifth. Lema died
the next year in a plane crash.
	   1971
	   At the 100th championship, Lee Trevino became only the fourth
player to win the U.S. Open and British Open in the same year.
	   It was the first of consecutive British Open titles for the
Merry Mex, and his finish proved that no lead is safe at Birkdale.
Leading by three strokes with two holes to play, Trevino got caught
in the sand hills along the par-5 17th and wound up with a double
bogey.
	   But Lu Liang Huan of Taiwan, fondly christened ``Mr. Lu'' by the
British gallery, could not take advantage of Trevino's slip.
Trevino managed to par the 18th for a 278 and a one-stroke victory.
	   1976
	   Johnny Miller won his second major with another brilliant
finish. Trailing by two strokes going into the final round, he
closed with a 66, the lowest closing round by a British Open
champion at the time.
	   It was reminiscent of his final-round 63 that won him the U.S.
Open at Oakmont three years earlier.
	   Miller had a 279 for a six-stroke victory over Jack Nicklaus and
a 19-year-old Spaniard named Severiano Ballesteros.
	   Ballesteros opened with rounds of 69-69-73 for the lead, but
Miller's steady play gave him the lead at the turn. Ballesteros
took a triple bogey out of the gorse on No. 11, and Miller coasted
home.
	   Still, Ballesteros gave the gallery something to anticipate with
his booming drives and deft touch. He finished with a birdie by
hitting an incredible bump-and-run between two bunkers on the 18th.
	   1983
	   This Open is remembered as much for Tom Watson's 2-iron as Hale
Irwin's whiff from 3 inches (7.6 cms)
	   Watson became the first American to win five British Opens by
finishing with a 275 and a one-stroke victory over Irwin and Andy
Bean. He remains the only man to win the Open at five venues.
	   Irwin was trying to stay in the hunt in the third round when he
gave himself a 25-foot (7.5-meter) birdie putt from below the hole
on the 14th green. The putt turned away at the last second and
Irwin tried to backhand it in. The putter bounced on the green and
hopped over the ball for a bogey.
	   Irwin could only hope the lost stroke did not come back to haunt
him. It did, but it required one of the greatest shots under
pressure in Watson's remarkable career.
	   Watson had 213 yards (194 meters) into the wind to the 18th
green on Sunday, needing par to win. He hit a 2-iron safely on and
two-putted for victory.
	   ``I'll take that shot to the grave,'' Watson said.
	   With the win, Watson became the last player to defend a British
Open title.
	   1991
	   The Aussies ruled at Birkdale once again, only it wasn't Greg
Norman. Ian Baker-Finch stormed into a share of the third-round
lead with Mark O'Meara with a 64. He then played one of the best
front nines by a leader in a major championship.
	   With five birdies on the first seven holes, Baker-Finch went out
in 29 to seize control over O'Meara and closed with a 66 for 272,
two strokes ahead of fellow Australian Mike Harwood.
	   Baker-Finch's 130 on the weekend tied the record for lowest
final two rounds by a champion, first set by Tom Watson at
Turnberry in 1977.
	   His biggest threat turned out to be Fred Couples, who started
the last round five strokes back. Couples made the turn in 32, then
birdied the next four holes to get to within range.
	   But with two par 5s among the last four holes, Couples could do
no better than par. He settled for a 64 and finished third, tied
with O'Meara.

Protesters attack prime minister's car as parliament opens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUGGIE JOSEPH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ Protesters seething over last
month's election attacked cars carrying St. Vincent and the
Grenadines' prime minister and finance minister as they left the
opening session of the legislature.
	   Supporters of the opposition Unity Labor Party, which claims the
June 15 vote was fraudulent, surrounded the cars and pounded their
fists on the roofs as Prime Minister James Mitchell and Finance
Minister Arnhim Eustace tried to drive through Thursday night.
	   They hurled bottles at Eustace's car, damaging the fender and
smashing the windows of a nearby vehicle. One man lay on the ground
to prevent Eustace from moving forward.
	   A police officer fired his gun in the air to scatter the crowd,
and another hauled the protester out of the car's way.
	   The protesters claim Mitchell's New Democratic party rigged the
elections in this archipelago in the southeast Caribbean.
	   The opposition party won 4,300 more votes than Mitchell's New
Democratic Party _ almost a 10 percent margin _ but Mitchell's
party won more districts to secure an 8-7 majority in the House of
Assembly. Mitchell has denied accusations of fraud.
	   Opposition supporters also opposed the election of Nolwyn
McDowall as House Speaker. McDowall lost in his district in the
June election, but Mitchell nominated him to the post anyway. The
speaker manages the legislature's work but has no vote.
	   Labor Party lawmakers refused to stand for McDowall when he
entered Parliament Thursday, as is traditional.
	   ``He was a person who was just defeated at the polls, and to
appoint him speaker immediately following the elections is a
cynical manipulation of the democratic institution of the state,''
said Ralph Gonsalves, deputy leader of the opposition.
	   Mitchell also appointed two other losing candidates to Cabinet
posts: health minister Sinclair Thomas and attorney general Carl
Joseph. They joined the House of Assembly as senators, who are
appointed by the parties.
	   With unemployment at 45 percent, the Unity Labor Party had seen
the elections as the best chance in years to unseat Mitchell, who
has been prime minister since 1984.

Brazil goes asks World Trade Organization to look into aircraft
</HEADLINE>
dispute

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil has asked the World Trade
Organization to look into what it says are illegal Canadian export
subsidies for its aircraft industry, the Foreign Ministry said
Friday.
	   The move follows a similar announcement by the Canadian
government asking the WTO to look into illegal subsidies for
Brazilian aircraft industries.
	   The dispute between the Canada's Bombardier Inc. and the
Brazilian airplane manufacturer Embraer began in December 1997,
after the Canadian company announced it would purchase training
planes from Raytheon Aircraft of the United States.
	   Embraer said it was about to sign a dlrs 90 million contract to
sell 24 of its Tucano planes to Bombardier. The Raytheon contract
prompted Brazil to announce it would reconsider all projects of
interest to Canada's aeronautical industry.
	   Brazilian and Canadian government officials vowed to resolve the
dispute through diplomatic channels, but talks broke down earlier
this week.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Police foiled a bombing attack in London on Friday
and arrested 10 people in a joint British-Irish operation against
IRA splinter groups opposed to the Northern Ireland peace
agreement, Scotland Yard said.
	   Six arrests in London followed raids by police in Dublin,
Wexford and Dundalk, all in the Republic of Ireland, where four
arrests were made, authorities said.
	   There was no immediate indication of the targets, but Deputy
Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, head of Scotland's Yard's
anti-terrorist branch, said three men arrested in London had
explosive devices that were intended to be used ``within minutes.''
	   Two of them were arrested near university buildings in Elephant
and Castle, a district south of the River Thames. The third was
arrested in central London near University College, part of London
University.
	   A fourth person _ a woman _ was arrested later near Oxford
Street, one of the capital's busiest shopping districts, police
said.
	   Another man and a woman were arrested near the new
multimillion-pound (dollar) British Library, near King's Cross rail
station, Scotland Yard said.
	   All six were taken to London police stations for questioning.
	   Police have warned that a real threat to April's peace agreement
remains from splinter groups that do not recognize the cease-fires
called by Northern Ireland's major paramilitary groups.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, congratulated the authorities Friday after the
arrests. Ahern added that his government ``will continue to
underpin the peace process by tackling the terrorist threat from
whatever source.''
	   ``This evening's arrests are the result of prolonged
investigation into dissident criminal Irish republican terrorist
groups,'' Grieve said in a statement from Scotland Yard.
	   The surveillance operation by London's Metropolitan Police and
MI5, the British internal intelligence agency, had thwarted ``an
imminent planned terrorist attack in London,'' he added.
	   Scotland Yard would not say how many devices had been found, or
state their intended targets.
	   No shots were fired and no one was injured during the operation.
	   The Irish police operation targeted hardline organizations
determined to thwart the peace accord, which sets up a new Assembly
in the province with power-sharing between Catholics and
Protestants.
	   In Dundalk, 5 miles (8 km) south of the Northern Ireland border,
police said they uncovered two shotguns, bomb components and false
documents in an apartment and arrested one man.
	   A woman and another man were picked up in Dublin. A fourth
arrest was made in Wexford.
	   The Irish police operation had been under way for some months,
authorities said. Information uncovered there prompted Irish police
to contact their London counterparts and led to the arrests here by
anti-terrorist officers.
	   Irish Republican Army dissidents have rejected the peace
agreement, even though the IRA called a truce in July 1997 and the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party was one of the eight political parties
that took part in the negotiations.
	   They have said they will settle for nothing short of a union
between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, with the British
relinquishing any oversight of the province.
	   Republican dissidents have mainly attacked in Northern Ireland,
although Irish police intercepted a car packed with explosives just
before it was to board a ferry to Britain in April.
	   The Irish Republican Army had often struck in London _ sometimes
with small bombs or incendiary devices, and occasionally with large
and devastating bombs.
	   Witnesses to Friday's arrests south of the River Thames said
police descended on the area brandishing guns and arrested the two
men within yards of each other outside a local supermarket.
	   Ann-Marie Wholey, 14, said she didn't realize at first that the
armed men who suddenly leapt from cars were police.
	   ``I saw them yell at a studenty-looking man, who was carrying a
rucksack, `Put the bag on the floor!' When he did that they shouted
`Get down on the floor! Get down on the floor!''' she said.
	   Her grandmother, Rosemary Wholey, saw one arrest when she came
out of her house.
	   ``There were police everywhere, it was a mad sight,'' she said.
``Two police cars raced down the road outside my house and both
crashed, one into a barrier, the police
	   were in such a hurry.''

Ambassador says Dutch drug charges rooted in politics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Dutch drug charges against
Suriname's former dictator are rooted in political differences,
Suriname's ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago claimed Friday.
	   Interpol wants former leader Desire Bouterse on Dutch cocaine
smuggling charges, and the Netherlands asked Trinidadian officials
to nab him Thursday as he visited the Caribbean country.
	   Trinidad and Tobago refused, saying it had not been asked by
Interpol to intervene. Bouterse hurriedly left the country.
	   During a news conference Friday in Port-of-Spain, Ambassador
Harvey Naarendorp said the Dutch were angry over Bouterse's
attempts to make the former Dutch colony of Suriname less dependent
on Europe.
	   ``The Dutch are known to be good international businessmen, but
they have been bad at decolonizing, whether it be in Suriname,
Indonesia or Papua New Guinea,'' Naarendorp said. ``We believe the
charges against Bouterse are yet another attempt to criminalize the
leaders of Suriname.''
	   Bouterse seized control of Suriname during a coup in 1980, five
years after the country won independence. Dutch officials suspended
aid programs after 15 of his political opponents were executed.
	   He resigned after elections in 1987, but remains a political
power broker.
	   The government of Surinamese President Jules Wijdenbosch, a
political ally, has shielded Bouterse from arrest. On July 1,
Wijdenbosch awarded him the country's highest honor, the Honor
Order of the Yellow Star.
	   Wijdenbosch has come under pressure to resign as the country's
economy continues to slide. He said Wednesday he will not step
down.

Vasser takes provional pole at Cleveland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ For a while Friday, Jimmy Vasser's crew was
lost, unable to figure out a way to get real speed out of his
Honda-powered Reynard.
	   There was no give-up in his Target-Chip Ganassi crew, though.
Doing a little guessing and hoping, along with a lot of work, they
helped put Vasser on the provisional pole for Sunday's Medic Drug
Grand Prix of Cleveland.
	   ``We had some major problems in the morning (practice),'' Vasser
said after grabbing the top spot in the first round of time trials
with a record-setting lap of 134.385 mph (215.016 kmph). ``We came
here with a (chassis) set-up not very conducive to the circuit.
	   ``We destroyed the tires in the morning and knew we were in
trouble.''
	   So Vasser's crew looked for help from his teammate, CART FedEx
Series champion and defending race winner Alex Zanardi.
	   ``We took most of what he was doing, some of what we were doing,
just threw it at the car and it was fantastic,'' Vasser said.
	   The fast lap, which broke Zanardi's record of 133.048, set last
year on the 2.106-mile (3.37-km), 10-turn Burke Lakefront Airport
road course, came on Vasser's last lap. It knocked Bryan Herta's
133.181 off the top spot.
	   ``I got a front row seat for that one,'' said Herta, who drives
a Reynard-Ford. ``I was following him on that lap. He was inching
away from me pretty good and I thought, `I'm on a good lap and he's
pulling away. That's going to be a good one.' It was.''
	   CART officials used orange safety cones on some areas of the
course to keep the drivers from short-cutting the corners. But some
of the cones were scattered onto the track.
	   ``There were a couple of them right in the racing line,'' Vasser
said. ``One was in a particularly bad spot, a very fast place. You
had to keep tiptoeing around it. But, my last lap, I put one
together and, lo and behold, that one cone was gone right in a
place where you can make up some speed.''
	   Both the drivers on the provisional front row said they expect
speeds to climb even more Saturday in the final round of
qualifying.
	   If Vasser can hold the top position, it will be his sixth career
pole and first road course pole since leading qualifying in
Cleveland in 1996.
	   Dario Franchitti was third at 132.990 (212.784), with Zanardi _
the current series points leader and winner of two straight races
and three of the past four _ next at 132.936 (212.697). Both were
in Reynard-Hondas.
	   Mark Blundell was fifth, followed by Paul Tracy, Michael
Andretti, Mauricio Gugelmin and Gil de Ferran.
	   De Ferran, who won here in 1996 and finished second to Zanardi
last year, was one of the favorites to lead Friday's qualifying,
but had problems with a sticking throttle cable.
	   Cars on Firestone tires dominated the session, taking the top
six positions and 11 of the top 14. Goodyear's fastest entry was
Andretti.
	   ``I can get maybe another tenth (of a second) out of the car,
but that's it,'' said Andretti, the 1991 Cleveland winner.
``Everything was perfect with the car, so I don't know what else we
can do.
	   ``The track will get quicker tomorrow, and so will everyone
else. I hope we can come up with more than a tenth of a second or
we will be farther back than seventh.''

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico will begin formal negotiations toward
a free trade agreement with the European Union at a meeting next
week in Brussels.
	   The Mexican delegation, including secretaries Herminio Blanco of
Commerce and Rosario Green of Foreign Affairs, will meet members of
the European Commission in the Belgian capital on Tuesday, a
government source, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said Friday.
	   Blanco, accompanied by other trade officials, will head the
talks.
	   Tuesday's meeting will be the first of the joint Mexico-E.U.
commission responsible for the free trade negotiations.
	   Mexico, a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement with
Canada and the United States, signed an economic and political
cooperation accord with the European Union last December _ an
interim agreement ahead of formal free trade talks.
	   The European Union is Mexico's second-largest trading partner
after the United States, and Mexico's second largest source of
direct foreign investment.
	   Bilateral trade in 1997 totaled dlrs 14 billion.

Zanardi still negotiating ride for 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Rumors that Alex Zanardi has signed a two-year
contract with the Williams Formula One team are premature,
according to the defending CART FedEx Series champion.
	   The story heated up again Friday when a radio station in England
reported that Zanardi had made his much-anticipated decision.
	   Zanardi, in the final year of a three-year contract with
Target-Chip Ganassi Racing, is leading the PPG Cup championship
again heading into Sunday's Medic Drug Grand Prix of Cleveland.
	   ``It is true I am talking to some teams (in Formula One),''
Zanardi said, ``but nothing is done and will probably not be done
until people will say, `OK, Alex, this is it, take it or leave it.'
Then I will make up my mind.''
	   Zanardi raced with the non-competitive Lotus team in Formula One
before coming to CART. Since moving to the Champ cars in 1996, he
has won rookie of the year honors and the series title, as well as
12 races _ four this year.
	   He said the decision would be made soon.
	   ``I think both Chip and I know we cannot drag this out too far,
like late September or October,'' Zanardi said. ``That would be
painful for both of us.
	   ``One thing I have decided, if I stay in the U.S. it will be
with this team.''
	   Zanardi would not confirm which team or teams he was negotiating
with in Formula One, although he did say, ``Even to be associated
in such reports with the Williams team, which has won championships
and is such an important team, is an honor.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CLEAR RUNWAY: &LR;  The Cleveland race, which has been run every
year since 1982 on the downtown Burke Lakefront Airport, has
received clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration for
five more years.
	   That's a big step for the Cleveland-based International
Management Group, which promotes the race, because the FAA has been
reluctant in the past to give such longterm extensions.
	   This is the final year of a three-year agreement with the FAA,
which previously gave permission to hold the race at an active
airport only on a year-to-year basis.
	   IMG's current contract with CART runs through 1999.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ANDRETTI LUCK: &LR;  Michael Andretti is in the midst of a
frustrating season.
	   Since winning the season-opener at Homestead, Andretti has
managed only three top-10s _ a fifth, second and 10th _ in the last
eight races, failing to finish most of the others because of
accident or mechanical problems.
	   ``We need to change our luck in Cleveland this year,'' Andretti
said. ``I basically had one good year (winning in 1991), and the
rest have been disappointing.
	   ``We want to not only change our luck at Cleveland, but also our
luck for this season. We need to finish a race. If we do, I think
we'll be in good shape.''
	   Andretti was seventh-fastest in Friday's provisional qualifying.

Annan backs off US lobbying effort, says US arrears in Washington's
</HEADLINE>
hands &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief warned Friday that
Washington's failure to pay back dues and the resulting loss of its
General Assembly vote would shock Americans and make relations with
the world body even more acrimonious.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has lobbied U.S. politicians,
businessmen and celebrities alike to get the United States to pay
its dues, said Friday he had recently scaled back contacts with
Washington, fearing that his intervention might worsen the
situation.
	   ``But quite frankly, this is an issue that is in the hands of
the U.S.,'' Annan said at a news conference. ``They know the rules,
they know how much is required of them, they know how much they
have to pay in order not to lose their vote.
	   ``And I hope that the right thing will be done, and that we will
not get into a situation like that _ which would make the U.N.-U.S.
relationship even much more acrimonious.''
	   Last year, the Senate approved a bill to pay most of the U.S.
debt, which the United Nations estimates at about dlrs 1.3 billion.
But House conservatives tacked on anti-abortion language which
Clinton refused to accept.
	   A second bill was approved this year, containing weakened
anti-abortion language. But Clinton has threatened to veto the
measure, which Congress has not yet sent to the White House.
	   U.N. diplomats say the failure to resolve the debt issue has
encumbered American efforts to build support for U.S. foreign
policy goals within the United Nations.
	   Washington could lose its vote in the General Assembly if it
doesn't pay between dlrs 211 million and dlrs 241 million by Dec.
31, according to a June report by the U.S. Congress watchdog arm,
the General Accounting Office.
	   ``I'm sure, some members of Congress, and I suspect many
Americans and ordinary citizens will be shocked that the U.S. finds
itself in that situation,'' Annan said.
	   Since he was chosen U.N. chief, Annan has lobbied to get the
United States to pay by enacting an institution-wide reform plan
that Congress had said was a condition to getting the U.S. arrears.
	   With Congress still not budging, however, Annan has courted to
the financial and entertainment industry to press the case that the
United Nations matters and deserves U.S. support.
	   ``You have a voice,'' Annan told a Los Angeles audience that
included Jacqueline Bisset, James Woods and Tony Curtis this past
April. ``Through your trade, through your profession, work with us,
individually and collectively. Speak up.''
	   This week, he met with executives of 40 major U.S. companies,
including American Express, Exxon and Time Warner Inc., to court
support for U.N. initiatives at a conference here by the Business
Council for International Understanding.
	   Annan said his last discussion with Clinton on the matter was
during the June 8-11 U.N. drug conference, and said he had no
indication that Clinton would change his mind about vetoing the
latest bill from Congress.
	   ``I think the president's position on a bill with an amendment
with the unrelated domestic issue amendment attached to it is very
clear,'' Annan said. ``And he did not given me any indication that
he has shifted from that position.''

Eagle helps Morgan take two-stroke lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DEARBORN, Michigan (AP) _ Hot putter. Memorable wedge. Gil
Morgan used both to forge a two-stroke lead over his biggest rival
in the Senior Players Championship on Friday.
	   Morgan, who eagled the 10th hole, shot an 8-under-par 64 in the
second round for a 133. That earned him a third-round pairing with
Hale Irwin, who shot 69 for 135 at the TPC of Michigan.
	   Jack Nicklaus, who designed the 6,876-yard (6,257-meter) layout
in the shadow of sponsor Ford Motor Co.'s world headquarters, shot
70 to tie Jim Albus at 137. Albus shot 69.
	   ``Yesterday, I played at a pretty high level, tee to green,''
Morgan said. ``Today, I played a little better and putted better.''
	   Morgan and Irwin are easily the hottest players on the senior
circuit. Each has won three times and they rank 1-2 on the money
list. Irwin, who finished second in the State Farm Senior Classic
last week, has earned dlrs 1.3 million, about dlrs 300,000 more
than Morgan.
	   ``Usually, if you play with Gil on the weekend, you're playing
pretty well,'' Irwin said. ``So, I'm happy to be playing with
Gil.''
	   Morgan, who was three strokes off the lead after an opening 69,
birdied five of the first eight holes. His only bogey was at No. 9
where he hit a tree with an errant approach, then two-putted from
45 feet (13 1/2 meters).
	   But he more than made up for that mistake when he holed his
approach for an eagle-2 at the next hole.
	   ``I hit an intermediate wedge from 110 yards out,'' Morgan said.
``The ball hit about six feet from the pin, bounced twice and dove
in the hole.''
	   Morgan, who has nine top-10 finishes in 13 starts this season,
made successive birdies at Nos. 12 and 13 to go 11-under and made
it hold up the rest of the way under almost perfect playing
conditions.
	   ``It was kind of funny, because I really didn't look at the
scoreboard until I made a couple of birdies,'' Morgan said.
``Starting about No. 6, I looked and saw that Jack was still one
shot ahead of me. He was going pretty strong.
	   ``So, I thought, `Just keep plugging along here.'''
	   Irwin, who shared the first-round lead with John Jacobs at 66,
was tied for the lead with Morgan at 9-under through 11 holes.
Irwin, who made his first bogey at No. 12, rebounded with an
eagle-3 at the 13th.
	   But the damage was done. Morgan had gone 11-under and Irwin
stumbled once more with a bogey at the difficult 17th, a par-5
where players must carry a long pond to a narrow, difficult green.
	   ``I hit it just in the right rough on the left and I played a
4-wood out of there,'' Irwin said. ``I just hit a nice, classic top
shot. Went in the water. Stuff happens.''
	   Nicklaus, whose streak of 154 majors will end when he skips the
British Open next week, continued his strong play despite an ailing
left hip. Nicklaus, at 58, was looking like the Golden Bear of old
and shared the lead with Irwin at 8-under after nine holes.
	   Nicklaus got to 9-under with a birdie at No. 13, but bogeyed
Nos. 14 and 16.
	   ``I felt pretty good,'' Nicklaus said. ``But with me, it's
compared with what? With me, you never know. So far this week, the
hip has been pretty good.
	   ``It certainly never bothered me hitting a golf shot, and that's
all you can ask for.''
	   Players who weren't making lots of birdies were losing ground.
Jose Maria Canizares, who was two strokes off the lead with an
opening 68, was still 4-under but far back at 140 after an even-par
72 Friday.
	   Jacobs fell out of the lead fast and hard.
	   Jacobs, who claimed his first pro victory with a one-stroke
victory over Irwin in the Nationwide Championship in June, went
triple-bogey, double-bogey, bogey to open the second round. He was
40 at the turn and gone from the leader board.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police foiled a bombing attack in London on Friday
and arrested 10 people in a joint British-Irish operation against
IRA splinter groups opposed to the Northern Ireland peace
agreement, Scotland Yard said.
	   Six arrests in London followed raids by police in Dublin,
Wexford and Dundalk, all in the Republic of Ireland, where four
arrests were made, authorities said.
	   There was no immediate indication of the targets, but Deputy
Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, head of Scotland's Yard's
anti-terrorist branch, said three men arrested in London had
explosive devices that were intended to be used ``within minutes.''
	   Two of them were arrested near university buildings in Elephant
and Castle, a district south of the River Thames. The third was
arrested in central London near University College, part of London
University.
	   A fourth person _ a woman _ was arrested later near Oxford
Street, one of the capital's busiest shopping districts, police
said.
	   Another man and a woman were arrested near the new
multimillion-pound (dollar) British Library, near King's Cross rail
station, Scotland Yard said.
	   All six were taken to London police stations for questioning.
	   Police have warned there is a real threat to April's peace
agreement from splinter groups that do not recognize the
cease-fires called by Northern Ireland's major paramilitary groups.
	   Tensions have soared in the province in the past week as
hard-line Protestants have pushed for the right to parade through a
Catholic neighborhood in Portadown, Northern Ireland. Authorities
have barred the marchers, and the standoff has exploded into five
nights of street violence.

Pak makes LPGA history with 61
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYLVANIA, Ohio (AP) _ Se Ri Pak, bolstered by her first good
night's rest since winning the U.S. Women's Open, posted the lowest
LPGA tour score ever with a 10-under-par 61 Friday in the second
round of the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic.
	   The 20-year-old South Korean birdied five holes on each side,
wrapping up the historic round with birdies on her last three
holes. She capped the round by rolling in a 20-foot (7-meter)
birdie putt before a large and loud gallery circling the ninth
green.
	   ``Every putt was perfect right to left and left to right,'' she
said. ``Everything was perfect.''
	   Five players have shot 62s in an LPGA event, most recently
Kathryn Marshall in the second round of last year's State Farm Rail
Classic.
	   The PGA Tour record is 59, set by Al Geiberger in 1977, and
matched by Chip Beck in 1991.
	   The 61 vaulted Pak, who had an even-par 71 in the opening round
at the 6,319-yard (5,750-meter) Highland Meadows Golf Club, into
first place by two strokes over first-round co-leaders Vickie
Odegard and Dana Dormann and Hall of Famer Betsy King.
	   Pak had said after the first round that she was battling fatigue
since beating Jenny Chuasiriporn to win the Open in a 20-hole
playoff Monday. Pak won on the second sudden death hole after the
two were still tied after the original 18-hole playoff.
	   With her manager preventing calls from getting through, Pak got
9 1/2 hours' sleep Thursday night.
	   ``Last week was a really, really long week,'' Pak said. ``I
played eight days, then two holes more. I came here on Tuesday
afternoon and played six holes (in a celebrity exhibition). The
next day I played 18 holes in the pro-am. Then yesterday, my body
felt heavy. Not comfortable.''
	   The record round started without fanfare. Starting on No. 10,
she pushed her tee shot into the right rough and hit the ball into
the left greenside bunker before blasting out to a foot to salvage
par.
	   On only one other hole did she have trouble. She again avoided
trouble in the rough and a bunker at No. 1 before making a 6-foot
par putt.
	   On Nos. 11, 13 and 15, she birdied after hitting 9-irons inside
10 feet. She finished her first nine with consecutive birdies,
hitting wedges to eight feet and three feet and rolling in the
putts.
	   She made a 15-footer (4.5-meter) for birdie at No. 3, a par-4,
and followed it up with a pitching wedge to six feet for another
birdie.
	   She hit a wedge to six feet (1.8 meters) at No. 7, almost holed
a 9-iron at No. 8, par-3, before making the 3-foot (0.9-meter)
birdie putt and then dropped her last putt with a gradual right to
left break from above the hole.
	   Before playing partner Meg Mallon stepped up to her own 8-foot
(2.4-meter) birdie putt on No. 9, she offered her putter to Pak
while the gallery cracked up.
	   ``Everybody came out to see the U.S. Open champion play and they
saw some fabulous golf,'' Mallon said. ``She made every putt inside
15 feet (4.5 meters) that she needed to.''
	   The 61 was two shots better than Pak's previous low, as an
amateur two years ago. It was shot shy of the LPGA record for
strokes under par as Vicki Fergon had an 11-under 62 at the San
Jose Classic in 1984.
	   Pak's caddie Jeff ``Tree'' Cable estimated almost every one of
the putts as being longer than Pak did _ sometimes twice as long.
	   ``She just rolled the ball extremely well today,'' Cable said.
``We didn't hit it all that close. This is the best I've ever seen
her roll it.''
	   Cable said it was a case of Pak hitting her stride after the
grueling five days at the Open.
	   ``She started to come around the last three holes yesterday,''
he said. ``She was lucky to finish with a 71. Today she was the
same Se Ri Pak.''
	   Nobody else in the 144-player field shot lower than 67 in the
second round. The 61 also shattered the course record of 64 that
was matched by Dormann and Odegard in the opening round.
	   Dormann and Odegard each shot a 70 in the second round, while
King _ seeking her first victory in 15 months _ picked up her
second straight 67. All were at 8-under 134.
	   Nancy Lopez missed the cut in her third straight tournament for
the first time in her 22-year career, shooting a 70 for 143.

	   PARIS (AP) _ France hasn't won the World Cup championship _ yet
_ but fireworks bathed the Eiffel Tower Friday night, accompanied
by some vocal fireworks by the Three Tenors.
	   The tenors presented their third World Cup extravaganza against
a spectacular setting _ the floodlit Eiffel Tower. But the crowd on
the Champs de Mars field, huddled under chilly skies, was smaller
than organizers predicted: some 150,000, according to police,
rather than the 800,000 hoped for.
	   Still, the audience got what it came for: three hours of
crowd-pleasing arias, traditional songs, and a Broadway tune _
``You'll Never Walk Alone'' _ thrown in.
	   The tenors _ Jose Carreras, Luciano Pavarotti and Placido
Domingo _ were backed up by the Paris Orchestra, under the
direction of U.S. conductor James Levine. The program, kept a
strict secret before the concert, delivered such favorites as ``O
sole mio,'' but was missing a humorous number that might have
lightened the proceedings.
	   Some fans did that, though, by singing a soccer chant as the
crowd filed off the field, reminding those around them that this
is, after all, World Cup weekend.
	   The Three Tenors sang at Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles for the
1994 World Cup. Only 60,000 people attended, but the concert was
seen on television by an estimated 1.3 billion people around the
globe.
	   The trio made its debut at the 1990 World Cup, at the ancient
baths of Caracalla in Rome.
	   Beamed live to over 75 countries, Friday's concert was also
being recorded for a worldwide album release in August.
	   Most people came for free, but the seats up front cost money _
in fact, up to dlrs 1,000.
	   The tenors are big soccer fans, but their teams _ Spain for
Carreras and Domingo, Italy for Pavarotti _ have been eliminated
from the World Cup. France plays Brazil in Sunday's final.

Swedish semis for Gustafsson
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Top seed Magnus Gustafsson, aiming for an
unprecedented fourth title in the Swedish Open, advanced to the
semifinals Friday when Jerome Golmard quit because of back pain
early in the second set.
	   Gustafsson, a clay-court specialist, dropped the first set 6-7
(7-9) to his French opponent. Golmard retired after losing the
first game of the second set.
	   Gustafsson next faces compatriot Thomas Johansson. Johansson,
the No. 6 seed, edged Davide Sanguinetti of Italy 6-7 (5-7), 6-3,
7-6 (7-5) in a match completed Friday after being interrupted by
rain Thursday.
	   Johansson also was to play Morocco's Karim Alami in the quarters
Friday but moved on in a walkover. Alami hurt his right wrist in a
fall late in his match the previous day.
	   Gustafsson won this event in 1991, 1992 and 1996 and is bidding
to surpass three-time winners Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander.
	   In other quarterfinals, No. 7 Dominic Hrbaty of Slovakia ousted
Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.
	   Hrbaty on Saturday faces Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine. A top-five
player less than five years ago, Medvedev is coming back from
injuries and is now ranked No. 100.
	   Medvedev had to finish two matches Friday to make it to the
semis. He first downed Australia's Richard Fromberg, a Swedish Open
winner in 1990, 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 7-6 (7-2). In the afternoon, he
defeated No. 3 seed Andrea Gaudenzi of Italy 6-3, 6-4.
	   In doubles, South Africans Lan Bale and Piet Norval advanced to
the final by beating top-seeded Swedes Nicklas Kulti and Mikael
Tillstrom 6-4, 6-3.

Tampa Bay goaltender suspended for kicking ball into ref
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Thomas Ravelli, the goaltender for Major League
Soccer's Tampa Bay Mutiny, was suspended for six games for kicking
a ball that struck a referee following a successful penalty shot
against him.
	   Ravelli's action came in the July 4 game against the New England
Revolution after Raul Diaz Arce converted a penalty kick in the
75th minute. After the goal, the former Swedish national goaltender
ran directly at referee Ruben Rodhas and kicked the ball, which
struck Rodhas in the legs.
	   Rodhas immediately showed Ravelli a red card and sent him off.
	   The Revolution won 3-2.
	   Ravelli, who also was fined dlrs 5,000, has missed one game, a
victory over the Worcester Wildfire in the U.S. Open Cup. He will
miss another cup game as well as four MLS games.
	   He is eligible to return July 22, when the Mutiny play D.C.
United in Washington.

Stoltenberg advances to semifinal in Hall of Fame tennis
</HEADLINE>
tournament &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWPORT, Rhode Island (AP) _ Jason Stoltenberg, trying to become
the first top seed to win the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships,
moved a stepped closer Friday by thrashing seventh-seeded John Van
Lottum 6-1, 6-2 in a quarterfinal match.
	   Stoltenberg, a 28-year-old Australian, ousted the only other
seed remaining in the tournament by playing near flawless tennis.
	   ``I felt like I didn't do a thing wrong all day,'' Stoltenberg
said. ``I came out firing today.''
	   Stoltenberg won 66 percent of the points in the match and 83
percent of his service points.
	   ``He played unbelievable, said Van Lottum, a 22-year-old from
Belgium. ``I got overclassed today.''
	   Stoltenberg does not appear fazed by the Newport jinx, which has
prevented a No. 1 seed from capturing this tournament.
	   ``All things have to come to an end,'' he said.
	   Although he claims not to be superstitious, Stoltenberg did joke
that he may try to repeat his regimen so that he can play as well
in the semifinal round Saturday.
	   ``I'll eat the same stuff, sleep the same way, get out of bed
the same way and put my left shoe on first,'' he said, noting that
the only habit he really does have is putting his left shoe on
first.
	   In another quarterfinal, Neville Godwin of South Africa overcame
a match point in the second set tiebreaker to defeat Justin
Gimbelstob 6-7, 7-6, 6-3. Gimbelstob was suffering from a cramp in
his leg, which bothered him more and more as the match went on. He
needed a medical timeout when he was down 4-3 in the third set.
	   Godwin, ranked 170th on the ATP tour, will face Stoltenberg in
one semifinal match. The other will feature Leander Paes of India
against Laurence Tieleman of Belgium.
	   Paes defeated Rainier Schuttler of Germany 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 to
advance to the semifinal round of this tournament for the third
straight year. He lost to the eventual champion both times.
	   Tieleman, whose 15 career ATP victories have come on grass,
knocked out Mark Knowles 6-4, 7-5, rallying from a 4-1 deficit in
the first set.

Rights activist urges reduced pressure on Cuban government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN RICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A leading Cuban human rights activist said
Friday that the United States should pause in its pressure against
Fidel Castro's Cuba, where the number of political prisoners has
fallen sharply.
	   ``There has not been so low a level of repression in the country
for decades,'' said Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission
of Human Rights and National Reconciliation.
	   Speaking by telephone, he said Cuba should be given ``time to
organize its response'' to calls for reforms by Pope John Paul II
and other world figures, many considered friendly to the communist
government.
	   He suggested that period might extend to the end of the year.
	   Sanchez's organization is considered the most reliable
independent source of information about political prisoners within
Cuba. A former university professor, Sanchez also spent several
years in Cuban prisons for dissent.
	   His suggestion is in line with his long-standing opposition to
the U.S. economic boycott of Cuba. Many other dissidents,
especially those based in the United States, favor a stronger line
against Cuba's government.
	   One step, he said, would be to ``diminish anti-Castro rhetoric,
because in a climate of verbal hostility .... the government of
Cuba is going to take a defensive position and will not think of
reforms.''
	   Ramon Cernuda, a rights activist in Florida who works with
Sanchez, suggested lifting the ban on U.S. sales of food and
medicine, as well as considering Cuba's participation in the
Organization of American States, which has been blocked by the
United States.
	   ``We would of course expect reciprocal steps on the part of the
Cuban government,'' he said.
	   Sanchez said the commission this week released an updated list
of 381 known political prisoners in Cuba, down from 482 at the
start of the year and from more than 1,000 at the start of 1997.
	   Roughly 100 were released in response to the pope's January
visit and several others after Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien went to the island in April.
	   Sanchez said fewer than 10 people have been arrested on
political charges so far this year, though his new list includes
names of some previously unknown people already in prison.
	   ``That still remains too high, taking into account that Cuba ...
has very little internal political violence,'' he said. ``There is
no reason for there to be so many prisoners.''
	   He said the government has found that despite the reduction in
prisoners, its authority ``has not been reduced, nor has its
enormous capacity of social control.''
	   Even so, he said, ``there is no more freedom of expression in
Cuba. The authoritarian model continues intact.''

Spanish hotel chain fined for damaging Costa Rican wetlands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ A Costa Rican environmental tribunal
has fined the Spanish hotel chain Barcelo dlrs 14,000 for
destroying wetlands along the Pacific Coast and ordered the company
to halt development in the region, a lawyer said Friday.
	   Barcelo destroyed two hectares (five acres) of the fragile
ecological system near Paquera, about 250 kms (155 miles) east of
San Jose, where the hotel chain built a golf club.
	   Barcelo plans to build 200 residences at the Los Delfines club,
but environmental officials are fighting the development which they
say fails to comply with Costa Rican law.
	   The fine against Barcelo, ordered this week by an Environment
and Energy Ministry tribunal, will go toward the reforestation of
about 40 hectares (100 acres) of land as a form of environmental
compensation, said Mario Leiva, a lawyer for the ministry.

Small pipe bomb found near home of presidential candidate's father
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A small pipe bomb was found under a
car parked in front of the home of the parents of leading
presidential candidate and former coup leader Hugo Chavez, police
said Friday.
	   Juan Rodriguez, the head of Chavez's political party in Barinas
state, told police that he found the device stuck under his car
with a magnet after he had finished a meeting Thursday in the
Chavez family's home.
	   Police removed the device and no one was injured. They said no
arrests had been made and would not comment on whether they
believed the incident was politically motivated.
	   Chavez, a former Army paratrooper who led a failed 1992 coup
attempt, was not near his family's home in Barinas, 450 kilometers
(270 miles) southwest of Caracas.
	   He says he has received several death threats since rising to
the top of the opinions polls for the Dec. 6 presidential race.
	   Chavez's Fifth Republic Movement political party may name his
father as its candidate for the governor's race in Barinas state.
Critics in the party charge the move would amount to nepotism

Parliament seals truce by allowing opposition party back in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyanese lawmakers welcomed the
opposition party back into the National Assembly on Friday, sealing
a truce that ended weeks of violence in the South American country.
	   Lawmakers voted to re-admit the People's National Congress, one
month after its 25 representatives were booted from the legislature
for missing six consecutive sessions.
	   National Congress members boycotted the body, saying the Dec. 15
elections were rigged. President Janet Jagan's party won 36 of the
65 seats in Parliament.
	   The boycott was accompanied by weeks of riots and firebombings,
and a shotgun attack on protesters by police that injured 12.
	   The impasse had racial overtones. The People's National Congress
is supported mainly by people of African descent, while Jagan's
People's Progressive Party is dominated by ethnic East Indians.
	   Caribbean leaders persuaded Jagan and opposition leader Desmond
Hoyte to strike a truce during a Caribbean Community summit in St.
Lucia earlier this month.
	   ``This bill is in keeping with the Guyanese spirit of
camaraderie, warmth and cordiality,'' said Agriculture Minister
Reepu Daman Persaud, who piloted the bill into law.
	   However, members of smaller parties Alliance for Guyana and The
United Force warned that Jagan's party must begin moving toward
constitutional reform or risk more unrest.
	   ``This is going to be the start of a new assignment for the
National Assembly,'' said Manzoor Nadir, leader of the United
Force. He urged ``serious introspection'' by Jagan's party in order
to better balance governing power among the races.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks posted slim gains Friday despite an early
downturn, but the buying was hesitant with the market holding such
big gains before the impending crush of company profit reports. On
Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average finished 15.96 points
higher at 9,105.74 after recovering from a morning deficit of 60
points. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Indonesia is asking the United States for help
in securing an additional dlrs 4 billion to dlrs 6 billion in
international aid to combat the Asian nation's worst financial
crisis in 30 years. Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's senior
economics minister, said he had discussed with Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin a U.S. contribution to a possible package the
International Monetary Fund is arranging for Indonesia.
Kartasasmita would not mention any figures, however. ``The United
States has been very supportive'' of Indonesia, Ginandjar said.
``Of course, we would like to see it translated into concrete
terms. ... The United States plays a major role in the IMF.''
(IMF-INDONESIA)
	   WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) _ A high-level source at Volkswagen said
Friday there are no plans for a link-up with Swedish automaker
Volvo. Shares in both companies jumped last week following reports
that Volkswagen was interested in Volvo's truck operations and was
discussing a possible joint venture or merger. Neither company at
the time would confirm or deny a deal was in the works. Volvo said
only that the companies' chairmen met in Stockholm, but that the
routine meeting was about existing cooperation in engines and other
components. On Friday, the high-level Volkswagen source told Dow
Jones Newswires on condition of anonymity that there is ``nothing
in the pipeline'' with Volvo. Separately, Volkswagen board member
Klaus Kocks said expanding into big trucks is part of the
automaker's long-term strategy, but he again declined to comment on
any plans for a link-up with Volvo. (GERMANY-VW-VOLVO)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a blunt and gloomy report, the prime minister
warned parliament on Friday that social tension was rising in
Russia and financial markets have ``practically ceased to exist.''
Since Russia's economy began spiraling downward this year, volume
on the stock market has declined from about dlrs 110 million a day
to as little as dlrs 10 million a day. In his address to the
Federation Council, the upper house of parliament, Sergei Kiriyenko
also said the government's proposed new economic program
represented a wholesale change in economic policy. Still, the
program _ demanded by Western lending agencies _ received only a
lukewarm response from the legislators. Kiriyenko delivered his
speech as President Boris Yeltsin was beseeching Western leaders
for support. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The stock market tumbled 55 points _
hitting another all-time low _ and the beleaguered Pakistani rupee
lost 20 percent on the open market Friday. Stock brokers and
economists blamed the grim economic performance on fears that
Pakistan is on the brink of either defaulting on this month's debt
payment or seeking a moratorium. Fears were heightened following a
two-day visit to Pakistan by International Monetary Fund director
Paul Chabrier, who held a joint press conference on Thursday with
Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz. ``There is complete panic in the
market,'' said Yasin Lakhani, president of the Karachi Stock
Exchange. (PAKISTAN-ECONOMIC TURMOIL)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With investors pulling out of the Russian economy
for now, the government has extended until Oct. 27 the deadline for
bidding on the state-owned Rosneft oil company. Rosneft is the
largest oil company that has not been privatized, but the country's
financial crisis has scared away both local and foreign investors.
The government canceled one attempt to sell the company earlier
this year when no one bid the minimum asking price of dlrs 2.1
billion for a 75 percent stake in the company. The price was
lowered to dlrs 1.6 billion in early June, but there is still
little interest. Officials say they will not drop the price any
further. (RUSSIA-OIL)
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The Canadian dollar fell to another record low
Friday against the U.S. dollar, in part because of
weaker-than-expected job figures. The Canadian dollar hit an
all-time low Thursday when it closed at 67.78 U.S. cents. It opened
Friday at 67.64 cents and fell as low as 67.57 cents before closing
at 67.63 cents. Analysts linked the latest slide to June
unemployment figures that were released Friday. (CANADA-WEAK

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ With a tense and violent week
sliding into a potentially explosive weekend, Prime Minister Tony
Blair offered to arrange meetings between Protestants who want to
march through a Catholic neighborhood and Catholic residents who
oppose it. Also Friday, police foiled a bombing attack in London
and arrested 10 people during a joint British-Irish operation
against militants opposed to the Northern Ireland peace agreement,
Scotland Yard said. Six London arrests followed raids Friday by
police in the Irish Republic, where four arrests were made. The
head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch said the arrests came
during an investigation of ``dissident criminal Irish republican
terrorist groups,'' but it was unclear if the attempted bombing was
related to the conflict over the march. Authorities did not say who
the suspects allegedly were targeting. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Riot police in helmets and flak jackets
milled around the city's mosques, trying to forestall an escalation
in ethnic attacks that began soon after the death of the country's
most prominent political prisoner. Days after the death of Moshood
Abiola _ a southern ethnic Yoruba _ waves of rioting and violence
appear to be pitting Yorubas against northern Hausa Muslims. For
the third straight day Friday, youths stormed through streets in
parts of Nigeria's commercial capital, Lagos, setting fires,
smashing windows and blocking roads. The violence had ended by late
afternoon, but streets in some neighborhoods remained tense.
(NIGERIA)
	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav troops seized antitank mines
after a pair of battles with Albanian arms smugglers, in what could
signify a dangerous escalation of the fighting in Kosovo. The
soldiers said it was the first time they have found smugglers with
the powerful mines. Four smugglers were killed in the fighting.
Government and ethnic Albanian sources reported scattered clashes
Friday throughout the rebellious province, where Albanian rebels of
the Kosovo Liberation Army are fighting for independence from
Serbia, the dominant of two republics that make up the remainder of
Yugoslavia. The six-nation Contact Group, which coordinates
international policy in the Balkans, on Wednesday called for
significant autonomy but not independence for Kosovo. The group
also called for an immediate cease-fire after a meeting in Bonn,
Germany. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Senate has underscored U.S.
commitment to Taiwan in a 92-0 vote that Republicans called a
``powerful signal'' repudiating President Bill Clinton's comments
during his China trip. Democrats said Friday's resolution,
repeating a U.S. pledge to help Taiwan ``maintain a sufficient
self-defense capability,'' merely reaffirms existing law. ``Our
position has been the same before and after the president's trip to
China,'' Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said
in explaining why Democrats stampeded to support what had
originated as a largely Republican slap at Clinton. During his
recent China tour, Clinton publicly stated Washington's opposition
to Taiwanese independence, a separate Taiwan government and the
island nation's bid to join the United Nations. That brought sharp
criticism from Taiwanese leaders, who fear such a public pledge
could diminish Taiwan's efforts for more world recognition, and
from congressional conservatives. (US-CHINA)
	   ROME (AP) _ A United Nations conference has produced a draft
treaty on a world criminal court that would grant the prosecutor
sweeping authority, a measure vigorously opposed by the United
States. The draft, produced Friday, also did away with proposals to
declare the use of nuclear weapons, blinding lasers and
anti-personnel mines as war crimes. It said the court could have
jurisdiction over internal conflicts, now the major source of
crimes against humanity. The draft also allowed including state
``aggression'' as a crime _ if delegates could decide on what that
means by Monday. It came after four weeks of negotiations by more
than 150 countries to establish a permanent body to pursue the
perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.
The draft represents the consensus so far on the treaty, and it
could change. (UN-INTERNATIONAL COURT)

Marchers, Catholic opponents try talks to solve impasse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. Talks scheduled to start at 0800 GMT
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ After six nights of violence
anent of
the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of
Belfast, accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's invitation to try to
find a durable solution to a march that has sparked violence for a
third summer.
	   The violent potential of Northern Ireland's ancient sectarian
hatreds has been evident in the disorders that erupted across the
province after Orange marchers were stopped Sunday by police and
soldiers. In London on Friday, police arrested six people linked to
Irish Republican Army dissidents who allegedly prepared to plant
bombs in the city.
	   Police fired plastic bullets Friday night at Protestant
hard-liners who again tried to break through barricades around the
Drumcree Anglican church, where the Orange march was stopped
Sunday. However, the crowd on a cool and rainy night Friday was
substantially smaller than the estimated 20,000-plus of the night
before.
	   The Orangemen and their Catholic opponents won't meet directly,
but will relay proposals through intermediaries. Having failed in
similar contacts the past two years, both sides were cautious about
the prospects.
	   Breandan MacCionnaith, leader of the residents group, said, ``We
have been down this road before with proximity talks, last year and
the year before. For our part, we would view this as a small first
step toward what we would hope would be face-to-face dialogue with
the Orange Order.''
	   ``It is our objective to deliver the Portadown brethren safely
on their return down the Garvaghy Road,'' the Orange Order said in
a statement. ``We intend to establish our inalienable rights and
freedom to express our culture.''
	   The Orange Order refused to have any direct contact with the
residents group, because MacCionnaith is a former Irish Republican
Army prisoner. The order insists it has a historic right to march
on any public highway.
	   ``What we want to see is this issue resolved and resolved in a
way that is acceptable so that things can return to normal, not
just this year but every year,'' said David Trimble, newly elected
first minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly created by the
peace agreement negotiated in April.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said he was ``hopeful but no
more than hopeful. We have to try from another angle, otherwise the
alternative for all of us is too dangerous.''
	   Indirect talks were attempted in 1996 and 1997, but both times
failed to resolve the conflict over the Garvaghy Road march. In
1996, police and soldiers stopped the march but backed down after
four nights of Protestant violence across Northern Ireland. Last
year, police clubbed protesters off the road to let the Orangemen
through.
	   This year, Blair said he will enforce the decision of the new
Parades Commission that the Orangemen could not go down the
Garvaghy Road. The only way that part of the march could proceed,
Blair said, is through an agreement between marchers and residents.
	   Tensions are likely to peak this weekend with the 12th of July
holiday, the annual Protestant celebration of the defeat of
Catholic King James II by King William of Orange at the Battle of
the Boyne in 1690.
	   Hundreds of Orange marches are scheduled Monday, with the vast
majority expected to cause no trouble.

Ferrari jousts on and off track with McLaren
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Michael Schumacher does most of
Ferrari's scoring, but Eddie Irvine is the man on the point.
	   After McLaren's David Coulthard and Mika Hakkinen finished 1-2
in free practice Friday _ suggesting another big points harvest for
them in Sunday's British Grand Prix _ Irvine took aim.
	   Hakkinen leads the series standing with 50 points, followed by
Schumacher (44), Coulthard (30) and Irvine (25). But Coulthard has
scored only one point in the last three races and Hakkinen's lead
has dwindled from 22.
	   ``They (McLaren) should have been a lot further ahead than they
are,'' said Irvine, fifth in practice Friday ``They've made
strategy mistakes, reliability mistakes. Over the season, I'd put
my money on Michael.''
	   McLaren owner Ron Dennis, sitting alongside, took the hit and
shot back.
	   ``You would all be delighted if I allowed myself to get involved
in a game of verbal tennis with Eddie,'' he said, glancing at
Irvine.
	   ``I have unusual respect for Grand Prix drivers, it is a pretty
difficult task. But he's wrong. Most opinions that drivers express
are wrong.''
	   Irvine is trying to up the psychological pressure.
	   Though Coulthard's time of 1 minute 25.640 seconds _ at 216.067
kph (134.262 mph) _ was the quickest in Friday's free practice,
Saturday qualifying is where it begins to count. This is the ninth
GP of the season, and McLaren has won every pole _ five for
Hakkinen and three for Coulthard.
	   Hakkinen was second in 1:25.764 followed by Heinz-Harald
Frentzen and Jacques Villeneuve, both in Williams-Mecachromes, with
Schumacher's Ferrari in seventh.
	   Coulthard has picked up only one point in the last three races
and if he fails to win Sunday and edge closer to the top two,
McLaren may focus it resources on Hakkinen in the last seven races.
	   ``Mika and Michael are my main rivals and my priority is to get
in front of them,'' said the 27-year-old Briton. ``It was a good
start today, but we have to make sure we stay ahead.''
	   ``I have got to try and start clawing back the points,'' he
added. ``It's still possible to do that if I can get a good
reliability run, but I'm going to need Mika and Michael to have
reliability problems as well.''
	   The Silverstone track, one of the quickest in Formula One with a
mix of high-speed turns and long straights, is home to many of the
British-based teams, including McLaren.
	   ``It's like France in the World Cup. They're playing at home,
they've got the home advantage,'' said Irvine, whose teammate,
Schumacher, is coming off back-to-back victories as he aims for his
third series title and Ferrari's first in 19 years.
	   Schumacher, characterized as arrogant, ruthless and cold, but
still gets more from his car than it deserves, admitted winning
here will be trickier than Magny Cours, France, two weeks ago.
	   ``We should be able to improve tomorrow (Saturday) on seventh,
but I expect we will have a slightly more difficult job than we did
in Magny Cours.''
	   Last year's series champion Jacques Villeneuve _ rumored to be
moving to British American Racing when it debuts next season _ has
won the last two British GPs but, despite Williams' best free
practice this season, is a longshot to repeat.
	   Villeneuve has only 11 points so far and has yet to finish in
the top three. Frentzen, rumored to be on his way out, has only
eight for Williams, which has won five of the last six
constructors' titles but has slipped behind McLaren and Ferrari.
	   ``For sure it feels better than it did two weeks ago,''
Villeneuve said. ``There are not many slow-speed corners where you
need good traction, so we don't forfeit as much to Ferrari.''

Williams' changes coming soon

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Williams owner Frank Williams won't
confirm reports he's signed IndyCar champion Alex Zanardi. He's
also mum about dropping Heinz-Harald Frentzen next year.
	   But changes will be coming soon, he said, including word on the
future of Canadian Jacques Villeneuve, who is being courted by
British American Racing when it debuts next season.
	   ``I learned many years ago not to make any contributions to the
silly season,'' he said Friday. ``I'll keep out of it and when
we're ready we'll announce our drivers when we've singed them.''
	   In the next few weeks? he was asked. ``That's correct,'' he
said. ``Sometime soon.''
	   For the record, Zanardi drove four seasons in F1 (1991-94) and
has only one sixth-place in 25 races with lesser teams.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TIRE TALK: &LR;  Despite rumors to the contrary, Goodyear is still
set to leave Formula One after this season, leaving Bridgestone as
the lone supplier with talk Michelin might enter in 2000.
	   ``Nothing has changed since they made the announcement last
November,'' said Goodyear spokesman Dermot Bambridge. ``We said our
goal was to win this year, and that's where the focus has been.''
	   ``But while the heart is still beating, the beast is still
alive,'' he added. ``But I don't really think it will happen.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MONEY-MACHER: &LR;  Michael Schumacher is close to singing a new
three-year contract with Ferrari, reported to be worth a whopping
25 million pounds (dlrs 41 million) a year.
	   Schumacher, one of the world's highest paid athletes, joined
Ferrari in 1996 and is trying to bring the storied Italian racing
team its first series champion since 1979.
	   ``There's good reason that (new contract) could happen,'' the
29-year-old German said on the eve of Sunday's British Grand Prix.
	   Ferrari is being pressed by McLaren-Mercedes, which is reported
trying to lure away the German.
	   ``He doesn't want to win the world championship for McLaren, he
wants to do it at Ferrari,'' said Schumacher's teammate Eddie
Irvine. ``He hasn't spent three years here just for the money.''

Honda _ and an estimated 15-million-pound (dlrs 25 million) backing
from Benson and Hedges, this was the season Eddie Jordan's team was
to win its first GP.
	   It hasn't happened for the team that began racing in 1991. In
fact, Jordan drivers Damon Hill and Ralf Schumacher still haven't
finished a race in the top six.
	   Jordan is to unveil aerodynamic improvements for Sunday's
British GP and there is a slight case for optimism following
nagging engine problems. But Hill has suggested he may leave if
Honda isn't committed.
	   ``Honda have made it known they are coming back to Formula
One,'' Hill said. ``There is talk they will build their own car.
But I would like to see them come back in with Jordan and provide
us with the engine we know they are capable of building.''
	   ____
	   PIT STOPS: &LR;  Williams has won six of the last seven British GPs
and has taken the pole all seven times. Don't look for it to happen
this year.
	   A victory for Schumacher in the British GP would be his 31st and
tie him for No. 3 on the all-time list with Nigel Mansell. Alain
Prost leads with 51 followed by Ayrton Senna (41).
	   How hard is it to win an F1 race? Of this season's 23 drivers,
only nine have ever won a race. Subtract those who've won two or
fewer and the number drops to only six.
	   Rain is forecast for Sunday, perhaps giving the advantage to
Schumacher, who skills are unrivaled when it's wet.

World Cup: Being there was the challenge; Now most pressure is off
</HEADLINE>
for French &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Just being there was the
challenge. And going into Sunday's final, the whole of France has
already fallen on its knees in gratitude.
	   A championship game against Brazil was the biggest dream of all.
Nobody's demanding that they win it too. ``Glory days,'' headlined
l'Equipe sports paper.
	   ``Against Croatia in the semifinal we had everything to lose. It
is exactly the opposite now,'' said French coach Aime Jacquet.
	   So instead of making sure his players don't get suffocated by
the pressure, Jacquet's task now is just as much about keeping the
pressure on the players. But deep down among the deer and boar in
the woods outside Paris, Jacquet is his own master and he knows how
to work his troops.
	   ``We're totally isolated. Time doesn't apply here,'' Jacquet
said. ``We have to realize our adventure is not over yet,'' he
said. Jacquet has proved throughout he is a great motivator.
	   Surrounding him are enough veterans, molded in so many years of
playing the world's finest leagues, that a psychological letdown is
out of the question.
	   The French love the Brazilian team almost as much as their own,
making it hard to live up to that ``us vs. them'' attitude marking
so many World Cup finals.
	   ``It will be the most beautiful symbol of the friendship that
unites the Brazilian and French people,'' said French President
Jacques Chirac. The players just hope the 80,000 Stade de France
crowd will be more fired up than during the preceding games there.
	   And for the first time in seven games, France won't be the
favorite and be forced to impose play. Perhaps it will even be able
to play the counter.
	   ``Brazil is the favorite. The whole world sees the Brazilians
win against us. So much the better,'' said France's star playmaker
Zinedine Zidane.
	   Ronaldo will be seeking to score two goals to become the World
Cup top scorer his stature demands, and with his lightning speed so
evident so late in the tournament, he would inspire fear in lesser
men than the French defenders.
	   ``We all know Brazil. Sometimes you don't need too much respect.
We have a culture of victory now,'' said Lilian Thuram, who scored
both goals in the semifinal win over Croatia in the semifinal.
	   Last time the two sides met at the World Cup, in 1986,it
produced one of the best matches in the history of the game _ a
penalty shootout win for the French at the end of a 1-1 draw that
belied the true spectacle of the match.

future &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOUNT PLEASANT, Michigan (AP) _ When the doors of the Soaring
Eagle Resort open in late July, the Saginaw Chippewa Indian tribe
will place its largest bet ever on the powerful draw of gambling.
	   The 518-room hotel next to the tribe's casino will create a
gambling compound with luxury touches right in the middle of rural
Michigan. With Italian marble tiles, Irish carpets, a pool shaped
like a turtle with a cherry-wood cathedral ceiling and rooms with
whirlpool tubs, managers say it can compete with the best hotels in
Detroit and Grand Rapids.
	   Since the tribe opened its first casino in 1994, gambling has
given millions to the tribe's members, the city and surrounding
townships. The tribe that had suffered poverty for decades has
become the city's largest employer, surpassing Central Michigan
University.

 &UR; The ride to the top of Mount San Jacinto is improving
	   PALM SPRINGS, California (AP) _ For folks wanting to escape the
desert floor to the cool of 8,500-foot (2,590-meter) Mount San
Jacinto, creen with a small rectangular opening.
	   The rule: If it doesn't fit, you must check it.
	   ``This way it makes it fair to everyone,'' says Weda Faizi,
customer service manager at Southwest Airlines' terminal in
Oakland, one of the locations where the screening program is
getting a trial run. Between 7,000 and 10,000 travelers pass
through the Oakland terminal daily.
	   So far, a few passengers have reacted angrily, but most are
responding favorably, Faizi says.
	   Southwest's cargo embargo is part of an industry wide carry-on
crackdown.
	   A similar screen went up earlier this year in New York's La
Guardia Airport at a terminal shared by United, Continental and
Northwest.
	   ``It's a pretty easy, simple and smart idea,'' says United
Airlines spokesman Tony Molinaro. ``We just have to talk to (other)
airports about doing it.''

	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Except for an idle carousel, all the
rides are gone. T-shirts and souvenirs were sold at cut rates or
donated to charity.
	   After a quarter of a century, the Opryland USA theme park in
Nashville is history.
	   The park was shut down to make way for Opry Mills, a dlrs 200
million entertainment and retail complex scheduled to open in 2000.
	   Opryland's closing leaves Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, 185 miles
(300 kilometers) to the east, as Tennessee's only theme park. It's
in its 13th season.
	   The Opry Mills development will include 15 to 20 anchor stores
and more than 200 retail stores, plus theme restaurants, casual
dining, entertainment, a bowling alley, IMAX theater and an in-line
skating area.
	   For Leisa Peek of Nashville, the closing of Opryland means she
must find other places to take her 8-year-old son and 6-year-old
daughter. All three have had season passes for five years.
	   ``I watched them get tall enough to go on the adult rides,'' she
says.
	   Gaylord Entertainment, which owned the park, decided to close it
because attendance dipped below 2 million annually in recent years,
down from a high of 2.4 million in the mid-1980s.
	   ``It's a time of mixed emotions,'' says Tom Adkinson, a Gaylord
spokesman. ``There used to be a sense of anticipation about the
park. Now it's on something a little farther away.''
	   Dollywood's attendance last year was 1.95 million, down from 2.1
million a year earlier. But state tourism commissioner John Wade
says he expects Dollywood will get a boost from Opryland's closing.
	   Located on 118 acres (48 hectares) in the foothills of the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park, Dollywood has typical theme park
rides: a Ferris wheel, water rides, roller coasters, replica cars
and trains.
	   There are at least 40 live performances every day, including one
by Randy Parton, Dolly's brother.
	   Twenty-two country stars will perform on Sundays throughout the
season, including Merle Haggard, Ronnie Milsap, Diamond Rio,
Loretta Lynn, Pam Tillis and Charlie Daniels. Dolly herself will
perform Sept. 5-6.
	   Music is one of the few things that remains at Opryland. The
Grand Ole Opry country show is presented at the park every Friday
and Saturday night.
	   After the park closed last fall, Gaylord sold 13 rides to other
theme parks. The Opryland merchandise was discounted and sold to
the public. What was left was donated to Goodwill Industries.
	   The Opryland carousel was left intact but will not be used this
year.
	   ``We wanted to hang on to it and plan to work around it and
incorporate it into the new complex,'' Adkinson says.
	   Gaylord officials say the closing of the park will have little
effect on the giant adjoining Opryland Hotel. The 2,883-room hotel
gets 80 percent of its business from conventions and has 4.2
million room nights already booked, some as much as 19 years ahead
of time.
	   Wade says the new Opry Mills complex will attract a projected 18
million visitors annually.
	   ``It will be the most attended tourism venue in the state by
far,'' he said.

Brazil goes asks World Trade Organization to look into aircraft
</HEADLINE>
dispute
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. ADDS quotes from Embraer president, details of
dispute &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil has asked the World Trade
Organization to look into what it says are illegal Canadian export
subsidies for its aircraft industry, the Foreign Ministry said
Friday.
	   The move follows a similar announcement by the Canadian
government asking the WTO to look into illegal subsidies for
Brazilian aircraft industries.
	   The dispute between the Canada's Bombardier Inc. and the
Brazilian airplane manufacturer Embraer began in December 1997,
after the Canadian company announced it would purchase training
planes from Raytheon Aircraft of the United States.
	   Embraer said it was about to sign a dlrs 90 million contract to
sell 24 of its Tucano planes to Bombardier. The Raytheon contract
prompted Brazil to announce it would reconsider all projects of
interest to Canada's aeronautical industry.
	   ``The Canadian government contributed billions of dollars in
subsidies to Bombardier in the past five years,'' Embraer President
Mauricio Botelho said. ``We can compete with Bombardier and its
products, but it's not fair to compete with the financing of the
Canadian government.''
	   Brazilian and Canadian government officials vowed to resolve the
dispute through diplomatic channels, but talks broke down earlier
this week.
	   ``In spite of intensive efforts to reach a bilateral solution,
the dispute unfortunately reached a complete deadlock,'' said
Waldemar Leao, head of the economics department at the Foreign
Ministry.
	   Leao said the trade rift wouldn't affect Brazil-Canada relations
in general, which he characterized as ``excellent.''
	   Embraer, Latin America's leading manufacturer, has beaten
Bombardier several times over the past year, landing large
contracts with several regional airlines in the United States and
Europe.
	   ``Brazil's argument is that the Canadian government indirectly
subsidizes exports of Bombardier models through incentives payments
for research and development,'' Leao said.
	   Leao said there were several ``hidden subsidies'' the Canadian
government was giving to Bombardier.
	   ``These are more difficult to detect, but we have a detailed
list which we will submit to the WTO,'' he said.
	   Brazil requested the organization's arbitration board to meet on
the matter July 23 to set up a panel.

He wants to row his boat across the Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY413 &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB MIMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIDVALE, Utah (AP) _ Four decades of rafting some of the
American West's wildest stretches of white-water rapids were merely
warm-ups for what Richard Jones says will be his greatest
adventure.
	   At 55, the owner of Worldwide River Expeditions wants to row,
row, row his specially designed boat across the Atlantic. And yes,
he knows it won't be a gentle trip.
	   ``I'll just play it by ear,'' says Jones, who has spent five
years getting ready for his dlrs 80,000 ocean odyssey. ``If the
weather gets so heavy I can't row, the boat has two compartments
with hatches. I can just crawl inside and wait it out.''
	   Jones figures he can safely navigate his torpedo-shaped
Fiberglas craft _ 27 feet (8.2 meters long and 4 1-2 feet (1.4
meters) wide _ in seas with waves up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) high.
	   ``After that, with the wind blowing the waves will start to
break, so I would have to just bag it and wait the storm out,'' he
says.
	   Starting from Lisbon, Portugal, in mid-September, Jones plans to
arrive in Miami six to eight months _ and 5,000 miles (8,000
kilometers) _ later.
	   Others have rowed the Atlantic before. Two Norwegians, George
Harbo and Frank Samuelsen, were believed to be the first in 1896.
Jones believes he could be the first American rower _ and oldest _
to complete the Lisbon-to-Miami route solo.
	   Jones' boat is modeled after one used by English adventurer
Peter Bird, who successfully rowed large stretches of the Atlantic
before dying at sea in 1996 while trying to cross the Pacific.
	   Jones' sleek boat, though cramped, is state-of-the-art. Inside
is packed filtration equipment to make sea water drinkable, a
cookstove, and electronic navigational and communications
equipment.
	   A laptop computer will be onboard, linking him to navigational
information and home via satellite. As a backup, Jones also will
take a marine radio.
	   The boat itself cost dlrs 40,000, taking Jones four years to
build in a garage outside his offices in Midvale, a Salt Lake
suburb. The past year has been spent installing his high-tech
equipment and learning how to operate it.
	   The gear, along with food, transport of the boat and travel to
Portugal, and other incidentals account for the remainder of the
expedition's price tag. That bill is being footed primarily by
Worldwide, with other aid coming from a few corporate sponsors,
friends, relatives and former clients and Jones himself.
	   Jones' daughter, Susan Jones, will monitor her father's seagoing
progress and run the river-rafting business while he is gone.
	   In the naming of his boat, Jones, a member of The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, acknowledged he may also be
hedging his bets on a higher plane.
	   The craft has been christened ``Brother of Jared,'' a reference
to a Book of Mormon story about ancient mariners who migrated from
Mesopotamia to America some 2,500 years ago.
	   What do his wife and four children think of his adventure?
	   ``Well, say they're reconciled,'' Jones laughed. ``They're
comfortable with it now, seeing all the preparations made to keep
the boat safe and stable.''
	   Jones plans few if any landfalls along the way.
	   ``I might go to Maderia (an island 500 miles (800 kilometers)
southwest of Lisbon) just to check my navigational skills. I plan
to bypass the Canary Islands, but could stop there if needed,''
Jones says.
	   Even with a 7,000-calorie-per-day diet, he expects to lose up to
20 pounds (9 kilograms) from his 6-foot-3 (1.9-meter), 200-pound
(90-kilogram) frame, rowing 12-15 hours per day.
	   ``It's strictly a rowboat. The only moving parts are a left arm
and a right arm,'' Jones says, adding that he is willing to pay the
price in pain for ``the adventure of a lifetime.''
	   ``It's a challenge,'' he says. ``Just an enormous challenge.''

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A severe drought has forced Cuba to adopt
emergency measures in eastern communities, where crops have
suffered ``serious'' damage, the Cuban government's news agency
reported Friday.
	   Many people are temporarily relocating to other regions due to
the lack of rain, Prensa Latina said, citing Pedro Miret, the vice
president of the Council of Ministers.
	   In areas where natural wells have run dry, water is being
brought in by truck or animals for thousands of people and
livestock, the National Information Agency said in the report,
monitored in Mexico City.
	   Precipitation for June was its lowest for the month in the last
four decades, the report said without giving specific figures.
	   In the eastern province of Guantanamo, hundreds of hectares
(acres) of crops have been lost. Coffee and honey production has
suffered; low reservoir levels have affected irrigation for sugar
cane; and fishing also has been hurt, it said.

	   MALINDI, Kenya (AP) _ When Joan Rutherfoord Goodhart first came
to Malindi on vacation in 1943, the floor of the Holmes Hotel was
made of packed-down earth.
	   Half a century later, Malindi boasts dozens of comfortable,
intimate hotels with thatched roofs, airy rooms and luxurious
vegetation. Game fish are plentiful, and the millions of brightly
colored fish that dart in and out of a long coral reef make the
area a snorkeling and scuba diving paradise.
	   But most of the rooms stand empty, and boats to the reef are
idle.
	   The steady decline in the number of tourists to Malindi and
Kenya's entire Indian Ocean coast since 1990, capped by this
season's precipitous drop, is a tale of complacency, government
mismanagement, corruption _ and sometimes, an unfamiliarity with
Kenyan geography.
	   ``It never was a smart sort of place,'' says the 79-year-old
Goodhart, a resident since 1982 who tries to go snorkeling every
other day.
	   Nevertheless, she says, Malindi had been a magnet since the
mid-1960s for hundreds of thousands of British, German, Swiss and
Italian tourists on the strength of its relaxed atmosphere and
proximity to Kenya's reknown game reserves.
	   Ann Robertson of the Malindi Museum Society says the town has
been on the map for centuries, first as a market and trading post
in the complex network of Indian Ocean commerce.
	   She led efforts to use the commemoration of the 500th
anniversary of the April 15 arrival of Vasco da Gama at the head of
a Portuguese fleet en route to India to boost Malindi's flagging
image.
	   ``Malindi has had its ups and downs, but this certainly has been
the lowest low,'' says the Museum Society's treasurer, Korinna
Spyratos, whose husband is a local building contractor.
	   Government tourism officer J.Z. Machuka says 90 percent of the
town's population of about 30,000 depends on tourism for their
livelihood.
	   ``Everyone suffers when there are no tourists,'' he says. ``Here
there is no industry. It's not like Mombasa.''
	   But East Africa's major port, 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of
Malindi, is also affected by the absence of tourists, who shun its
historic but potholed and garbage-strewn streets.
	   The Kenyan coast, which receives 60 percent of all tourists to
the East African nation, began to experience a decline in visitors
during the 1991 Gulf War, which put a chill on tourism around the
world.
	   And, like rest of Kenya, the coast suffers from government
neglect, particularly its failure to maintain roads, power grids
and the telephone system. Hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked
for repair of highways and other infrastructure have been siphoned
off by corrupt officials.
	   Kenyan tourism has also been seriously affected by the opening
up of new safari destinations in South Africa and Tanzania and sun
spots in the Caribbean.
	   But a series of politically motivated inter-ethnic attacks on
the coast south of Mombasa last August that left 88 dead dealt the
industry a staggering body blow, although no tourists were
targeted. And no attacks occurred in Malindi, about 160 kilometers
(100 miles) north of the scene of the violence.
	   ``Things had been iffy for three or four years, and last August,
most hotels were looking at the best season for 10 years,'' says
Elsa Friman, owner of Scorpio Villas. She says people were putting
aside Gulf War fears and beginning to remember how nice Malindi
was.
	   The government of President Daniel arap Moi was quick to blame
the international media's reporting on the attacks for the
avalanche of cancellations at the beginning of the 1997-98 tourist
season.
	   ``People overseas did read about it (the attacks), but they have
no idea of geography. I think they don't realize how big Africa is;
they think it is just a dark continent,'' Spyratos says.
	   Maybe things will pick up in the upcoming July-April season,
``if nothing else happens,'' Friman said.
	   Jim Flannery, a technical adviser to the semi-official Kenya
Tourist Board, says both the government and people in the tourism
industry had been complacent when Kenya was the only game in town.
	   ``Kenya was not marketed. It depended on tour operators, and
Kenya was undisturbed by real competition ,'' Flannery said at the
recent launch of a publicity campaign in Europe to woo tourists
back.
	   Fishermen such as Ali Mohamed, who inherited his wooden dhow
with a lateen sail from his father, would also like to see tourists
return.
	   But, setting off in the early dusk for a night at sea, he said
fishermen can at least survive as they have always done.
	   ``We like tourists, but we don't starve, no matter what happens
to tourism.''

KHARGA: more visitors.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ``The thinking is to create a tourism system,'' says Adel Rady,
head of the Tourism Development Authority. His plan would restore
historic sites and connect the best-preserved ones with roads lined
with hotels, restaurants and other facilities.
	   It's an eight-hour drive from Cairo to Siwa, via Marsa Matrouh
on the Mediterranean. The asphalt road, which follows the desert
routes taken by camel caravans 4,000 years ago, is treacherous in
places and prone to be covered by shifting sand dunes in spots.
	   Another road is in the works linking Luxor and Kharga, a
distance of 200 kilometers (125 miles).
	   The airport at Kharga is used mainly by businessmen and
government bureaucrats who work in the area. Tourism officials say
there are plans to convert a military airport in Siwa to civilian
use.
	   Rady insists oasis tourism will be eco-minded. He says officials
are aware of the messy development along the Red Sea, where
shopping malls mar the beauty of the mountains. Many coral reefs
were destroyed in the building marinas for yachts.
	   ``There is more awareness and carefulness these days,'' Rady
says.
	   Environmentalists hope some oasis areas can be protected
reserves. Areas near Siwa and Farafra are being considered because
they are home to foxes and gazelles which have been decimated by
illegal hunting.
	   ``The environment there is very delicate,'' says environmental
researcher Sherif Baha el-Din.
	   ``The desert is always seen as harsh and can take anything, but
actually it is quite sensitive because everything is so critically
balanced.''
	   To some, change cannot come soon enough.
	   Mounir Neamatalla, who has built two hotels in Siwa, says the
goal should be to protect the oasis's unique assets of history and
nature while benefiting local people _ and investors.
	   As an example, he says Siwans can profit through making and
selling olive oil, soap and clothes by traditional methods.
	   Neamatalla is part-owner of a private company called
Environmental Quality International. He calls the company's hotels
_ which are clusters of restored Siwan houses _ ``eco-lodges.''
	   The houses, with the mud brick and soft angles, match the
environment. Neamatalla's biggest hotel, to be opened before
October's harvest festival, uses 24 old homes.
	   Stopping change in the oases is impossible, Neamatalla says.
	   ``We cannot put a fence around Siwa and make it like a zoo so
that tourists come to see something different,'' he says. ``That's
not the concept of sustainable development.''

	   Here are some of the main sites to see in the oases of Egypt's
Western Desert.
	    &UR; KHARGA:
	   A museum in Kharga houses Pharaonic, Greco-Roman and Coptic
items discovered in the oases.
	   Hibis, a beautiful small Amun temple, rebuilt about 2,400 years
ago during the rule of Persian King Darius I.
	   Bagawat, a nearly 2,000-year old Christian necropolis with
hundreds of domed tombs, has well-preserved biblical scenes painted
on the walls.
	    &UR; DAKHLAH:
	   El-Qasr is a nearly 700-year old Islamic town with the remains
of houses and mosques almost intact.
	   El-Mizawaqqa is a nearly 2,000-year old Roman cemetery with
tombs carved into a hill. Two tombs still retain their wall
paintings. In one, that of Pady Osiris, a woman with blonde hair _
probably his wife _ is depicted on the ceiling.
	   Balat is a site that dates back to the 6th Dynasty (2345-2181
B.C.) with burial Mastabas, or step-like pyramids. One kilometer
(half a mile) away, French archaeologists are working in Ein Aseel,
where the nearly 50-room house of the oasis' governor and a
settlement have been found. The site is closed to visitors.
	    &UR; FARAFRA:
	   The White Desert is an excellent camping ground. During
full-moon nights, the silver rays are reflected off white rock
formations. The occasional desert fox can be spotted.
	    &UR; SIWA:
	   The 300-kilometer (185-mile) road that leads from Marsa Matrouh
south to Siwa was used by Alexander the Great when he visited Siwa.
There are no historic sites along the way.
	   The nearly 2,500-year old Temple of Amun, one kilometer (a
half-mile) outside Siwa, is where Alexander the Great's divinity
was confirmed.
	   Shali, the old town in Siwa whose houses date to the 17th C., is
eerily beautiful with its cylindrical mosque minarets. Most of the
inhabitants deserted it after rain destroyed many houses in the
late 1800's.

Desert day trip from any oasis about 50 Egyptian pounds (dlrs 15).
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   ACCOMMODATIONS: Staying in a hotel can mean roughing it.
Generally, clean bed-and-breakfasts run 17 Egyptian pounds to 129
Egyptian pounds (dlrs 5- dlrs 38.) A hotel near Siwa will open in

(dlrs 100 daily). Small restaurants in major oases offer meal of
rice, chicken and vegetables at six Egyptian pounds to 17 pounds
(dlrs 2- dlrs 5).
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   TRAVEL TIPS: Best time to visit is September-March, when
temperatures average 59-77 degrees Fahrenheit (15-25 C) during the
day but nearly 32 degrees Fahrenheit (zero C) at night. Take loose
cotton clothes and jacket for nights.
	   No alcohol sold; no night life. But don't forget bathing suit
for hot springs. Dipping in a steamy spring at night is
unforgettable.
	   Sunglasses, sun block, comfortable shoes and mosquito repellents
are essential, especially when camping. Bring needed medicines;
there are few pharmacies or emergency centers.

Ethnic violence jars Lagos, leaders try to stem ethnic attacks

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Fearing an escalation in ethnic violence
sparked by the death of Moshood Abiola, Nigerian authorities
dispatched riot police to watch over the city's mosques and urged
ethnic leaders to appeal for calm.
	   The three days since the death of Abiola _ a southern ethnic
Yoruba _ waves of rioting and violence in cities across Nigeria's
southwest appear to be pitting Yoruba against Nigeria's northern
Hausa Muslims.
	   On Friday, youths rioted in the streets in parts of Nigeria's
commercial capital, Lagos. That violence ended by late afternoon,
but streets in some neighborhoods remained tense and watched over
by scores of police and soldiers.
	   The Hausa-Yoruba enmity was born after Nigeria's 1960
independence from Britain, when northerners quickly took control of
the country. They have held power ever since, except for a period
of about four years when southerners were in control.
	   These days, Nigeria's pro-democracy movement is largely led by
southerners, particularly Yorubas.
	   The bodies of nine Hausas have been discovered in a
predominantly Yoruba neighborhood, backing up fears of inter-ethnic
violence.
	   While Nigeria is a confused grid of more than 250 ethnic groups,
it is dominated by Hausas and Fulanis in the north, Yorubas in the
southwest, and Ibos in the southeast.
	   Religious differences overlay the ethnic divisions, with Muslims
making up the majority in the north and Christians _ along with a
strong current of traditional Nigerian religions _ dominating the
south.
	   But the divisions are not always aligned neatly. Abiola, for
example, was a Muslim as well as a Yoruba. He died Tuesday, still
in custody four years after his arrest.
	   His freedom, though, had been widely hinted at in the four weeks
since the sudden death of Gen. Sani Abacha, who had brutally ruled
Nigeria for the past five years.
	   Life in Nigeria became increasingly difficult during Abacha's
dictatorship; the economy and infrastructure crumbled under the
weight of neglect and corruption.
	   The death of Abiola _ the apparent winner of annulled
presidential elections in 1993 _ has infuriated his supporters, who
say the military, dominated by Hausa and Fulani northerners, is to
blame.
	   The junta says he died of a heart attack, but some of Abiola's
relatives say he was killed by the military even as they prepared
to set him free.
	   The government has completed an autopsy, but hasn't released the
results. A second, independent autopsy to be conducted by a team of
foreign pathologists, was scheduled for Saturday at the earliest,
according to Abiola family members who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Trying to stave off further ethnic attacks, riot police and
paramilitary troops were protecting Muslim mosques in Lagos, some
of which have been targeted by the predominantly Christian Yorubas.
	   While a feared wave of attacks during Friday afternoon Muslim
prayers did not occur, authorities believed violence was still
possible.
	   Abacha's successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has released a
group of political prisoners and promised to free the rest. He also
has vowed _ albeit vaguely _ to return the country to civilian
rule.
	   Abiola's death has touched off three days of violence. More than
400 people have been arrested since Tuesday night, when violence
first broke out in Lagos. Police say at least 55 people have been
killed.
	   Many of the victims were Hausas and Fulanis, said junta
commander Col. Hamed Ali.
	   Unemployment is rampant, roads are a mess and buying gasoline
means waiting in line for up to 12 hours.

Opposition lawmakers calls Mexico's offer for talks on Chiapas 'a
</HEADLINE>
joke' &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ GUZMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ The Mexican
government's latest proposal to restart talks with rebels in
Chiapas is ``a joke'' for the country, an opposition lawmaker said
Friday.
	   The government's plan for Chiapas ``is not real, and is a very
little thing (compared to) what is needed by Mexico and the
region,'' said Carlos Payan, a senator from the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party and member of Congress' peace commission.
	   The Interior Secretariat on Wednesday promised actions to relax
political tensions in Chiapas and urged the Zapatista National
Liberation Army to resume talks to end the 4 1/2-year-old
rebellion.
	   It promised to promote development in the impoverished southern
state and to release imprisoned Zapatista rebels and their
supporters who have not been directly implicated in acts of
violence.
	   Zapatista leaders have not publicly responded to the proposal.
Their supporters have dismissed it as a reiteration of previous
offers.
	   The Zapatistas rose up in January 1994 to demand greater rights
and democracy for Chiapas' Indians. It declared a cease-fire and
entered peace talks, but negotiations broke down in 1996.
	   Payan said that for the government's effort at peace to be real,
it should withdraw troops from the state, free political prisoners,
and punish the parties responsible for the December massacre of 45
people in Acteal, a village sympathetic to the rebels.

 &UR; ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES: Protesters attack prime minister's
car &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ Protesters seething over last
month's election attacked cars carrying St. Vincent and the
Grenadines' prime minister and finance minister as they left the
opening session of the legislature.
	   Supporters of the opposition Unity Labor Party, which claims the
June 15 vote was fraudulent, surrounded the cars and pounded their
fists on the roofs as Prime Minister James Mitchell and Finance
Minister Arnhim Eustace tried to drive through Thursday night.
	   They hurled bottles at Eustace's car, damaging the fender and
smashing the windows of a nearby vehicle. One man lay on the ground
to prevent Eustace from moving forward.
	   A police officer fired his gun in the air to scatter the crowd,
and another hauled the protester out of the car's way.
	   The protesters claim Mitchell's New Democratic party rigged the
elections in this archipelago in the southeast Caribbean.
 &UR; TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO: Government to execute killer on Tuesday
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Trinidad and Tobago intends to
hang a murderer on Tuesday, defying an international human rights
court and international pressure to ban the death penalty.
	   Authorities at the State Prison in Port of Spain confirmed
Friday that they had read a death warrant, a notification of
execution, to killer Haniff Hillaire on Thursday.
	   Caribbean countries say executions help deter crime related to
the region's drug trade, and they are increasingly frustrated with
international attempts to block executions.
	   Thursday's execution order is a challenge to the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights, which is hearing an appeal from
Hillaire. In May, Trinidadian officials accused the court of
dragging its feet and shocked civil rights advocates by dropping
out of an Organization of American States human rights accord that
allows such appeals.
 &UR; NETHERLANDS: Marines charged with smuggling cocaine from Curacao
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Two Dutch marines, four members of
the Netherlands Antilles coast guard and seven civilians have been
arrested on charges of smuggling cocaine from the Caribbean to the
Netherlands, a defense ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   Authorities have seized a total of 355 kilograms (781 pounds) of
cocaine, some were discovered aboard a Lockheed Orion
anti-submarine patrol aircraft from the Dutch Navy.
	   Ironically, the aircraft is used to patrol the Caribbean for
drug trafficking as part of the Netherlands Antilles coast guard.
	   Police discovered up to 125 kilograms (275 pounds) of cocaine
stashed away in personnel's bags on the plane, which returned to a
military base in the Netherlands from Curacao Thursday.
	   Raids were also conducted at various locations in Curacao and in
the Netherlands. All the suspects were arrested in the Netherlands,
including the four conscripts from the Netherlands Antilles.
 &UR; GUYANA: Parliament seals truce by allowing opposition party back
in
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyanese lawmakers welcomed the
opposition party back into the National Assembly Friday, sealing a
truce that ended weeks of violence in the South American country.
	   Lawmakers voted to re-admit the People's National Congress, one
month after its 25 representatives were booted from the legislature
for missing six consecutive sessions.
	   National Congress members had boycotted the body, saying the
Dec. 15 elections were rigged. President Janet Jagan's party won 36
of the 65 seats in Parliament.
	   The boycott was accompanied by weeks of riots and firebombings,
and a shotgun attack on protesters by police that injured 12.
	   The impasse had racial overtones. The People's National Congress
is supported mainly by people of African descent, while Jagan's
People's Progressive Party is dominated by ethnic East Indians.
	   Caribbean leaders persuaded Jagan and opposition leader Desmond
Hoyte to strike a truce during a Caribbean Community summit in St.
Lucia earlier this month.
 &UR; TRINIDAD: Suriname's ambassador says Bouterse charges rooted in
politics
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Dutch drug charges against
Suriname's former dictator are rooted in political differences,
Suriname's ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago claimed Friday.
	   Interpol wants former leader Desire Bouterse on Dutch cocaine
smuggling charges, and the Netherlands asked Trinidadian officials
to nab him Thursday as he visited the Caribbean country.
	   Trinidad and Tobago refused, saying it had not been asked by
Interpol to intervene. Bouterse hurriedly left the country.
	   During a news conference in Port-of-Spain Friday, Ambassador
Harvey Naarendorp charged the Dutch were angry over Bouterse's
attempts to make the former Dutch colony in South America less
dependent on Europe.
	   ``The Dutch are known to be good international businessmen, but
they have been bad at decolonizing, whether it be in Suriname,
Indonesia or Papua New Guinea,'' Naarendorp said. ``We believe the
charges against Bouterse are yet another attempt to criminalize the
leaders of Suriname.''
 &UR; GRENADA: Opposition protests Castro visit
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Fidel Castro will get a frigid
reception from opposition party members when the Cuban leader
visits Grenada this summer, the president of the Grenada United
Labor Party vowed Friday.
	   ``We are not going to hug him and welcome him here,'' said party
leader Herbert Preudhomme.
	   The Cuban president has promised to visit Grenada sometime this
summer as a gesture of the new friendliness between the two
countries. The visit has stirred memories of the 1979 leftist coup
that led to the imprisonment of some Labor Party members.
	   The revolution was followed four years later by a U.S.-led
invasion that ousted armed Cuban construction workers from the
island.
	   The Labor Party has accused Castro of assisting the coup and has
criticized Prime Minister Keith Mitchell's policy of ``engaging''
the communist island.
	   ``We experienced what happened to us here during 1979 to 1983
when brave Americans came here and gave their lives to set us free,
so we are saying Castro must change,'' Preudhomme said.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: New inconvenience looms _ a massive water outage
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Ricans, still recovering
from a general strike that left a quarter-million people without
long-distance telephone service, face a new shortage _ of water.
	   On July 18, workers will shut off water to some 900,000
residents around San Juan to begin repairs to the area's main water
treatment plant, the Aqueduct and Sewer Authority announced Friday.
For at least 36 hours _ and possibly five days _ residents will
have to collect water from tank trucks and portable tanks.
	   The news is not going over well with residents, who frequently
criticize the aging water system and its propensity for water main
breaks.
	   ``You never know what's going to crop up next here _ it's like
hurricane season year-round,'' griped a caller to a radio show.
	   During a two-day general strike to protest privatization of the
state telephone utility, many Puerto Ricans hoarded water in
bathtubs and water jugs, fearing that sabotaged power lines might
disable distribution pumps.
 &UR; WASHINGTON: Barbados leader says IMF, World Bank should study small
nations
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund should do more to alleviate the economic vulnerability of
small nations, Prime Minister Ower Arthur of Barbados said Friday.
	   He said many of these nations, which have relatively high
incomes compared to the world's poorest countries, are being pushed
to the sidelines by globalization of trade while international
financial institutions concentrate on the financial crisis in Asia
and Russia's economic difficulties.
	   ``There are new threats to the security of small states from
economic shocks, natural disasters, global warming, that make them
increasingly vulnerable,'' Arthur said. ``We want (the World Bank
and the IMF) to focus on these concerns and they have agreed to do
so.''
	   Arthur led a group of ministers from Lesotho, Mauritius, Fiji
and New Zealand that met with World Bank President James Wolfensohn
and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus.The group met Thursday
with senior State Department officials.
 &UR; FLORIDA: Drifters with Bahamas tie possibly linked to missing
millionaires
	   MANALAPAN, Florida (AP) _ Using a luxurious hotel in this
exclusive seaside community as a cover, a drifter and his mother
pulled a scam to trade in a used motor home that may be linked to a
murder, police said Friday.
	   Kenneth Kimes Jr., 23, and his mother, Sante, 63, may have been
trying to get rid of evidence connecting them to a slain Los
Angeles businessman when they bought a new RV using bad checks,
police said.
	   Investigators in several states are working to link Kimes and
his mother _ who've left a nationwide trail of 22 fake names and
fake documents _ to the deaths or disappearances of three wealthy
people.
	   The Kimes have piqued the interest of Bahamian authorities who
are looking into the disappearance of banker Syed Bilal Ahmed. The
55-year-old native of Bahrain vanished in September 1996 in Nassau
after meeting with the Kimeses.
	   The couple were being held Friday in New York on a bad check
warrant from Utah as police searched for their missing landlady in
Manhattan.

Prime Minister's future in the balance ahead of crucial elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's political parties launched final appeals to
voters Saturday ahead of nationwide elections that could decide the
fate of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's 2 1/2-year
administration.
	   The polls Sunday for the upper house of Parliament, in which
half of the chamber's 252 seats are up for grabs, are widely seen
as a referendum on Hashimoto's handling of Japan's moribund
economy.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's hold on power is not at
stake because it enjoys a strong majority in Parliament's more
powerful lower house, but experts say a poor showing could be
enough to force a leadership change.
	   ``This election is effectively about confidence in the Hashimoto
administration,'' the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said
Saturday.
	   After a series of embarrassing wobbles on a pledge to slash
taxes, senior LDP officials said Friday they were considering a 4
trillion yen (dlrs 28.4 billion) permanent tax cut to boost Japan's
economy, which is stuck in a deep recession.
	   But it was unclear if that would repair the damage done by
Hashimoto's dithering and vagueness on taxes while on the campaign
trail this week, which reinforced the image of the LDP as a house
divided.
	   In spite of record low support ratings for Hashimoto, analysts
had until recently been predicting that voter apathy and an
ineffectual opposition would allow the LDP to regain control of the
upper chamber for the first time since 1989.
	   Now, the LDP says it is aiming to gain the 61 seats that would
allow it to break even. If that happens, the ruling party would
again have to seek coalition partners to pass legislation.
	   Hashimoto's mention of tax cuts at the height of the election
campaign was seen as a crucial blunder and a transparent ploy to
woo voters.
	   At one point last week, the prime minister said he supported
``permanent tax reforms'' and then seemed to backtrack two days
later by saying the reforms wouldn't reduce the nation's overall
tax revenues.
	   On Wednesday, Hashimoto finally came out in favor of income tax
cuts, though he stopped short of saying how big they'd be.
	   Analysts said Hashimoto's hand may have been forced as opinion
polls showed opposition parties such as the Japan Communist Party
gaining popularity by calling for tax cuts.
	   The July 12 elections are the first upper house elections since
Hashimoto came to power in early 1996. As a member of the more
powerful lower house, Hashimoto himself does not stand for
reelection.
	   Still, the prime minister's less-than-stellar performance is
also raising the question of how big a blow his party would have to
suffer at the polls for him to step down.
	   The national Asahi newspaper reported Friday that Hashimoto may
have to resign if his party wins less than 61 seats. It said
several leading LDP lawmakers such as Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi
are already jockeying for position to replace him.
	   If so, polls show Hashimoto could be in for a tight race this
Sunday.
	   The Nihon Keizai, Japan's largest business daily, released a
poll on Tuesday of 37,600 voters showing the party will win only 60
seats. As with most Japanese polls, the Nihon Keizai didn't give a
margin of error.

Away from hottest battle zones, Serb police raid suspected KLA
</HEADLINE>
hideouts &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While Yugoslav troops sought to cut
the flow of arms from neighboring Albania, police raid suspected
rebel hideouts elsewhere in rebellious Kosovo province to step up
pressure on the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The Serb Media Center said police on Friday raided suspected
guerrilla hideouts in the Serb-controlled towns of Urosevac and
Kacanik, arresting 11 ethnic Albanians and seizing weapons and maps
of police and military facilities.
	   According to the report, 22 other suspected KLA members escaped.
Police accused them of staging three ``terrorist attacks'' in
recent weeks against police stations in the area south of of the
provincial capital of Pristina.
	   Meantime, Yugoslav troops along the Albanian border were
battling arms smugglers who ferry weapons across the mountainous
area in mule trains.
	   Serb sources and witnesses said at least four smugglers were
killed Friday in two hours-long battles along the border about 75
kilometers (45 miles) to the west of Urosevac and Kacanik.
	   Two smugglers were captured and a large quantity of weapons _
including anti-tank mines _ were seized. A Yugoslav officer said it
was the first time troops captured anti-tank mines destined for the
rebels.
	   KLA commanders have told reporters that tanks have given
Yugoslav troops a strong advantage in battles with the lightly
armed rebels.
	   Hundreds of people have died and thousands more _ including
Albanians and Serbs _ have fled their homes since late February
after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ordered a crackdown
against Albanian extremists battling for independence.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which along with Montenegro,
forms all that remains of Yugoslavia. Albanians outnumber Serbs in
the province by 9-to-1.
	   On Friday, 25 ethnic Albanian women who fled their homes in
Belacevac, 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Pristina, gathered at
the U.S. Information Service office to appeal for help in returning
home.
	   USIS spokesman Richard Huckaby met with four of the women and
said he would refer their complaints to international observers who
have been touring battle areas.
	   As part of the international campaign to end the violence,
France and Britain plan to introduce a resolution in the U.N.
Security Council threatening new sanctions unless Serb and ethnic
Albanian forces accept a cease-fire and agree to talks on
``substantial autonomy'' for Kosovo.
	   The major powers oppose independence, fearing it could trigger
rebellions in other Balkan countries with substantial Albanian
communities. The United States and European powers want the KLA to
accept the leadership of moderate politician Ibrahim Rugova, who
has disavowed violence.
	   But Rugova also supports independence. On Friday, he called on
Washington and the Europeans to back that call.
	   ``We expect and demand (the Americans and Europeans) to support
our proposal on an independent Kosovo,'' Rugova said.

World Cup final is Ronaldo's last chance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Ronaldo has one game left to
make history. The world's best player knows he hasn't made it yet.
	   ``The moment is coming,'' the Brazilian said, on the eve of
Sunday's World Cup final with France. ``One more, and we will make
history. It is our great challenge.''
	   It also is a personal challenge for Ronaldo. Twice voted FIFA
player of the Year, the 21-year-old striker has yet to produce the
great things expected of him in the Cup.
	   Sure, he leads Brazil's scorers with four goals in six games.
But three teammates have three goals each, and Ronaldo has not been
the dominant force many predicted.
	   Asked to name the key players in Brazil's campaign, coach Mario
Zagallo cited Aldair, Cesar Sampaio, Cafu, Rivaldo and Dunga. Not
Ronaldo.
	   But Zagallo simply holds Ronaldo to a higher standard. He knows
the Inter Milan striker can do better.
	   ``Ronaldo is rising in production every game,'' he said. ``I am
sure the final will be Ronaldo's.''
	   Zagallo has pushed Ronaldo to be more mobile and shake the
double coverage he routinely draws. But Ronaldo doesn't always
follow the coach's advice.
	   In Brazil's semifinal against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was
invisible for much of the first half, then awoke in the second to
score a goal and torment the Dutch defense. It's a pattern that has
recurred throughout the Cup.
	   The explanantions offered for his hot-and-cold play range d from
tendinitis in his knee to an overdeveloped muscle to excess weight.
Ronaldo denies them all.
	   ``Because I won two trophies, people always expect me to resolve
everything,'' he said. ``But nobody wins anything alone. The
responsibility of helping Brazil to be champion is mine but also
the team's.''
	   It's not easy being Ronaldo. Barely five years ago, soccer's
superstar was just another kid from the poor north side of Rio de
Janeiro, trying to make a local team. How life has changed.
	   ``Every day, people ask me if I want to be the best, if I will
be the high scorer, what I think about being constantly on magazine
covers, if all this scares me,'' he said. ``Nothing scares me. I
never was afraid of anything.''
	   But if soccer has changed his life, Ronaldo says he's still the
simple youngster from Bento Ribeiro.
	   ``Nothing has changed in my head. Things happen and I keep
overcoming obstacles. It's like that everywhere I go,'' he said.
``I'm well off financially, but my behavior is the same.''
	   In 1994, he watched from the bench as Romario and Bebeto led
Brazil to its fourth World Cup title. Now, he's ready to take his
role as leader.
	   ``I'll do anything to win. If it takes more sacrifice from me,
I'll do it,'' he said.
	   The way Ronaldo sees it, his job is the same as it was back in
Rio _ score and win. It's just that all Brazil is watching.
	   ``The difference now is that a goal makes the happiness of 160
million people,'' he said.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Contaminated water has killed four
people, including two children, and left 200 more sick in a small
northeastern town, local officials said Friday.
	   The townspeople were forced to drink from cistern and polluted
streams because of a three-month-long drought affecting the region,
said Amarildo Ribeiro, the mayor's Cabinet chief in Santa Luzia, a
town of 8,000, some 870 miles (1,406 kms) northeast of Rio.
	   ``The situation is out of control. We need urgent assistance
from federal and state governments because of the seriousness of
the situation,'' Ribeiro said by telephone.
	   So far, doctors have only tested 12 of the sick, all of whom
have been diagnosed with cholera.
	   Ribeiro said people started suffering from diarrhea and vomiting
around 10 days ago, overwhelming the town's only hospital that has
just 20 beds.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Friday
he would be happy to have the United Nations help Colombia as it
embarks on negotiations to end a 34-year civil war.
	   His comments at a news conference come after the United Nations
issued a statement last week to refute a Bogota report that the
organization would play a key role in peace talks.
	   Annan said he told President-elect Andres Pastrana that ``the
U.N. will be very happy to do whatever we can do in a useful way to
assist Colombia in solving the grave internal problems it has. And
so we stand ready if the government wants us to help. We will do
whatever we can to assist.''
	   Annan was leaving Friday night for the start of a Latin American
trip that will take him to Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Guatemala
and Mexico.
	   Pastrana, who was elected June 21 and takes office in August,
has promised he'll seek direct talks with the country's two largest
rebel groups. Both have responded positively.
	   The United Nations moderated successfully peace talks ending
civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala. Many Colombians see a
similar U.N. role as likely in their country's conflict.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ One of Carlos Menem's top party
rivals said Friday that he would seek a referendum in Argentina's
largest province on whether the president can seek a third term.
	   The announcement by Eduardo Duhalde, governor of Buenos Aires
province, came days after the governor of Menem's hometown of La
Rioja also called for a non-binding vote on the issue.
	   Duhalde's move to hold a non-binding Sept. 13 referendum in
Buenos Aires province _ home to 8 million voters _ came as a
surprise.
	   Duhalde's own presidential aspirations and aversion to any Menem
re-election are well known. While La Rioja province is expected to
overwhelmingly support Menem, he faces far lower popularity ratings
in Buenos Aires province.
	   Although Menem has not said whether he intends to seek another
term, his aides have repeatedly suggested he might do so _ despite
a constitutional prohibition on a third straight term.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A midnight knife fight between rival
prison gangs left three dead Friday at a jail with a history of
problems.
	   ``The same groups are always fighting, because they are selling
drugs,'' Justice Ministry spokesman Josmer Gonzales said of
violence at La Planta prison in Caracas.
	   At least two inmates are killed either by guards or other
prisoners every month in the run-down, overcrowded prison where
weapons possession is rampant, she said.
	   A fire in 1996 killed 25 inmates. Guards allegedly started the
blaze.
	   Venezuela's jails were recently called the most dangerous in the
world by Washington-based Human Rights Watch.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) _ A Mexican army officer accused of
protecting a notorious drug-smuggling family has been ordered to
serve 20 1/2 years in prison on drug charges, the Attorney
General's Office said Friday.
	   Army Brig. Gen. Alfredo Navarro Lara was convicted of crimes
against health for collaborating to promote drug shipments into and
out of Mexico.
	   Navarro Lara was arrested in the northern border city of Tijuana
in March 1997 after he offered dlrs 1 million a month to a top
federal agent to protect the Arellano Felix clan.
	   The agent, chief federal prosecutor Jose Luis Chavez, told
authorities that Navarro had suggested that Chavez and his family
could be killed if he refused.
	   Defense lawyer Antonio Lopez Sotomayor said that while Navarro
Lara recognizes his guilt, he was under pressure from the ``mafia''
to make the bribe attempt and would appeal Thursday's sentence.
	   Navarro Lara was being held at the Almoloya de Juarez
maximum-security prison in Mexico state, 35 miles (55 kilometers)
east of Mexico City.

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Criticized by the
government as biased toward leftist rebels, Catholic Bishop Samuel
Ruiz was honored Friday by Mexican and foreign groups for his
``patriotic'' efforts to bring peace to Chiapas.
	   Some 300 community leaders and groups signed the certificate of
recognition presented to Ruiz, including Nobel Peace Prize
laureates Rigoberta Menchu, the Rev. Desmond Tutu, Oscar Arias
Sanchez of Costa Rica, and the Dalai Lama.
	   The award said Ruiz demonstrated ``authentically patriotic
efforts to make possible an act unknown in the history of the
indigenous people of Mexico.''
	   Ruiz last month ended his efforts to mediate a resolution to the
4 1/2-year-old rebellion by the leftist Zapatista rebels in Chiapas
state, claiming there was growing government ``aggression'' against
his church. The mediation commission he led also disbanded.
	   The controversial bishop led mediation efforts since the
conflict erupted Jan. 1, 1994. The first talks in early 1994 were
held here in his cathedral.
	   Critics accused Ruiz of fomenting the uprising by preaching
social activism and of favoring the Zapatistas in negotiations.
	   In a recent tour of Chiapas, President Ernesto Zedillo made
veiled criticisms of the bishop, saying those ``who are said to be
mediators'' are showing their bias and trying to impose their own
interests.
	   During the simple award ceremony at a coffee shop Friday, Ruiz
said his departure as a mediator was not a resignation but a
condemnation of the path, which one party has chosen as an unviable
attempt at peace.
	   The government on Wednesday called on Zapatista leaders to
resume peace talks, which have been stalled since 1996. It said it
intended to relax tensions in Chiapas by promoting development and
freeing Zapatista rebels and supporters not directly implicated in
violence.
	   Critics say the proposal offers nothing new and said the
government should first withdraw troops from the southern state in
order to foster peace.

Jones, Lickliter tied for midway lead

<TEXT>
	   COAL VALLEY, Illinois (AP) _ Steve Jones got badly needed help
from a drink cooler to rebuild a disintegrating round and grab a
share of the 36-hole lead with Frank Lickliter in the Quad City
Classic.
	   Jones shot a 5-under-par 65 and Lickliter a 64 as they tied at
129, 11 under for two rounds. Defending champion David Toms and
Kenny Perry each shot their second 65s and were at 130.
	   P.H. Horgan III and Russ Cochran, each with 66s, were at 131.
First-day leader Curt Byrum fell into an eight-way tie at 8-under
after shooting a 69. Also at that figure were D.A. Weibring and Hal
Sutton, who started the day a stroke off the lead following
opening-round 64s.
	   Jones, the 1996 U.S. Open champion, started as if he was going
to humble the 6,762-yard (6,153-meter) Oakwood Country Club course.
He eagled No. 10, his first hole of the day, to get to 8-under,
then added birdies on Nos. 14, 15 and 17.
	   His round began to fall apart, however, when he bogeyed Nos. 18
and 1, failing to get up and down after errant approaches.
	   ``I was a little disgusted with myself,'' Jones said. ``All of a
sudden I'm 9 and I'm thinking, `What am I doing?'''
	   More trouble appeared imminent as his tee shot on No. 2 veered
toward the rough. But the ball smacked off a course marshal's
cooler and rolled back into the fairway.
	   Jones took advantage, lofting a wedge to 18 feet (5 1/2 meters)
and making the birdie putt, then tapping in after a great wedge to
within a foot (0.9 meters) at No. 3.
	   He got to 12-under with a birdie at No. 6, but gave the stroke
back on the next hole.
	   Lickliter's round was highlighted by six birdies in his first 11
holes.
	   Lickliter is in his third year on the PGA Tour, and earned half
his career total of dlrs 690,836 in the last year. This year he was
17th in the Western Open and 18th in the U.S. Open.
	   Casey Martin, who won a lawsuit for the right to ride a cart in
PGA tournaments, added a 68 to a first-round 66 and was at 134,
five off the lead and four strokes better than the cut of 2-under
138. Among the victims of the cut was John Daly, who had only a 72
Friday and missed the weekend by a shot. He was among nine players
who failed to qualify after opening with 67s.

United down Galaxy 3-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ John Harkes, Roy Lassiter and Jaime Moreno
scored goals Friday night as D.C. United beat Los Angeles 3-0,
ending the Galaxy's five-game winning streak.
	   The matchup of the top two Major League Soccer teams drew a
season-high 23,631 fans to RFK Stadium, where D.C. has won 10 of 11
games this season.
	   The game featured six of the league's seven top scorers, but it
was United (15-5) who provided all the offense with goals from
Harkes in the 23rd minute, Lassiter in the 34th and Moreno in the
49th.
	   Los Angeles (15-3) came into the game averaging more than three
goals a game, but the Galaxy didn't get a shot on goal until the
78th minute and they were shut out by goalkeeper Scott Garlick.
	   United's first goal came off Marco Etcheverry's corner kick. The
Galaxy defense left Harkes alone in the penalty area and he headed
the ball into the net from 12 yards out.
	   The assist increased Etcheverry's league-leading total to 12.
	   United's second goal started with defender Jeff Agoos stripping
Cobi Jones of the ball in the midfield. On the resulting 3-on-2
break, Lassiter split the defenders and fired a shot from 12 yards
that easily beat Galaxy keeper Kevin Hartman.
	   Moreno scored on a header four minutes into the second half.
	   Mexican star Carlos Hermosillo, who has yet to score in five
games with Los Angeles, was ejected with a red card in the 82nd
minute for a tackle from behind on Lassiter.

<TEXT>
	   NEWPORT, Rhode Island (AP) _ Jason Stoltenberg, trying to become
the first top seed to win the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships,
moved a stepped closer Friday by thrashing seventh-seeded John van
Lottum 6-1, 6-2 in a quarterfinal match.
	   Stoltenberg, a 28-year-old Australian, ousted the only other
seed remaining in the tournament by playing near flawless tennis.
	   ``I felt like I didn't do a thing wrong all day,'' Stoltenberg
said. ``I came out firing today.''
	   Stoltenberg won 66 percent of the points in the match and 83
percent of his service points.
	   ``He played unbelievable, said van Lottum, a 22-year-old from
the Netherlands. ``I got overclassed today.''
	   Stoltenberg does not appear fazed by the Newport jinx, which has
prevented a No. 1 seed from capturing this tournament.
	   ``All things have to come to an end,'' he said.
	   Although he claims not to be superstitious, Stoltenberg did joke
that he may try to repeat his regimen so that he can play as well
in the semifinal round Saturday.
	   ``I'll eat the same stuff, sleep the same way, get out of bed
the same way and put my left shoe on first,'' he said, noting that
the only habit he really does have is putting his left shoe on
first.
	   In another quarterfinal, Neville Godwin of South Africa overcame
a match point in the second set tiebreaker to defeat Justin
Gimbelstob 6-7, 7-6, 6-3. Gimbelstob was suffering from a cramp in
his leg, which bothered him more and more as the match went on. He
needed a medical timeout when he was down 4-3 in the third set.
	   Godwin, ranked 170th on the ATP tour, will face Stoltenberg in
one semifinal match. The other will feature Leander Paes of India
against Laurence Tieleman of Italy.
	   Paes defeated Rainier Schuttler of Germany 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 to
advance to the semifinal round of this tournament for the third
straight year. He lost to the eventual champion both times.
	   Tieleman, whose 15 career ATP victories have come on grass,
knocked out Mark Knowles 6-4, 7-5, rallying from a 4-1 deficit in
the first set.

Eleven arrests in Toronto abortion protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Eleven abortion-rights demonstrators were
arrested Friday at the Ontario Legislature while trying to
challenge an anti-abortion rally led by American activists.
	   The protesters were charged with mischief after sitting on the
road, blocking traffic and crossing a police line that separated
them from the rival rally.
	   Ralph Ovadal, of the Wisconsin-based Missionaries to the
Preborn, led about 100 anti-abortionists in the noon rally. He said
a quarter of the group's supporters came from the United States.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ George Foreman and Larry Holmes will fight on
Jan. 23, 13 days after Foreman's 50th birthday.
	   Holmes will be 49 by the time of the fight at a site expected to
be announced at a news conference Wednesday in New York.
	   The date was confirmed Friday by Roger Levitt of Boxing
International, promoter of the pay-per-view match between the two
former heavyweight champions.
	   Levitt said the fight could be held at Las Vegas, Houston or New
York. New York's Madison Square Garden, however, appears to be a
long shot.

Secretary-General to talk Chiapas in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with five grafs with Mexican foreign ministry response. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan hasn't ruled
out a possible U.N. mediating role for the rebellion in the
southern Mexican state of Chiapas.
	   At a news conference Friday to launch his five-nation Latin
American trip, Annan said he was reviewing documents from
govermnent officials and non-governmental organizations about the
issues.
	   When asked if he would consider a role of a mediator in the
conflict, Annan responded: ``I think it depends on what happens on
the ground and what sort of discussions we have and what sort of
requests come to me. Right now I am studying the material that I
have been given, and it will depend very much on what happens when
I am on the ground.''
	   The Mexican foreign ministry issued a statement saying that by
offering information about attempts to resolve the conflict, the
government ``in no way means to invite those receiving it to take
any action.''
	   ``On several occasions the foreign secretary has reiterated that
this is a conflict between Mexicans that will be resolved between
Mexicans,'' the statement added.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ The New York Yankees won their
eighth straight game Friday night, getting three-run homers by
Chuck Knoblauch and Scott Brosius to beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
8-4.
	   The Yankees improved the top record in the majors to 63-20,
winning for the 13th time in 15 games. New York kept pace with the
1902 Pittsburgh Pirates for the best start this century through 83
games.
	   Tampa Bay lost its eighth in a row.
	   Hideki Irabu (7-3) won for the first time since June 10. He
allowed Fred McGriff's solo home run and Dave Martinez's
inside-the-park homer.
	   Ramiro Mendoza pitched 2 2-3 scoreless innings innings for his
first save. Wilson Alvarez (4-6) took the loss.
 &UR; Indians 6, Twins 5 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, David Justice had an RBI single off Greg Swindell
with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth for Cleveland.
	   Minnesota's Mike Trombley (3-3) walked David Bell on a 3-2 pitch
leading off the ninth. Kenny Lofton singled to right off Swindell
to send pinch-runner Shawon Dunston to third with nobody out.
	   Swindell walked Omar Vizquel intentionally to load the bases for
Justice, who gave Cleveland its seventh last at-bat victory at home
with a ground single to right past a drawn-in infield.
	   Mike Jackson (1-1) pitched a perfect ninth for the victory.
	   Travis Fryman hit his 15th for Cleveland. Minnesota's Ron Coomer
was 4-for-5 for his fourth career four-hit game, including his 12th
homer.
 &UR; Orioles 3, Red Sox 2 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Eric Davis homered off Pedro Martinez in the
eighth inning to snap a tie and lift Baltimore past Boston.
	   Davis, who replaced an injured Harold Baines in the sixth, hit a
1-0 pitch over the center-field wall with two outs. It was his 12th
homer of the season and first since June 20. Mike Bordick also
homered for Baltimore.
	   Martinez (11-3), vying for his sixth straight victory, allowed
three runs and five hits in eight innings. Jesse Orosco (3-1)
pitched 1 1-3 innings and Armando Benitez retired John Valentin for
his 11th save.
	   Mo Vaughn hit his 22nd homer for Boston.
 &UR; White Sox 10, Royals 3 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Albert Belle homered twice and matched a career high
with six RBIs as Chicago beat Kansas City.
	   It was the 31st multihomer game of Belle's career, and fourth
this season. Belle has 21 home runs, marking the eighth straight
year he's hit 20 or more. Ray Durham also homered for Chicago.
	   Jaime Navarro (7-10) gave up eight hits and three runs over 7
2-3 innings. Jose Rosado (3-7) took the loss.
	   Jeff Conine homered for Kansas City.
 &UR; Tigers 3, Blue Jays 2, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Deivi Cruz's 10th-inning RBI double pushed Detroit
past Toronto.
	   Joe Randa hit a one-out, infield single off Paul Quantrill (1-4)
and stole second. Paul Bako was intentionally walked before Cruz
lined the next pitch into the right-field gap to score Randa with
the winning run.
	   Todd Jones (1-3) pitched a perfect 10th for the victory.
	   Luis Gonzalez homered and Geronimo Berroa had an RBI single for
the Tigers. Ed Sprague hit a home run for the Blue Jays.
