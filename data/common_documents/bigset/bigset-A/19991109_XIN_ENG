<HEADLINE> Annan recommends to Extend Mandate of UNMOT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday recommended to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) for
another period of six months until May, 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the United Nations Security Council, Annan
said during the last three months, the peace process in Tajikistan
has made further progress, with the constitutional referendum and
the lifting of the ban on the United Tajik Opposition political
parties.
</P>
<P>
The last major event of the transition period envisaged in the
General Agreement will be the parliamentary elections, to be held
before the term of the current parliament expires at the end of
February 2000, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
As the constitution period nears its end, UNMOT approaches the
completion of its assignment, and although the peace process has
been marred by recurrent serious crises and the implementation of
the General Agreement has been far from perfect, it has served its
fundamental purpose, which was to set Tajikistan on the course of
national reconciliation and democratization, the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
Close international involvement remains essential to assist
Tajikistan in any political tension, to ensure that they are
resolved by peaceful means rather than by violence, and in this
context, there is a continuing requirement for supporting the
process leading to the elections of the new parliament, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
It is widely held that a continued political presence of
the United Nations in the country would greatly assist in
ensuring that Tajikistan can consolidate the path of peace and
national reconciliation, said Annan, adding that he inteded to
outline in an interim report following the parliamentary
elections, a possible political role for the United Nations in
this respect that the Security Council may wish to consider.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) has sent its condolences to the family
of former president Kenneth Kaunda on the death of his son.
</P>
<P>
MMD Information Chairman Vernon Mwaanga told the press here
Monday that Wezi Kaunda, who was shot at the gate of his Lusaka
residence last Wednesday evening and died in hospital on the
following day morning, had made a great contribution to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He described Wezi as an active politician who had a lot to
achieve in life.
</P>
<P>
Mwaanga urged people not to draw hasty decisions over the
shooting accident, adding that the case is in the hands of the
police and investigations are being made.
</P>
<P>
He bemoaned the fact that a number of reporters from
government-run media and some members of the opposition United
National Independence Party (UNIP) led by Kaunda were harassed
because the UNIP members were suspected of being behind of the
killing of Wezi.

<HEADLINE> French President Meets With Arafat, Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
met on Monday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak in two separate meetings at the Elysee
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak, both of whom were in Paris to attend a
Socialist International congress, did not have their own meeting
here.
</P>
<P>
The meetings were held one day after French president received
the son of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad, at
the Elysee palace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine also make a
trip to Syria and Lebanon next week to discuss possible French
mediation between the two Arab countries and Israel in a
resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made after his meeting with Chirac, Arafat said
that Israel must respect the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 242 which asks the Jewish state to withdraw from all
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
He said that this resolution served as the basis not only for
the early stages of the peace process such as the Madrid
conference and the Oslo talks, but also for the Charm-el-Sheikh
framework agreement signed last month.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said on Sunday that
Resolution 242 was not suitable for application in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who was in Paris for a second time within one month,
said that he agreed with the French president that ``all should be
done to end 100 years of conflict in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
He said that it is time for Israel to ``make brave man's
peace'' with Syria.
</P>
<P>
``We should work simultaneously on three wings (of peace
process): Israeli-Palestinian, Syrian-Israeli and
Lebanese-Israeli, in a way in which all the parties would win in
the light of what would push forward the peace process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He denied that Chirac delivered to him a letter from Syrian
president.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria suspended their peace talks after former Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in mid-1995.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Israel to Accelerate Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein Monday called on Israel to speed up the peace process with
its Arab neighbors to pave the way for economic development and
construction in the region.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal during his meeting with two members of the
British House of Lords Howard Griffle and Ahmad Nazzer, Jordan's
official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah stressed that the majority of Arab people aspire for
true peace and are willing to live in peace, and Israel should
respond to the aspirations and speed up the peace process in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The monarch said people in the region have suffered a lot in
decades of Arab-Israeli conflicts, and it is now the time to tap
all potential in favor of peace and building up the future.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated Jordan's support for the Palestinians,
Syria and Lebanon to regain their rights and occupied
territories, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
On the ongoing final status talks between Israel and the
Palestinians, Abdullah expressed hope that an agreement will be
reached within a comprehensive framework that addresses all
issues, particularly the refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Palestinian refugees fled their home during
decades of war with the Jewish state, and Jordan currently has
some 1.2 million registered Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Amman supported the rights of the refugees of either returning
to their home or asking for compensation, though most of the
refugees have been given Jordanian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has said on many occasions that the refugee issue has
become one of the core issues that should be addressed in the
final status talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and for years
it has been actively promoting the peace process between Israel
and its Arab neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Strongly React on U.S. Withdraw From ABM: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia will consider
asymmetrical measures to meet the United States' drive for
revising the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, said an
influential Russian State Duma deputy Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will have to cough up a little more for an asymmetrical
answer -- the perfection of the system for bypassing the (U.S.)
missile defense system, if Washington withdraws from the ABM
Treaty," said Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Russian Duma
Committee for International Affairs in an interview with the Ekho
Moskvy radio station.
</P>
<P>
"I think we shall find an inexpensive way of bypassing
anti-missile defense, particularly the fragile system the U.S. may
build at the initial stage," said Lukin.
</P>
<P>
Russia is not violating the ABM Treaty as it has the right to
improve what it has, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the Start-2 strategic arms reduction treaty, Lukin said
its fate is related with the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
He noted there are signs of a "cooling" in disarmament between
Russia and the United States.

PARIS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- France has lifted its holding on
a sub-marine and several Mirage fighters of Pakistan, which were
blocked from leaving after the military coup d'etat of October 12
in Pakistan, Agence France-Presse quoted officials as saying on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Francois Bureau, a spokesman of the French Defense
Ministry, said that an unspecified number of Mirage fighters sold
to Pakistan, and the submarine Agosta 90 which was in France for
equipping itself with modern technologies, can leave France at any
moment they want.
</P>
<P>
He said that the greenlight allowing the Pakistani armaments to
leave France coincides with a change of the evaluation of the
situation in Pakistan by France.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine met in Paris last week
with a Pakistani government envoy, former Foreign Minister Yakub
Khan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret said that France would continue to "exercise the
greatest vigilance" against arms sale to Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Mitchell Back in Belfast for Crucial N.Irish talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator George Mitchell
was back in Belfast on Monday on the last leg of a campaign to
break the deadlock of the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was expected to discuss a blueprint for ending a
standoff over demands for guerrilla disarmament and creation of
new political structures.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Mitchell might make an announcement within 48
hours about the result of his talks which were the core of a
10-week-long review of the troubled peace accord signed in April
last year.
</P>
<P>
Pro-British unionists refuse to sit in a coalition government
with the Sinn Fein party unless its Irish Republican Army (IRA)
guerrilla wing disarms.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell brokered the Good Friday agreement in April 1998.
Britain and Ireland brought him back into the peace process in the
hope that his diplomatic skills would produce a compromise between
the parties and trigger a fresh start for the accord.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell adjourned the talks last week, saying he wanted to
consult with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern and U.S. President Bill Clinton before
completing a report on the review of the peace accord.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Profits Slump 38 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- British Airways (BA) reported
Monday a 38 percent slump in profits as cut-throat competition for
passengers has taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
It is said that rising fuel prices, the strength of sterling
and the fact that there are too many seats on offer to too few
passengers have all taken their toll on BA's profit levels.
</P>
<P>
The airline reported pre-tax profit in the quarter to end
September fell 83.3 percent to 40 million pounds and operating
profits for the first six months fell 51.5 percent to 211 million.
</P>
<P>
But BA's chief executive Bob Ayling defended the results,
saying all major airlines had been hit by the same problems.
"These figures were better than our shareholders expected, so I
hope we get some credit for that," he said.
</P>
<P>
While most airlines have been increasing capacity, BA has
announced it will cut capacity by 12 percent over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
By flying a fleet of smaller planes that hold fewer economy
passengers but a greater number of business travellers, BA hopes
to boost profitability over the next two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
BA also said a one billion pound-per-year cost-cutting program
was on track, and reiterated that an extra 225 million pounds
would be saved this financial year as 1,000 jobs are shed.

MOSCOW, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal units are
narrowing the encircling of the Chechen capital Grozny and
launched heavy air strikes on it, reported Russian media Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Russian troops Monday
started to make heavy air force and artillery bombardment over
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Bombs made craters about seven meters deep and 12 meters in
diameter at the intersection of Lenin Avenue and Nuradilov Street
in the center of the city, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Targets have also been reportedly heat in the vicinity of
Bogdan Khmelnitsky Street leading to the airport, in Oktyabrsky,
Zavodskoi and Staropromyslovy districts of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The press secretary of Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov told
reporters that there are numerous dead and wounded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian federal units advancing from the West
attacked the village of Yermolovka (Alkhan-Kala), several
kilometers from the Chechen capital's Zavodskoi distrit.
</P>
<P>
"The units have captured new objectives. In particular, the
part of Gudermes to be cleared by units under my command is
already free," the Interfax quoted General Gennady Troshev,
commander of the eastern federal army group as saying in a program
telecast.
</P>
<P>
He said that the reconnaissance-in-force Sunday confirmed that
there are still 80 to 100 militants in Gudermes, the second
biggest city of the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
The Russian air force Sunday continued missile strikes and
bombing over the positions of militants in Chechnya, killing, by
early reports, about 150 of them and destroying 18 vehicles of the
rebels, said a Russian military source Monday.

<HEADLINE> Africans Urged to Find Solution to Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
African Renaissance Institute (ARI) said here Monday that Africans
should play a key role in solving conflict and other problems in
the continent.
</P>
<P>
Washington Okumu, executive director of the ARI, said that
Africa is facing a new danger in the proliferation of ethnic
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for non-Africans to fully comprehend the
African socio- political ethos for them to be able to mediate
effectively and successfully in African ethnic conflict."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the support of the outside the world, he said:
"The central role in mediation an negotiation should be undertaken
by the African themselves."
</P>
<P>
Okumu made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the
All-Africa Conference on African Principles of Conflict Resolution
and Reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the United Nations and the world community to
support the use of preventive diplomacy in Africa, stressing that
preventive diplomacy is an important and integral part of
peace-making.
</P>
<P>
He complained that since its founding, the UN had been mainly
concerned and pre-occupied with peace-keeping operation rather
than paying particular attention to taking early preventive action
to avoid conflicts actually happening.
</P>
<P>
Preventive diplomacy should be the corner stone of international
 relations in the 21st century, Okumu added.
</P>
<P>
The ARI was established four weeks ago in Gaborne, Botswana.

<HEADLINE> Labor Government Suffers Defeat on Welfare Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The British Labor government
suffered a defeat in the House of Lords on Monday in the latest
clash over its controversial Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill.
</P>
<P>
An amendment tabled by Baroness Strange, allowing younger war
widows with children to keep their dead husbands' occupational
pension rights, was backed by 153 votes to 140.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, who are facing several further possible defeats
on the bill in the Lords on Monday evening, have refused to make
further concessions beyond those announced last week.
</P>
<P>
However, rebel peers led by disability campaigner Lord Ashley,
have threatened to return the bill to the House of Commons over
the government's changes to the way incapacity benefit is paid.
</P>
<P>
Lord Ashley told peers that some of the measures in the bill
amounted to "an unjustified attack on disabled people."
</P>
<P>
Ministers have threatened that the deal to keep on 92
hereditary peers after the first stage of House of Lords reform
could be off if any of its major legislation is blocked in the
upper chamber.
</P>
<P>
The Labor leader of the Lords, Baroness Jay, warned peers
against voting down the welfare reform bill.
</P>
<P>
Last week, 54 Labor backbenchers staged a Commons revolt
against the proposals.
</P>
<P>
With the parliamentary session due to end on Thursday, there is
a danger that the flagship bill, which includes provision for
other welfare reforms important to the government, could be lost
if neither House backs down.

ABU DHABI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) this year is expected to
rise by 8 percent over last year, thanks to the oil price hikes in

A statement of the Central Bank said Monday that the "UAE

It went on to defend the free market policy adopted by the
state since it was founded in 1971 as "a prudent policy, from
which the country has benefited a great deal."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Warns Against Marginalization of Africa in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Monday warned that the marginalization of the African
continent may jeopardize the world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium on basic commodities in Africa, Moussa
cautioned against the tendency that Africa is being marginalized
on the world economic map.
</P>
<P>
"The social, economic and political shortcomings of the
marginalization could result in a state of instability, which will
negatively affect the continent," Moussa told the five-day
symposium opened here in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry and the Dutch Fund for Basic
Commodities organized the symposium. Representatives of African
countries, the Organization of African Unity, the Geneva-based
International Trade Center, the African Export and Import bank and
a host of experts and specialists took part in the event.
</P>
<P>
The participants will discuss the general situation of the
basic commodities which earn the majority of foreign currencies
for African countries.
</P>
<P>
"There are indications that show the marginalization of Africa,
including the reduction of its share of the world exports to 2
percent," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the annual direct foreign investment in Africa
stands at 6.4 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for a minor 1.6
percent of the world's total of 400 billion dollars, the Egyptian
official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the third sign of marginalization of Africa is
the back-breaking indebtedness, which drains most of the
continent's foreign currency urgently needed for development of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Moussa called for support for the efforts exerted by Africa's
least developed countries to attract investments to promote
infrastructure and technology transfer in a bid to enable them to
sidestep the economic hardships resulting from the ups and downs
of the basic commodities in the world markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
Monday expressed the hope for the reconvention of the Burundi
peace talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete stressed that Tanzania does not
want to see the issue of finding a new facilitator in Burundi
peace talks to succeed former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere
being used as a pretext for delaying the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Swedish Regional Meeting on East Africa held
here Monday, Kikwete said: "We hope the question of appointing a
new facilitator will be resolved soon."
</P>
<P>
"But we prefer to see the Burundi peace talks reconvene as soon
as possible while the international community and the parties
involved continue to search for a qualified person to do this
job," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said the Tanzanian government recognizes the right of
all parties in the Burundi conflict to be fully involved in the
process of choosing the facilitator, but this right should be used
judiciously to avoid undue delays in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming regional meeting on Burundi conflict later this
month in Tanzania's northern city Arusha is expected to resolve
the issue of facilitator and thus pave the way for negotiations on
all aspects of the peace process, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> France Urges D.R.Congo to Provide Security to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- France Monday urged the two
conflicting sides of the Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R.Congo)
to offer sufficient security to the 90 United Nations observers
being deployed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council resolution 1273 recommended
the deployment of 90 observers, or liaison officers, in the
D.R.Congo and its neighboring countries. Thirty-nine of them are
already in the D.R.Congo with a mandate to stay until January
2000.
</P>
<P>
However, reports from the D.R.Congo said that the peace process
there remains very fragile with both the D.R.Congo government and
rebels accusing each other of violating the ceasefire agreement
signed in July in Lusaka, Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has also
recommended the deployment of 500 military observers and creating
a mission of observers of the United Nations in the D.R.Congo.
</P>
<P>
"In order to allow the rapid deployment of these liaison
officers, France calls on all the signing parties of the Lusaka
agreement, in particular the government of D.R.Congo, to provide
as quickly as possible the security guarantees demanded by the
U.N. secretary general," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She also said that France supports the proposal by the U.N.
secretary general to send 500 military observers to the D.R.Congo.
</P>
<P>
The D.R.Congo and some African countries involved in the
conflict of the Great Lakes region signed the Lusaka agreement on
ceasefire in July, while the D.R.Congo rebels signed it at the end
of August.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt Troops Capture 2 UNITA Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) have
captured two camps serving to supply food for the rebel troops
near Andulo, former military headquarters of the rebel National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), official sources
said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the camps locating about 20 kilometers from Andulo,
thousands of people, including women and children, were found
working for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
These people were drawn from various urban or rural areas in
the central plateau because they failed to fulfill the quota of
food supplies for the rebel troops.
</P>
<P>
According to a decree issued by UNITA, each farmhouse living in
the central plateau must provide the rebel troops with 100
kilograms of alimentary goods every year while the quota for a
single individual was 50 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
After the capture of Andulo and Bailundo by the government
troops, roads leading to the camps were cleared and the workers in
the camps were allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
"We were UNITA's slaves," said 50-year-old Albino Culekalaga,
adding that he was maltreated and had been twice whipped.
</P>
<P>
Oali Limwe, chief of a village, 63, was also obliged to carry
food bags for the rebel troops. "I'm the Soba (chief of tribe),
but they respect nobody," he said.

<P>
PARIS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- France has condemned the attack
in Israel on Sunday which injured 27 people in Netanya, north of
Tel Aviv, one day before the opening of talks on the final status
of Palestinian territories by Israel and Palestinian authorities.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman of the French Foreign Ministry Anne
Gazeau-Secret Monday accused the "adversaries of peace" of trying
to "lock" the peace process with attacks.
</P>
<P>
She called on Israel and Palestine to carry forward with "the
greatest ever" determination their talks, which began on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the talks which have begun will allow all the
sides to bring to a successful conclusion all the questions of the
definite status of the Palestinian territories in the fixed time
limit," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian officials began Monday morning in
Ramallah, West Bank, their talks on the final status of
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The talks are focused on the status of Jerusalem, including the
eastern part of the city occupied by Israel since 1967, the right
of returning to their homeland of some 3 million Palestinian
refugees driven out of home from 1948 to 1967, and the creation of
a Palestinian state on a part of West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Monday urged
Israel to respect the United Nations Security Council resolution
242 which asks Israel to withdraw from Palestinian territories of
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who was in Paris to attend a Socialist International
congress, said that the U.N. resolution 242 served as the
foundation of the early stages of the peace process which began
with the Madrid conference and the Oslo talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said on Sunday that the U.N.
resolution 242 was not suitable for West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Help in Combating Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Vice President for
Executive Affairs Mohammad Hashemi on Monday called on
international organizations and the United Nations to offer more
help to Iran in its fight against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Iranian anti-drug
headquarters, Hashemi said that for the time being,
international organizations should help Afghan farmers replace
poppy cultivation with other products to reduce the supply of drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The Afghan farmers say if they plant cotton, the proceeds
would be more than poppy, because the drug traffickers get main
part of poppy incomes," the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
Hashemi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of the anti-drug headquarters Mohammad
Fallah said 125 Iranian soldiers have been martyred in
fighting with drug traffickers in the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Iranian police have seized 163 tons of drugs since
the beginning of the Iranian calendar year (which started March
21) and arrested 130,000 people involved in drug cases.
</P>
<P>
Iran frequently complained that it has been fighting alone
against drug trafficking which mainly targets at Europe.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari on Monday
also blamed European countries for not offering serious
assistance to Iran in combating drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately Iran stands alone in its campaign against
illicit drugs and Europeans usually do not proceed beyond
expressing regret or mere words which are not backed by any
tangible support, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, an official of the U.N. Drug Control Programs (UNDCP)
told the seminar that Iran should not feel alone in its campaign
against drug trafficking, the anti-drug campaign is an
international drive.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UNDCP has extended 12.7 billion U.S. dollars
in assistance to Iran, but taking the extensive dimension of drugs
smuggling in the region into consideration, the assistance is not
enough.
</P>
<P>
Fallah said last month that Iran spends over 8,000 billion
rials (about 2.67 billion dollars) annually on fighting drug
trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Iran Sign Deals Worth 200 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran has signed 200 million U.S.
dollars worth of business and trade contracts with Egypt during an
exhibition of Iranian products in Cairo, an official of the
Islamic republic said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The contracts and deals signed between Iranian and Egyptian
companies will be implemented in the coming three or four years,
Iranian Deputy Minister of Commerce Mojabati Khosrotaj told a
press conference on the seven-day exhibition closed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Khosrotaj, also chairman of Iran's Exhibitions Authority, said
the exhibition "achieved remarkable success" toward the
improvement of trade relations after 20 years of disruption.
</P>
<P>
The official, whet just as their Egyptian counterparts attach
importance to the Iranian market.
</P>
<P>
Tehran severed diplomatic ties with Cairo in 1979 after Egypt
signed a peace treaty with Israel, but did not cut off the
economic relations. Since the moderate Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami took office in August 1997, the two countries have been
exerting efforts to improve the political relations and seek ways
of enhancing economic, investment and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The latest exhibition of Iranian products was organized by the
Iranian Ministry of Commerce in collaboration with the Egyptian
Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade. The products included car
and car parts, medicines and medical equipment, machines, food,
chemicals, electric appliances and handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
Under agreements reached between the two sides, Iran will
participate in the Cairo International Fair due to open in March
while an exhibition of Egyptian products will be held in Iran in
April, Khosrotaj said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the meetings with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa, Minister of Industry Moustafa el-Rafay and other Egyptian
officials, Khosrotaj said the meetings were "fruitful and
constructive."
</P>
<P>
He said he and Moussa dealt with ways of expanding bilateral
relations in the various fields.

KAMPALA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart Pasteur Bizimungu Monday
reaffirmed their commitment to the Lusaka agreement on cease-fire
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
They made the promise while holding talks on bilateral

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges UN to Defend Principles of Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday urged the
United Nations to condemn the Unted States for training
"terrorists" opposed to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz called his attention to a report
published by The New York Times on October 28, 1999, concerning the
military training that the United States is to provide for
mercenary groups of Iraqi nationals.
</P>
<P>
The letter quoted The New York Times as saying "The
administration has authorized the first direct military training
for opponents of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, senior
officials said today," and "...American officials will school them
on how to organize a military in an emerging state. Other courses
are being prepared."
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the foregoing leaves no rooms for doubt that the
provision of funding and training to these terrorists by the
United States of America means that it is a state that sponsors
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The action in question also comes within days of the
adoption by consensus of Security Council resolution 1269(1999),
and this provides a further indication of the contempt in which
the United States holds the resolution of the Security Council,
Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Such actions on the part of the United States against Iraq
require the international community and its institutions to
respond with rejection and condemnation they deserve, the
Deputy Prime Minister said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has a legal and moral responsibility to
defend the principles of the Charter and, to oppose attempts to
undermine the unity and independence of its member states and to
reject a United States policy that seeks to return the
international community to the law of the jungle and the rule of
brute force, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The United States announced late last month that it was
starting its first direct military training of opponents to
Saddam Hussein at the Florida base.

<HEADLINE> Debt Dispute Threatens U.S. Role in U.N., Paper Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Even if Washington coughs up
its back dues to the United Nations, the United States has seen "a
precipitous loss of influence" in the United Nations, the U.S.
daily newspaper "Boston Globe" reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The senior U.N. officials predicted that the new U.S.
ambassador to the U.N., Richard Holbrooke would face renewed
hostility no matter what the outcome in U.S. Congress on U.N.
arrears over a U.S. demand that it pay a smaller share of U.N.
costs.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the back pay issue is resolved within seven weeks, the
cost kick in quickly under U.N. by laws," the newspaper said. "For
example, American companies may be barred from bidding on millions
of dollars in U.N. contracts."
</P>
<P>
U.S. vendors now take home 47 percent of U.N. purchases. The
United States also would lose its vote in the General Assembly
next year.
</P>
<P>
At present, the United States owes the United Nations some 1.7
billion U.S. dollars in arrears. The U.S. reluctance to pay its
back dues in full, in time and without any condition has long
plunged the world body into serious financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The United States has to pay at least 350 million U.S. dollars
by the end of the year in order to save the face without losing
the voting right at the General Assembly next year.
</P>
<P>
The Article 19 of the U.N. Charter said, "A Member of the
United Nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial
contributions to the Organization shall have no vote in the
General Assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds
the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two
full years."
</P>
<P>
"The anxiety and anger toward the U.S. Congress for holding up
nearly 1.7 billion (U.S.) dollars in arrears, according to U.N.
calculations, became clear during meetings with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and 14 of his top deputies over two
days last week," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"It will be much worse, though, if Congress doesn't pay part of
the dues by year's end," the newspaper quoted Holbrooke as saying.
"If that happens, we will be just stumbling through the next year
and a half" until the next U.S. president takes office.

<HEADLINE> Russia Unhappy With Some U.N., NATO Moves in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Russian ambassador
to the United Nations said Monday in Pristina, capital of the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, that some measures taken by the U.N.
Interim Administration Mission (UNMIK) and the NATO-led
international peacekeeping force had not helped preserve a
multi-ethnic society in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Lavrov, the Russian representative to the United
Nations, made the statement after he began a two-day visit to
Kosovo Sunday, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador also acknowledged that international
officials in Kosovo met a difficult task.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he was not accusing them of deliberately
disobeying U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244, which, adopted
on June 10, governs the presence of the UNMIK and the
45,000-strong international peacekeeping force, known as KFOR.
</P>
<P>
"We believed that some of the actions taken by KFOR and UNMIK
leadership were not entirely helpful from the point of view of
keeping the multiethnic nature of this place," Lavrov said after a
meeting with U.N. mission head Bernard Kouchner, who is a French.
</P>
<P>
When Russia chaired the Security Council last month, it
demanded more frequent reports from UNMIK and made clear it was
not happy with some aspects of its work, mission officials said.
</P>
<P>
Like the Yugoslav Government, Russia has expressed particular
disapproval at the creation of the so-called lightly armed Kosovo
Protection Corps, to be staffed overwhelmingly by former rebel
fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army.

GENEVA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Federal Transport
Ministry has given permission to the latest stage of plans to
upgrade the country's main airport of Zurich-Kloten.

Voters in canton Zurich approved the fifth extension plans
costing over two billion Swiss francs (about 1.3 billion U.S.

There have been growing tensions between those who want to
develop the airport to keep up to international standards and cope
with increasing flight movements and those who live nearby.
</P>
<P>
While acknowleging the economic importance of the airport, the
ministry also decided to extend the night time flight ban by half
an hour and called for increased efforts to adhere to

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Slovenia Sign Air Transport Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Slovenia signed an
air transport agreement here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Cyprus' Communications and Works
Minister Averof Neophytou and visiting Slovenian Minister of
Transport and Communications Anton Bergauer.
</P>
<P>
The agreement outlines the right of scheduled flights between
the two countries in transporting passengers, cargo and mail.
</P>
<P>
It also opens prospect for further cooperation in air transport
between the two countries, said Neophytou.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries share the mutual aim and vision of
"accession in the same European family."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus along with Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, Estonia and the
Czech Republic started substantive accession negotiations with
the European Union last November.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed cooperation in the fields of road
transport and maritime, said the minister, adding that in February
2000 the two sides will work on details before signing the
cooperation agreements in the two fields.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Slovenian minister said that the agreement
will contribute to reinforcing commercial and tourism exchanges
between Cyprus and Slovenia.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Introduce Code of Sexual Conduct for Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary Geoff
Hoon said on Monday that Britain would introduce a code of sexual
conduct for its troops.
</P>
<P>
Hoon told parliament the code was part of the government's
response to a European court's rule in September.
</P>
<P>
In September, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that
homosexuals should not be barred from the armed forces and that
Britain's ban on homosexuals in the military was a breach of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
"In the light of the decision of the European Court of Human
Rights it is clear we need a revised policy that sustains
operational effectiveness and is within the law," Hoon said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Secretary, who came into power last month after his
predecessor George Robertson went to Brussels to take the role of
the Secretary-General of NATO, said the code was necessary to
maintain discipline and efficiency in British army, navy and air
force.
</P>
<P>
British policy currently holds that "homosexuality, whether
male or female, is considered incompatible with service in the
armed forces".
</P>
<P>
But the European Court of Human Rights, hearing the first case
of its kind against Britain, ruled in September that four
homosexuals should be compensated for what it said was their
wrongful dismissal from the armed forces.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Withdraw Diplomats From Moscow Due to Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
withdraw some embassy employees in Russia and three other
ex-Soviet states to avoid risks which may be caused by the Y2K
computer problems, The New York Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper quoted experts as saying that there is
virtually no risk to diplomats from the computer problem although
there may be some disruption in telephone communication and
electrical power in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The cost of withdrawing those with wish to leave could run
into millions of dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"It reflects anxiety in Washington and among some government
employees in Moscow, but is also being encouraged by the State
Department's bureaucratic procedures," the report added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department made the decision after officials
agreed that Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova will be among
countries worst affected by the 2000 changeover glitch.
</P>
<P>
The Year 2000 problem could affect computers that have been
programmed to read only the last two digits of a year. Unless
adjustments are made, they could read the year 2000 as 1900,
interfering with public utilities, aviation, banks and other
enterprises that use computers.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times said that Russia seems well prepared for the
Y2K problem. American experts have concluded that the risk of
the accidental launch of a Russian nuclear missile will be
virtually nil.
</P>
<P>
Russia's electricity monopoly says it plans to change over to
manual control on December 31 to prevent computer problems, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan President Predicts Cabinet Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Moldovan government will
inevitably have to resign, said Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi
at a press conference in capital of Chisinau on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In current situation, there are no other options except the
resignation of the cabinet and the formation of a new government,"
the Interfax news agency quoted Lucinschi as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, 52 parliament deputies demanded that a vote of
no-confidence be passed on the government. The demand is to be
considered within three days.
</P>
<P>
Lucinschi also said that he is already thinking of a new
candidacy for prime minister, but will make proposals only after
consultations with the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He sharply criticized the Ion Struza government, describing as
"far-fetched" its macro-economic successes. He quoted facts which
suggest that the situation in the real economic sector is much
worse than it was a year ago.

SHENYANG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build five
urban railway lines spanning a total length of 182.5 km in
Shenyang starting in the year 2001, local officials said.
</P>

over 70 percent of the trains, and more than 80 percent of the
accessory machinery to be domestic products.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that they have negotiated with over 30 financial

<HEADLINE> Lockout Costs Vancouver Port Daily 89 million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada's busiest port of
Vancouver is suffering a daily loss of 89 million Canadian dollars
(about 61 million U.S. dollars) from an on-going lockout.
</P>
<P>
The country's CTV television reported Monday that the Port of
Vancouver and all the other ports in British Columbia have come to
a standstill after 2,000 longshoremen walked off their jobs Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Eighty-nine million dollars worth of trade a day will cease
through the port of Vancouver," the port authority was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"It affects just about every major industry in the West --
agriculture, mining, the forest industry" and it also "affects
trade with 90 countries," according to the authority.
</P>
<P>
The lockout came after months of bargaining between the local
union and the employers' association over a three-year contract on
pay rise.
</P>
<P>
The union has rejected a raise of 1.30 Canadian dollars (about
0.89 U.S. dollars) an hour over three years. It also holds that
the latest offer of 2.40 Canadian dollars (about 1.6 U.S. dollars)
an hour over four years isn't much different from the earlier one.

<HEADLINE> Norway's Participation in EU Security Cooperation Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stockholm, November 8 (Xinhua)-- Three countries of the
European Union expressed their hope here Monday that Norway will
participate in the organization's security cooperation to
strengthen the peace-keeping action in this continent.
</P>
<P>
This came after a summit held in Stockholm between five north
European countries: Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway and Iceland.
The first three are EU members.
</P>
<P>
The leaders indicated in a joint news conference that they are
planning to establish a united force to carry out EU-mandated
peace-keeping action and Norway is indispensable in the plan.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Bondevik in his remarks seemed
to accept the plan but said his country should enjoy the same
rights as in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Some EU member states such as Britain and France reportedly
opposed Norway's participation, insisting that only EU members can
participate in security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sweden and Finland said they are seeking an solution acceptable
to all sides.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Guatemala FRG Candidate Gets More Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUATEMALA CITY, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala's rightist
Guatemalan Republican Frong (FRG) candidate Alfonso Portillo
appeared headed in Sunday's presidential election, said the
Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Portillo won 47.88 percent of the votes, followed by Oscar
Berger of the ruling National Advanced Party (PAN) with 31.19
percent of the votes, according to preliminary results. Nine other
candidates trailed far behind.
</P>
<P>
The voting Sunday was quiet, with no signs of the heavy
military presence that marked past elections. The Electoral
Tribunal estimated that more than 50 percent of the 4.46 million
registered voters had gone to the polls.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala held its first presidential election Sunday after the
signing of peace accords in 1996 which ended the 36-year civil
war.
</P>
<P>
Under the electoral law, the presidential candidate winning at
least 51 percent of the votes will be the elected president who
will take office on January 14, 2000.
</P>
<P>
But none of the top two passed 50 percent of the votes, so
Portillo and his nearest runner Berger will continue a runoff on
December 26.

<HEADLINE> EU Industrial Confidence Index Rises in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The index of industrial
confidence rose by two points in October to a level of five points
above the long-term average in the euro zone and the European
Union, according to data from the Business and Consumer Survey
published Monday by the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive branch said that the main contributors to the
increase are Italy, rising four points, and Germany and France,
each rising two points.
</P>
<P>
"Confidence in the construction sector is also rising," the EU
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The data in September in the construction sector for the EU
has been revised upwards by one point and another point in October.
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, consumer confidence rose up by two points both in
the EU and the euro zone. The recovery of the consumer confidence
has been subdued in Germany, while consumers seem to be
considerably more optimistic in France, Italy and Britain, it
added.
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence of the confidence increase, a positive
evolution of the economic sentiment indicator has been presented
in both the EU and the euro zone, showing a significant increase
from 103.8 in September to 104.2 in the EU and 104.3 in the euro
zone in October, the highest level of this year, well above the
long term average of 100, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urges Vatican to Understand Mosque Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel appealed on Monday to
Vatican to understand why the Israeli government has allowed the
Muslims to build a mosque in the northern city of Nazareth, the
town of Jesus' boyhood.
</P>
<P>
"I trust the Vatican will understand the complexity of the
situation and see one bright side of it," Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami made the call after Vatican has said that the plan to
build a mosque near a church in Nazareth has hindered the
preparation for a visit to Israel by Pope John Paul II scheduled
next March.
</P>
<P>
The mosque issue in Nazareth has dragged on for about two
years. The Muslims in the city insisted that no matter what
happens, they will build the mosque in which they can pray.
</P>
<P>
Local Christians refused to accept this, saying the place
planned for the mosque is too near to the Basilica of the
Annunciation.
</P>
<P>
According to Catholic tradition, the church marks the spot
where the Angel Gabriel told Mary that she would give birth to
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
"It is our task to explain both to the churches and the Vatican
that we do not intend to curtail the freedom of nay religion, with
special emphasis on the Christians and the Catholic Church,"
Ben-Ami pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Israel will continue to prepare for the Pope's visit and will
do its outmost to secure the interests of the churches and aid the
conditions for the visit of the Pope, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, church leaders in Jerusalem issued a statement,
threatening to shut down their churches for two days on November
22-23 to protest against the government's decision to allow the
mosque to be built in Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
Israel neither wants the churches to shut their doors nor the
Vatican to cancel the Pope's visit to Israel, because those
consequences will damage badly the country's tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
Israel expects around 3 million foreign tourists, most of them
Christians, to visit Israel early next year, when the country
marks the start of the next millennium.

<HEADLINE> Over 140,000 Ethiopian Children Infected With HIV: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has more than
140,000 children who have contracted HIV, the virus that causes
the killing AIDS, an official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Such a great number has earned Ethiopia a top place in terms of
HIV infected children in the world, HIV/AIDS coordinator with the
World Bank Debre-Work Zesde told the on-going International
Conference on HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
A recent study shows that Ethiopia, estimated to have three
million HIV/ AIDS patients, occupies the 16th place in HIV/AIDS
prevalence rate among the Sub-Saharan African countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zesde, Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Africa
contributed one third of the 22 million HIV infections in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Hailu Negassa, AIDS and Epidemiology team leader with the
Ethiopian Health Ministry, told the conference that there have
been 71,000 reported AIDS cases in the Horn of Africa country so
far.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the reported cases are adults aged between
20 and 40, he said, predicting that by the year 2000, about half
of the country's hospital beds would be occupied by AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
The four-day International Conference on HIV/AIDS, which began
here on Sunday, is designed to promote public realization of the
danger and harm of HIV/AIDS both inside and outside Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Works for Better Office Response to Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The African regional
office of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has
launched a joint initiative to improve response by UNDP country
offices to complex emergency situations, UNDP officials said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The joint initiative, launched by the UNDP's Regional Bureau
for Africa and its Emergency Response Division, will strengthen
the capabilities of UNDP offices in countries in "special
development situations."
</P>
<P>
The effort will also enable them to respond more effectively to
challenges of conflict management and peace building on the
African continent, they said.
</P>
<P>
Two workshops recently held in the Democratic Republic of Congo
and Rwanda under the initiative provided training to UNDP staff in
how to better analyze rapidly evolving and complex emergency
situations, and to better grasp their root causes.
</P>
<P>
Training also focused on how to strengthen collaboration with
U.N. resource mobilization for emergency programs.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP, set up in 1965, is the world's largest multilateral
source of grants for sustainable human development. It coordinates
most of the technical assistance provided by the U.N. system.

and Crime Prevention launched a program of 516,000 U.S. dollars to
help strengthen Malawi's capacity to tackle the nation's growing
drug problems, including production and trafficking, UNDP
officials said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The effort will fund a civic education program to help educate
Malawians on the harmful effects of drug use and will strengthen
law enforcement and legislation.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP resident representative in Malawi, Zahra Nuru, said
that drug use, like alcohol, disorients people and retards
development.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for collective action to tackle the disastrous
consequences which the scourge of drugs yield," she said. "UNDP is
committed to assist the government in meeting this goal."
</P>
<P>
The UNDP, set up in 1965, is the world's largest multilateral
source of grants for sustainable human development. It coordinates
most of the technical assistance provided by the United Nations
system.

MOSCOW, November 8 (Xinhua) -- External interference in the
Chechnya issue will not facilitate the settlement of the conflict,
said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Any statements on external interference, as Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov made, are aimed at creating an external pressure
factor on Russia, and will make no use for the peaceful solution
to the Chechnya problem," Ivanov said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov in Grozny
called on the United Nations and the United States to "interfere
in the events going on in Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ivanov called for taking real steps towards the
political end to crisis and not making such statements.
</P>
<P>
"There are all possibilities for a peaceful settlement," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister emphasized the need to stop terrorist acts, noting
that only after that there will be conditions for starting a

ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) expressed on Monday
its frustration over the silence of a Gulf Cooperation Council
committee on its dispute with Iran over three strategic Gulf
islands during Sunday's GCC ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The committee of foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, Oman and

over the islands of Abu Musa and Great and Lesser Tunbs, did not
even issue a communique at the end of the GCC meeting in Riyadh,
complained the official Al Ittihad daily.
</P>
<P>
The committee, formed last May, has not even disclosed to the
UAE the result of its contacts with Iran over the land dispute,
the paper said. Instead, it has chosen to remain silent.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- British Queen Elizabeth Monday
hailed the good relationship between Ghana and her country while
addressing the parliament in the African country, Ghana News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Queen, who arrived in Accra on Sunday, is on a three-day
state visit to Ghana.
</P>
<P>
The ties between the two counties, dating back two centuries,
are founded not simply on personal connections and history, but on
common interests, the Queen said.
</P>
<P>
She commended Ghana's role in the provision of troops to the
ECOMOG Force in Sierra Leone, adding that Ghana has made "a
valuable contribution to the international effort to bring peace
to that unhappy land."
</P>
<P>
 "That vital effort is but one example of Ghana's long and
distinguished history in international peacekeeping and conflict
resolution," she said.
</P>
<P>
 The Queen noted that "Ghana is the fifth largest contributor
to United Nations peacekeeping forces, and over the years, has
served the interests of the international community in places as
far apart as Bosnia, Cambodia and Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming speech, Justice Annan, speaker of the
parliament, said the Queen's visit provides further evidence of
the strengthening of the bonds of friendship and co-operation
between Ghana and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we celebrate with the United Kingdom, a new bond of
friendship, a new commitment to development, peace, and
prosperity in the pursuit of our common agenda for the realization
of true democracy," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Agree to Early Use of Euro Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) finance
ministers agreed Monday to abolish old EU national currencies in 11
euro-zone countries on March 1, 2002, four months ahead of
schedule after the introduction of the euro cash on January 1,
2002.
</P>
<P>
The agreement means banks, businesses and consumers will have a
dual-currency circulation period of only two months to change over
to the EU's single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
The changeover deadline had been set for July 1, 2002. The EU
finance ministers take the new step in order to minimize confusion
during the transition period.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 11 of the 15 EU nations have adopted the euro:
Austria, Belgium, Germany, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy,
Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Sweden, Denmark
and Britain have opted to stay out tentatively while Greece has
not met the EU's economic criteria but hopes to join the euro zone
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
So far, the euro is mainly used by companies and government
bookkeepers. The introduction of euro-denominated notes and coins
will not start circulating until 2002.
</P>
<P>
But Europe's business circle is not in favor of setting a
deadline for ending the dual circulation of the euro and national
currencies between January 1 and July 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
The Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(Eurochambers) has said that any period of dual circulation will
constitute a burden for companies as retailers will have to accept
payments in a national currency and give change in euros.
</P>
<P>
The Eurochambers have recommends the distribution of euros to
companies and consumers before January 1, 2002 through banks and
special exchange offices in order to alleviate a security risk for
retailers and cashiers.

BUENOS AIRES, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The governments of
Paraguay and of Cuba reestablished diplomatic relations Monday
after a 40-year interruption.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay was the only country in South America that lacked
diplomatic ties with Cuba, according to reports reaching here from
Asuncion.
</P>
<P>
Paraguayan Foreign Minister Jose Felix Fernandez and visiting
Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos made the announcement in
Paraguay's capital city of Asuncion.

NAIROBI, November 8 (Xinhua) --The Nairobi stock market is
expected to pull out of its slump in the next few months, Kibuga

The 20-share index of the Nairobi exchange has fallen to the

corporate performance, he said.

Kariithi, who was appointed the head of the Nairobi Stock

ATHENS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Communist Party-led
Hellenic Committee for International Peace and Detente organized
Monday night a mock trial or "people's court" to try U.S.
President Bill Clinton for crimes committed against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The mock trial took place at Athens' central constitution
square with the participation of about 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Following the mock trial, they also marched to the U.S. embassy
in protest against the forthcoming visit by Clinton to Greece from
November 13 to 15.
</P>
<P>
A number of protest marches are expected to be held this week
in both Athens and the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
In what seem to be protests possibly linked to Clinton's visit,
a time-bomb exploded outside a Levis jeans store in Athens Sunday
night and shots were fired outside the Hellenic-American Union in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, an overwhelming 80.5 percent of
Greeks have a negative opinion on Clinton while 92.4 percent do
not trust his mediation in Greek-Turkish affairs, according to a
poll published by the Athens daily Ethnos Monday.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Rappas Monday condemned the
wave of bomb attacks against Clinton's visit, adding that the
government has taken necessary measures for peaceful protests
against Clinton.

However, he said that the right of the people to free

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Visits Congo (K) on U.N. Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has asked his special envoy for the Democratic Republic
of Congo, Moustapha Nisasse, to travel to Kinshasa, capital of
Congo (K), on November 7-10, in a bid to promote the peace process
in the central African country, a U.N. statement said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by the U.N. spokesman, said that the
special envoy is in Kinshasa for consultations with the government
of the Democratic Republic of Congo on the on-going deployment of
U.N. personnel in the country to assist in the implementation of
the Lusaka Peace Agreement, signed on July 10, and several other
issues related to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"While in Kinshasa, the special envoy will also meet with
representatives of the unarmed opposition and civil society, as he
did in April 1999, both to listen to their views and to brief them
on the on-going and planned action of the United Nations to
contribute to the restoration of peace" in the country, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference here,
"We called Kinshasa this morning, and were told that the technical
survey team, which has been in Kinshasa since October 17, spent
the day waiting for clearance in Kinshasa airport to begin their
mission to Goma and a number of other sites."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the team did not receive the green
light from the Congolese authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Friday unanimously renewed until January
15, 2000, the mandate of several dozen U.N. military liaison
officers sent to Congo (K) and neighboring countries to help
implement the Lusaka Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is trying to lay groundwork for carrying out
an accord signed in Lusaka, capital of Zambia, in July aimed at
ending the conflict in the country, with the government of Congo
(K) supported by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe and the rebels
backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

NAIROBI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Burundi rebels Monday killed at
least 12 civilians and seriously wounded seven after blocking a
main road near the country's capital Bujumbura, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place at Kavumu, some 37 kilometers northeast
of Bujumbura in the Muramvya Province, according to a news release

<P>
The rebels cut a tree down to block the road and set fire on
four passing vehicles, leaving at least 12 dead and seven wounded,

</P>
<P>
The death toll could rise since the occupants of one abandoned
jeep had not been found, Provincial Military Commander Janvier
Rubwebwe said.

More than 150,000 people have been killed in a six-year
ravaging civil war in Burundi between the Tutsi-dominated army and

<HEADLINE> 7 Police Hostages Killed in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The police commissioner for Bayelsa State confirmed Monday
that the seven hostages had been killed," said a local government
spokesman in Yenagoa, the capital of Bayelsa State located in
Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
The seven policemen were abducted last Thursday from Ode
village in the Kaiama local government area in the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the accident might further worsen tensions between the
Ijaws and Yorubas, who were involved in a violent clash against
each other last week in Nigeria's biggest city Lagos. Fifteen
people were killed in that conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Ijaw militants seized the police officers, said to be
Yorubas, in an apparent revenge of their toll in that accident, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Bayelsa State spokesman said Governor Dieprieye
Alameisiegha had travelled to the Nigerian capital Abuja to
consult with President Olusegun Obasanjo on the latest
developments in the troubled region. Obasanjo himself is a Yoruba.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the current clashes were an extension of fighting
between Ijaws and Ilajes -- a clan of the Yoruba -- in the western
reaches of the Niger Delta over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta has long been a hotbed of ethnic feuds and
violence, which has claimed thousands of lives over the past two
years and threatened the normal operations of the multinational
oil firms in the oil producing region. Revenue from crude oil
accounts for 90 percent of Nigeria' s hard currency incomes.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts are believed to be deeply rooted in poverty in
the region caused by years of exploitation by foreign oil firms
and neglect by the Northerner-controlled military government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army to Inspect Apache Attack Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Army will inspect
all 743 of its Apache attack helicopters and temporarily ground
those found to have a type of tail rotor bearing which is believed
to have caused an Apache crash early this year, Army spokesman Jim
Stueve said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bearings will be replaced and the Apaches will be returned
to duty, Stueve said, adding that no Apaches will fly until the
inspections are completed this week.
</P>
<P>
The Apache is a twin-engined army attack helicopter developed
by Mcdonnell Douglas (now Boeing). The U.S. Army took first
delivery of the Apache in 1984. Now it is the Army's best attack
helicopter and is deployed both in the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The decision to inspect the full fleet was made when the Army
recently found that the bearing was the cause of an Apache crash
in Fort Rucker, Alabama State, last January, in which the
helicopter was destroyed and the two-man crew suffered minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Investigators determined that a heating process used by
Boeing to make the bearing assembly extra hard led to stress
corrosion fractures in the bearing.

<HEADLINE> Election Results Led to Tension in Guatemala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUATEMALA CITY, November 8 (Xinhua)-- Guatemala's situation has
become tenser due to displeasure to the provisional election
results.
</P>
<P>
Former Guatemalan President Ramiro Leon de Carpio, who is
member of the main opposition Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG),
threatened Monday that if his party loses because of the "fraud",
a bloodbath would be provoked in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of followers of FRG presidential candidate, Alfonso
Portillo, met in the computer center to press the Supreme
Electoral Tribunal (TSE) to announce quicker definitive results.
</P>
<P>
"Results, results", "no fraud", shouted demonstrators at the
center installed in Hyatt Hotel, Guatemalas's captial's center.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ruling National Advance Party (PAN) denounced that
violent incidents had happened in different places in the country.
</P>
<P>
The tense situation has come about owing to FRG not agreeing
with preliminary results announced by the Supreme Electoral
Tribunal (TSE), which gives 47.57 percent of votes versus 30.83
percent of PAN.
</P>
<P>
Up to now only lacking is the scrutiny of 33 municipalities,
and a possible runoff.
</P>
<P>
But FRG claimed it has won 52.4 percent and doesn't now need
the second electoral round, according to its own count.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PAN has reiterated its party's count agrees with TSE
preliminary result and a second electoral round has been defined
between PAN and FRG.
</P>
<P>
This tense situation has provoked a big worry on TSE's behalf
and the international community and police and military
authorities. Police authorities with support of Guatemala's
army has obviously reinforced security measures.
</P>
<P>
Two anti-riot policemen, consulted by Xinhua confirmed they
arrived to stop eventual violence due to disconformity of rival
parties regarding results announced by TSE.
</P>
<P>
However, Sunday's presidential election, the first peacetime
voting held quietly in Guatemala after 36-year civil war ended in
1996. The country is facing an estimated 20 percent of
unemployment, inflation and weakened national currency before the
dollar.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Emir Urges Political Solution to Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad
Bin Khalifa al-Thani Tuesday appealed for finding political
solutions to the Iraqi crisis so as to end the sufferings of the
Iraqi people who have been under international sanctions since
1990.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of Qatar's Shura (Consultative) Council,
Hamad said the Iraqi people are still suffering from the sanctions
and "we have to make all possible efforts to put an end to this
crisis for which we believe time has come."
</P>
<P>
The Qatari emir called for resorting to political means to
settle the crisis in a way that maintains Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Iraq following
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which triggered the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The council insists the sanctions be lifted only after
verifiable evidence shows that Baghdad has eliminated all its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
On Gulf security and stability, Hamad reiterated that his
country "supports solving all differences among regional states
through dialog and adherence to the logic of justice."
</P>
<P>
He voiced confidence in the efforts exerted by a Gulf
tripartite committee in helping solve the dispute between the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran over the Gulf islands of Abu
Moussa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
Both UAE and Iran claim sovereignty over the islands, which are
located near the strategic mouth of the Strait of Hormuz and being
controlled by Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The committee was established at the Gulf Arab foreign
ministerial meeting that was held in the Saudi Red Sea port city
of Jeddah early July. It comprises Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,
with an aim to work out a proper mechanism for a peaceful solution
to the UAE-Iranian territorial dispute.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel conducted indirect talks with Syria earlier this
year in a bid to gauge Damascus' reaction to a possible phased,
unilateral Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, Likud Chairman
Ariel Sharon revealed to The Jerusalem Post Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, who conducted the negotiations as then foreign
minister, said Syria refused to approve such a withdrawal, a move
o
he attributed to Damascus' desire to maximize pressure on Israel
to yield the Golan Heights, which Israel took from Syria in the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Dozens of Israeli soldiers and a few officers in southern
Lebanon are smuggling drugs into Israel, according to information
obtained from a high-ranking police superintendent.
</P>
<P>
The former head of the police drug force in the northern
district, whose name was not disclosed, told Haaretz on Monday
that the information had been given to senior officers in the
army, but that they had decided not to act on it for various
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators for the final-status
talks set on Monday in their first session the groundwork for a
permanent peace accord, saying they believed a framework agreement
could be reached within 100 days.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged statements on their policy regarding
final-status issues and discussed procedures for the talks in the
coming weeks and months. The next meeting will be held on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The police said they had gathered more evidence to back
their claim that former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had
received 500,000 shekels (nearly 120,000 U.S. dollars) of bribes
in the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's attorney dismissed the report, accusing the police
of leaking information about investigation to the media.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for More Efforts in Reducing Greenhouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. environment agency has
urged the international community to intensify efforts in cutting
greenhouse gas emissions and reversing the trend of global
warming.
</P>
<P>
"Only if the international community maintains and intensifies
the political momentum for making the Kyoto Protocol fully
operational can we be sure that it will enter into force in time
for industrialized countries to achieve their emissions targets,"
Executive Director of the Nairobi- based U.N. Environment Program
(UNEP) Klaus Toepfer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol for reducing greenhouse gas
 emissions from industrialized countries will be determined over
the next 12 months, a press report obtained here Tuesday quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn last week, ministers and officials from 166 governments
set a timetable for completing the outstanding details of the
protocol by November 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto Protocol will come into force only when at least 55
countries, including a number of developed countries accounting
for at least 55 percent of developed country emissions, have
ratified.
</P>
<P>
So far, only 16 countries, all from the developing world, have
approved the protocol.
</P>
<P>
Under the Kyoto Protocol, rich countries are to reduce their
emissions of six greenhouse gases by five percent by the period
2008-2012.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Visits Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada on Tuesday met with his Indonesian counterpart Abdurrahman
Wahid who arrived here for a brief visit earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora told reporters after the
meeting that while the "getting-to-know-you" meeting lasted less
than an hour, the two leaders instantly established rapport with
each other.
</P>
<P>
He said the two leaders agreed to adopt "pretty common
positions" on many things, including the peaceful resolution of
conflicts in Mindanao and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
According to Zamora, Wahid expressed his strong hope that the
conflict in East Timor would be "peacefully settled."
</P>
<P>
"(Wahid) does not want to send in the military just to settle
this dispute," Zamora said, adding that Indonesia is "very
appreciative of what we have been doing" to help restore peace in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Estrada voiced his hope that such efforts will
continue, particularly in the government's ongoing peace talks
with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), now the largest
rebel group in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
To highlight Indonesia's full support for the Philippine
government's efforts to bring genuine and lasting peace to
Mindanao, Wahid readily accepted an invitation by Estrada to go
there and see the situation for himself when he returns for an
extended visit.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is the last leg of Wahid's ASEAN tour, which
has already taken him to Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand,
Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Estrada, Wahid would leave for home,
press reports here said.

<P>
SHENZHEN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to multiply
the number of people in the country using the Internet in the near
future by implementing the latest technology.
</P>
<P>
The integrated E-business service platform, developed by the
Shenzhen Liming Networks Systems, one of the largest computer
network integration firms in China, enables users to access
service providers and other users of E-commerce via television,
telephones and facsimiles, as well as personal computers. The core
of the technology is an information switch, or I-switch, that can
bridge the flow of data between such electronic networks as TV,
telecommunications, and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Liming Network Systems signed an agreement today
with IBM of the United States on strategic cooperation in
developing applications of E-commerce that are suitable for
conditions in China today.
</P>
<P>
Director of the National Office of Information Technology Song
Ling said at the signing ceremony that the Chinese government is
considering listing this new technology as one of the national
experimental E-commerce projects.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Liming Network Systems has already installed this
technology for the Shenzhen Stock Exchange for the on-line trading
of securities.
</P>
<P>
Henry Chow, chairman of IBM operations in the greater China
region, said today that the company will help China explore
various ways to expand E-commerce.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankans Urged to Fight Sexual Abuse Against Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankans need to seriously
deal with sexual abuse against children to stem the rising evil,
the chairman of the Child Protection Authority said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Offenses against children are not taken seriously enough and
it is only a robbery, bomb or terrorism that is regarded as a
serious crime," Harandra de Silva told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"We need to change attitudes of the people," he said when
announcing Sri Lanka's plans to mark the 10th anniversary later
this month of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
Studies have found that 20 percent of boys and 10 percent of
girls have been sexually abused, de Silva said.
</P>
<P>
He said a questionnaire sent to 1,600 school children showed
that most of the perpetrators of child sexual abuse were relatives
while those most vulnerable to abuse were aged between 10 to 14.
</P>
<P>
De Silva said there was no system in the country to monitor
paedophiles, and the majority of recorded cases involved Sri
Lankans although there were some cases involving foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, a 54-year-old Norwegian man was sentenced
by a Sri Lankan court to jail for 14 years and a fine of 100,000
rupees (1,400 U.S. dollars) after he was found guilty of sexually
abusing a 14-year-old local boy.
</P>
<P>
Under Sri Lanka's tough child protection laws introduced
recently, sex with minors is an offense punishable with a long
jail term and a fine.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has in recent years tightened laws and set up the
Child Protection Authority to protect the rights of children
following an increase in the number of cases of paedophilia and
other offenses against minors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a local organization called Protecting
Children and Environment Everywhere prepared the first scientific
study on the scale of child sexual abuse in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
It found that up to 15,000 young boys, aged between 8 to 15,
are involved in the sex trade in Sri Lanka, most being victims of
paedophiles from Western Europe.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- One of the "black boxes" of
the plane on the EgyptAir Flight 990 has been recovered, U.S.
searchers announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Black Boxes" are the flight data recorder and cockpit voice
recorder, two vital instruments to help determine the cause of a
plane accident.

<P>
A U.S. National Transportation Safety Board spokesman confirmed
the find, without identifying which recorder was recovered.

<P>
The U.S Navy waged a round-the-clock search on Monday for the
boxes, eight days after the Boeing 767 plane crashed some 60 miles
off Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, shortly after it took off
from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
All 217 people on board were killed.
</P>
<P>
Two robots have been used during the operation in an effort to
find and catch the boxes amid the wreckage at the Atlantic seabed
80 meter deep.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Art Shop Owners Vow To Sell No Fakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) - Art shop owners in Beijing have
vowed to stop selling phony art works in a move to bring in more
customers.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xingjia, a senior staff member from the Rongbaozhai Art
Shop, said that fake art works, mostly traditional Chinese
calligraphy and paintings, used to sell for outrageous prices, but
in recent years more and more shop owners have complained that
fake art works have damaged their sales volume.
</P>
<P>
The prominent Rongbaozhai is one of the dozens of art shops in
downtown Beijing's Liulichang Street, where most of the city's art
and curio shops have been located for the past 400 years.
</P>
<P>
"During the past four to five years, with the strengthening of
a sound market and the improvement of people's cultural taste,
fakes have seriously damaged the reputation of Liulichang Street,"
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"The business of the art and curio shops in Liulichang Street
has reduced sharply in recent years due to the negative influence
of fakes," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng Maoquan, general manager of the Hongbaotang
Art Shop, situated at the entrance of Liulichang, the drop in
business can only be controlled by putting an end to fakes.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Cheng sponsored an exhibition of vertically-hung
traditional Chinese paintings in Liulichang. On the first day of
the show, 50,000 yuan-worth of paintings were sold, which drew the
admiration of other shop owners along the street.
</P>
<P>
"I assured the buyers that all the paintings are genuine, this
is the only reason for my success," said Cheng, who grew up in a
family of artists.
</P>
<P>
The selling of fake art works in Liulichang has also drawn much
attention from the public. A professor who visits the street
frequently said that the existence of fakes will have a huge
negative impact on the country's image, since Liulichang has
become one of the major channels for the outsiders to understand
Beijing and its culture.
</P>
<P>
The professor suggested that the government formulate more
severe rules to eliminate fakes.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia's Livestock Breeding Sets New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of livestock
raised in Mongolia this year increased by 10.39 million, setting a
new record.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Breeding and
Industry said the total number of livestock is expected to exceed
33 million at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Animal Husbandry is the foundation of Mongolia's national
economy. Privatization that started in this sector in the early
1990's has led to tremendous increases in domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
The main problem of the industry is how to increase the export
of livestock products, especially meat export.

<HEADLINE> Vancouver Lockout Enters Third Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A labor dispute-induced lockout
at the Port of Vancouver has entered its third day, with a daily
economic loss estimated at up to 68 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Operations remain halted at all ports of Vancouver, the Fraser
River, Prince Rupert, Port Alberni and Nanaimo, affecting
everything but bulk grain shipments.
</P>
<P>
There has been no sign of an end to the year's second local
work stoppage since 2,000 longshoremen walked off job Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Vancouver is our largest port and I hope they will go back to
the bargaining table," Canadian Transport Minister David
Collenette said Monday.
</P>
<P>
While the federal government has not yet stepped in, labor
conciliators are "in constant contact with both parties,"
according to a spokesman of Labor Minister Claudette Bradshaw.
</P>
<P>
The Port of Vancouver is the country's largest and busiest
outlet, which handles 31 billion dollars worth of goods annually.
The port authority has said that the on-going stalemate is
affecting trade with 90 countries.
</P>
<P>
The port was already hit in July during a four-week strike by
independent truckers. Between 1982 and 1995, the port had seen a
total of eight wage disputes.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The trio of world leaders who orchestrated the reunification
of Germany returned on Monday to the city where the Cold War
collapsed with the simple breach of a steel and concrete wall 10
years ago. The mood was triumphant, but the celebration was
tempered by the recognition that the dream of a united, democratic
Europe that seemed so close a decade ago has yet to be realized.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton predicted that the "personal
mistake" he made in his Oval Office affair with Monica S. Lewinsky
will not damage his administration's long-term reputation, and
asserted that historians will salute the way he fought against
impeachment "because it preserved the Constitution."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton sent his trade representative and his top
economic adviser to Beijing after a long Saturday-night telephone
call with President Jiang Zemin. Their mission is to close a deal
to bring China into the World Trade Organization in return for a
widening of its markets to american-made goods.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Supreme Court said it would not consider appeals
from two longtime inmates on death row who contend that a decades-
long wait for a death sentence to be carried out is itself so "
cruel and unusual" as to be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Microsoft antitrust finding is being scoured by private
lawyers and corporate counsels looking for an opening to seek
monetary damages. The company's shares, however, ended down only 1.
8% after analysts predicted it would emerge from the dispute
without serious damage.
</P>
<P>
-- Israel and the Palestinians launched talks aimed at
achieving a permanent peace accord, and sent an ambitious 100-day
deadline for crafting the broad outlines of a deal. Huge obstacles
must be overcome. Among them are the fate of Jewish settlements
and Palestinian refugees, and Jerusalem's status. Both sides claim
it as a capital.

furthered by the joint efforts of both sides.
</P>

President Jiang Zemin on Uzbekistan-China relations and regional
issues, and that a number of agreements have been signed on
boosting friendly ties. He also said that one of the major tasks
of his present China trip is to enhance bilateral economic and
trade relations.

He said that the success of China's reform has shown that the
country has found a development path which suits China's national
conditions. China's reform experience is unique, he added.

Uzbekistan appreciates China's policy toward Central Asia and
its participation in seeking a peaceful solution to the conflicts
in Afghanistan within the "six plus two" framework, he said.

<P>
ANKARA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf has said that he felt U.S. support was
behind him.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Turkish Daily News published on
Tuesday, Musharraf, who arrived here Monday for a one-day working
visit to Turkey, said that he was satisfied with the U.S. stance
on the recent developments in his country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is the third country Musharraf has visited since he
toppled the government of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a
peaceful military coup on October 12. He visited Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates late last month.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had a fruitful discussion with Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit which he received "brotherly advice."
</P>
<P>
Musharraf pointed out that he is planning to return to his
military career after democracy is properly restored in his
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper said Turkish leaders listened to him and
recommended that the Pakistani general quickly take the necessary
measures to return his country to democracy.
</P>
<P>
In light of its past experiences, Turkey lectured Musharraf on
how to return to democracy, it said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has had three coups d'etat in its recent history: on May
27, 1960, on March 12,1971, and on September 12, 1980.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The families of people missing
or kidnapped during Lebanon's 15-year civil war have asked the
government to help shed light on the fate their kin, the Daily
Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We ask the government to help us find out about our loved ones
despite the fact that the truth may hurt us," said Wadad Halawani,
president of the Families of the Wartime Kidnapped and Missing
Committee, at a meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held to discuss the fate of some 17,000 people
who were either kidnapped or went missing during the country's
1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
"We'd (rather) mourn them once instead of remaining uncertain
for the rest of our lives," Halawani said.
</P>
<P>
Families of the missing people held a demonstration late
October to attract attention to their plight. Their protests drew
the support of several parliament members.
</P>
<P>
They complained that the government was not following up on
the issue despite the fact that 25 years have passed since the war
began.
</P>
<P>
The committee asked the government to ratify a social welfare
program for the families, which will provide and set up a
fact-finding mission to investigate the whereabouts of their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
They also asked the government to build a memorial for the
missing and declare April 13, the date the war began, as a day of
memorial for them.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Press Association Calls for Editor's Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Iranian
Journalists has called for "prompt release" of Mashallah
Shamsolvaezin, editor-in-chief of the banned daily Neshat (Joy),
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to the Judiciary head Ayatollah Mahmoud
Hashemi Shahroudi, the association said the release of
Shamsolvaezin is their least demand, which would contribute to the
rehabilitation of journalists' confidence in the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
The letter said the performance of the press court has dashed
the hope of a reform in the judicial system and has further
endangered the credibility of the Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The association also demanded that the press court would
undergo suitable changes and judicial investigations take their
legitimate procedure to create a calm atmosphere in the society.
</P>
<P>
Shamsolvaezin was brought to an open trial on Monday by a local
court on charges of forging documents and publishing articles
insulting Islamic sanctities in the banned daily Neshat.
</P>
<P>
However, he rejected the competence of the court and refused to
answer any questions at the court, saying that his case should be
investigated by the press court with the presence of a press jury
according to the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Shamsolvaezin, currently editor-in-chief of Asr-e Azadegan
newspaper, was arrested here on November 2, two weeks after the
judge of Branch 1410 of Tehran Justice Department, Saeed
Mortazavi, issued the arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
In a court hearing last month, Shamsolvaezin had asked for
time to provide the court with evidence to support his defense
against the charges leveled against him.
</P>
<P>
However, he introduced three lawyers to the court later and
said he does not believe in the preliminary investigations and he
would only appear before the court in the presence of a press jury.
</P>
<P>
Neshat, which supported the reformist policies of President
Mohammad Khatami, was shut down on September 5 on charges of
"disrespect for Islamic Sanctities and the status of the supreme
leader."
</P>
<P>
The ban came after the daily published an open letter by a
co-founder of the opposition Iran Liberation Movement to supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging him to distance himself from
the hard-line conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The conservative clergies, who control most of the powerful
institutions including the legislature, the judiciary and the
police, were engaged in a heated power struggle with moderate
reformists spearheaded by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Neshat was the successor of the liberal Tous and Jameah
newspapers, which had been closed down on press charges. Since
Khatami came to power in August 1997, six liberal dailies have
been ordered to close by the conservative-dominated judiciary.

The paper said intelligence obtained from Chief Superintendent
Kobi Bachar, who was head of the police drug force in northern
Israel until a month ago, showed that most of the IDF soldiers
involved are trackers serving in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
These soldiers and officers mainly act as couriers, carrying
drugs from dealers in Lebanon to dealers in Israel, it added.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking has reportedly been increasing in recent
months along Israel's northern border and police estimate that
between one and three tons of heroin were smuggled into Israel
each year over the Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
Bachar stressed that it is command post personnel, rather than
combat soldiers in the front line, who are involved in drug
trafficking, and the officers involved include a unit commander at
the rank of major.
</P>
<P>
Bachar said he has spoken personally with brigade commanders
and given them the information, but was told by the commanders
that they do not have the capacity to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Bachar explained that Lebanese drug dealers and Israeli
soldiers get to know each other in outposts shared by the IDF and
the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army, at the border crossings or
when Lebanese civilians bring supplies to the outposts.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that a courier can make up to 10,000
U.S. dollars for transferring one kilogram of heroin.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with
self-claimed purpose of protecting its north. Over 2,000 IDF
officers and soldiers are stationed inside the security zone.

<HEADLINE> Statistics Show Social Gap Remains Wide in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The gap between rich and
poor in Israel remains wide, with the richest 10 percent of
families have a monthly income some nine times higher than that of
the poorest one-tenth, according to an official report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The top 10 percent of families bring in an average 27,000
shekels (nearly 6,430 U.S. dollars) every month, compared with
2,970 shekels (about 710 U.S. dollars) for the lowest one-tenth,
the Central Bureau of Statistics said in its annual report for
1998.
</P>
<P>
This gap, almost the same as in 1997, has been developing in
the last few years as Israel changed the socialism idea dominating
in the first years following the country's establishment in 1948,
and adopted a policy of open market and privatization.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel stands in the ranks of developed countries
with a per capital gross domestic product of 15,700 U.S. dollars,
the income distribution inequality has become one of the potential
greatest dangers threatening the society, experts have warned.
</P>
<P>
About 84 percent of the top 10 percent families live in
apartments of their own and 12 percent in rented houses, while 24
percent of lowest decile families live in freehold apartments and
71 percent in rented apartments, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of top decile families are small families of
one or two members at most, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Another social problem reflected in the report is that Israel
is becoming a country of the old.
</P>
<P>
By 2020, Israel will have over 1 million residents over the age
of 65, constituting 12 percent of the population and doubling the
ratio in 1995, the report said.
</P>
<P>
One factor of this trend is the steady increase of life
expectancy of the people. The report shows that the average life
expectancy for a woman is 80.1 years, and 75.9 years for a man in
1998, both representing a two-year increase compared with 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
On the average, the life expectance for a Jewish woman is two
or three years longer than that for a non-Jewish woman, and a
Jewish man might live one year or two years longer than a
non-Jewish man, according to statistics in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
A trend worrying some Israeli politicians is the demographic
balance in the country. The report shows that at the end of 1998,
79.2 percent of the total population of roughly 6 million were
Jews, declining from the 82.1 percent ration when the Jewish
state was proclaimed 51 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Although experts predict that in 20 years, Jews will still
make up a dominating majority of 73.5 percent of the population,
some politicians say that the continual decrease in the Jewish
proportion of the population might pose a threat to the nature of
the country.
</P>
<P>
They attribute this trend to the increasing gap in the growth
rate between Jews and non-Jews. The growth rate for the Jewish
population stood at 1.8 percent in 1998, declining from 2.4
percent in 1994, while the growth rate for non-Jews stood at over
2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims, the largest group among the minorities, have the
highest growth rate in the country, which stood at 3.7 percent in
1998, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Jailed PKK Leader Calls on Kurds to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned
leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), has called
on Kurds living abroad to return and "contribute to the
development of democracy and a new era of peace in Turkey."
</P>
<P>
The English-language newspaper Daily News reported here Tuesday
that Ocalan made the call in his latest messages to the Turkish
government delivered by his attorney Dogan Erbas, who visited him
on November 4 at the Imrali Island prison where he was held.
</P>
<P>
The call came after the arrival on October 1 of a group of
eight PKK members.
</P>
<P>
Calling themselves the "Peace and Democratic Solution Group,"
the eight turned themselves in to military officials in the
eastern province of Hakkari in what they termed as an illustration
of the PKK's sincerity in its call for peace.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who was now appealing against his death sentence handed
down by an Ankara district court, called on his followers to
withdraw from Turkey as of September 1, the World Peace Day.
</P>
<P>
A second group of eight PKK members arrived in Istanbul, the
largest city of Turkey, from European countries on October 29,
Turkey's Republic Day, and surrendered to the Turkish security
forces.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a third group of PKK members is expected
to surrender in Istanbul soon in a move to coincide with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) summit
on November 18-19.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has since 1984 been fighting a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over
37,000 lives in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Since his capture in February by Turkish special agents, Ocalan
has repeatedly appealed to the Turkish authorities to spare his
life in return for the PKK to end its military actions.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Emir Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah Tuesday received Pakistani Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf, who arrived here earlier in the day on a
five-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince and Prime Minister Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah,
First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad
Al-Sabah, and other high-ranking officials from both sides
attended the meeting, the Kuwait News Agency reported, without
giving content of the talks.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports available here earlier, the
talks were likely to deal with ties between the two Islamic
countries, as well as the latest situation in Pakistan since
Musharraf came to power.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf is on his second visit abroad since he toppled the
government of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on October
12. He had visited Turkey and will travel on to Qatar in his
current tour.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
late October.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti cabinet, in a weekly session Monday, welcomed
Musharraf's visit and hoped for "more development of the good
relations between Kuwait and Pakistan in the service of joint
interest."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Pakistan have been maintaining a close
relationship, which has been expanding over the years in the
fields of economic cooperation, trade and manpower.
</P>
<P>
There are over 85,000 Pakistani nationals working and living
in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that bilateral trade volume was 11.9
million Kuwaiti dinars (about 39.27 million U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government also put 250 million dollars in the
State Bank of Pakistan as a loan in August 1998. The loan, with a
4 percent interest rate for two years, was aimed at easing
Pakistan's economic hardship inflicted by international sanctions
imposed on Islamabad after it conducted nuclear tests last year.

<HEADLINE> China Succeeds in Making First MD90-30 Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The first MD90-30 commercial
aircraft made in China acquired the certificate from the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today, after it passed all
flight tests.
</P>
<P>
This means that the country's aviation industry is capable of
producing modern large-scale civilian airplanes, insiders here
said.
</P>
<P>
The China Aviation Industry Corporation (CAIC), the
predecessor of the China Aviation Industry Corporation I (CAIC I),
signed an agreement in 1994 on cooperation with the former U.S. MD
Corporation to produce 20 MD90-30s.
</P>
<P>
This is another key Sino-American cooperative project, coming
after the Shanghai Aviation Industry Corporation succeeded in
making 35 MD82/83 planes together with MD.
</P>
<P>
Based on the agreement, MD is in charge of supplying raw
materials, engines and technical support, and the CAIC is in
charge of making the airframe, general assembly and test flights.
</P>
<P>
Four major aircraft manufacturers under the CAIC jointly
undertook the production in 1995 and completed the first MD90-30
four years later.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the MD90-30, a 150-seat brand-new
commercial aircraft, is equipped with the advanced V2500 engine,
which uses less oil and makes less noise.
</P>
<P>
The CAIC had planned to produce 20 such aircraft, but cut that
figure down to two, because of the changes in the international
market and the merger of Boeing and MD.
</P>
<P>
The first aircraft will be put into use soon and the second is
expected to be delivered in February, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Biggest City Hit by Transport Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Lagos State government of
Nigeria has insisted on levying increased taxes on transport
vehicles despite their owners' strike paralyzing Nigeria's biggest
city of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Tens-of-thousands of commuters and students Monday were forced
to trek by foot to work and schools, while those who made use of
private cars got caught in traffic-jams, reported the Guardian
newspaper Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After a whole day talk with the state government, some
transporters agreed to call off their strike Tuesday morning. But
as a whole, the strike still goes on.
</P>
<P>
The strikers are reportedly protesting against plans by the
state government to levy increased fee ranging from 2,000 to 5,000
naira (21 to 52 US dollars) monthly on them, and among others,
the alleged extortion and harassment by transport and security
officials.
</P>
<P>
Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu who had a protracted dialog
with representatives of some of the drivers and transport owners
Tuesday at the state secretariat, emphasized that the taxes
imposed by the state transport ministry would remain "even if the
transporters' strike continued till eternity."
</P>
<P>
The governor said vehicle taxes in Lagos was the lowest in the
country, adding that he was prepared to sponsor some of the
transporters to Rivers and Kano states to find out what the
transport levy situations are like.
</P>
<P>
Tinubu said the state would spend the money raised by tax rise
to implement free education and health services, repair roads and
provide other social services to the people.

<HEADLINE> Israel Weighs All Ways of Pullout From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's army chief said
Tuesday that the Israelhief of
Staff Shaul Mofaz told a parliamentary committee overseeing
defense affairs.
</P>
<P>
Taking office in July, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has
pledged to pull out Israeli troops within a year from a
15-kilometer-deep border zone Israel occupied in southern Lebanon
since 1985, through the resumption of negotiations with Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But since no progress has been made in the last several months
towards the revival of the Israeli-Syrian talks, which stalled in
early 1996, speculation has emerged in Lebanon and Syria that
Barak might pull the Israeli troop out of the so-called security
zone unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Both Lebanon and Syria have dismissed the idea of a unilateral
Israeli withdrawal, saying it would destabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from southern
Lebanon will strip Syria of a strong card it wants to play to
pressure Israel into handing over the Golan Heights, a strategic
plateau Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria has demanded an Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal
from the heights as the precondition for the restart of the talks,
saying former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had made such a
promise before the talks were frozen.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, disagrees with this claim, saying that Rabin
only raised a hypothetical question on a full Israeli withdrawal
to see what Syria would offer in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local daily The Jerusalem Post
published Tuesday, Likud Chairman Ariel Sharon said Israel had
conducted indirect talks with Syria early this year to arrange a
phased unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, who was the architect of Israeli invasion of Lebanon in
1982, conducted the negotiations in February while he was foreign
minister in the government of Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He said Syria rejected the Israeli idea in order to keep
maximum pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sharon has previously denied the existence of such negotiations
when they were first revealed on the Haaretz daily in March.
</P>
<P>
In the summer of last year, the Netanyahu government also
conducted secret negotiations, through third parties, with Syria
on the future of the Golan Heights. But the talks failed over
disputes on security arrangements.

Israel transferred 7 percent of the West Bank territories from
Area C to Area B in its first redeployment on September 10 under

HARARE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The cease-fire in the Democratic
 Republic of the Congo (DRC) will hold despite rebels' claim that
they will resume fighting in the troubled country, Zimbabwean
Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge said.
</P>
<P>
"I remain confident that it (DRC peace process) will succeed,"
Mudenge told a press conference in Harare Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is our agreement and it should succeed," he said, adding

</P>
<P>
Taking into consideration concerns and fears of all parties,
"it was worked out among us ... and it will be disastrous for us
and future generations if it fails," he said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Joint Military Commission (JMC) and observers
from the Organization of African Unity (OAU) are now going to set
up their bases in the DRC is testimony that the peace process
would hold, Mudenge said.
</P>
<P>
"Chairman of the JMC General Rachid Lallali of Algeria was in
Harare at the weekend to brief me on the outcome of their meeting
in Lusaka. The 36 JMC members will be joined by 32 others from the
OAU and will provide a window through which all cease-fire
violations would be investigated," said the Zimbabwean minister.
</P>
<P>
Despite the violations which have been reported by all parties,
he said the cease-fire would hold and all the belligerents are
committed to the Lusaka peace accord signed on July 10 this year.

<HEADLINE> No Plan for Massive Retrenchment in Nigerian Army: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- There is no plan for massive
retrenchment in the Nigerian armed forces, Nigeria's Defense
Minister Theophilus Danjuma has said.
</P>
<P>
Military personnel have no reason to feel about their jobs, the
minister told officers of the 3rd Armored Division in Nigeria's
northern city of Jos Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the army will be reorganized to be more mobile and compact,
the Guardian newspaper Tuesday quoted the defense minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Danjuma restated his resolve to create compact, well-equipped,
well- trained and highly motivated armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that his intention is to replace sheer number with fire
power and technology, stressing that his emphasis will be on a
force that would be highly mobile to respond quickly to areas of
threat as identified in the army contingency plan.
</P>
<P>
On security situation in the area of operational
responsibility, the defense minister said that the activities of
armed bandits in the northeast area are particularly worrisome.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the lost glamor of the army, Danjuma urged the
officers to "rediscover the joy of being officers again."

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Govt Agrees to Privatize Big Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Daniel
Yona told the National Assembly that his government has agreed to
privatize the NBC (1997) Limited, a giant public bank in the
country, the Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly (parliament) of Tanzania started to
debate the NBC (1997) Limited Incorporation Bill Monday, formally
marking the demise of the big bank.
</P>
<P>
Since establishment in 1997, the bank has continued to register
losses amounting to an average of two billion Tanzanian shillings
(about 2.5 million U.S. dollars) monthly, Yona said, stressing
that the only remaining option is to privatize it.
</P>
<P>
According to the recent audited accounts approved by the
central bank of Tanzania, the NBC (1997) Ltd. had an accumulated
negative loss amounting to 34.4 billion Tanzanian shillings (about
43 million dollars) by last September.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's ABSA bank, which has some 1,000 branches and
2,000 automatic tell machines (ATMs) across Africa, took over the
management of the NBC (1997) Ltd. in July this year after signing
a memorandum of understanding with the Tanzanian government.
</P>
<P>
"From ABSA's experience in modern banking, we believe that ABSA
can develop, reform and enlarge the NBC (1997) Ltd. within a short
time," said the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
However, members of the parliament form both the opposition and
the ruling Revolutionary Party of Tanzania (CCM) strongly
criticized the government for hastening the bank's divestiture
under external pressure.
</P>
<P>
If an exercise to privatize the bank would not be effected by
the end of this year, the government would not be able to observe
one of the conditions raised by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
It would also result in the discontinuation of programs under
the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiatives and
disqualify Tanzania from obtaining aid and loans from the IMF in
future, he added.

Muhimana, 49, and seven other accused were charged with 25
counts of conspiracy to commit genocide, crimes against humanity
and violations of the Geneva Conventions in the first indictment
issued by the ICTR Prosecutor on November 28, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Muhimana is charged, in particular, with having conspired with
others to kill Tutsis in Kibuye Prefecture and to have
participated in attacks on Bisesero hill where thousands of
predominantly Tutsi men, women and children had sought refuge from
about April 9 to June 30, 1994.
</P>
<P>
He is also charged with having personally taken part in the
attacks in the area of Bisesero and killed persons seeking refuge
there.
</P>

international humanitarian law committed in the territory of
Rwanda between January 1 and December 31 of 1994.
</P>

It also has the mandate to try Rwandan citizens responsible for
such violations committed in the territory of neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has so far issued 28 indictments against 45
individuals and a total of 38 indicted individuals are in custody.
</P>
<P>
Five of the convicts have so far been sentenced by the ICTR to
serve their terms from 15 years to life time in prison.
</P>
<P>

1994 genocide when the majority Hutus oppressed the minority
Tutsis.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred people were
injured when clashes broke out between rival fans and with police
after a soccer match in the southern city of Shiraz late Monday,
according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
The reports said security forces had to intervene to prevent
the fans of the visiting Tehran team Esteghlal entering the pitch
when home side Fadr-e-sepassi jumped to a 1-0 lead with a penalty
in a key tie for the championship.
</P>
<P>
The game was stopped for a few minutes but had to be postponed
by referee Jalal Moradi after Fadr-e-sepassi scored again with
five minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
A hail of stones, fruit, rubbish and other objects rained down
on the field and in the crowd, injuring two players and an Iranian
soccer federation official as well as the referee. A ball boy was
badly hurt after a projectile hit him in the eyes.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that incidents among the 20,000 fans, who
included a majority of visitors, had occurred throughout the match
until they boiled over with the penalty in the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that supporters of the Tehran side Piruzi, the
first division leaders, were also involved in the violence as they
backed the home side against their bitterest rivals.

<HEADLINE> Angola Only Accepts Talks on Capitulation of Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The ruling People's Liberation
Movement of Angola (MPLA) has said that the Angolan government can
only accept negotiations on the capitulation of Jonas Savimbi,
head of the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
"With Savimbi, we will only negotiate on his capitulation,"
official sources Tuesday quoted Joao Lourenco, secretary-general
of the ruling party, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If he surrenders, we will preserve his life. Otherwise, of
course, he will go to tribune to respond to questions on what he
did," Lourenco pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As for followers of Savimbi, the ruling party leader said that
"the government has opened all the doors to those who are willing
to give themselves up."
</P>
<P>
Lourenco, who is in Paris attending a meeting of the
international socialists, reaffirmed the military victory achieved
by the government troops, but admitted that there should exist
"serious problems" in his country, mainly due to the acts by the
followers of Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
"Two or three individuals in civilian dress can penetrate into
our zone and inflame two or three cars," the secretary-general
said, noting that "Savimbi has few days for his flight."

<HEADLINE> Angola, Zimbabwe to Reinforce Techno-military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The techno-military cooperation
between Angola and Zimbabwe will be reinforced by a visit paid by
the Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi, official sources
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi's visit to Angola will be made Tuesday, just two days
after the Angolan government Sunday denied a report by South
African weekly Saturday Star, which accused the Zimbabwe troops of
being involved in the Angolan civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
The South African weekly last weekend published a report saying
that a 2,000-strong Zimbabwean contingent was found in the Angolan
territory fighting alongside the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Angolan Defense Ministry said that the
reinforcement of bilateral techno-military cooperation will be
restricted in the field of cadre formation.
</P>
<P>
According to the program of the three-day visit, the Zimbabwe
defense minister will meet in Luanda with his Angolan counterpart
Kundy Paihama and visit installations of the General Staff of the
Army. On Wednesday, his delegation will pay a visit to the
Province of Benguela.

<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian Prime Minister
Rinchinnyamiin Amarjargal's recent China visit helped to advance
bilateral trade and diplomatic ties, Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman
Zhang Qiyue said here today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Through his working visit from November 5-8, the Prime Minister

<P>
The two heads of government exchanged views on bilateral
relations and issues of common concern, and reached wide-ranging

While talking about stepping up trade cooperation, both sides
noted that the two economies are highly complementary, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian side expressed the intent to make more and better
use of China's Tianjin Harbor, while the Chinese side promised to
improve services there, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also reached agreement and exchanged documents
concerning Chinese aid to its northern neighbor, a move which was
decided upon during President Jiang's Mongolian visit in July this
year.
</P>
<P>
"The Mongolian Prime Minister's visit was a complete success,
which enhanced bilateral understanding and trust, and promoted the
development of a long-term, stable, and healthy neighborly
relationship of mutual trust," Zhang added.

<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has paid
great attention to the human rights condition in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), said Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue at a regular press conference here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
From November 1-2, a HK SAR delegation formulated a report on
the implementation of the relevant provisions of the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that China is not a state party to the
Covenant, China transmitted the report, a first-ever such report
which was compiled solely by the HK SAR government, to the UN
Commission on Human Rights, in accordance with the Covenant and
the principle of "one country, two systems," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
According to the HK SAR Basic Law, provisions of the Covenant,
which are adaptable to the Special Administrative Region, still
apply after Hong Kong's return to the motherland, and are
implemented according to the laws of the HK SAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in English
soccer history, lucky losers in the second round of this year's FA
Cup will get the second chance to fight for the final trophy of
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The F.A.'s Challenge Cup Committee announced that one loser
from the 20 clubs knocked out in the second round would get a
second chance as replacements for holders Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
United have decided to quit the FA Cup, the first side not to
defend the trophy in the competition's 127-year history, and are
taking part in the new world club championship in Brazil instead.
</P>
<P>
The 20 losing clubs from the second round will go into a draw
with the one pulled out playing away at the last team drawn from
the regular third round draw.
</P>
<P>
"We have been determined that the beneficiaries of this unique
situation should be a smaller club outside the premier league and
the first division." an F.A. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In theory it will now be possible -- although highly unlikely --
for a team to go out in the second round, beat the same opponents
in the next round and go on to win the cup.
</P>
<P>
Only once before -- in the 1945-46 season immediatly after the
Second World War when ties were played over two legs for the first
and only time -- has a club lost in the F.A. Cup and still reached
the final.
</P>
<P>
Charlton Athletic lost 2-1 to Fulham in a third round second
leg match but won through 4-3 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
They went all the way to the final before losing 4-1 after
extra time to Derby County.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Fourth General Conference
of the East Asian Regional Branch of International Council on
Archives (EASTICA) opened Tuesday in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Under the theme of "Records Appraisal and the Preservation of
Electronic Information," the biennial conference drew the
participation of about 100 archivists, information and records
management professionals from China, Japan, South Korea, Mongolia,
Macao and Hong Kong regions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Carrie Yau, director of
administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
said archival appraisal has become more complicated with the
advent of the electronic age and the increasing application of
information technologies in records and information processing.
</P>
<P>
"The fragility of the electronic medium and the rapid cycle of
technological obsolescence make the long-term preservation of
archival records created in electronic systems seem even more
formidable," she said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, four international renowned specialists are invited
to deliver lectures on the records appraisal and present reports
on the latest world research endeavor in tackling problems of
electronic records.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition on Archival Equipment and Supplies will also be
held concurrently with the conference, which will run through
November 12.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some 200 local participants from senior management of
government agencies, universities and private sectors will attend
the lectures and special sessions.
</P>
<P>
EASTICA was established in August 1993 in Beijing, with its
members increasing to 27 from 12 at the beginning.

<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Steve McManaman has dashed off
to join the England squad for the Battle of Britain Euro 2000 play-
off with Scotland declaring: "I feel fine."
</P>
<P>
The Real Madrid winger played for 61 minutes in Lee Dixon's
testimonial Monday night in a bid to prove his fitness for England
ahead of Saturday's Euro 2000 play-off clash with Scotland.
</P>
<P>
McManaman, who has just returned from a six-week lay-off with a
thigh injury, declared himself fit if needed by England coach
Kevin Keegan for the crunch clash against the Scots.
</P>
<P>
"I feel fine," said McManaman. "I've now played for an hour in
two games in the last three days and I have felt no reaction to
the injury. Now I'm going straight off to the England team hotel
to meet up with the rest of the lads and I can look forward to the
weekend."
</P>
<P>
McManaman's rapid recovery was more good news for Keegan, who
saw a fully-fit squad report for duty last night.
</P>
<P>
The England boss has suffered numerous early withdrawals from
his previous squads but while he will be checking on the sharpness
of the likes of Michael Owen this week during training, there are
not believed to be any other major injury concerns.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Release Withheld Afghan Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
ordered the release of goods imported under the Afghan Transit
Trade (ATT) and withheld at the Karachi Port for the last six
years, official sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The order came after conclusion of the first round of talks
here Tuesday between The Afghan delegation led by Taliban Deputy
Foreign Minister Mulla Muhammad Jalil and the Pakistani team led
by Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has ordered the release of 101 items while some
others would be released after another round of talks between
officials of the two countries in Islamabad," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The deposed government of prime minister Nawaz Sharif had
directed the release of Afghanistan's stuck-off goods at the
Karachi Port four months ago. However, the orders could not be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Pakistan has waived 8 billion rupees
(about 153 million U.S. dollars) of excise duty on these goods.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour meeting, the Pakistani side urged the
Taliban to ensure that 17 items, which have already been banned
under ATT, should not be smuggled into Pakistan from Afghanistan,
said the sources.
</P>
<P>
It has been decided that a high level delegation of the Taliban
Ministry of Commerce will visit Pakistan within a week to discuss
ways of stopping re-import of these items into Pakistan from
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has imposed restrictions on ATT several years ago
after Pakistani businessmen complained that electronic goods,
which are exported under ATT for Afghanistan, are re-imported to
Pakistan, damaging Pakistan's local industry.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Resumes Manpower Export to Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will resume export of
trained manpower to Malaysia next month after a nearly two-year
recess under special arrangement, Labor and Employment Minister M
A Mannan said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the press the minister said that Bangladesh will
send 1,500 skilled workers in the first phase next month and the
number will increase gradually.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia stopped recruiting manpower from Bangladesh and other
Asian countries in 1997 and declared 150,000 out of 300,000
Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia to be illegal.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad reviewed his
government's overseas labor recruitment policy at the persuasion
of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and decided to resume
recruitment of Bangladeshi workers.
</P>
<P>
Mannan stressed that the government is determined to maintain
some strict principles on manpower export to Malaysia and other
countries to uphold the goodwill and image of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are searching for alternative employment sources in East
and Southeast Asia, Africa and even in Europe," the minister said,
adding that at least 1,000 workers would be sent to Brunei soon.
</P>
<P>
More than three million Bangladeshis are now working abroad.
Remittances from overseas workers reached 1.51 billion U.S.
Dollars in 1998 compared with 1.34 billion U.S. Dollars in 1997.

LOS ANGELES -- A Web browser war in the United States has come
to an end with Microsoft's Internet Explorer dominating the market,
a local market research firm declared here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its final browser survey of 236 U.S. companies, Zona
Research found Microsoft's Internet Explorer was the primary
browser choice for 64 percent of the respondents, while 36 percent
indicated Netscape Navigator. There were nine players on the
browser frontier battling for a slice of a market of 200 million U.
S. dollars in 1996, said the firm's first browser study in January

WELLINGTON -- The Labor Party, the main opposition party in New
Zealand, has reaffirmed its opposition to the lease or purchase of
F16 jets from the United States and its refusal to buy more Anzac
frigates from Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion Tuesday quoted Labor's defense spokesman Geoff
Braybrooke as saying that if his party wins the November 27
election, it will examine the F16 contracts "and if possible
cancel them." The current New Zealand government with the National
Party as its ruling party has a lease-to-buy agreement with the
United States on 28 F16 fighter planes, which the Labor Party
regards as "poor prioritization of defense funds." (New Zealand-

<HEADLINE> Study Says Healthy Habit Reduces Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A study released Monday by
the Harvard School of Public Health said that women who eat
sensibly, don't smoke, get some exercise, keep the weight down and
have an occasional drink, can reduce their chance of heart disease
by an astonishing 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many studies over the years have shown the importance of
specific habits such as kicking cigarettes or cutting out
saturated fat. But Harvard researchers say their report is the
first to show what happens when people do everything they are
supposed to.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted at the Harvard School of Public Health,
was presented in Atlanta at a meeting of the American Heart
Association.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Frank B. Hu, one of the authors of the study, said those
who followed all of the standard health advice reduced their risk
of heart attacks, congestive heart failure and stroke by 82
percent compared with the other women in the study.
</P>
<P>
While genes can play a role in early heart attacks, they
largely result from unhealthy living habits, he said. The study
results "are very dramatic, because these are not drastic changes
for people," he said. "Premature heart disease can be virtually
eliminated by these lifestyle changes."
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted on 84,129 nurses who were between 34
and 59 years old when it began in 1980. During 14 years of follow-
up, 1,129 of them developed heart disease. Even though all the
participants were female, Hu said, he believed the results would
be similar for men.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Pasternak of Massachusetts General Hospital said
the research was important because it suggested that controlling
heart disease is possible without any new technology or
discoveries. "There is a good chance that we could wipe out this
epidemic if we do everything we already know about," he said.

<HEADLINE> Investment Plays Key Role in Flood Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The drastic increase in
spending on water conservation facilities has played a key role in
ensuring the safety of the Yangtze River region this year, China's
vice minister of water resources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jiyao said at a press conference that investment after
last year's severe flooding until the start of this year's flood
season stood at 40.9 billion yuan, bringing down the risks along
the Yangtze River alone by 83 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of summer, flooding on the Yangtze has been
almost as severe as last year, but because of strengthened
embankments the river posed much less danger, and repair work
along the river required only one-sixth to half of the materials
used last year.
</P>
<P>
Lake Taihu in east China witnessed the worst flooding in
history, but thanks to the drastic improvement in the flood
control facilities, the safety of its surrounding areas was
ensured this year, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has used 4.6 billion yuan to fortify the
bank around the lake since last year, and losses were brought down
by 9.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Despite the achievement, China's flood control system remains
flawed and needs significantly higher funding, Zhang said, adding
that harnessing the Yangtze alone would need around 120 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministry is considering the use of overseas
investment in building key water conservation projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the early 1980s, he was assigned with the work of setting up
a stone quarry and processing company. To learn more about his
occupation, he went on a research trip to the desert in western
Inner Mongolia, where he discovered large areas strewn with queer
stones, which he gathered.
</P>
<P>
To raise money for a queer stone museum, he went to Xiamen, at
the southeast coast of China, and set up an export-oriented gem
processing factory. But he contracted cancer and later all of his
stones were stolen.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Zhang has rebuilt his collection, and now his
rocks stones are stored in several different locations in Xiamen
and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the many difficulties he has faced, he remains
philosophical about life and rocks.
</P>
<P>
"These stones are like humans," he said, adding that "No matter
how many hardships they have endured, they retain their high
spirits. Life has refined these stones -- that makes them more
meaningful."

<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Jing, an established
expert on grassland construction and water resources conservation,
spends most of his retirement operating a traveling rock museum.
</P>
<P>
For 41 years, the silver-haired 72-year-old has devoted his
spare time to collecting oddly shaped stones, which he views as
abstract art. He now has 100,000 rocks that resemble, among other
things, chickens, owls, bears, flowers and flying saucers.
</P>
<P>
Zhang came to Beijing three years ago hoping to set up a
permanent rock museum, but found he could make more money moving
his exhibition from spot to spot in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Currently, his stones are displayed in the basement of a high
rise building in western Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang started his rock collection in 1955, as the result of
stopping a fight between a farmer and a shop clerk in Inner
Mongolia, where he was assigned to work after college graduation.
The clerk refused to buy what the farmer claimed was a bone,
insisting that it was only an ordinary rock. Zhang suspected the
object was a fossilized elephant tusk, and bought it at a much
higher price.
</P>
<P>
He has collected unique stones ever since.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Fourth General Conference
of the East Asian Regional Branch of International Council on
Archives (EASTICA) opened Tuesday in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Under the theme of "Records Appraisal and the Preservation of
Electronic Information," the biennial conference draws
participation of about 100 archivists, information and records
management professionals from China, Japan, South Korea, Mongolia,
Macao and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Carrie Yau, director of
administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
said archival appraisal has become more complicated with the
advent of the electronic age and the increasing application of
information technologies in records and information processing.
</P>
<P>
"The fragility of the electronic medium and the rapid cycle of
technological obsolescence make the long-term preservation of
archival records created in electronic systems seem even more
formidable," she said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, four international renowned specialists are invited
to deliver lectures on the records appraisal and present reports
on the latest world research endeavor in tackling problems of
electronic records.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition on Archival Equipment and Supplies will also be
held concurrently with the conference, which will run through
November 12.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some 200 local participants from senior management of
government agencies, universities and private sectors will attend
the lectures and special sessions.
</P>
<P>
EASTICA was established in August 1993 in Beijing, with its
members increasing to 27 from 12 at the beginning.

<HEADLINE> Washington willing to Extradite Two Suspects to Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States will extradite
two important suspects to South Korea if the latter requests after
a bilateral extradition treaty goes into effect, U.S. FBI Director
Louis Freech said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Freech, who is attending the 68th ICPO-Interpol session here,
told a press conference that the United States government will
hand over Lee Suk-hee, former deputy chief of South Korean
National Tax Service, and Lee Suk-chae, former minister of South
Korean Information and Communication if the South Korean
government requests.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government will be pleased to accept the request by
the Korean government for the arrest (of the two suspects)," said
the FBI director.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and the United States signed a bilateral
extradition treaty in June 1998. The treaty, which was passed by
the U.S. congress last month, is expected to be ratified by the
South Korean National Assembly, or parliament, late this month.
</P>
<P>
Lee Suk-hee is charged with extorting campaign funds from
businessmen for then ruling party candidate Lee Hoi-chang during
the 1997 presidential election by threatening tax audit.
</P>
<P>
Lee Suk-chae is accused of receiving bribes when he was in
charge of the government's selection of personal communication
service providers.
</P>
<P>
South Korean prosecution has recently asked the United States
branch of Interpol to help find the whereabouts of the two
suspects.
</P>
<P>
According to South Korean Justice Ministry, 263 South Korean
criminal suspects are hiding in the United States after committing
various crimes in South Korea.

<HEADLINE> ADB, World Bank Urge Greater Efforts for Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank called here Tuesday for
greater and joint efforts to reduce extreme poverty in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the four-day "Manila Social Forum," ADB President
Tadao Chino said that Asia, especially East Asia, has made the
greatest progress in reducing poverty during the last two or three
decades.
</P>
<P>
"However, the recent Asian crisis has clearly demonstrated how
vulnerable such progress can be. To sustain the past progress and
ensure that all people benefit from economic development, we need
to intensify our efforts in reducing poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present, nearly 900 million people, or almost
70 percent of the world's poor, live in Asia and Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"At least one of every three Asians has no access to safe
drinking water. Problems of illiteracy and malnutrition persist in
the region. In addition, the region has been undergoing a rapid
and significant social and economic transformation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, many areas lack an adequate social safety
net, which protects the poor and prevents the vulnerable from
being adversely affected by development," Chino said.
</P>
<P>
He said that significant poverty reduction can only be possible
with rapid and sustainable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, economic growth alone does not guarantee all
people in society benefit, especially in countries where the poor
lack access to and share in the fruits of growth.
</P>
<P>
"Given our development mandate, we shall continue to support
economic growth in a way that maximizes its contribution to
reducing poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the meeting, Jean-Michel Severino, vice
president for East Asia and Pacific of the World Bank, said that
rapid growth cannot be the primary safety net, provider of jobs
and income security in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The (Asian financial) crisis has underscored that growth is a
prerequisite for restoring incomes of the poor and principal
vehicle for improvement in their welfare, but it is simply not
enough," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Asian economic recovery is not yet reaching
everybody and is still fragile.
</P>
<P>
"While sustained economic growth is clearly the only viable
engine driving poverty reduction, experience shows that the rising
tide does not lift all boats equally," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that bringing the weakest and the most vulnerable from
the margins of the society to the center stage is one of the
fundamental challenges facing the region.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official called on governments, private sectors
and the international community to make joint efforts to reduce
poverty in the region.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Asian policy makers started here Tuesday morning the
"Manila Social Forum," which will address Asia's policy issues,
including social safety nets and social protection.
</P>
<P>
The forum, organized jointly by the Asian Development Bank and
the World Bank, will address global labor market, regionalization,
urban and rural poverty reduction, social expenditures and reform
of the social sectors, and corporate restructuring.

<P>
SEOUL, November 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korean presidential think-
tanks have set five national goals and made 10 national
development strategies for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Commission on Policy and Planning and the
Presidential Commission for the New Millennium Tuesday unveiled
the five goals and 10 strategies at a two-days joint conference on
"National Visions and Strategies for the New Millennium."
</P>
<P>
The five national goals consist of a pluralistic democracy,
dynamic market economy, creative knowledge-based country,
cooperative community and becoming Asia's central nation.
</P>
<P>
The 10 national strategies are productive and harmonious
politics, government innovation, consistent economic reform,
innovation in knowledge, information and education, productive
welfare, democratic citizenry, symbiotic environmental community,
cultural pluralism, peaceful national integration and progressive
participation in the global community.
</P>
<P>
The goals and strategies are based on the belief that
globalization, development of knowledge and information, and
democratization will be the major challenges faced by South Korea
in the new millennium, said the commissions at the conference
attended by some 1,000 academics and experts.
</P>
<P>
Conference discussions focused on a total of 16 topics,
including the market economy of the new millennium, social
development, science and technology development, national
reunification and women's issues.
</P>
<P>
Proposals made at the conference included one for establishing
a free trade agreement among South Korea, China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The presidential think-tanks will improve the goals and
strategies based on the discussions at the conference and submit
them to President Kim Dae-jung later this month.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Potential GDP Growth Rate Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The potential growth rate of
South Korea's gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have
dropped to the 4 percent level this year, from 7 percent before
the financial crisis in late 1997, said the Bank of Korea in a
report issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The potential GDP growth rate refers to the pace at which an
economy can grow without sparking inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the sharp decline in the potential
GDP growth rate to sluggish investment in facilities since the
financial crisis triggered by corporate failures and bad loans of
financial institutions in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The potential growth decline is believed to be likely to foil
the nation's hope of reenacting its past high growth.
</P>
<P>
The report said the output gap due to fast recovery of the real
economy has been rapidly decreasing this year, raising the
possibility that inflationary pressure may materialize in the
foreseeable future, although analysts said inflationary threats
are not yet imminent since the nation's real GDP is still below
potential GDP.
</P>
<P>
The output gap rate, which stood at minus 9 percent in the
second half of last year, is estimated to be at minus 4.2 percent
for the same period this year.
</P>
<P>
The output gap rate is expected to enter positive territory
around the third quarter of next year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
But, in light of the declining output gap, inflationary
pressure from demand may build up next year.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Problem Resolved in Sea Ports, Shipping Businesses (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China's sea ports and ocean
shipping enterprises are fully prepared for Y2K millennium bug,
hoping to avoid possible computer glitches which would lose them
overseas and domestic customers.
</P>
<P>
The ports and enterprises have carefully studied the Y2K
problem and invested heavily to renovate and upgrade all computer
systems and equipment where the Y2K problem may exist, Feng Maorun,
chief engineer of the Ministry of Communications, told Xinhua
today.
</P>
<P>
"The profits of all customers will be guaranteed at the turn of
the century," he said.
</P>
<P>
People both in China and from overseas have noted their concern
about whether China's ports and enterprises have resolved the Y2K
problem, Feng said.
</P>
<P>
He added that computerized management has been applied in China
's sea ports and ocean shipping businesses, which if grounded by
the Y2K bug could threaten the lives of sailors, safety of vessels
and interests of customers.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications is one of the 20 key units
designated by the State Council to resolve the Y2K matter, while
the port and navigation system is regarded as a priority for the
effort in the communications sector.

<P>
A special inspection team of officials and experts from the
ministries of information industry and communications recently
toured ports and transport enterprises in east China's Shanghai
and Ningbo cities and the north China port city of Tianjin, saying
that they are confident the sea ports and ocean shipping
enterprises will enter safely into the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai and Ningbo ports have resolved the Y2K problem in all
large computer systems and the effort has passed assessment. The
China Ocean Shipping Corporation (COSCO), the country's leading
sea transport enterprise, has tested and revised more than 5,200
computers and other equipment vulnerable to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
Feng said that China's sea ports and ocean fleets have drawn up
emergency contingency plans to cope with Y2K accidents, and
rehearsals of the plans are continuing.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K millennium bug stems from the way that early computer
programmers used only the last two digits of the four-digit year
number in an effort to save memory. In this sense, computers may
take the year 2000 as 1900, and disorders will occur.

<HEADLINE> Regulations Issued on Commercial Codes Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China's top code management
agency has issued a notice stressing that the state exercises full
authority over the research, manufacturing, marketing and use of
commercial codes.
</P>
<P>
The notice, released here today by the office of code
management committee under the State Council, notes that units
engaging in commercial code research must be approved and
designated by the office.
</P>
<P>
To enhance management of commercial codes in the country, the
State Council promulgated on October 15 a set of regulations,
which went into effect on that day.
</P>
<P>
"Those units that don't have the approval of the office must
immediately cease their research and manufacturing of commercial
codes," the notice says.
</P>
<P>
Businesses involved in the marketing of commercial code
products must first obtain licenses from the office. Those without
the licenses and approval will not be allowed into the field.
</P>
<P>
Units and individuals that researched, used or purchased
commercial code products (including overseas products and related
equipment) prior to October 15 should report to the office, the
notice says.
</P>
<P>
China-based overseas organizations, enterprises and individuals
should also report to the office if they use code products and
equipment with code technology, it says.
</P>
<P>
Those who continue to research, manufacture, market or use
commercial code products without authorization will be punished
according to the regulations, it warns.

<HEADLINE> Britain Apologizes to Zimbabwe for Attack on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain has formally apologized
to the Zimbabwean government for the attack on President Robert
Mugabe by a group of gays during his recent stop-over in London,
Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge confirmed.
</P>
<P>
After contacting British African Commonwealth Affairs Minister
Peter Hern, Mudenge told reporters in Harare Monday that the
British government regretted the attack on President Mugabe at
Buckingham Gate as he left St. James Court Hotel for home.
</P>
<P>
Four gays pounced on Mugabe in full view of cameras in what
appeared to be a well-organized mission.
</P>
<P>
"They will ensure that it will not happen again," Zimbabwean
newspaper Herald daily Tuesday quoted Mudenge as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean foreign minister said that British authorities
had expressed "ignorance" at the incident as they had not
anticipated it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwean government has dismissed British
media reports suggesting that Zimbabwe, along with Zambia, Sri
Lanka and Kenya, be suspended from the Commonwealth for perceived
human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Daily Telegraph Monday, a London-based
foreign policy center had compiled a report suggesting that
Zimbabwe be censured for failing to uphold human rights. The
center is an independent think-tank,

whose president is British Foreign Sectary Robin Cook, with Prime
Minister Tony Blair as its patron.
</P>
<P>
"This is ridiculous and utter rubbish," said Mudenge, who
chairs the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group.
</P>
<P>
He added that this report has no relevance to proceedings at
the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Durban
later this week.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parliament Okays Govt's Power Deal with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- After nine months' debate, the
Uganda Parliament has finally given the government go-ahead to
sign a power purchase agreement with AES Nile Power, a U.S.
company.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company proposed to develop a 430-million-U.S. dollar
hydroelectric project at the Bujagali Falls in Jinja, 80 kms east
of capital Kampala, the New Vision newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan legislature Monday passed a resolution authorizing
the government to guarantee Uganda Electricity Board's obligations
and the World Bank partial risk guarantee under the power purchase
agreement with the AES.
</P>
<P>
The resolution will enable the U.S. company to move to the last
stage of financial closure before it begins constructing the dam
project which is expected to curb the current power shortfall.
</P>
<P>
The motion was moved last Friday by State Minister for
Privatization Manzi Tumubweine, but was pushed to Monday due to
lack of time.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the project which is expected to
generate 250 megawatts of electricity annually, power will be
likely to become a major export commodity and earn the east
African country some 120 million dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
With a capacity of generating only 180 megawatts of electricity
against a demand of 260 mcountry's industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Only some five percent of the country's population have access
to electricity and 80 percent of Ugandans are living in Kampala,
Jinja and Entebbe, the three largest cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Industries are facing 90 days of power interruption in a year.
Uganda's per capita power consumption is the second lowest in the
world, next to Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Monaco Prince Invites Estrada For State Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Monaco Crown Prince
Albert Alexandre Louis Pierre on Tuesday invited Philippine
President Joseph Estrada for a state visit when he goes to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was extended during the two leaders' meeting at
the presidential palace here, where they discussed issues
involving environmental protection, tourism and other issues of
mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Rodolfo Reyes, who was present during the
bilateral meeting, told reporters that Estrada did not give any
commitment as to whether he would come to Monaco and when, since
no definite schedule for his visit to Europe has yet been
finalized.
</P>
<P>
"They discussed a little on environmental protection and about
their concern on the environment. The prince also extended an
invitation for the president to go to Monaco, just in case the
president goes on a European trip," Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there is a plan for President Estrada to Europe
next year, Reyes said "at the moment there's none but I suppose
during his incumbency, he would be making a trip to Europe but
there's none scheduled in the near future."
</P>
<P>
During their 30-minute bilateral meeting, Reyes said the prince
expressed to President Estrada his plan to go to a Palawan resort
in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"They discussed about environment and the prince said he is
looking forward to his vacation in Palawan resort," Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
The prince arrived here Tuesday morning on an 8-day visit,
which earlier press reports said is aimed at enhancing close ties
between the Philippines and Monaco.

<HEADLINE> China's Industry Grows Seven Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese industry registered
181.8 billion yuan in added value in October, up seven percent
from the same month last year, the National Bureau of Statistics
said today.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the slowdown to a high base rate for
October 1998, and a prolonged three-day holiday of the National
Day on October 1.
</P>
<P>
For the January-October period, the Chinese industry had an
added value of 1,625.8 billion yuan, an increase of 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's report said that the state-owned enterprises and
the joint stock firms slowed down in production growth while the
foreign-funded and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan invested industrial
firms speeded up production, which pushed up its monthly added
value by 12.3 percent to 38.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The state sector completed an added value of 104.5 billion yuan,
a yearly rise of 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The heavy industry had an added value of 103.7 billion yuan
last month, up 7.6 percent while the light industry reached an
added value of 78.1 billion yuan, an increase of 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sales rate of industrial products went up by 0.41
percentage points to 92.27 percent in October, thanks to brisk
sales of light industrial products, said the report.
</P>
<P>
With the rise of the export tax rebate and the recovering of
the neighboring economies, China's export picked up in momentum in
the recent few months.
</P>
<P>
In October, China's industrial firms exported 102.4 billion
yuan worth of goods, up 9.4 percent on an annual basis. For the
first ten months of the year, China's industrial export rose 8.1
percent, which is 2.4 percentage points higher than the rate for
the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> ADB Works out New Poverty Reduction Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
announced here Tuesday a new poverty reduction strategy to help
the Asia-Pacific region to eradicate extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the bank's new strategy, ADB President Tadao Chino
said: "Despite the development of gains of the past few decades,
Asia is still home to 900 million extremely poor people. This is
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"Public policy and action can change this and we are
re-focusing our work with the single, over-arching goal of
eliminating poverty from the region."
</P>
<P>
The ADB's poverty shift will affect every aspect and level of
its operation, the bank said in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it is setting up a new poverty reduction unit by
the end of this year to spearhead of the drive.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based bank, which finances roughly 6 billion U.S.
dollars worth of projects and programs yearly, will readjust its
project focus, it said.
</P>
<P>
"At least 40 percent of all public sector lending will be for
poverty interventions," said the bank.
</P>
<P>
The ADB's new strategy will concentrate on the rural and social
sectors, and will also invest more to provide the poor, especially
women, access to essential services.
</P>
<P>
With emphasis on economic growth in earlier years, ADB financed
Asia's urgent need for physical infrastructure -- electricity,
roads, irrigation systems, school building and health centers. In
later years, the bank expanded its focus to include human
development, gender equity and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"However, the Asian crisis, which reversed decades of
development in some countries, underscored the fact that Asia has
a massive under-class which has been untouched by the general rise
in prosperity," said ADB Vice President Peter Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that governance is crucial to the success of the
strategy, especially in the rural areas, where government
institutions are frequently the weakest in capacity, commitment
and accountability.
</P>
<P>
"The ADB will also use new tools to bring its operations closer
to the poor. These include lending directly to local governments,
promoting social and investment funds and supporting
non-governmental organizations with proven track records for
helping the poor," it said.

<HEADLINE> SOEs Rely Heavily on Technological Upgrading (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) have embarked on a massive technological upgrading drive
with state approval of the first batch of 159 projects in the
country's eight key industries.
</P>
<P>
The industries include metallurgics, textiles, paper-making and
five others.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of the government's efforts to lift SOEs out of
difficulties in a three-year period," an official with the State
Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The second and third group of technological upgrading projects
currently under review will also be decided shortly," he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Yi Hui, director of the SETC's overseas fund management
department, said the fact that 80 percent of Chinese SOEs need
technological upgrading provides good opportunity for the entry of
overseas capital and advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will work out favorable policies to
encourage overseas investors to take part in the current drive, he
added.
</P>
<P>
China issued an additional 60 billion yuan (7.2 billion US
dollars) in treasury bonds in September, 9 billion yuan (1.08
billion US dollars) of which are scheduled for use in
technological upgrading. It is estimated that the fund can trigger
180 billion yuan (21.7 billion US dollars) of additional
investment for technological upgrading in state firms.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most of China's traditional industries have a
surplus production capacity, but they still rely heavily on
imports. For example, China imports more than 6 billion meters of
high-quality textiles each year.

<HEADLINE> SOEs Rely Heavily on Technological Upgrading (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More and more Chinese SOEs have realized the importance of
technological upgrading.
</P>
<P>
 Northeast China's Liaoning Province, an old industrial base
with the largest number of SOEs in the country, is a key province
for the reform. Sources said that 2,200-plus SOEs in Liaoning have
conducted technological upgrading using some 5 billion US dollars
of overseas capital this year.
</P>
<P>
Developing new production techniques is another way for SOEs
to shed their financial woes. The Fengyuan Group, in east China's
Anhui province, was a small citric acid factory in the red for six
straight years. But the factory started earning huge profits when
it successfully replaced Chinese potatoes with maize in producing
citric acid.
</P>
<P>
The technique, once considered impossible among fellow
producers, shortened the ferment period of citric acid by half of
the formerly tried methods, and reduced costs by 400 U.S. dollars
per ton. In the first five months this year, Fengyuan reported 1.7
million yuan in profits and earned 21 million U.S. dollars in
exports.
</P>
<P>
The metallurgical sector is a key industry for the current
technological upgrading drive. Due to the sluggish domestic and
global market, the goal to lift all state-owned iron and steel
companies out of debt seems more difficult than ever.
</P>
<P>
However, the Handan Iron and Steel Complex, in northern Hebei
province, did not wait for the market to improve, but took the
initiative to improve its own technological level.
</P>
<P>
The investment of the complex in the ongoing five projects
equals the pervious 40 years' total, and the company will become a
national plank producing center next year when these projects are
completed.

<HEADLINE> Drop in China's Economic Growth Will End: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The decline in China's economic
growth rate in recent years will end this year, with the yearly
growth rate for 1999 predicted at around 7.6 percent, almost the
same as last year, according to an academic report soon to be
published.
</P>
<P>
The report, finished by a group of scholars from the China
Academy of Social Sciences, bases the conclusion on the outcome of
the government proactive fiscal policy and various consumption-
stimulating measures.
</P>
<P>
China has earlier set this year's growth rate at seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The report puts the growth rate for 2000 at between 7.5 to
eight percent, adding that a steady growth will, however, depend
on a number of domestic and international variables.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, fixed asset investments for 1999 and
2000 are estimated at 3,130 billion yuan and 3,410 billion yuan,
respectively, up 10.3 percent and 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total retail volume is expected to grow by 10 percent and 9.
4 percent, respectively, for the two years under review.
</P>
<P>
The declining trend of the price index will also be controlled,
the report says. In 1999, the fluctuation of the retail price
index is predicted at -3.0 percent, and the figure for 2000 will
be 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, China's foreign trade has already seen
some positive signs. In 1999 and 2000, the growth in imports will
remain faster than in exports, and China will have a trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
The report will be published by the Social Science Literature
Press before the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan President Blames Media for Exaggerating Casualties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has blamed the media for exaggerating military
casualties in the fierce fighting last week, the Government
Information Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I regret that some media institutions have grossly exaggerated
and in fact continue to report highly misleading casualty figures
of government forces," Mrs. Kumaratunga said in a statement issued
late on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Reports indicate that the number of security personnel killed
in action from November 2 up to 7 is limited to 101, much below
the suspected figure earlier," said Kumaratunga in the first
statement since the latest fighting broke out
</P>
<P>
She said more than 500 of 743 wounded soldiers are expected to
return to duty shortly and 122 others are reported missing after
the rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) captured
territory in the northern Wanni region.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that the LTTE has lost over 150 cadres, 120 of
whose names have already been published. The number of LTTE cadres
wounded in action is reportedly large," said Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE launched their latest offensive, codenamed "Unceasing
Wave 3", late Monday last week, wresting control of a large chunk
of territory in the Wanni region that they had lost in the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
The losses in the Wanni region are the latest losses of the
military's major setbacks in the 16-year-old civil war and could
affect Kumaratunga's reelection hope in the presidential poll
slated for December 21.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Kumaratunga said she had ordered a reorganization of the
Army High Command following the loss of some military complexes in
the Wanni region, including the towns of Oddusuddan, Nedunkerni,
Mankulam and Kanakarayankulam.
</P>
<P>
The new commanders have begun sending reinforcements to shore
up defenses around the garrison town of Vavuniya, about 200
kilometers north of the capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE have been fighting for a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Exposes Falun Gong Traps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, carried a signed article in its overseas edition
today exposing the evil snares spread by the heretical Falun Gong
cult.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Gong cult has attracted such a large number of
practitioners because it uses many cunningly-designed tricks and
traps, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Health-conscious people are tempted into the cult by its false
claims that it can cure terminal illness through meditation alone
and that medicine is unnecessary for treating physical ailments.
</P>
<P>
People confused by the ways of society and nature are
brainwashed into believing the Falun Gong's heresies that the end
of the earth is near, and that the earth will one day explode, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong positions itself as the saving grace for people who
feel powerless in their life, promising peace in heaven for people
who pledge total obedience to the group.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that once a person is trapped by the
cult, he or she gradually becomes completely controlled by the
spiritual prison.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong has every feature of a cult. Led by its founder Li
Hongzhi, Falun Gong has organized several demonstrations that went
against governmental regulatory measures against such gatherings.
</P>
<P>
Within the organization, followers blindly worship Li Hongzhi,
and individuality and personal dignity are sacrificed for the sake
of the group.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Gong cult defies civilized society and order, and
violates the Chinese people's human rights, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that since the government declared the ban of the Falun
Gong cult, more and more Chinese people have seen through the
charade and have seen the cult in its true light.
</P>
<P>
However, Li Hongzhi and his kind, now residing abroad, continue
to stir up trouble and behave like enemies of the state, the
article said, adding that more rigorous efforts are needed to rid
this cancer from society.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on AFTA Process Held in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on the implementation
of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) began here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar is sponsored by the Institute of Strategic
and International Studies Department of Myanmar and Sasakawa Peace
Foundation of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier-General Abel, minister at the Office of the Chairman
of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, said at the
opening session that to create common ground for achieving the
ultimate goal of the ASEAN by the year 2020, almost all the ASEAN
economic cooperation is radiated from the Framework Agreement on
Enhancing ASEAN Economic Cooperation Agreement.
</P>
<P>
He added that to establish an AFTA is one of its brilliant
responses to the rapidly changing global economic environment.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
for performing better than some other groupings in many respects.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Myanmar has the obligation to reduce the
tariffs of its products to between zero and 5 percent by 2008.
</P>
<P>
He complained that although the ending date had been brought
forward, implementation of the AFTA was challenged in mid-1997 by
the Asian financial crisis which pushed the ASEAN into a dilemma,
forcing ASEAN leaders to choose between backsliding on economic
integration and keeping on accelerating its implementation.
</P>
<P>
He also complained that the ASEAN has not progressed well in
the liberalization of trade in services which is a more difficult
process.
</P>
<P>
He revealed the parameters and phases under which the services
negotiations will be conducted.
</P>
<P>
He added that in the transition period, the parameters will be
further refined by sectoral experts to suit the specific needs of
their service sectors.
</P>
<P>
He also said the ASEAN is implementing the ASEAN Industrial
Cooperation Scheme which provides a window of opportunity for each
ASEAN firm to exploit its comparative advantage.
</P>
<P>
According to the bold measures adopted at the Sixth ASEAN
Summit in 1998 in the acceleration of AFTA, the six original
member countries would bring forward the completion of the AFTA by
one year to 2002 instead of 2003. The new members including
Myanmar shall maximize their tariff lines between 0 and 5 percent
by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Attending the seminar are officials of the Myanmar Foreign
Ministry, National AFTA Unit and Investment and Companies
Administration Department.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Industrial Production Increases in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's industrial
production index for the third quarter of 1999 increased by 13.6
percent over the same period of 1998, the Statistics Department
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The index for the period under review was also 5.4 percent
higher than that for the second quarter of this year, the
department said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly attributed to the growth of the
manufacturing sector which registered a 18.7-percent rise for the
third quarter over a year earlier and a 6.3-percent growth over
the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The electricity sector also contributed to the increase, it
said.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of 1999, the department said, the
industrial production index recorded an increase of 5.9 percent
over a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Support Rate for New Zealand Opposition Party Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Party, the major
opposition party in New Zealand, has surged ahead to a 13-point
lead
over the National Party, the ruling party in the country, in
public
support in the latest TV3-CM Research poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which surveyed 1,000 voters last week and whose
result
was published Tuesday, contradicted Friday's New Zealand Herald-
Digipoll survey, which showed Labor's lead over National narrowing
to
only two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The support rate for the Labor Party rose four percentage
points
from last month to 41 percent while the support rate for the
National
Party fell five percentage points to 28 percent, according to the
TV3-CM Research poll.
</P>
<P>
The National's potential coalition partner ACT gained one
percentage point to 10 percent while the Labor's ally the Alliance

was steady at 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that the center-left bloc formed by the Labor
Party and the Alliance could hold 61 seats in the 120-seat
parliament
with its own votes plus the votes it could get from minor parties
that failed to obtain at least 5 percent of the nationwide party
votes. That means that the Labor-Alliance could govern without
support from other parties after the November 27 election.
</P>
<P>
The poll has a 3.1 percent margin of error.

<HEADLINE> Jets, Frigates Off New Zealand Labor's Defense List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Party, the main
opposition party in New Zealand, has reaffirmed its opposition to
the
lease or purchase of F16 jets from the United States and its
refusal
to buy more Anzac frigates from Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion Tuesday quoted Labor's defense spokesman Geoff
Braybrooke as saying that if his party wins the November 27
election,
it will examine the F16 contracts "and if possible cancel them."
</P>
<P>
The current New Zealand government with the National Party as
its
ruling party has a lease-to-buy agreement with the United States
on
28 F16 fighter planes, which the Labor Party regards as "poor
prioritization of defense funds."
</P>
<P>
Instead of Anzac frigates, which the government is eager to buy

from Australia, the Labor Party will look at "less-expensive,
multi-
role naval ships," the Wellington-based newspaper quoted
Braybrooke
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested in expensive, floating weapons
platforms,"
he said, indicating that the Labor Party is interested in
multi-role
ships such as the Danish Standard Flex 3500, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"We'd prefer ships that can fill practical roles supporting
land
operations, transporting troops and equipment, helping out
disaster
relief, as well as defending ourselves," Braybrooke was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The position of the Labor Party has been criticized by New
Zealand
Defense Minister Max Bradford, who said the Labor Party would "run

down air and sea firepower and leave New Zealand troops
vulnerable."
</P>
<P>
"It would be like fielding a rugby team without a front row,
wings
and a fullback," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand spends about 1.5 billion NZ dollars (780 million
U.S.
dollars) a year on defense.

WELLINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
announced Tuesday that the list of diseases for which mandatory
tests
are carried out for immigrants will be expanded to include HIV as
of
July 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Currently only tuberculosis and syphilis tests are mandatory
for
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said the new requirements will apply to
applicants for residence (including refugee-status seekers),
people
who intend to work or study in New Zealand for two years or more
and
people proposed by the UNHCR for the refugee quota.
</P>
<P>
"The move is in keeping with our policy to balance the rights
of
entry with the potential risks to New Zealanders. It is purely a
preventative step," the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet has agreed to maintain the current policy of not
requiring medical assessments for applicants for short-term entry
(less than two years) to New Zealand," it added.

<HEADLINE> Australia Restores Ecosystem in Murray-Darling Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government has
newly allocated 3.58 million U.S. dollars under the foundation of
the Natural Heritage Trust for community-based projects to help
rehabilitate the salt-ridden Murray-Darling Basin.
</P>
<P>
Australian Press Association reported Tuesday that the relevant
basin states -- New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South
Australia -- made their contributions to the funding which is
aimed at restoring land systems, wetlands and flood plains,
improving and protecting the water quality, improving the health
of the river systems and encouraging economical and
environmentally sustainable land use.
</P>
<P>
An authoritative joint ministerial commission of the federal
government and related states issued last month a report revealing
the dangerous salinity level in the Murray-Darling Basin. In 50
years, land in the basin would be unsuitable for crops and water
undrinkable, the report warned.
</P>
<P>
Experts believed that it was the clearing of native vegetation
that resulted in salinity. 200 years ago the total eastern part of
the continent was covered by virgin forest of which now only odd
pieces are available.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government has allocated 125.44 million U.S.
dollars over the past six years to restore balance to the basin.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Warren Truss said in a statement, "The
Murray-Darling Basin is Australia's most important agricultural
region, producing about 40 percent of Australia's 3.25 billion
U.S. dollars annual agricultural wealth."
</P>
<P>
"It takes in about one-seventh of Australia's land mass and its
long-term sustainability is vital to Australia's economy and
environment," Truss said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Shi Guangsheng, minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation, said here today that the
mainland and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) can
conduct mutually beneficial cooperation in the trade and economic
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Shi was speaking to Chau Tak Hay, secretary for Trade and
Industry of the HKSAR Government and Hong Kong delegates who are
here for the first conference of the Mainland-Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade which
opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that if the scientific and technological advantages of
the mainland and the strength of Hong Kong's finance, shipping and
information services are combined, it will help improve the
competitiveness of exports of both places.
</P>
<P>
That was also the aim of the high-tech fair held not long ago
in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone neighboring Hong Kong, Shi
said.

<HEADLINE> Lung Cancer Remains Top Cancer Killer of American Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Lung cancer remains the
number one cause of cancer death of women in the United States and
new cases in women are poised to outpace cases among men for the
first time, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although perceived as "man's disease," said the report from the
National Foundation for Cancer Research (NFCR), lung cancer is
currently the leading cause of cancer death for both women and men,
responsible for approximately 32 percent of all cancer deaths in
men and 28 percent of cancer deaths in women. Lung cancer killed
160,000 Americans in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At one point, half the adult women in the United States were
smokers, and almost 25 percent continue to smoke today, according
to the NFCR.
</P>
<P>
Women who are former smokers retain a heightened risk for lung
cancer development. In fact, the report said, more than 50 percent
of newly diagnosed lung cancers occur in former smokers. As a
result, lung cancer incidence in women has increased by 451
percent in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, available data shows that women are
more susceptible to lung cancer than men. There is preliminary
data to suggest that estrogen-related hormones may promote cancer
development in women exposed to tobacco. And female patients with
lung cancer are less likely to be able to repair damaged DNA than
male patients -- an indicator of possible heightened
predisposition to cancer.
</P>
<P>
An NFCR project now undergoing at the University Texas aims to
identify the genetic and hormonal differences in women that put
them at greater risk for lung cancer.

<HEADLINE> Auto Industry Sustains U.S. Bearings Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Strong growth in the
automotive industry is sustaining the U.S. market for bearings, an
American market research firm reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hit by a severe reduction in demand for OEM (original equipment
manufacturer) products sold in Asia, the U.S. bearings market,
which generated 6.45 billion U.S. dollars in revenues in 1998, has
been experiencing little growth, said the report from Frost &AMP;
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
The Asian economic crisis has also influenced the U.S. bearings
industry by increasing competition as foreign manufacturers seek
to benefit from the strong U.S. market, the research firm said.
</P>
<P>
The automotive industry, however, seems untouched by the
decline in the bearings market. Passenger vehicles, light trucks
and heavy trucks have experienced double digit growth during 1998
and it has continued into the first half of 1999 and is expected
to remain strong, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Railroads, increased automation and a great demand for
computers are also contributing to maintaining growth in the
market divided into segments of ball bearings, roller bearings and
plain bearings.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the strong U.S. economy has provoked increased
consumer spending, particularly recreational and exercise
equipment that employs bearings.

<HEADLINE> Web Browser War Ends in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A Web browser war in the
United States has come to an end with Microsoft's Internet
Explorer dominating the market, a local market research firm
declared here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its final browser survey of 236 U.S. companies, Zona
Research found Microsoft's Internet Explorer was the primary
browser choice for 64 percent of the respondents, while 36 percent
indicated Netscape Navigator.
</P>
<P>
There were nine players on the browser frontier battling for a
slice of a market of 200 million U.S. dollars in 1996, said the
firm's first browser study in January of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Browser is the program that serves as the front end to the
World Wide Web on the Internet. In order to view a site, the user
types its address (URL) into the browser's Location field and the
home page of that site is downloaded to the user.
</P>
<P>
The success of Internet Explorer and Navigator are reflected in
the growing number of companies with browser policies mandating
uniformity in desktop configuration, Zona said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly three quarters of companies interviewed have a corporate
browser policy that encourages or requires use of a particular
browser, the Zona study showed. Of the companies with a browser
policy, 69 percent dictate the use of Internet Explorer, while 31
percent require the use of Navigator.
</P>
<P>
No other browser has been named as part of a corporate policy,
Zona said.
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing a shift away from the importance of the
browser technology to the content on the Internet," Zona said. "
It is not surprising that the two dominant browser vendors now
play a significant role in the burgeoning content marketplace.
The question is how will the content war play itself out."
</P>
<P>
The latest browser survey also indicated that 36 percent of
companies monitor Internet content based on a list of approved
sites. Twenty-three percent of all monitoring is based on the
user's job function, 19 percent of all monitoring is based on the
size of the transmission, and 14 percent of monitoring Internet
content is based on the time of day.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Advance to Sri Lankan Army-Held Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels
advanced into the territory held by government troops on three
fronts in Northern Province of the country Monday, Tamil sources
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the three fronts are Manal Aru, Omanthai and
Pallamadu areas in the eastern, central and western Vanni
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting continued in the border areas of Vanni as the
advancing columns of the Tigers' forces made further thrusts
Monday into the northeastern sector of Manal Aru and regained vast
tracts of territory from the occupying Sri Lankan government
troops, they said.
</P>
<P>
Government troops re-established new defenses in the north of
the country Monday after losing vast territory to the Tamil rebels
in fierce fighting last week, military sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The troops engaged the rebels in counterattacks near the
northern town of Omanthai while a fresh defense line was being
built to hold back possible further thrusts by the rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), they added.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has captured at least 10 towns as ferocious battles
raged in the north of the country, leaving up to 1,200 combatants
dead on both sides, officials earlier said.
</P>
<P>
Both the LTTE rebels and the government troops have been
engaged in a fierce artillery duel in the three areas for the last
10 hours, Tamil sources said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government troops are dismantling several
camps in the eastern Trincomalee and Batticoloa districts in a
desperate effort to reinforce troops in the border regions of
Vanni to halt the rapid advance of the LTTE rebels, the Tamil
sources added.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a war against the government
for a separate state for the Tamil minority in the north and east
of the country since 1983 and more than 55,000 people have
reportedly been killed in the war.

<P>
MANILA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has been
designated as country coordinator for the Visit ASEAN Millennium
campaign, the region's largest tourism promotion program,
Philippine News Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Secretary Gemma Araneta said this will be a cooperative
competition, saying, "The Asian region will be promoted as a
single tourist destination with a special focus on intra-ASEAN
travel."
</P>
<P>
Araneta said special tour packages will be developed and
promoted in key markets such as Europe, North America and selected
countries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Brochures, maps and films will be produced and special events
to feature the region's varied cuisine, sports, music and arts
will also be organized, Araneta said.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines will benefit from this exposure. We will have
a wider promotional reach than we would on our own. However, the
competition will still be there because each ASEAN country will be
promoting the best it has to offer," Araneta pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which will run from the year 2000 to 2002, will
highlight the historical, cultural and natural attractions of the

<HEADLINE> Dixon's Big Night Nearly a Wright-Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Ian Wright almost ruined Lee
Dixon's big night out after his high jinks delayed the kick-off of
the full-back's testimonial at Highbury Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
It was party night for Arsenal full-back Dixon as more than 22,
000 fans turned up to pay tribute to the loyal 35-year-old and see
the Gunners beat Real Madrid 3-1.
</P>
<P>
But the star of the show was undoubtedly former Highbury
favorite Wright who delayed start of the match by 20 minutes after
he threw some of the players' shirts out of the dressing room
window.
</P>
<P>
Celtic striker Wright, who played for the last 20 minutes as a
guest substitute, opened the dressing room window before the game
and asked fans outside if they wanted a present.
</P>
<P>
He then threw out the shirt of Marc Overmars, followed by that
of Davor Suker, still on its hanger, much to the delight of the
gathering hordes.
</P>
<P>
But it meant that kit man Vic Akers had to dash to the Arsenal
club shop and get replacement shirts and then have them printed up
with new names and numbers.
</P>
<P>
Wright, the club's all-time record goalscorer, earned the
loudest cheer of the night when he came off the bench to replace
Suker but Dixon, who will have earned around 300,000 pounds from
the night, had no complaints.
</P>
<P>
Dixon joked: "It was very nice for me to play in Ian Wright's
testimonial! I had nine shots on goal and all of them were off-
target, but the atmosphere was brilliant and magnificent
</P>
<P>
"I would like to thank all the fans whether they were here
tonight or not for all their support over the years," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's "Forest Capital" Bans Logging in Half of Woodlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Yichun City, known as China's "
forest capital" located in northeast China, has banned logging in
nearly half of its natural forest in an effort to protect forest
resources.
</P>
<P>
Among Yichun's 2.32 million hectares of natural forest, logging
is prohibited in 1.424 million hectares and is limited in another
0.896 million hectares of forestry land.
</P>
<P>
The timber output of Yichun, Heilongjiang Province, is reduced
to 1.99 million cubic meters this year from 1998's 2.14 million
cubic meters, according to the production plan.
</P>
<P>
Yichun, with nearly three-fourths of its land covered with
trees, is one of China's key state-owned forestry areas. "
Guangming" is a domestic name brand of wood furniture made in
Yichun.
</P>
<P>
Years of over-logging started Yichun's tree shortage in the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The city has worked to reduce its timber yield and cultivate
forest reserves through various means, including the planting of
250,000 hectares of trees.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of Health and
Education from Ibero American countries gathered here Monday to
address regional issues concerning infancy and adolescence.
</P>
<P>
The conference, co-sponsored by the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) and the Cuban Foreign Investment and Economic
Cooperation Ministry (MINVEC), coincided with the 10th anniversary
of the Convention on Children's Rights.
</P>
<P>
Per Engebak, UNICEF general director for Latin America and the
Caribbean, said in his speech that the region has paid greater
attention to young people after a decade of arduous work.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that "at the threshold of the 21st century,
nearly half of Latin American and Caribbean population live in
poverty and of this, half is made up by boys and girls under 18."
</P>
<P>
He specified that around 6 million children and adolescents in
the region are victims of violence every year, while 85,000 of
them die at their own homes.
</P>
<P>
Under-age labor is another serious problem in the region. It
is estimated that there are 20 million boys and girls working
under the age of 15, he said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Trying to Help Tigers Regain Wild Nature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A goat is exerting its utmost
strength trying to escape from the chase of a giant tiger, but in
vein, and becomes a meal of the colorful big cat at the end of the
race.
</P>
<P>
It is not a scene from any of the Disney cartoons. It is but a
everyday game at a tiger research center in Meihua (Plum Blossom)
Mountain, in Fujian, a coastal province that faces Taiwan across
the straits.
</P>
<P>
Local researchers believe that after years of efforts, Meihua
Mountain may regain its past reputation as the ancestral home and
the most favorable habitat for the South China Tiger, also known
as the Chinese Tiger or the Xiamen Tiger.
</P>
<P>
The number of the tiger, who used to be widely seen in eastern,
southern and southwestern parts of the country, has declined
drastically in the past decades due to rampant human activities
including hunting and lumbering.
</P>
<P>
Currently, an estimate 20 to 30 South China Tigers are living
in the wild, while 53 of the species are living in captivity. The
tiger has been listed among the most endangered animals as its
number is far less than that of giant panda which stands at around
1,000.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, China has began to explore ways for
retaining the rare species, in close collaboration with some
international organizations concerned.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a South China Tiger salvation program was launched
and the research center was set up in Meihua Mountain to help the
big cat to recover its capabilities to live in the wild and
increase their number.
</P>
<P>
To date, 1.5 million yuan (about 180,000 U.S. dollars) has been
spent on the project, mostly going to infrastructures, according
to scientists working at the center.
</P>
<P>
At present, the three seed tigers introduced for breeding from
a zoo in Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province, in September last year,
have got used to their new home in Meihua Mountain.
</P>
<P>
The big cats are now weighed at about 150 kilograms each and
have entered the heat period.
</P>
<P>
Along with the daily chase game, the days are gone when the
tigers were so tame that "they could be frightened to illness by
encountering a deer", said one of the scientists.

<HEADLINE> Nordic, Baltic Nations Support Russia's Territorial Integrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Government leaders from five
Nordic and three Baltic countries on Monday expressed support for
the territorial integrity of Russia, but called on Moscow to find
a political solution to its Chechen issue.
</P>
<P>
Prime ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland,
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania made the call at a joint press
conference here after their annual meeting on closer cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They noted that though the issue was not the focus of their
meeting, their countries shared the view that Russia should
maintain its territorial integrity and combat terrorist activities
but the effort should not be taken as the pretext of staging
military actions in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops moved into Chechnya in September to attack
Islamic rebels who invaded a neighboring province and whom Moscow
blames for bombings in Russia that killed nearly 300 people.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers described the current situation in Chechnya
as "grave" from both humanitarian and political points of view,
urging Russia to settle the conflict through political means
rather than military actions.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, whose country
holds the current rotating chairmanship of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said the Chechnya issue
would come under spotlight at the OSCE summit in Istanbul next
week, when the 54 member states are expected to take some steps on
the matter.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A member of the
Colombian Parliament, Carlos Arturo Ramos Maldonado, was kidnapped
by the National Liberation Army (ELN), said his brother Manuel
Ramos Maldonado on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said "ELN disclosed that Carlos and his press secretary
Jorge Utrilla are being held by the ELN."
</P>
<P>
Carlos, the Chamber representative for the "Ciudadano" movement,
left home Saturday "to see to commitments in Bogota, and since
then we hadn't heard anything from him until the kidnapping was
confirmed this morning," said Manuel.
</P>
<P>
He said that ELN is holding his brother in order to send a
communique about the fate of the people abducted in del Retorno
marsh, near Baranqullia.
</P>
<P>
Last week ELN freed eight persons it had kidnapped in a Cali
church on May 30, which included five journalists and two
cameramen, captured for four days, and a photographer from the
British news agency Reuters, who was held for nine days.
</P>
<P>
ELN is the second largest rebel group in Colombia, following
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).

<HEADLINE> Brazil Shuts Down Illegal Timber Yards in Amazon Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazil has closed down 68
illegal lumberyards in the Amazon area in the last two months in a
campaign to protect the Amazon jungle.
</P>
<P>
The country's Environmental Minister Jose Sarney Filho said
Monday that 40 percent of the timber yards have been closed so far
in the Amazonia area, which covers nine states in northern and
northeastern Brazil.
</P>
<P>
These lumberyards were shut down for storing lumber illegally
cut, unauthorized forest exploration, and unregistered operations.
</P>
<P>
In the nine states in the Amazon region, 6,706 lumberyards are
currently running with the official approval of the Brazilian
Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (
IBAMA).
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the past two decades, 550,000 square
kilometers of forests in Brazil's Amazon region have been
destroyed, representing nearly 10 percent of the tropical jungle
area.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government decided to allot 580 million U.S.
dollars to protect the Amazon jungle last July.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shuttler Picks Asian Cup to Build Waning Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's men's singles
shuttler Hendrawan is aiming to rebuild his motivation and
confidence in the upcoming JVC Asia Cup in Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam, this week.
</P>
<P>
"For me, the Asia Cup is an important event to show my quality
as a world-class shuttler. This year I haven't shown a great
performance in some tournaments. I could not perform my best game.
I found that badminton was not challenging anymore. In the Asia
Cup, I'll just try to win all my matches. I consider it a
challenge for me," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan, now world number 11, will fly to Ho Chi Minh City on
Tuesday with world number three Taufik Hidayat and the world's
second best pair of Candra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan. The Asia Cup
will take place from November 10 to 14.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan said the Asia Cup was a part of his strategy to
compete in the Grand Prix Finals in Brunei Darussalam from
December 1 to 5.
</P>
<P>
"In the Grand Prix Finals, I always have problems overcoming my
opponents in early matches as I am a slow starter. I have to be
realistic to qualify for the Olympic Games as my rivals don't only
come from other countries, but are also my own teammates," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has Taufik, Budi Santoso, Marlev Mainaky and
Hariyanto Arbi in the world top ten.
</P>
<P>
"I am the world number 11 now. Hopefully, by the end of the
year my ranking won't decrease. If it does, I have to work harder
next year to reach the top three among my friends to qualify for
the Olympics. For now, I have to make a new commitment to regain
my supremacy," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Baltic Countries Call for Closer Relations With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of five Baltic
countries on Monday called for closer relations with Russia,
noting that it would be difficult for Europe to maintain lasting
stability without Russia's active role.
</P>
<P>
The presidents -- Lennart Meri of Estonia, Vaira Vike-Freiberga
of Latvia, Valdas Adamkus of Lithuania and Aleksander Kwasniewski
of Poland -- were meeting in Jyvaskyla, central Finland, at the
invitation of their Finnish counterpart Martti Ahtissari to mark
the 10th anniversary of the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The five presidents noted that the European pattern has
undergone fundamental changes since the collapse of the Berlin
Wall in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Polish President Kwasniewski said a closer European cooperation
would be impossible without Russia's participation and that Poland
aims at a genuine and all-round integration of Europe.
</P>
<P>
He expressed full confidence in the development of Russia,
pledging efforts to strengthen political dialogue, economic
cooperation and mutual trust between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Finnish President Ahtissari, whose country serves the current
rotating presidency of the European Union (EU), noted that Finland
has enjoyed good relations with Russia since it entered the EU in
1995.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU and Russia have an established form of contact
and that even on the most sensitive issues like Kosovo and
Chechnya, the two sides are able to keep political dialogue going.
The EU is willing to carry forward its relations with Russia, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian President Adamkus said he believed Russia would find
a way to be part of the European integration and its participation
in the entire integration process is in the interest of all
countries.
</P>
<P>
Latvian President Vike-Freiberga said that with the dismantling
of Russia's Skrunda radar station in her country in October and
the withdrawing of Russian military agents ahead of schedule, a
new foundation has been laid for the relations between the
countries.
</P>
<P>
She said the Cold War has truly ended and the spheres of
influence under geopolitics have become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
Estonian President Meri said that since the former Soviet Union
fell apart in 1991, Estonia has established good relations, on a
new basis, with East European countries, especially Russia and
Ukraine.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Poland's official foreign
exchange reserves last month dropped to 25.8 billion U.S. dollars
from September's 26 billion dollars, the country's central bank
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 1.3 billion dollars less than the same month last
year and 1.6 billion dollars less than last December.
</P>
<P>
The bank blamed the slackening economy, a precarious political
situation, and an unstable zloty, Poland's currency, for the
plunge.
</P>
<P>
Contradictions and divisions within the Polish government have
led to the turbulence of the country's stock market, which has in
turn reduced the value of the zloty.
</P>
<P>
Exports dipped by 8.1 percent in the first half of the year
compared with the same period in 1998, while imports decreased by
6.6 percent, leaving a trade deficit of 8.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Income from border trade during the first three quarters of the
year plummeted by 43 percent compared on a year-to-year basis, the
central bank said.

<HEADLINE> Water, Soil Conservation Project in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank-financed project
on water and soil conservation has been initiated along the Yellow
River Valley in the Loess Plateau in north and northwest China.
</P>
<P>
With a total of 2.95 billion yuan (355 million US dollars) and
150 million U.S. dollars from the World Bank, the project will
focus on the 18,100-sq km area of soil erosion in 12 valleys along
the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the second longest in the
country after the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven counties in Gansu, Shaanxi and Shanxi province and
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will benefit from the project,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The Loess Plateau covers a total area of 640,000 sq km. Serious
soil erosion in the area had caused agricultural conditions to
deteriorate until 1994, when the first loan of 150 million U.S.
dollars from the World Bank was used for a soil conservation
project.
</P>
<P>
Water and soil conditions have returned to normal in more than
3,800 square kilometers in the valley region after five years
efforts, local authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Dome Company Denies Poor Ticket Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Millennium Dome company on
Monday denied reports of dismal early ticket sales in the face of
cash flow problems for the centerpiece of Britain's year 2000
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Ross Cook, spokesman for the New Millennium Experience Company,
said the sales were strong.
</P>
<P>
"If they continue at this rate, the Dome will meet -- if not
exceed -- its target of 12 million visitors," the Reuters quoted
the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after a Financial Times survey of ticket
outlets around Britain which suggested there had been little
public interest in the Dome despite a four million pound (6.5
million dollar) advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
No date had sold out so far, including January 1, the Financial
Times said, citing the Dome's own ticket hot-line.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that out of more than a dozen news agents in
Edinburgh, none had sold a single ticket for the Dome -- a giant
umbrella-like building with a 758 million pound (1.2 billion
dollar) price tag.
</P>
<P>
It said the 20 pound (32.50 dollar) adult admission price was
too expensive.
</P>
<P>
"The report does not give an accurate picture and can hardly be
described as a scientific survey. They spoke to 40 retailers
whereas there are 25,000 National Lottery retailers selling
tickets nationwide," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the organizers had been given an
additional 50 million pound public subsidy, in the form of a loan,
to help cover cash flow difficulties.

NEW YORK, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose Monday
despite the ruling by a federal judge against Microsoft Corp.'s
"monopoly" in computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
14.37 at 10,718.85.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 6.78 at 1,377.01 while the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 41.68 at 3,143.97, surpassing the
record closing high of 3,102.29 points Friday for the six straight
records.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's stock prices fell sharply initially in the session
because Judge Thomas Jackson ruled last Friday that the computer
maker abused its dominance of the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
But at the close of trading, the company's stock recovered some
of losses as government officials and Microsoft talked of the the
possibility of a settlement.
</P>
<P>
While Microsoft was punished by the ruling its rivals rejoiced
and its losses were balanced by others' gains. Sun Microsystems, a
critical of Microsoft's business practices, rose and Red Hat, an
alternative to Microsoft's popular Windows NT system, soared as
well.

<HEADLINE> Taylor Rejects Wages Fear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- English soccer players' chief
Gordon Taylor rejected Premier League chairman Dave Richards'
claim that spiralling wage demands could force some clubs out of
business.
</P>
<P>
Richards, who is also chairman of Sheffield Wednesday, is
alarmed by the growth in players' salaries during the 1990s and
doubts that it can be sustained much longer. Taylor, who is the
chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association,
understands Richards' concerns.
</P>
<P>
However, he claimed the hike was not down to the players and
that it merely reflected the millions of pounds which have been
pumped into the game in recent years. Taylor insisted that players
were not holding clubs to ransom and that it was the
responsibility of boards to ensure that they pay their players
what they can afford.
</P>
<P>
"This is the nature of the game at the moment," he said. "It's
the clubs who are prepared to pay these wages.
</P>
<P>
"Even in Dickens' time if you made sure your expenditure was
less than their income you would have nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
"Players don't force clubs' arms up their backs.
</P>
<P>
"Instead players realise choice to pay these wages.
</P>
<P>
"Clubs have to be run as normal businesses and football is just
the same as any entertainment business and if you are staging a
concert you are not going to pay the musicians more than the
audience brings in, otherwise you will go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
"The game is about players and it has always happened that the
best clubs pay the best players the best money.
</P>
<P>
"But it's also important that clubs don't over-reach themselves
and try to keep pace with each other. If clubs cannot afford these
wages they should try and develop their own players," he said.

answer -- the perfection of the system for bypassing the (U.S.)
missile defense system, if Washington withdraws from the ABM
Treaty," said Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Russian Duma
Committee for International Affairs in an interview with the Ekho
Moskvy radio station. (Russia-US-ABM)

<HEADLINE> Ginola: Ljungberg Didn't Butt Me </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- David Ginola may be able to
clear Arsenal's Fredrik Ljungberg of his red card, by telling the
Football Association the Swedish winger did not headbutt him.
</P>
<P>
Referee David Elleray showed 10 yellow cards and two reds as
Tottenham won the north London derby 2-1 at White Hart Lane.
Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said he had been told by his players
that the sending off of Ljungberg was for butting Ginola.
</P>
<P>
Wenger said that Ljungberg protested his innocence and promised
to review a tape of the game to see what happened, adding that if
he felt his player was in the clear, he would launch an appeal.
Ljungberg's hopes of a successful appeal have been boosted after
Ginola told the London Evening Standard: "He did not head-butt me.
"
</P>
<P>
Instead, Ginola claimed he may have been poleaxed by an object
thrown from the crowd, and the Frenchman offered his support if
Arsenal try to have Ljungberg's red card overturned.
</P>
<P>
Ginola said: "Freddie did not butt me. I didn't know he had
been sent off for that. I have no problem telling the FA this. I
was just looking at what was going on and I was then hit in the
face by something."

<HEADLINE> (Feature) Chinese Painting, Calligraphy Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Painting and
Calligraphy Exhibition opened here Monday at the visitors lobby of
the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, with the theme "Nature and Humanity", was
sponsored by the Chinese Mission to the United Nations in
cooperation with the United Nations Department of Public
Information and artists from the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
This exhibition comprises about 80 great and valuable works of
painting and calligraphy of about 28 outstanding contemporary
artists, including masters like Qi Gong, Wu Guangzhong, Bai
Xueshi, Guan Shanyue and Li Xiongcai.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin
Huasun launched the opening of the exhibition by saying "I always
believe that we live in a colorful kaleidoscopic world, the beauty
of which lies in its diversity and plurality."
</P>
<P>
Qin said " Each nation, with a different historic background, a
different culture, a different language, and its own unique way of
understanding and appreciating life and beauty, acts and
interacts, composing a real colorful and a real gorgeous
picture."
</P>
<P>
"It is in this diversity that we find beauty and harmony, as in
a Chinese painting, tall mountains are often accompanies by
murmuring streams, magnificence coexists with grace ad charm...,"
said Qin.
</P>
<P>
"If diplomacy is an important way for governments to interact,
art is no doubt one of the best ways for different nations and
peoples to appreciate each other, as it is without border, it is
expressive, it is easy to strike an accord," added Qin.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, UN Under-Secretary-General
Kensaku Hogen, along with hundreds of U.N. diplomats and staff as
well as reporters, represented the opening of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Chinese painting and calligraphy is dazzling pearl in the art
treasure-house of the world. Chinese painting formed its unique
style almost 1700 years ago. Ever since that time, the charm and
beauty of landscape, flowers and birds have become a timeless
subject of the Chinese painting masters.
</P>
<P>
By depicting the charm and beauty of landscape, flowers and
birds, the artists express their feelings through the painting of
nature. With their paintings, they try to interpret the high
degree of harmony between humanity and nature and understanding of
the relationship between the environment and sustainable
development, thus opening up an ideal world in front of the
beholders.
</P>
<P>
Preserving the ecological environment and achieving sustainable
development have been important topics for discussion at the
United Nations in recent years, especially after the convocation
of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in
1992. It is more than appropriate to have these works displayed at
the United Nations to manifest their love towards nature.
</P>
<P>
Now as humanity is about to enter a new millennium, the
exhibition, which will be on view from November 8 to 18, may give
one the feeling of harmony and enlightenment.
