 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Trivia question: Which starting pitcher did the
Astros use their first-round pick on in 1993?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Answer: Closer Billy Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   It may have taken a few years for Wagner to find his calling,
but ever since it has been a match made in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting how decisions are made that seem
insignificant at the time but could totally change a kid's
career,'' said general manager Gerry Hunsicker.
</P>
<P>
   The change almost didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   With all the hype befitting a No. 1 pick, Wagner entered spring
training in 1996 with a shot at making the Astros' rotation. There
was lobbying for Wagner, the talk of the organization at the time
because of his ability to fling a baseball at ungodly speeds, to
break camp with the club.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker balked. Wagner was sent to Class AAA Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The flirtation with Wagner and a starter's role didn't end
there. A few months later, Hunsicker went to watch Wagner pitch and
couldn't believe his eyes. What he saw was a starting pitcher in
need of three pitches.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hunsicker, Wagner had a fastball ``that was
certainly good but not great'' and little control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually one of those situations where I was
disappointed,'' Hunsicker said. ``I guess it was because the
expectations were so great. Many times that happens, when the
expectations become so great you can never quite live up to them. I
came out of there scratching my head because I didn't see the
polish I was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, bad is good. After 70 starts in five minor-league
seasons, Wagner made it to the big leagues _ as a reliever. Billy
The Kid was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it,'' said Wagner, who was eased into his new role
after an injury sidelined closer Todd Jones. ``I was all for being
a reliever, even before they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years, 158 appearances, 62 saves and a $10.3 million
contract later, he hasn't looked back.
</P>
<P>
   The questions, however, beg to be asked:
</P>
<P>
   What if the Astros hadn't needed help in the bullpen?
</P>
<P>
   What if Wagner had remained a starter?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd probably still be in the minors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, at 27, Wagner is one of the game's top closers. And one
of the hardest throwers, with pitches that approach 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's 30 saves last year (despite missing almost a month
after being hit in the head by a line drive) were the third-best
total in club history. Doug Jones holds the record with 36 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you get 30 saves in the league nowadays, it's
average,'' said Wagner. ``I think getting 30 saves for a guy on a
team like ours should be nothing. I think it's hard work to get 30,
but we won 102 games. I should have had 45 saves. I don't think you
can be one of the top closers until you've saved 40 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner converted 30 of 35 save opportunities in 1998, including
a stretch of 19 in a row. He averaged 14.6 strikeouts per nine
innings, fanning the side on 11 occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations may be greater now with his salary increase
from $280,000 a year ago. But his approach will remain what it
always has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to know they have faith in me and that I'm going to
be the closer for the next three years. The financial security
makes things a little bit easier,'' Wagner said. `` I go out there
and try to do my job converting every save. There are going to be
games I blow, unless you have one of those great years where
everything goes your way. I still go out with the same mind frame:
`Hey, I've got to get this guy out; I can't let him score.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going out there saying, `If this guy scores, no big
deal because I'm already getting paid.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker recalls the caution taken in addressing Wagner's
then-pending move to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   As a starter, there was no doubt about Wagner's velocity, which
showed flashes of 95 mph. The concern was that he had little
control and still needed to develop secondary pitches to complement
the fastball. The idea was to use Wagner's strength in shorter
stints.
</P>
<P>
   And what once was a 90- to 92-mph fastball as a starter became a
consistent 94 to 96 when Wagner became a closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a natural in that role,'' Hunsicker said. ``He
just took to it right away. He never missed a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wagner: ``I would go all out as a starter, and I never
would be able to pace myself. I'd get to the seventh inning, but I
was exhausted and wasn't able to go into the eighth or ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner doesn't have to pace himself any longer. And National
League hitters have no time to adjust. But by no means does Wagner
consider his on-the-job transition into a reliever complete.
</P>
<P>
   There is still the much-publicized effort to develop an
effective second pitch. His fastball is still the pitch of choice,
but Wagner is using this spring to work on a changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the fastball) is my No. 1 pitch as always,'' Wagner said.
``I'm coming into camp with a good changeup. I've had it for years
but never used it. As I start to use it more and more, I've started
to get more consistent. Most hitters can jump on a fastball. You've
got to have something else as an equalizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner has gotten a crash course in throwing a changeup from his
best friend and neighbor, former Astros pitcher Donne Wall, and
all-time strikeout king Nolan Ryan, who spent a day with Wagner in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker thinks Wagner could already have developed
his second pitch had the opportunity to test it come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Former catcher) Brad (Ausmus) very seldom called for anything
other than a fastball,'' Dierker said. ``We tried to get him to,
but he felt like we were doing hitters a favor if we threw them
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The learning process continued this winter when Wagner toured
with a group of major-leaguers in Japan. He used the time to pick
the brains of other top closers, particularly San Diego's Trevor
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell there's a difference already,'' Wagner said. ``I've
got a little better understanding on what I need to do and what I
want to do with the ball. Hopefully, it will pay off.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Jeff Maggert expected to be here playing for the
PGA Tour's biggest payday ever.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His opponent in today's finale of the Andersen Consulting Match
Play Championship had far more modest expectations. Andrew Magee
was so certain he would be lounging by the pool at his Arizona home
by now, he didn't pack enough clothes for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep having to iron another shirt at night,'' Magee said.
``I had to go buy socks, too. Two pairs at $10 each.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, he said, they ought to call this place ``La
Cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ritzy La Costa Resort is a perfect backdrop for
today's conclusion to a week in which golf's top 64 players have
been whittled day by day, all in the pursuit of the $1 million top
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after The Woodlands' Maggert came from behind
to take down golf's brightest star, Tiger Woods, he proved again he
could rally in the clutch as he came from three holes down to beat
Steve Pate 1-up Saturday in the semifinals. Magee also was down by
three holes early in his match but pulled ahead and beat John
Huston 3 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   And so, it's Magee and Maggert in today's final. The winner's
share is more than either of them has won in a full year of play.
The loser gets $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The first inclination is to wonder if the Andersen Consulting
people should feel cheated because the Touchstone Energy Tucson
Open ended up with a better field over the weekend than was left at
La Costa.
</P>
<P>
   But everybody thinks it's terrific when there are upsets in the
NCAA Tournament. Why should it be different in golf?
</P>
<P>
   The lack of star quality on the final two days hasn't hurt the
caliber of golf. Maggert shot 32 on the back nine Saturday to pull
off the victory. He pulled even with Pate on the par-4 15th when he
made a 10-footer for birdie. He then got a gift on the 16th when
Pate made bogey to fall one hole behind.
</P>
<P>
   Magee's comeback was just as impressive and even more
unexpected. Unlike Maggert, who has played solidly during the first
two months of the PGA Tour season, Magee has been inconsistent,
which is why his hopes weren't high coming to La Costa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I packed for the LA Open (last week) and for maybe half of
this week,'' Magee said. ``I figured I'd be going home for a nice
weekend off. But now, I'm just thrilled about it. I figured I'd
come here and win 25 grand (the reward for losing in the first
round). And now, I'm going for a million. I'm having a great
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't having a great time after the first three holes
Saturday. He lost all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was ready to start playing the consolation
match,'' Magee said. ``That changed in about 10 minutes when he
(Huston) bogeyed the fourth hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Magee drew even on No. 10 and went 1-up with a birdie at the
par-5 12th. He went ahead two holes when Huston bogeyed the 16th.
Magee chipped in for birdie on the par-5 17th to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Magee will try to win for the fifth time in his career when the
final commences today.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert, meanwhile, will try to avoid his 14th second-place
finish compared with a single victory in his PGA Tour career.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he's not about to apologize for being in the final
of the most lucrative tournament in PGA Tour history.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way professional sports are,'' he said. ``Whether
it's basketball, football or golf, the superstars make it a great
game. If it wasn't for Tiger and David (Duval), our sport wouldn't
be what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have a very competitive sport. When you play a guy who
is playing good, it doesn't matter who you are. You'd better play
good, too, or you're going to get beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of close calls the last five years. But I'm
going to continue to keep putting myself in a position to win. And
I know sooner or later it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert is 13 under par for the five rounds he has played at La
Costa. That wouldn't have gotten him into the top three last year
at the Mercedes Championship, which was the tournament La Costa
hosted in '98.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, it's good enough for a minimum of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lot of money, more than I've made in a whole season,''
Maggert said. ``But winning the golf tournament is going to mean a
lot more to me than the million dollars. I want the victory a lot
more than putting a few more dollars in my bank account.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert played an atypical round Saturday. Normally consistent,
he made bogeys at No. 6 and No. 8, both par-4s, to put himself in a
2-down hole. That went to 3-down when Pate rolled in a 12-footer
for birdie at the par-3 11th.
</P>
<P>
   But Maggert turned on the jets after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good about the way I played the last nine
holes,'' he said. ``I gave away some holes early in the round with
some silly bogeys, and I was upset at myself. That's not what I
normally do when I play well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you give holes away with a bogey, it's like taking the
momentum and handing it to your opponent instead of making him earn
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being 3-down is a significant margin, especially when you've
only got seven holes left. Usually, the only way you can come back
from that is to make some birdies.''
</P>
<P>
   Or eagles, which Maggert did on the par-5 12th hole. He reached
the green in two shots, then drilled a 40-footer for eagle. He then
got a gift on the next hole when Pate's approach bored into the
sand and left him hopelessly sunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``On 13, I thought I had a chance,'' Pate said. ``He hit his
approach well behind the pin, and I was kind of in between clubs. I
decided to try to beat a sand wedge because I was downwind, and it
didn't clear the front bunker. I had a terrible lie and couldn't
get it close.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert had come from two holes down to beat Woods on Friday. He
said he falls back on his instincts whenever he gets behind in a
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get two or three holes behind, you have to get
aggressive,'' he said. ``You can't wait for your opponent to make
mistakes. I've always been the kind of player who isn't afraid to
fire at pins. If I'm in the fairway, I'll shoot at pins that are
tucked behind bunkers or the water.'' &QL;

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Let the games begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' second spring season swings into focus this
week with intrasquad games on Monday and Tuesday, an exhibition
against the University of Arizona on Wednesday and the opener of
the Cactus League schedule against the Colorado Rockies on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few things to keep an eye on this spring as the club,
full of new faces, searches for an identity: &QL; 
A test for Tony &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Tony Womack, acquired from Pittsburgh in a
trade on Friday, can steal bases, but what about his defense? Is he
capable of handling a move from second base to right field?
</P>
<P>
   It will be the job of outfield coach Dwayne Murphy to help the
transition go as smoothly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he'll probably be nervous, because it is difficult to
make a change like that,'' said Murphy, a six-time American League
Gold Glove winner with Oakland in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to be able to get a good jump on the ball, and then
there's reading the spin and the angle. He'll have to start during
batting practice, because doing it with fungoes is not that much of
a help.''
</P>
<P>
   Womack's arrival means more crowding in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter initially was leaning toward keeping five
outfielders and 11 pitchers, but that could end up being six and
10, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Four outfielders appear to be locked in _ Womack, Steve Finley,
Luis Gonzalez and Bernard Gilkey. The other one or two will come
from incumbents David Dellucci and Yamil Benitez, newcomer Dante
Powell, and non-roster invitees Pete Incaviglia and Ernie Young.
</P>
<P>
   Powell has been impressive early, particularly on defense, while
Dellucci and Incaviglia have been swinging the bat with authority. &QL; 
Oly's safety net &QL; 
Veteran right-hander Gregg Olson resurrected his career as a closer
with 30 saves in 1998. He will assume that role again this season,
but what if he struggles or is injured for a long period of time?
Who could step in?
</P>
<P>
   Right-handers Ben Ford and Vladimir Nunez are seen as
possibilities for the future, but they are not ready. So, short of
diving into the trade waters, the most likely candidates, believe
it or not, would be two starters from last season, left-hander
Brian Anderson and right-hander Amaury Telemaco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian is a control pitcher and `Tele' would fit because he has
a pretty good fastball,'' pitching coach Mark Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson led the National League in fewest walks per nine
innings last season (one). &QL; 
Cutting the K-rations &QL; 
Arizona batters led the majors with 1,239 strikeouts. Showalter
would like to avoid a repeat performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more mental than anything,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting coach Jim Presley said the addition of veterans such as
outfielders Luis Gonzalez and Steve Finley should help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of young guys last season, and that's what young
guys do when they're trying to make something happen,'' Presley
said. ``They can be overaggressive. But the older guys need to work
on it, too. We've addressed that this spring and will continue to.
We have to have a better approach with two strikes and generally be
more selective.'' &QL; 
No shortage of bodies &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The battle for starting shortstop between Tony Batista and Danny
Klassen is expected to go down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   The move of Jay Bell from short to second base is expected to be
permanent, but he could move back if necessary. Womack began his
career as a shortstop and could figure into the mix. Andy Fox has
been getting more work there, and veteran Dale Sveum, a non-roster
invitee, can handle the job. &QL; 
Pitchers' progress &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From left-hander Randy Johnson through the other members of the
rotation, the key will be keeping them healthy and building arm
strength, Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, starters will be limited to between 35 and 40
pitches. The number will increase. &QL; 
Another Andy &QL; 
Fox proved to be one of the club's most valuable players last
season. In 1999, Greg Colbrunn will play a similar role. He will
back up Travis Lee at first base, Matt Williams at third base,
could see a few innings in the outfield and will don the catching
gear in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn showed up early to get work with the pitchers and
catchers, but he was glad for the chance to get work at the other
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was getting a bit weary,'' Showalter said. ``He finally
threw down his gear and told the other catchers, `See you next
spring, boys.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a blue-collar guy. I sat across from him in the
other dugout (against Colorado and Atlanta last season) and you
don't want to have him with a bat in his hand in a situation that
can hurt you (as a right-handed pinch-hitter). He can really help
us.'' &QL; 
Lee locks in &QL; 
After finishing third in Rookie of the Year voting, how much can
Lee improve?
</P>
<P>
   ``He has more of an `I belong,' `I can do this' air about him. I
think he's more comfortable all the way around,'' Showalter said.
``After getting squeezed a bit last year, he should benefit from a
better strike zone. Incavigila told him that umpires stuck his bat
so far in his ear during his rookie season that he still hasn't
found it, but the second year was much, much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Presley: ``He's more mature, more relaxed . . . he knows
what it takes. Everything he does is natural.'' &QL; 
More deals ahead? &QL; 
The club has made significant upgrades over the winter, but might
not be done yet. Anderson continues to be an attractive target to
other clubs, but Arizona is leaning toward keeping him. The club
would like to add another right-handed hitter and improve the
bullpen, although nothing is likely to happen until later in the
spring, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more depth than last season and a lot more options,''
Showalter said. &QL;

DON'T LOOK NOW _ IT'S PRETTY BAD  
 NBA SCORING, SHOOTING FALL TO HISTORIC DEPTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA's marketing hook for this post-lockout, abbreviated
season may just be wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still love this game,'' the slogan goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's to love?'' might be more fitting.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, don't say you weren't warned.
</P>
<P>
   With only two weeks of training camp, often with incomplete
teams, and two preseason games instead of the usual eight, sloppy,
ugly basketball was predictable this season for the NBA's 29 clubs.
And with a compacted schedule, teams have few days to practice or
work on conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, shooting is off, scoring is down and turnovers
are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen some well-played basketball games, but some of them
have seemed sloppy,'' said forward Tom Gugliotta of the Suns, who
play host to the Golden State Warriors tonight at America West
Arena. ``Players are loose with the ball, especially at the
beginning of games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is timing, getting used to new players. But in the
last five or six minutes of close games, most teams seem to be
playing at a high level.''
</P>
<P>
   But they're not scoring at the high levels that pushed the NBA
to new levels of popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Through Friday night's games, none of the NBA's 29 teams was
averaging even 100 points a game. The Sacramento Kings led the
league at 99.6. Not since 1953-54 has the NBA failed to have at
least one team average 100 points a game, and that was the last
season before a guy named Danny Biasone, owner of the Syracuse
Nationals, came up with the idea of a 24-second shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen teams were averaging 90 points or fewer per game,
including the Chicago Bulls, who were at 79.
</P>
<P>
   The league average for scoring was 91 points a game, almost five
points a game fewer than last season. And the 29 teams were
shooting 43 percent, the worst leaguewide shooting since the
1961-62 season. In one game, the Chicago Bulls shot 26.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But is it just the lockout? Or has the labor dispute simply
magnified a downward trend in scoring that has been apparent in the
NBA for the past decade?
</P>
<P>
   Consider that most people assumed teams such as the Utah Jazz
and Indiana Pacers, who made few changes in their core of players
and had rosters loaded with veterans, would not be adversely
affected by the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   And both are among the teams with the best records. But the Jazz
scored only 56 points in a game in Seattle, the second-lowest
output since the shot clock was instituted. The Pacers set the
record last season when they scored 55 against San Antonio in
March. That performance can't be blamed on a lockout or
early-season rust.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most efficient offensive clubs in the NBA during the
past decade, the Jazz made only 21 field goals against Seattle, two
more than the all-time NBA low. Indiana is shooting only 44.5
percent for the season. The Pacers have won four games this season
without scoring even 90 points.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the ragged play, fans still are watching on
television and passing through the turnstiles. The Suns had their
home sellout streak snapped, but they still have had a full house
for four of six home dates.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 130 games played around the league, attendance
was actually up slightly from the first 130 games a year ago,
averaging 16,571 compared with 16,556 last season, a league
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   And, the NBA's ratings on NBC and Turner Sports are slightly
higher than last season _ up 2 percent on NBC, 18 percent on TNT
and 19 percent on TBS, said Seth Sylvan, director of the NBA's
sports media services.
</P>
<P>
   In the Valley, over-the-air broadcasts of Suns games on Channel
45 have averaged a 10 rating, equal to the average rating last
season, according to figures provided by the club.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lockout, many teams have simplified their
offenses, and they still aren't executing well. Shooters are rusty.
Three-point shooting also is down, and even free throw shooting has
dropped from almost 74 percent last season to 72 percent this year.
Turnovers are up from an average of about 15.5 last season to 16
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely been a little hit in the quality of play,''
said Todd Quinter, Suns scout who evaluates teams the club is going
to play and provides breakdowns of their offenses, defenses and
personnel for the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, it's almost like every other year,'' he said.
``Offenses are always simplified early in the year, and as they go
along, coaches are adding things, players are getting in better
shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just looking at the statistics, scoring and shooting are way
down, and I think that can be attributed to guys just not being in
shape yet. It's also attributed to so many players changing
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA, spacing of players on the floor and their timing
with other players as a play unfolds often are just as important as
the play itself. Quinter said he sees many teams struggling with
those aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups of players on a team may click together well, but
other groups that aren't accustomed to playing together struggle.
Thus, there can be moments of great play and sloppiness in the same
game.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody is blaming the lower scores entirely on the
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the evolution of the game of professional basketball,
where intense, energetic effort on defense is the name of the
game,'' Miami Coach Pat Riley told the ``Fort Lauderdale
Sun-Sentinel.'' ``It's never been like that before. Teams simply
realize the only way to win games is to be consistent in your
effort defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why scores are being held down. That's why field goal
percentages are down. The lockout might have contributed to it a
little bit, but not a whole lot. As much as the people in the
league office don't like what they're seeing, this is what they're
going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   And teams are better prepared than ever to play that type of
defense. Scouting is more sophisticated than ever. Scouts such as
Quinter break down every tendency of teams and players. Video
scouts such as the Suns' Garrick Barr break down opponents
play-by-play. As a result, every team knows virtually every play
the opponent is calling and how to defend it.
</P>
<P>
   With offenses simplified, it would seem to make that task even
easier this season. But Suns Coach Danny Ainge said it never has
been that complicated, and that when conditioning and familiarity
improve, so will the basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is that as long as I've been in basketball, I
think it's been simple,'' Ainge said. ``In Boston, we had to defend
the post-up, the pick and roll and the fast break. Defending those
and isolation plays are still what it boils down to at any level of
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was playing, I always knew what the other team was
running. It's trying to stop it that's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as difficult as it used to be, though. &QL;

GRUDZIELANEK HAS SOMETHING TO PROVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ It's not that Mark Grudzielanek is
oversensitive. He's just reacting the way anybody would after being
criticized by his employer.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Los Angeles Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone made
it a point to talk to Grudzielanek as training camp began. It was
the first chance both had to get together since Grudzielanek's
salary arbitration case, which went in the team's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going to be permanently in his mind,'' Malone said.
``You can't erase what was said.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek's feelings are hurt, though time could mend the
problem. Still, it's not quite the way you want your starting
shortstop to enter spring training. Before being acquired from the
Montreal Expos on July 31, rumors of the trade, and his contract
status, bothered Grudzielanek. Some suggest his play dropped off as
a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are times when he battles himself,'' Expos
general manager Jim Beattie said. ``I think it's a maturity and
experience thing. The possibility of a trade was always hanging
over his head and the contract situation hung over his head. When
you're not settled, a lot of things can affect you.''
</P>
<P>
   This is part of the arbitration process. It's been two weeks
since Grudzielanek experienced it for the first time. It's going to
be much longer before he forgets it.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Dodgers embarrassed him with some of things that
were said during the hearing. He is trying, unsuccessfully, to
separate the business and emotional sides of his profession.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to the Dodgers present a case why he isn't worth
the $3.6 million he was asking _ basically, railing about his
deficiencies _ he's supposed to play the most demanding infield
position for a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confused me a little bit,'' Grudzielanek said. ``They tell
me, `Yeah, you're our backbone, but we're going to take you to
arbitration because we want to embarrass you and make you feel like
you're not worth what you really think you are.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Montreal would treat me like this. I never thought
it would come from the Dodgers.' It really kind of shocked me,
after they traded for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek lost his case and will be paid $1.9 million for
this season, but that isn't the issue. Even if he won, he didn't
like what transpired. He considers himself a little wiser about the
business of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be here, I think we're going to have a very good
team and I'm excited about that,'' Grudzielanek said. ``But the
next time this comes up there will be no sympathy. None.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek couldn't say definitively he was over the
experience, but he figures by Opening Day he'll be fine. That is,
if he beats out Jose Vizcaino for the starting shortstop job, which
he thinks will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an everyday player, and if I'm not an everyday player,
here I will be somewhere,'' Grudzielanek said. ``But this is my
home. This is where I wanted to start over, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   It could come down to whether manager Davey Johnson emphasizes
offense or defense from the position. Grudzielanek's strength is
offense; Vizcaino is defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you could carry a glove, but now you have to be
able to hit, too,'' Johnson said. ``You have to be able to do
damage offensively and hold your own defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting has never been an issue for Grudzielanek, a career .279
hitter who was second among National League shortstops with 62 RBI
and third with 10 homers a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding is where his problems lie. In the past three seasons he
made 27, 32 and 33 errors. He was so put off by his performance
last season that he called it ``pathetic.'' It prompted him to
spend the offseason working on fielding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think defense is now a priority for him,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said. ``I think maybe he was always told he
was an offensive player. His offensive production and capabilities
was always complimented. I don't know how much emphasis was ever
placed on his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the tools. He can play defense. I've seen him play
defense. He has the ability.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has pride.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek didn't just work on grounders in his backyard
during the winter. He went to Bucky Dent's camp in Delray, Fla., to
re-learn the fundamentals of fielding. It also helped him establish
a daily routine to improve his glovework _ it begins with a
short-hands drill, taking grounders on the edge of the infield
grass, then he works his way back and takes grounders to his left
and right to improve his range. He then takes slow rollers,
fielding them with two hands and one hand, and finishes up by
turning the double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a total rebuilt engine this offseason,'' Grudzielanek
said. ``Some of things we talked about I never even heard about. My
angles and my footing, the fielding of the ball and where your
hands should be, the release point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a complete player. I want to get better and be
consistent out there. The last thing I want anyone to do is blow it
out of proportion.''

SAMPRAS FINALLY BACK IN SCOTTS DALE  
 WORLD'S NO. 1 PREPS FOR OTHER U.S. EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - Things certainly have changed for Pete
Sampras since he last played a professional tennis match in
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1988, and Sampras was 17 and ranked 157th in the world.
After upsetting Jim Courier in the second round, Sampras was
eliminated by Kevin Curren.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras returns to Scottsdale this week for the Franklin
Templeton Tennis Classic at the Canadian Pacific Scottsdale
Princess Resort in the prime of his career _ the big dog of pro
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   He has been the No. 1 player on the ATP Tour for a record six
straight years. He's one Grand Slam title away from tying Roy
Emerson's record of 12. Naturally, he's the top seed in this
tournament, followed by Patrick Rafter and Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras might not have played here this year except he wanted to
tune up for upcoming Mercedes Super 9 tournaments at Indian Wells,
Calif., and Key Biscayne, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've struggled a little bit at Palm Springs over the past
couple of years,'' he said in a conference call last week, adding,
``I've heard a lot of good things about the tournament in
Scottsdale. My brother is actually involved in it, so I have the
family guilt on me to play.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes conditions here will prep him for Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there is a little altitude there (Scottsdale),''
Sampras said. ``I've always struggled a little bit in those
conditions. When you have a field like that, it's really a true
test to see where I'm at.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras caused a stir in the tennis world in January when he
passed up the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam event of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Before the San Jose ATP tournament in early February, where
Sampras had to withdraw after injuring his leg, he said that he
needed to rest after a grueling season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to give myself a good off-season this year,'' he said
at that time during a conference call, ``and obviously we have some
tournaments that are coming up _ San Jose, Scottsdale. Then you
have Indian Wells, Lipton (in Florida), which are big tournaments,
and those are events that I'll have to play. But I would have loved
to have gone down to Australia. I just wished it started in
February.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sampras rested and played golf, namely at the
celebrity-filled Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. And even though he
didn't play in Australia, he retained the No. 1 ranking when No. 2
Yevgeny Kafelnikov lost a quarterfinal match Friday in the Guardian
Direct indoor tournament in London.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is only 11 weeks away from Ivan Lendl's career record of
270 weeks at No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said last week, the leg is completely healed.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was asked if he still intimidates other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a question you have to ask the other players, if they
enjoy playing me,'' Sampras said. ``If anything, I think players
know this year that I'm ready, that I'm fresh and mentally ready to
go. Parts of last year I felt a little worn out and not really
enjoying what I was doing. It showed in some bad results.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, this year I think guys know that I'm eager. When I'm
eager and fresh, I'm tough to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel like I'm going to get better. I feel like this
year is going to be a great year for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras said that even if he would have fallen from No. 1 after
the Australian Open, it would have been no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what you're ranked in February,'' Sampras
said. ``It matters what you're ranked in December.'' &QL;

JACKSON, LAKERS MAY GET TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are few nicer men in the NBA than former Lakers Coach  &UR; Del
 &UR; Harris, who got the ax last week after 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   But it came as little surprise. In fact, many expected the move
to come after the Lakers lost an overtime game to Denver. Several
NBA scouts working that game noticed that the Lakers bench was
lifeless, even when LA made a big rally that forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sign that the Lakers had quit responding to Harris, but
owner  &UR; Jerry Buss and General Manager  &UR; Jerry West gave Harris
another game. When the Lakers lost to Vancouver, there was little
doubt about what would happen next.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you can do in LA is win, that's it,'' Miami
Coach
 &UR; Pat Riley told reporters covering the Heat. Riley spent nine years
as Lakers coach, played there and worked as an analyst on club
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Already, speculation has begun about former Chicago Coach  &UR; Phil
 &UR; Jackson taking over.  &UR; Kurt Rambis has the job on an interim basis.
His performance will be evaluated at season's end. There is little
doubt that Jackson will be interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers have not contacted us at this point, Jackson's
agent,
 &UR; Todd Musburger, told the ``Chicago Sun-Times'' last week. ``We
cannot rule out (his coaching) this season. But we should not read
too much into that because we are in hypothetical land, and Phil is
quite happy working the speaking tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Musburger pointed out that he included ``cancellation
provisions'' in contracts that Jackson has for speaking
engagements. But with Rambis in place, those won't be necessary
unless Jackson goes to another team later this season.
</P>
<P>
   It makes plenty of sense. Jackson knows how to deal with  &UR; Dennis
 &UR; Rodman, assuming Rodman returns next season. He has shown he can
handle a superstar such as  &UR; Shaquille O'Neal, coaching the  &UR; Michael
 &UR; Jordan-led Bulls to six championships.
</P>
<P>
   But there also has been speculation that Jackson, who has a home
in Montana, might prefer a more laid-back atmosphere and wind up in
Denver, where the Nuggets have given Coach  &UR; Mike D'Antoni only a
one-year commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it will be Jackson's call. Apparently, there is no
lack of opportunity for the Zen Master. Musburger said a half-dozen
NBA teams already have inquired about his availability. &QL; 
Say what? &QL; 
Orlando Coach  &UR; Chuck Daly recently told reporters who cover the
Magic that he finds the Sacramento Kings to be a team capable of
capturing the imagination of fans during a season in which scoring
is at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have easily, I think, the most entertaining team in
basketball,'' Daly said. ``They run the ball. They've got post-up
people. They are not a team that you particularly like to play very
often. I think NBC and TNT are missing out on something very
entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   We couldn't agree more, especially with the flair that rookie
 &UR; Jason
 &UR; Williams brings to the game. But isn't this the same Chuck Daly who
brought us the Bad Boy Detroit Pistons, who started the whole
bump-and-grind routine that has stifled scoring? &QL; 
Not so fast &QL; 
Reports that clauses in  &UR; Jason Kidd's contract could allow him to
become a free agent at the end of next season may not be complete,
says a source familiar with Phoenix guard's contract.
</P>
<P>
   While language in the contract relates to what are known as
early termination options _ in Kidd's case, based on criteria tied
to individual statistics and the number of team victories _ a
stipulation in the contract supersedes those clauses, the source
said. It apparently is not as simple as meeting incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager  &UR; Bryan Colangelo would not comment on the
contract or the reports, other than to say, ``Whatever the
circumstances are regarding Jason's contract, we anticipate him
being a part of this team for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd is signed through the 2002-2003 season. If he became a free
agent at the end of next season with six years in the NBA, Kidd
would be eligible to receive a new seven-year deal from Phoenix
that would start at 25 percent of the salary cap, but not less than
$9 million for the first season of the new pact. &QL; 
Trivia &QL; 
Brothers  &UR; Dominique and  &UR; Gerald Wilkins are playing together for
the first time in their careers this season in Orlando. Who were
the first brothers to play together on an NBA team? &QL; 
Hard hat area &QL; 
Seattle's  &UR; Vin Baker, a career 63.4 percent free throw shooter in
the NBA, had made only four of his 33 attempts from the line
through Thursday's games, or 12.1 percent. He's on a strong pace to
supplant &UR; Chris Dudley's 31.9 percent free throw shooting in 1989-90
as the worst on record. &QL; 
On second thought &QL; 
Philadelphia Coach  &UR; Larry Brown was asked in a recent television
interview whether he believes his 76ers are a playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Brown answered.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted a number of telephone calls, including one from
club President  &UR; Pat Croce.
</P>
<P>
   ``When asked, I meant the playoffs shouldn't be a given,'' Brown
said. ``I don't say that (they can't make it) in the locker room. I
tell them, if we're playing, we might as well try and win the
championship. I told Pat there's no one in our locker room who
doesn't think I think we can make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Trivia answer &QL; 
If you guessed  &UR; Dick and  &UR; Tom Van Arsdale of the Suns, try again.
The Van Arsdales were teammates in 1976-77 for the Suns. But  &UR; Dick
and  &UR; Al &UR; McGuire were New York Knicks teammates from 1951-54. &QL;

2-REFEREE SYS TEM WORKS LIKE CHARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Coyotes captain  &UR; Keith Tkachuk had a message he
wanted to deliver to NHL Commissioner  &UR; Gary Bettman the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see him,'' Tkachuk said, ``tell him we not only want
the two-referee system in the playoffs, we want it from ``now''
until the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. Bettman said he understands the sentiment but the simple
truth is there aren't enough qualified referees to make it work for
the full slate of remaining regular-season games. The end of
February officially triggers the end of the two-referee system
phase-in period, as promised.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman said it wouldn't be fair to continue the practice in
only selected games down the stretch. And he's right. It could be
construed as some teams having a competitive edge. Besides, the NHL
couldn't be sure the system would be embraced as well as it has, so
it was agreed that each team would get an equal 20 games to test
it.
</P>
<P>
   It's been such an overwhelming success, Bettman suggested it's
virtually a lock that two refs will work each playoff game this
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general managers overwhelmingly endorsed it, which means
it's on track from their standpoint,'' Bettman said. ``But I told
the owners I would take their pulse after the last game in
February, and I intend to do that. I would be surprised (if they
rejected it), but don't want to second-guess or position the
owners, so I want to hear what they have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect the two-ref system to be given the green light within two
weeks. And within the next couple years, expect it to be a daily
part of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Other items of interest Bettman addressed:
</P>
<P>
   The future of overtime games. The American Hockey League, at the
NHL's beckoning, has been experimenting with skaters going
four-on-four during the entire extra period. In the first 27 games
the system was used, only four went to overtime but three of them
were decided in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   There is some talk the NHL might adopt an AHL-like policy of
awarding one point to each team when a score is tied at the end of
regulation regardless of a loss or tie. Two points would be awarded
for an overtime win.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no trap and no left wing lock when you're playing
four-on-four and if you're playing in the context where you've
already got your point . . . we're going to look at that,'' Bettman
said. ``Whether or not it's for next year, it's too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential labor strife. The collective bargaining agreement
doesn't expire until 2004, but both sides have agreed the next
round of talks very well could lead to a major work stoppage. The
Players Association already has compiled a war chest in the event
of a strike or a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the speculation and it's unfortunate because we are in
a period of prolonged labor peace and nobody knows what the world
will look like by then,'' Bettman said. ``The first two years of
the CBA, revenues were growing faster than salaries. The last two
years, salaries are growing faster than revenues. There's an ebb
and a flow. If we keep ebbing, 2004 may be difficult from our
standpoint. If we flow, it may be difficult for the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll deal with that in three or four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic participation. A decision probably will have to be made
within the next two months, possibly longer if the World
International Hockey Federation agrees it can wait. The NHL wants
guaranteed prime-time exposure on NBC, something the network can't
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going, it's got to make sense,'' Bettman said.
``There's a possibility it will make sense, but we're not done
yet.'' &QL; 
Gretzky's condition
</P>
<P>
   It took a New York minute for the conspiracy theorists in the
Big Apple to put two and two together and speculate that  &UR; Wayne
Gretzky's neck injury is a definite prelude to his retiring after
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it, although Gretzky still could surprise nearly
everyone and walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' Gretzky said, when the inevitable question came
up that the injury could lead to retirement, especially given his
age. ``I'm a young 38. If we would have known in January what the
problem was, I probably only would have missed two or three weeks
to rectify the problem and we wouldn't even be talking about it
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who had appeared in 223 consecutive games and was
leading the Rangers in scoring with 57 points in 58 games, is
suffering from a disc protrusion between vertebrae in his neck. The
protrusion, revealed in a magnetic resonance imaging test taken
Thursday, is causing stiffness and numbness in his neck and the
right side of his shoulder, back and arm.
</P>
<P>
   It will not require surgery, but Gretzky will be sidelined at
least two weeks and possibly longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to rest and then get ready to play hockey again,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton Oilers General Manager  &UR; Glen Sather wasn't so sure
after Gretzky presented his former boss with an autographed stick a
few days earlier, thanking Sather for his support during their days
together in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking later, `Is this Wayne's way of saying he's
quitting?' '' Sather said. &QL; 
Chicago fallout
</P>
<P>
   After canning first-year Coach  &UR; Dirk Graham last Monday,
Blackhawks GM
 &UR; Bob Murray said the former Chicago captain's kick-in-the-pants
style wasn't working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he took a lot of  &UR; Mike Keenan's qualities and thought
he could separate one from the other,'' Murray said, referring to
the ex-Chicago coach currently out of work after getting dumped in
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant  &UR; Lorne Molleken has replaced Graham behind the bench,
but it is widely rumored that fellow assistant  &UR; Denis Savard will
eventually take over next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, they'll respond to a fresh direction and a fresh
attitude. I hope those guys play for Lorne, I really do,'' Graham
said. &QL; 
Seeing is believing
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Stars defenseman  &UR; Richard Matvichuk had his eyes examined
the other day after teammates  &UR; Derian Hatcher and  &UR; Shawn Chambers
noticed he was squinting. Turns out Matvichuk needed glasses. He's
in the process of getting fitted with contacts.

CARDS' INERTIA MAY BE CAMPAIGN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way the Cardinals are doing business, they must have
forgotten that they have a stadium vote in May.
</P>
<P>
   It's naive to think whether they re-sign outside linebacker
 &UR; Jamir
 &UR; Miller, offensive tackle  &UR; Lomas Brown and free safety  &UR; Kwamie
Lassiter will determine the outcome of the May 18 election on the
Rio Solado Crossing, but it could sway some voters.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this was supposed to the warm and fuzzy off-season,
the one in which Cardinals players who experienced the team's first
playoff victory in 51 years lined up to re-enlist and free agents
from other teams dashed to the Valley to play for an up-and-coming
team.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cardinals are in danger of having the off-season
become a disaster, and of having the organization take huge public
relations hits.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who thanked the Cardinals for not placing the dreaded
franchise tag on him and allowing him to test free agency, is
frustrated that the team hasn't made him a contract offer.
</P>
<P>
   It's really very simple. The Cardinals aren't going to make him
an offer until they know what it will cost to sign him.
Translation: They want him back as cheaply as possible.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way proactive teams such as the Denver Broncos,
who have won back-to-back Super Bowl titles, do business. They
entered free agency with all but one of their starters under
contract and then targeted one free agent, Kansas City cornerback
 &UR; Dale Carter, and went out and signed him.
</P>
<P>
   Doing business Cardinals Vice President  &UR; Bill Bidwill Jr.'s way
is risky. Miller could go out and get a deal elsewhere and then not
give the Cardinals a chance to match it.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the Cardinals wouldn't have been in this fix with
Miller had they torn up the final year of his contract, as he
wanted last spring, and extended the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Brown, who appears to be leaning toward joining the
Browns, is more curious.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the Cardinals seemed to have him all but wrapped up;
he even said so. Then the money-rich Browns, tired of haggling with
free agent offensive tackle  &UR; Blake Brockermeyer of Carolina,
started getting serious about going after Brown, even though it is
odd for an expansion team to want a player who will be 36 next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Cardinals saw that the Browns, who have been snatching
up free agents throughout the league, were becoming serious about
Brown, why didn't they get the deal done before he visited
Cleveland? Aggressive organizations would have done that.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter, who has felt underpaid his entire career, received a
three-year offer from the Cardinals at the start of free agency. He
didn't think the money was enough, so he started looking around and
visited San Diego last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals think their offer is fair. He thinks he can get
more, which often is the case.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Cardinals get some of these players signed soon, the
momentum they gained from last year's winning season will be lost.
It's already in peril.
</P>
<P>
   The public also is getting annoyed. Signing a couple of their
big three remaining free agents would pacify fans.
</P>
<P>
   If they get much angrier, Cardinals Vice President  &UR; Michael
Bidwill, who has spearheaded the stadium drive, will have to
explain how big brother Bill Jr., who is in charge of the purse
strings, let things go awry.
</P>
<P>
   Their dad, team owner  &UR; Bill Bidwill, then could pay the ultimate
price at the ballot box. &QL; 
Reliving history &QL; 
Ten years ago, an event that some Dallas Cowboys fans consider the
darkest in franchise history occurred when owner  &UR; Jerry Jones fired
Coach  &UR; Tom Landry in what became known as the ``Saturday Night
Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   What infuriated fans was a ``Dallas Morning News'' photo of
Jones dining with Landry's replacement,  &UR; Jimmy Johnson, at Landry's
favorite Mexican restaurant while the only coach in team history
didn't know he was about to be dumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, it looked bad,'' Johnson said of the photo on the
front page. ``We were staying at a hotel, and Jerry came by the
room and said he wanted to take me to a little out-of-the-way
place. I told him I didn't think it was a good idea. It was Friday
night. Every place would be packed. But he was positive no one
would recognize me.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys owner  &UR; Bum Bright wanted to be the one who
informed Landry he was out, but Jones insisted that he tell Landry
face to face.
</P>
<P>
   Landry was at his home in Austin playing golf. So Jones went to
Austin, interrupted Landry's golf game and told him the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't going to be easy,'' Johnson said. ``I felt bad.
Coach Landry was an idol of mine growing up in Texas. . . . But
Jerry stood right up to it. He would not let Bum do the firing. He
would not let
 &UR; Tex ( &UR; Schramm, then general manager) inform Tom with a phone call.
He would not phone Tom himself. Jerry said the deal couldn't get
done until he told Tom face to face. And Tom had gone to Austin to
play golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry then put everything on hold, got on a plane, flew to
Austin and found Tom on the golf course. Contrary to popular
opinion, Jerry was not a close friend of mine, and I hadn't been
around him much. But after seeing that, I walked out that afternoon
really impressed. . . . On this part, I strongly defend Jerry.'' &QL; 
Family feud? &QL; 
 &UR; Denise DeBartolo York made sure last week that everyone in the San
Francisco 49ers organization knew she was in charge, not her
brother,
 &UR; Eddie DeBartolo, who remains in limbo since voluntarily stepping
down in December 1997 because of his involvement in a federal
gambling probe in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   She sent out a memo to team employees that said her brother can
have little to do with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie and his representatives have been directed to
communicate in writing exclusively through (team official)  &UR; John
McVay, with copies to me when he requests information from the
team,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's requests for reimbursement of expenses, further
advancement of team funds or use of team assets must be directed to
me for approval before payment or use.'' &QL;

COYOTES' FEARLESS WING PUTS SOUL ON ICE  
 DRAKE'S CHECKS MAKE FOES BOUNCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Every year at Christmastime, Coyotes captain Keith
Tkachuk dreams up another crazy gift idea for his closest friend on
the team and roommate on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk never divulges what he buys, but he's been known to drop
some serious cash when it comes to good buddy Dallas Drake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, he'll get Dally a new dental plan next year,'' one
Coyotes player joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' said another. ``What Dallas Drake needs is a good
accidental death and dismemberment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a hockey player in the NHL who tries to jeopardize
his career every single night on the ice, it's Dallas Drake, the
Coyotes' wiry and wacky 6-foot-1, 185-pound right wing from Trail,
British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   His full-length picture should be in every doctor's office in
North America for preventive medicine or future case studies. Just
draw a line and point it to each of the body parts he has mangled
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, just take this season alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, let's see. I had a concussion, but I only missed two
games,'' Drake said. ``Then I had the leg problem, a fracture I
didn't know was even there. But I only missed one game because of
that. Then I tore up my elbow, but that only cost me one game, too.
And then this shoulder separation thing came along. But that's
pretty much par for the course for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Drake forgot a few other maladies along the way. There
were the split tongue and damaged teeth from a puck in the face.
There was the broken toe. A butt end of the stick caught him in the
eye. Twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but it's not just me,'' said Drake, who has eight goals,
21 points and is a plus-13. ``Everybody gets that stuff. Those are
just the bumps and bruises that everybody in our locker room has to
go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake, who is becoming widely regarded, pound-for-pound, as one
of the toughest and hardest-hitting players in the game, returned
to the Coyotes' lineup Friday after missing 13 games with the bum
shoulder. He will be back on the ice again at 10 a.m. today, when
Phoenix will meet the New Jersey Devils in an effort to avoid
losing for the seventh time in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad he's back,'' Tkachuk said. ``I really think we've
missed a lot without him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it doesn't take long for Drake to bounce back. He's
like Gumby. You can pull him and stretch him and tie him into a
pretzel, but he snaps back into form.
</P>
<P>
   His body makeup isn't any different from anyone else's, Coyotes
head trainer Gord Hart said, but ``his desire level is extremely
high.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him for quite a few years now,'' Hart said, ``and I
have so much respect for his ability to play like that day in and
day out. Every time he steps on the ice, he doesn't hold back
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the point, KGME-AM (1360) radio held a contest last
week in which listeners were asked to vote for various Arizona
athletes and sports personalities in different categories. Drake
was the only double winner in the annual ``First'ies Awards,''
winning both the Most Underrated and Most Underappreciated titles.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent trip to Buffalo, Drake was called ``the
prototype hockey player'' by Sabres Coach Lindy Ruff. When asked
which Phoenix player he felt his team had to try to take out of the
equation for that night's game, Ruff didn't mention Tkachuk, Jeremy
Roenick or Rick Tocchet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drake's the guy you've got to really be careful with,'' he
said. ``He can do a lot of different things. He'll go in the
corners and battle for the puck. He'll go to the front of the net.
He'll bang along the boards. And he'll throw some pretty mean
checks. And it doesn't matter how big you are, either. If he sees
you, he'll drill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Philadelphia Flyers giant Eric Lindros, who dwarfs Drake in
stature and build like Paul Bunyan would Pee Wee Herman. Drake has
given Lindros more than a few bone-rattling jars over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I definitely know who he is,'' Lindros said during an
interview before the All-Star Game earlier this month in Tampa. ``I
remember one game, I think, where he knocked me down at least three
times. He's a pretty good hockey player. Tough as nails.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Los Angeles Coach Larry Robinson has something nice to say
about Drake, who nearly took off Doug Bodger's head during a
monster check into the boards on the Kings' defenseman back in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he's got great grit,'' Robinson said. ``He's not a big
man, but he comes to play every night, and that's all you want from
a hockey player. You can ask a lot of a hockey player every night.
Having great hands or being a great scorer, those are things that
usually are God-given. But the one thing that I feel all players
are capable of giving is an honest effort every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong. I still think that hit by Drake (on
Bodger) was a dirty hit. But he brings it every night. He gives you
that effort every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake is unique, a walking contradiction of sorts. But he said
he is no different from any other hockey player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give credit to all hockey players,'' he said. ``I have never
met a guy who doesn't want to play or won't play through injuries.
Everybody I've played with or played against, if they can get on
the ice and contribute, they will. It doesn't matter how you feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us are just blue-collar guys, guys who grew up in
small cities and never probably felt they'd play in the NHL. They
don't want to screw it up, so they'll do whatever it takes to play,
whether they have to play through a broken leg or a broken foot or
whatever.'' &QL;

NAU LOSES HOME EDGE FOR BIG SKY TOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JARED PAGE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OGDEN, Utah _ Northern Arizona's bid for a third consecutive Big
Sky Conference regular-season title hit a roadblock Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   NAU, one of the top shooting teams in Division I, hit just 37.5
percent of its shots in the second half and dropped a 77-57
decision to Weber State in front of 9,148 fans at the Dee Events
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Weber State (22-7, 13-3 Big Sky) wins the Big Sky's
regular-season title and the right to host the conference's
six-team postseason tournament, which begins Thursday. NAU (20-7,
12-4) will enter the event as the No. 2 seed and play the highest
remaining seed from the quarterfinal round at 7 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing,'' NAU Coach Ben Howland said. ``It's
a tough loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks, who led by three points at halftime (31-28),
struggled with the Wildcats' pressure defense and were outscored,
49-26, in the final 20 minutes of play. Thirteen of NAU's 21
turnovers were committed in the second half. Weber State also
outrebounded NAU, 30-23.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to win when you have 21 turnovers and you got
outrebounded by seven,'' Howland said. ``That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Land led the Lumberjacks with 16 points on 6-of-10
shooting, and Michael McNair added 11 before fouling out with 6:45
to play in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona, the Big Sky's regular-season champion the past
two seasons, shot 63.6 percent (14 of 22) and led by as many as
seven points in the opening half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were picking us apart,'' Weber State Coach Ron Abegglen
said.
</P>
<P>
   WSU forward Harold Arceneaux hit a three-pointer to give the
Wildcats a 42-40 lead and they gradually extended that advantage to
20 before the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Arceneaux, a favorite to win the Big Sky's Player of the Year
award, led Weber State with 18 points, nine rebounds and two
blocks.

STANFORD SUCCEEDS UA AS CHAMPION OF PAC-10 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ You walk into Stanford's Maples Pavilion, in
the middle of one of America's really smart people's universities,
and you just feel your IQ surge 15 points or so.
</P>
<P>
   Which could only help Arizona, given its performance Thursday at
California.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wildcats on Saturday needed more help than that. They
picked up where they left off, suffering defensive lapses, making
numerous fouls against a team with the Pac-10's two top free throw
shooters, shooting poorly and quickly falling behind sixth-ranked
Stanford by 20 points en route to a 98-83 blowout loss. Stanford
guard Arthur Lee scored a career-high 29 points.
</P>
<P>
   With it, defending champion Arizona surrendered the Pac-10
title. The Wildcats had not lost two in a row since dropping the
final two of the regular season in 1997, also on this trip, before
recovering to win the NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus for the past several games has been just playing
each game and trying to get better,'' UA Coach Lute Olson said.
``If you lose, you lose. What is important is do you get better as
a result of that? We're just trying to be better each game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside, there has been a lot of talk of our possibly winning
or tying for the conference championship. That's been more a case
of other people's attention rather than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Passing the crown was one of the few plays the seventh-ranked
Wildcats (20-6, 11-5) completed all evening. After both of its
power forwards, Michael Wright and Eugene Edgerson, had two fouls
each and had sat down by midway through the first half, the
sixth-ranked Cardinal (24-5, 14-2), which won its first conference
title since 1963, had little trouble controlling play inside.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford also had little trouble controlling Arizona point guard
Jason Terry, who on this trip suddenly looked mortal. Coming into
this trip as the Pac-10 Player of the Week, Terry didn't look
himelf in either game. Olson gives Terry time off in practice
because Terry plays nearly every minute of every game. But the
question lingers whether Terry is beginning to feel the fatigue of
a season of long minutes, in which he has been asked repeatedly to
put a young team on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats had suffered a collective brain malfunction at Cal,
sleepwalking through an 89-76 pounding _ its largest setback of the
season before this _ after allowing the Bears to shoot 51.6
percent, only the second game in which a UA foe has shot better
than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In this one, the Wildcats were thwarted by the league's
stingiest defense. Stanford has climbed to the top of the Pac-10 by
limiting foes to 37.8 percent shooting and 59.4 points per game.
Although the Wildcats were above those numbers, Stanford made its
point.
</P>
<P>
   With UA unable to score, the Cardinal was scoring in threes with
long-range shooting and pulled away in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona players were visibly frustrated, but they weren't
the only ones who blew their cool. With 7:22 to go in the opening
half, Olson was assessed a technical foul by official Mark Ayotte
after grumbling about the lack of calls inside. Olson then began to
charge onto the court before he was restrained by associate coach
Jim Rosborough, or Olson likely would have been given another and
ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Olson came into the game anticipating that Stanford would be
allowed to hammer away after watching the tape of its overtime win
Thursday over Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that staying out of foul trouble was huge for us,''
Olson said before the game. ``I watched the Stanford-ASU tape. How
many free throws did Stanford shoot, 39 to 10, was it? I have a
hard time figuring that out. I thought ASU was the aggressor taking
the ball to the basket. ASU was much more physical and aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing you've got to figure out is how in the world do you
keep them off the line?''
</P>
<P>
   Those proved to be prophetic words.
</P>

LOSS RESEMBLES OTHERS FOR ASU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Had anyone been beamed down from somewhere or awakened
from a long nap, having missed the entire Arizona State basketball
season to date, Saturday's game against California would have been
enough to get caught up.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils led early. They led late. They did a lot of
things well. They lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of how it's been all season,'' guard Eddie House
said after the Golden Bears beat ASU, 78-73, at the New Arena. ``It
comes down to a few plays, a few fouls, a few things going the
other team's way, and us coming up on the short end of the stick.''
</P>
<P>
   House played 39 minutes and scored 26 points. For only the fifth
time, the Sun Devils made at least half their shots. They
outrebound Cal by one. And the defense?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to work awfully hard against their defense,'' Cal
Coach Ben Braun said.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? How did ASU (14-14, 7-10 Pac-10) lose for the
fifth time in six games, putting even their NIT hopes in jeopardy
while keeping Cal's NCAA Tournament dreams alive?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a hint: The Sun Devils had 27 turnovers, the most in more
than two years. Senior forward Mike Batiste had nine all by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   House scored only two points in the final 10 minutes, a harmless
basket with 1.2 seconds left. Senior forward Bobby Lazor, who forms
with House and Batiste the highest-scoring threesome in the Pac-10,
was held to 10 points. Cal defender Sean Lampley had something to
do with that.
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas Kilgore, a senior guard for this maddeningly
inconsistent Cal team (16-10, 7-9) that belongs on the same
psychiatrist's couch as the Sun Devils, scored 12 straight points
for his team while the Bears were erasing an eight-point ASU lead
with 5:07 left.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the usual dose of weird stuff that has
characterized the ASU program for the better part of a decade.
</P>
<P>
   With 25.8 seconds left, Alton Mason drove to the basket, scored
and got fouled to bring the Sun Devils to within 70-68. Then he
missed the free throw.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Boyd, a muscular, 6-foot-5 junior forward, rebounded for
the Bears and was fouled by Jason Patton. After the call, Boyd
swung an elbow, clipping Batiste in the chest. Angered, Batiste
took a half-hearted swipe. Boyd did the same, and both squared off
in a boxing pose straight from the Marquis of Queensbury rules.
</P>
<P>
   As teammates grabbed Boyd and Batiste, official Jerry White
called a double flagrant technical foul and ejected both players.
That was a good trade for Cal. Boyd is a reserve and Batiste starts
and is ASU's No. 3 scorer.
</P>
<P>
   With Boyd gone, Braun summoned Ryan Forehan-Kelly from the bench
to shoot the free throws. Braun's first choice was Dennis Gates,
but he had a jammed finger. Forehan-Kelly is a walk-on freshman who
had played 18 minutes all season, had scored the grand total of
nine points and is not mentioned in the media guide.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, he made both foul shots. Cal led by four.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse for the Sun Devils, according to a new rule approved
by coaches, Cal got to keep the basketball because it last had
possession. Under the old rule, ASU would have gotten the ball.
With 21.4 seconds left, Geno Carlisle made two more free throws,
and the Bears led by six to sew it up.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the play warranted the ejection of both players,
ASU Coach Rob Evans said, ``I don't think so.'' He also said he
never heard of the rule change, and when told that a Pac-10
observer said the coaches approved the rule, said, ``All Pac-10
officials and all observers, you know, they all cover each other.
They're all going to say it's the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not familiar with that rule. I didn't vote for it, and I'm
at every meeting that goes on. I didn't vote on it at all.'' &QL;

BROOKS NOT HURTING ANY BODY; IN FACT, HE'S HELPING PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Three words for those who think  &UR; Garth Brooks'
presence at San Diego's spring training is bad for the game: Get
over it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Steve Howe and  &UR; Rupert Murdoch have done more damage to
baseball's credibility than Brooks ever will. He's not taking a
roster spot. He's raising money for charity, and he's living proof
that a well-paid celebrity ($54 million in 1998) still can connect
with fans. Brooks typically spends two hours after workouts signing
autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awfully polite,'' Manager  &UR; Bruce Bochy said.
</P>
<P>
   At-bat we hope to see: National League Rookie of the Year,
Chicago Cubs pitcher  &UR; Kerry Wood, vs. American League Rookie of the
Year, Oakland Athletics outfielder  &UR; Ben Grieve. The teams meet on
March 15 in Mesa and March 28 and April 1 in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Best bullpen in the Cactus League? Here's a vote for the San
Francisco Giants, who had the No. 1 bullpen ERA in the NL last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason is the overpowering  &UR; Robb Nen, who had a 1.52
ERA, 110 strikeouts and 25 walks. Even with  &UR; Jose Mesa gone, San
Francisco returns  &UR; John Johnstone (3.07),  &UR; Julian Tavarez (5-3,
3.80) and  &UR; Rich
 &UR; Rodriguez (4-0, 3.70) and adds  &UR; Alan Embree.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe spending $105 million for one player is a little
over the top, but the Los Angeles Dodgers' decision to give green
to Brown only magnifies what the Cubs didn't do in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   What was lost in the aftermath of their first playoff appearance
since 1989 was that they still finished 12{ games back in the NL
Central. Their biggest off-season move was the $2 million signing
of free agent catcher  &UR; Benito Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice for the game if a team didn't have to buy its
victories, but it probably also would be unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Position battle of the week:  &UR; Troy Glaus vs.  &UR; Dave
 &UR; Hollins for the third base job in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, 22, a highly regarded rookie, was impressive defensively
when he replaced Hollins in late July, but his struggles at the
plate led many to believe he was called up too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins, 32, who underwent shoulder surgery last summer, wants
the job, but Glaus is expected to put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Giants first baseman  &UR; J.T. Snow has said goodbye to his
switch-hitting career and will commit to being a left-handed
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. In 1998, he batted .265 against right-handed
pitchers, .164 vs. lefties. From 1995-97, it was .298 vs. .219. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Granted, $80 million will do that to you, but you have to like
 &UR; Mo Vaughn's attitude with his new team, the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn showed up a week ahead of other position players to get
acquainted and was overheard telling his teammates, ``The hard work
starts now.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres closer  &UR; Trevor Hoffman has set the end of spring training
as a deadline for signing a contract extension. San Diego would be
nuts not to accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, who converted 53 of 54 save opportunities last season,
is believed to be seeking a four-year, $30 million extension with a
no-trade clause. The Padres' last offer was for four years and $24
million.
</P>
<P>
   Milestone worth watching in 1999: San Diego outfielder
 &UR; Tony Gwynn is expected to reach 3,000 hits, probably in June.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay third baseman  &UR; Wade Boggs and Baltimore third baseman
 &UR; Cal
 &UR; Ripken also are expected to get there this season.
</P>
<P>
   From the here we go again department, Milwaukee appears to be
heading into another season without a true No. 1 starter.
</P>
<P>
   New pitching coach  &UR; Bill Campbell has his work cut out for him.
Last season, the Brewers set a major league record for fewest
complete games in a season _ two _ and recorded only two shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   No Milwaukee pitcher has won more than 13 games since  &UR; Cal
Eldred posted 16 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Cactus League players to report lighter was Milwaukee
pitcher  &UR; Steve Woodward, who dropped 30 pounds from last season's
243. &QL;

<P>
   In a time when so many fans believe baseball is nothing like the
old days, the last week provided a striking reminder that this game
remains basically the same as it was during its glory years in the
1940s and '50.
</P>
<P>
   From the camps of Philadelphia and St. Louis to New York and
Toronto, the war of the words heated up big-time last week,
reminding old timers of the good old days when no one was spared a
nasty word or pot shot.
</P>
<P>
   First we had Phillies outfielder  &UR; Ron Gant attacking St. Louis's
 &UR; Tony
 &UR; La  &UR; Russa, all but calling the three-time manager of the year a
racist with unethical morals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can't control you, if you're not one of his yes-players,
he doesn't want you around,'' Gant said. ``That's just his
insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa fired back at Gant, saying, ``You can say I'm a stupid
manager. But unethical? Immoral? That's very strong stuff. That's
like lying, cheating and stealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Toronto assistant general manager  &UR; Dave Stewart,
firing off some verbal cannon shots aimed at old nemesis  &UR; Roger
Clemens. Stewart poked Clemens where it hurts him most, attacking
his 1-2 record in eight playoff starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A true ace is the pitcher who helps you win in the
postseason,'' Stewart said. ``In my opinion, Clemens hasn't proven
that he's a postseason pitcher yet. When you talk about the two,
Roger's been in the postseason, but has not really won in the
postseason.  &UR; David Wells (who was traded from the Yankees to
Toronto for Clemens) has been in the postseason and he's won. Let's
not make Wells look like a lesser guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was this beauty delivered by Wells during his
introductory press conference after the trade: ``For starters, I
would just like to tell MSG (the Madison Square Garden Network),
the ``Daily'' ``News'' and ``Bay News 9'' to go ``expletive''
themselves for coming out to my house the night of the trade when I
asked to be left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, don't forget the sniping going on between general managers
in San Diego and Los Angeles, where GM  &UR; Kevin Malone has already
predicted a Dodgers-Yankees World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Pure and simple, this is baseball at its best, not the
namby-pamby everyone loves everyone that's come to represent the
game in the past decade or two. Somewhere,  &UR; Don Drysdale, who hated
his opponents, is smiling. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who are the career leaders in steals of home in the American and
National Leagues? &QL; 
A subtle shot at The Unit &QL; 
This dispatch comes courtesy of the ``Seattle Times,'' which noted
that &UR; Edgar Martinez is in the final year of his contract, a similar
situation that sometimes paralyzed the Mariners last spring with
 &UR; Randy
 &UR; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was asked if he is going to be miserable because of the
uncertainty?
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean frown? Stomp around the clubhouse feeling bad?''
Martinez said. ``No . . . no, that's not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, 36, is wondering how much longer he will stay in the
game. Just in case this is his final go-around, he reported to camp
in the best shape he's been in for years, determined to make it
another solid season in an already distinguished career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this will be my last year,'' said Martinez,
who three times in the past four years has been named the
outstanding designated hitter. ``If the Mariners show interest,
I'll stay. If that doesn't work out, I don't know what I'm going to
do.'' &QL; 
No sympathy here &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week we showed you how seemingly out of touch Kansas City
outfielder  &UR; Johnny Damon was after losing his arbitration hearing
and taking $2.1 million instead of the $3.2 million he sought.
</P>
<P>
   This week's version on the same topic comes from Baltimore
catcher
 &UR; Charles Johnson, a very decent person who surprisingly had this to
say after losing his hearing and taking the club's $3.6 million
offer instead of the $5.1 million he sought:
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like my agent and his staff did a great job with the
case, and I thought I had a very good chance to win,'' Johnson
said. ``It was very disappointing to me that I won a Gold Glove,
hit 19 home runs and has almost 60 RBIs and only got a $300,000
raise. But that's the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Damon share one thing: Agent  &UR; Scott Boras. &QL; 
Dreaming of Havana &QL; 
Baltimore owner  &UR; Peter Angelos' attempt to have his Orioles become
the first major league club in 52 years to play a game in Cuba
against a team of All-Stars from that island appears all but dead.
</P>
<P>
   While the Orioles are somewhat disappointed with the prospects,
they now face stiff competition to play on the communist island
nation when, and if, negotiations heat up again.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels applied to the U.S. Treasury Dept., for the
necessary license to play any kind of game in Cuba. In addition,
Cuban officials have asked about the possibility of the New York
Yankees, long considered the favorite club of most Cubans, coming
to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Baltimore have the inside track? I don't know,'' major
league spokesman  &UR; Rich Levin said. ``That's impossible to answer
right now. Major League Baseball will certainly be involved and
will certainly have a say as to who goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba was home to the Havana Sugar Kings, a Triple-A affiliate of
the Cincinnati Reds, in the 1950s. &QL; 
Atlanta misfortunes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves, who once again figure to be among the elite
in the National League, are off to a terrible start in spring
training. Consider some of the calamities that have stricken the
Braves camp so far:
</P>
<P>
   The first week of workouts featured the revelation that first
baseman
 &UR; Andres Galarraga has been diagnosed with lymphoma in his back;
third baseman  &UR; Chipper Jones has seen his marriage go down in
flames; outfielders  &UR; Brian Jordan and  &UR; Gerald Williams each had to
leave camp for undisclosed family emergencies and catcher  &UR; Eddie
Perez suffered a ruptured testicle on a foul ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a whole lot to be excited about,'' pitcher  &UR; John
Smoltz said. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ty Cobb's 50 steals of home plate are the most in AL history,
while
 &UR; Max Carey's 33 is the NL record. The player with the most steals of
home plate whose career began after 1950 is current Anaheim hitting
coach  &UR; Rod Carew, with 17. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Just one of the guys, eh?: New Cincinnati outfielder  &UR; Greg
 &UR; Vaughn arrived at the Reds' Sarasota complex last week in a white
stretch limousine. His first words: ``I just want to be one of the
guys, be a small part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; He may not be able to hit a curveball, but his head
 &UR; is in the right place: Country singer  &UR; Garth Brooks, in San Diego's
camp on a lark, spent four hours signing autographs after a Padres
workday last week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Tom Tresh.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wonder whether his horse, Champion, will be featured
 &UR; also?: Anaheim players will wear a patch during the 1999 season
honoring the late  &UR; Gene Autry, Angels owner for the club's first 37
years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hurry up: Today is the last day to sign up for local Nike
baseball camps that will feature Seattle's  &UR; Alex Rodriguez and
 &UR; Mark Grace of the Cubs next weekend. Application forms are
available at all Sports Authority stores in the Valley. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Baltimore Manager  &UR; Ray Miller is contemplating hitting
slugger &UR; Albert Belle third instead his customary cleanup spot.
Belle, who leads the majors in home runs, doubles, RBIs, total
bases and extra-base hits since becoming an everyday player in
1991, has taken all but 29 at-bats in the fourth spot of a lineup
in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's  &UR; Alex Fernandez, last seen in a major league game
during the 1997 playoffs, threw from the mound last week and
reported no pain in his surgically repaired rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Orel Hershiser's contract with Cleveland allows him to leave
free and clear on or after March 21 if another club is offering him
a spot on a 25-man roster. Only an injury to an Indians starter
( &UR; Charles Nagy, Jaret Wright, Bartolo Colon, Dave Burba and
 &UR; Dwight Gooden) would seem to prevent Hershiser from bolting.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs instituted a lottery system for single-game
tickets, which came under fire, but the results have brought in a
record number of sales. The Cubs sold 300,000 tickets, which far
exceeded the number sold in 1985 and 1990, seasons following their
most recent trips to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Rockies equipment manager  &UR; Dan McGinn will not issue
uniform Nos. 25, 14 or 18 anytime this season.  &UR; Don Baylor and
 &UR; Bruce Ruffin, the only Rockies to have been with the club through
their first six seasons, wore 25 and 18, respectively. No. 14
belonged to  &UR; Andres Galarraga, recently diagnosed with lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals, a shell of their former selves, have a
record 68 players in camp. Even the expansion 1969 Royals had fewer
at 62. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
The Diamondbacks have been on the sending and receiving end of
recently proposed deals that seem nearly impossible to come true.
The D-Backs asked Philadelphia whether it would consider sending
talented outfielder  &UR; Bobby Abreau this way for  &UR; Brian Anderson.
Then the D-Backs got a call from Texas, asking about  &UR; Omar Daal.
It's doubtful either one will happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees plan to take a long look at  &UR; Ricky Ledee in center
field this spring. If the World Series hero looks like he can
handle the chore as  &UR; Bernie Williams' backup, look for New York to
try to deal  &UR; Chad Curtis and his $2 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati shortstop  &UR; Barry Larkin, who over the winter made
strong overtures about wanting to be traded, has reversed his
thinking and now says he is going nowhere. ``It is no longer even
an issue,'' he said. ``I'm here and I'm staying. And I'm excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto is seeking an outfielder and may be able to work
something out with San Francisco, who has an extra one in  &UR; Stan
 &UR; Javier, who hit .290 with 21 stolen bases in 26 chances last year.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides strongly deny that anything is being bandied about,
but rumors persist that Atlanta is talking to the Giants about the
availability of All-Star left fielder  &UR; Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Club doctors now fear that San Diego second baseman
 &UR; Quilvio Veras, rehabilitating after shoulder surgery, may not be
ready to return before mid- to late May. That leaves open the job
for rookie
 &UR; Damian Jackson. &QL;

BIG RUNS FOR AMATO, MCCLENATHAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHANDLER, ARIZ. - That was close.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Joe Amato and  &UR; Cory McClenathan, each sleepy-eyed after nights
of tossing and turning, finally qualified for today's Checker
Schuck's Kragen Nationals at Firebird International Raceway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Amato made it into the 16-car field with a nifty third-round
pass, then moved to the top of the list on his final run with a
4.545-second blast at a career-best speed of 325.30 mph, both track
records.
</P>
<P>
   McClenathan made it with a 4.635-second pass, good for No. 8 on
the ladder. At least McClenathan made it.
</P>
<P>
   Through three rounds, McClenathan barely could peddle it down
the quarter-mile dragstrip, jeopardizing an eight-year streak of
136 consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't make it, I can't even go get hammered because I
don't drink,'' a visibly nervous McClenathan said before the run.
</P>
<P>
   And now that McClenathan safely is in the field?
</P>
<P>
   ``I got one (good run) underneath the belt, so watch out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out for Amato, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Friday night) was pretty sleepless,'' said Amato, one of the
sport's all-time greats. ``I knew were going to get it (right), but
the big question was if it was going to be (Saturday) or Monday in
testing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never gone 325 miles per hour in my life,'' a somewhat
stunned Amato said. ``I didn't see Elvis (Presley), but I did see
the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can make it through a couple of rounds today and
make the racing exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no change atop the Funny Car qualifying ladder as
 &UR; John
 &UR; Force in a Ford Mustang remained No. 1
</P>
<P>
   But  &UR; Cruz Pedregon in a Pontiac Firebird did jump to No. 2 with
a sterling pass of 4.888 seconds. &QL; 
Like father, like son &QL; 
For the umpteenth time,  &UR; Warren Johnson and son  &UR; Kurt Johnson have
qualified 1-2 in Pro Stock.
</P>
<P>
   For the second successive day, the elder Johnson set track
records for elapsed time (6.920 seconds) and speed (199.64 mph).
And with 104 career No. 1 qualifying positions, he also became
NHRA's all-time leader in No. 1 qualifying positions, breaking a
tie with  &UR; Bob Glidden. &QL; 
Slowpoke &QL; 
 &UR; Gary Scelzi knows what it's like to be the fastest driver in NHRA
history, having uncorked a 326.44 mph pass last November.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Scelzi also learned what it's like to be one of the
slowest in a sprint car.
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi drove a World of Outlaws machine during a practice
session at Manzanita Speedway, and while not fast, he still had
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Friend)  &UR; Danny Lasoski whizzed by me once and said I was only
going about 80 mph,'' Scelzi said. ``I looked like a little girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't scare me, but I can't imagine 24 guys out there all
running together. It's dark and there's a lot of dirt. Guys passed
me and it felt like they were throwing bricks at my face shield.'' &QL;

USC BEATS WASHINGTON STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The last home game of the season also meant one
more halftime for USC to get chewed out in its locker room.
</P>
<P>
   No, Saturday night's Sports Arena season finale didn't start out
much differently than many others for USC, as Trojans coach Henry
Bibby took his team to task for a lackadaisical effort.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the majority of their Pacific-10 Conference home
games, the Trojans acted upon Bibby's words and routed Washington
State 83-62 before 3,094.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans played their final 20 minutes before the home crowd
with energy and intensity, holding Washington State to just 23
points. And they sealed the victory with a 20-2 scoring blitz seven
minutes into the half that included a trio of 3-pointers from
senior guard Elias Ayuso.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Bibby say at halftime, when USC held a slim 42-39
lead?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to know,'' Bibby replied. ``In the first half,
we played no defense. They scored every time they wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby's message worked, because USC's defense in the second half
was as stingy as Thursday night, when the Trojans held Washington
to 57 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told us we needed to pick it up,'' Ayuso said. ``He
said, `This is the last-place team in the Pac-10 and they are
starting to smell some blood.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ayuso played a major role in quelling Washington State's upset
bid, scoring 15 points in the second half and finishing with 18 in
his final home game. Ayuso also had a career-high six steals and
moved into second place on USC's all-time career 3-pointers list
with 157.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of sad it came this fast,'' Ayuso said. ``But it's
time for everyone to move on. You can't stay in college forever. I
wanted to do well because this is my last home game.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory secured a winning record for USC (14-11, 6-10) in
the regular season, and more importantly, kept their slim hopes
alive for a bid to the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Center Brian Scalabrine, who had a game-high 20 points, said USC
needs to sweep its two games in Arizona this week for a chance at
postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, with Cal's situation, I think we have to win
two,'' Scalabrine said. ``Against Arizona (in Tucson), our backs
are against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal (16-10, 6-10) has two road games remaining against the
Oregon schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our initial goal was to go to the NCAA Tournament,''
Scalabrine said. ``This year, to make a step forward, we have to go
to a tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby, who is loath to discuss the NIT, did attach significance
to the winning season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means everything,'' he said. ``You can look back and say we
have made progress. I'm very pleased and proud of them. Everyone's
expectations have been super high. After the nonconference season,
I realized we were in for a dogfight in the Pac-10. My expectations
dropped then. We had a lot of growing pains, but we've made
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC has won two straight games for the first time since
Dec. 29-Jan. 2, when the Trojans defeated Arkansas State and
Arizona State.... Eddie Miller of Chatsworth High led Washington
State (11-17, 4-13) with 15 points and seven rebounds.

INCAVIGLIA GIVES UP NUMBER TO WOMACK

   TUCSON _ New acquisition  &UR; Tony Womack is due to arrive in camp
tonight and will be on the field Monday. He will wear No. 5, which
is now being worn by non-roster outfielder  &UR; Pete Incaviglia. But
the veteran agreed to switch to No. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the guys said he should have given the number up for
money, but Inky doesn't care,'' Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter said. ``He
just wants to play baseball.'' &QL;

When  &UR; President Clinton visited the Diamondbacks' camp on Thursday,
things got a bit hectic. Just ask  &UR; Brian Butterfield, the
third-base coach who has the additional assignments of infield
defense and baserunning.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton was touring the fields, visiting with players,
Butterfield looked to another field and yelled, ``Pres! Pres!''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking Butterfield was yelling at his boss, a Secret Service
agent approached him and said, ``Is there a problem here?''

   Gulp. Butterfield explained that he was yelling at hitting coach
 &UR; Jim Presley to get some players over to his field to begin the next

Electric Park later that night, he found himself locked inside the
complex. He called Showalter to rescue him. &QL;

   Right-hander  &UR; John Patterson, one of the club's top prospects,

VETERAN LIDSTER ANSWERS STARS' CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS, Texas _ Doug Lidster had already decided his NHL career
was over.
</P>
<P>
   Working as an assistant coach/player for the Canadian National
Team in Calgary, Alberta, the 38-year-old defenseman was ready to
take the next step in his life _ a transition into coaching.
</P>
<P>
   That was until the call came ... and not from one NHL team, but
two _ the Stars and Washington Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally caught off guard,'' said Lidster, the Stars'
newest addition, who could make his debut in today's 2 p.m. game
against the Los Angeles Kings. ``One of my first comments was it
took me a couple of months to make the decision to retire, I didn't
know if I could make the decision to return in five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lidster did make a decision, but he took his time and chose the
Stars. The Capitals wanted him to play last Wednesday. The Stars
told him not to rush. The Capitals wanted him for a run to qualify
for the playoffs. The Stars wanted him for a run at the Stanley
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the key factor,'' said Lidster, who already has his
name on the Cup as a member of the 1993-94 New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Stars have a little defensive depth, and Lidster has a
chance to stretch his legs one last time in the NHL. He comes with
great credentials, teammates say, a mix of on-ice intensity and
off-ice calm, which makes him the perfect seventh defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is in such good shape, always lifting'' weights, said
Sergei Zubov, Lidster's teammate on New York's Cup-winning team.
``I remember in the Finals, he came out of nowhere and played
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Lidster rode the pine for the first 14 games of the Rangers'
playoff run, but then was given his first chance to play in the
memorable Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New
Jersey Devils in which then-captain Mark Messier guaranteed
victory. Lidster played, the Rangers won and then-coach Mike Keenan
never had a reason to take Lidster out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Lidster played all seven games of the Finals, scored two goals
and earned his Stanley Cup ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember watching that series, and he was huge,'' said Stars
winger Pat Verbeek, also is a former teammate of Lidster's.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Lidster is like former Stars defenseman Grant
Ledyard, a good skater with steady hands. However, both Verbeek and
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock say the 6-foot-1, 200-pound Lidster is
tougher in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Rangers in '93-94, Lidster was one of the
Vancouver Canucks' most dependable defensemen, voted the team's top
blue-liner four times ('84, '85, '86 and '91). With the Rangers, he
became more of a role player, the kind of defenseman who might sit
for two weeks and then play three consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done that role before and it's one I'm comfortable
with,'' Lidster said. ``I think it comes easier with experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Today is the perfect example of what awaits Lidster. Defenseman
Darryl Sydor has recovered quickly from the strained medial
collateral ligament in his left knee and could play. However, the
decision to use Sydor _ the Stars' leader in defenseman scoring
with 40 points _ won't be made until game time. Lidster has to be
ready to play or sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something he's done in his career and something that
does take a little bit of a special individual,'' Stars general
manager Bob Gainey said. ``Doug has skills both on the ice and off
that can be helpful to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lidster, in fact, learned even more patience in his stint with
the Canadian National Team _ a situation in which he played more
than he expected, but said he was hoping to blend into a coaching
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was what I thought was a unique way to end a career,''
Lidster said. ``Now, I'm looking at \Rthe Stars\S the same way.''

HALL OF FAME PLAQUE NOW TAYLOR-MADE FOR BOB HAYES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I proudly call to order this morning, The Committee to elect Bob
Hayes to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Our co-chairmen will need no introduction. Mr. Roger Staubach
and Mr. Tex Schramm already have plaques hanging on the Hall's
walls in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, until one month ago there was no such committee.
Over the years, an occasional ``it's a shame about Bob Hayes''
would be heard, but sadly, there was no getting around the prison
time served in Huntsville back in the '70s. And truthfully, his
dope-selling conviction, along with questions about Hayes having
ever straightened out his life, seemed to leave Bullet Bob without
Hall of Fame hope.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this personal failure in his past, Hayes was not even
a Ring of Honor member at Texas Stadium. Nor a Texas Sports Hall of
Fame member in Waco. He was and is overwhelmingly deserving for
both, but around here, character counted.
</P>
<P>
   In Canton, however, it doesn't. This was just learned a month
ago when Lawrence Taylor, former New York Giants linebacker, was
elected to the Hall of Fame. As a side note, I, too, would have
voted for Taylor, even though this man appears to be a loosely
wired time bomb, ready to crack, so to speak. Bet me on this _
another ugly scene from Taylor is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Those Hall of Fame electors who opposed Taylor over the
character issue certainly had that right. And they had a good case.
</P>
<P>
   But large segments of the New York media reacted with utter
disgust at the anti-Taylor group. In some instances, they
lip-locked with Lawrence, and took pandering of a troubled jock
down to Switzer level.
</P>
<P>
   It was, however, a good lesson. And also a great Canton opening
for Bob Hayes. Without one doubt, now we know the Pro Football Hall
of Fame stands for only this _ what happened on the field during a
career. So be it.
</P>
<P>
   This means Bob Hayes has to be voted into the Hall of Fame at
the next election in late January, the Saturday before the Super
Bowl in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hayes committee still has much work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, based on football achievement, Bob was qualified
long ago,'' said Staubach, as successful a Dallas businessman as he
was an NFL quarterback. ``He was one of the special few who stepped
on a football field and totally changed the way the game was
played.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you factor in this Lawrence Taylor debate _ and I
admit I was back and forth on Lawrence _ this takes Bob's chances
to a higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   As an Olympic gold medal speedster, Hayes hit the field for the
Cowboys in 1965 and immediately destroyed the traditional
man-to-man concept of how a secondary planned its coverage. To this
day, zone coverage should be known as ``Hayes coverage.'' Zone
coverage was invented out of necessity, just to contain Bullet Bob.
</P>
<P>
   You want numbers _ in his first four seasons (14-game seasons),
Hayes scored 45 touchdowns. Even though limited by injuries in '69
and held to four TDs, Bob totaled 59 touchdowns in six years. As a
punt returner, Hayes made Deion Bay-bee look like Nate Newton. He
played 10 seasons, but with injuries a problem, he was most
productive in the first seven.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question, however, Hayes stacks up stat-wise for the
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never about numbers on Bob Hayes,'' said Schramm, for
29 years the team's president-GM. ``It is only about Bob being in
prison; otherwise, he's in the Hall of Fame, and I'd certainly have
put him in the Ring of Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Schramm and Staubach served as character witnesses at
Hayes' 1978 trial in Dallas on three counts of delivery of illegal
drugs. To this day, Schramm is angry at the 5-year sentence Hayes
received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob had his problems, but he was not a drug dealer,'' said
Schramm. ``He was totally set up by an undercover cop trying to
take down a big name. Bob has spent most of his life trying to
please everyone, and it has caused him great personal pain.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also well-documented that through all his problems, before
and after prison, Hayes always had a helping friend in Staubach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down, Bob is a super person and a decent human being,''
said Staubach.
</P>
<P>
   Schramm: ``I don't agree that only performance matters, but
since a Taylor is now the standard for the Hall of Fame, Bob Hayes
is way overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Now residing in Florida with his mother, Hayes cried last week
when told by phone there were those in North Texas pushing hard for
him to be in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had given up on that a long time ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In August, a committee will meet in Canton to put the names of
senior players on the next ballot. The campaign for Bob Hayes has
hereby begun.

PRO STOCK WORLD A STAGE  
 DRAGSTERS PLAY HEAD GAMES TO START RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Pro Stock gunslingers Warren Johnson and Scott Geoffrion, it
might as well have been high noon at the O.K. Corral.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it was near dusk and the site was Houston, one of
several stops on the National Hot Rod Association circuit.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Geoffrion were in the finals, and each driver
cautiously approached the starting line after their burnouts.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson lit the Christmas tree's pre-stage light first.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Geoffrion.
</P>
<P>
   Then . . . nothing.
</P>
<P>
   No one budged. No one buckled.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Geoffrion each refused to be the first driver to
light the second bulb, called staging, which precedes the start of
the quarter-mile drag race.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two minutes, they remained motionless.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, NHRA chief starter Buster Couch reached his own boiling
point. He instructed both drivers to back off the starting grid and
switch off the ignitions of their race cars.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Couch got in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``He yelled at us as if we were two schoolkids,'' Geoffrion
said.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the sometimes topsy-turvy world of ``staging games,''
a ploy some drivers use in an attempt to upset the mental balance
of their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it works.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   In that particular episode at Houston five years ago, it worked
for Johnson but not for Geoffrion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make a bit of difference if I stage first or
second,'' said Johnson, one of Pro Stock's all-time greats. ``But
that Wayne County team (Geoffrion) considered themselves somewhat
renegades from the standpoint they felt they could do anything they
wanted. They made a statement that come hell or high water, they
were going to stage last. I took a little measure of dislike to
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we (returned) to the (starting grid), I decided to go
ahead and stage first. (Geoffrion) was a relative rookie, and I
could tell he was getting pretty nervous. Their engine expertise
wasn't very good, so I knew the engine was at the point that it was
already boiling water. I saw them steam, and I knew (Geoffrion) was
cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to me who stages first, either,'' Geoffrion
said. ``I just felt at that particular time that (Johnson's car)
had a performance advantage, and it would be foolish to not try and
take that away from him. He had lane choice and a faster car.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you really studied him at that point in his career, he
was as good as anybody if he staged last. But if he staged first, I
felt he was vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won that one, but I faced him six more times the rest of
the season, and I beat him all six times. And that was after he
made all those snide comments (at Houston) about me, calling us
jerks and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the NHRA rule book doesn't stipulate the amount of time
one driver has to stage after another driver already has staged,
chief starter Rick Stewart, who has replaced the retired Couch,
said, ``It shouldn't take long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let the drivers mess around a little bit in pre-stage,
but once that first driver sets the staging light on, the second
driver better get himself in there at a very rapid rate, because
I'm counting,'' Stewart said. ``My job is to maintain a level
playing field, and a drag race should be won or lost by two things,
driver reaction and car performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be won or lost by who stages first or second or
who plays the best game. My job is to make sure these games don't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch always attempted to make certain drivers stage within
three seconds of each other. In the memorable showdown in Houston,
however, it never got to the final stage. Not initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Geoffrion) says I yelled at them like two schoolkids, it's
because they were acting like schoolkids,'' Couch said by telephone
from his Georgia home. ``I had to scold them. If they were going to
act like kids, I'd treat them like kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a time when Bob Glidden and Larry Morgan did the
same thing. I finally told them to shut off their cars and I went
up to (Glidden) and said, `Bob, you're a chicken if you don't stage
first.' Then I went and told Morgan the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They about ran over each other trying to stage first.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrion, however, doesn't see anything wrong with staging
games. In fact, he believes staging games are a useful tool in
spurring more interest in the division, which mostly takes a back
seat to Top Fuel dragsters and Funny Cars as far as media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Top Fuelers and Funny Cars got us covered in noise,
excitement and blowing up,'' Geoffrion said. ``If we can't create
excitement with some staging battles, our class would be pretty
boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staging games is one way to give the fans some excitement. I
don't think we should hang out the other guy. We should have to
stage within four seconds. But if two cars want to sit there and
play games, we should let them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Staging games rarely happen in Top Fuel and Funny Car because
the longer those 6,000-horsepower machines are subject to idle
time, the more it affects the performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sit there too long and you'll upset the tuneup of the car
and put more heat in the clutch,'' Top Fuel driver Eddie Hill said.
``These cars are so expensive to run, you can't afford to throw
away runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, if somebody does it to me at this race, I'll darn
sure do it to them at the next race.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill likely won't have to worry.
</P>
<P>
   But keep an eye on those Pro Stock drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darrell Alderman and I had a deal a few years ago at Columbus,
and (Stewart) finally put down the starting mechanism and
disqualified us,'' Pro Stock driver Bruce Allen said. ``I don't
think that was right. I don't think a starter should determine the
outcome. But in that case, not staging first didn't work for either
of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of racers feel if you can control the other person,
it's to their advantage to play these games.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it still happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me one way or the other, and I think Warren
(Johnson) is a much better driver than he was (in 1994),''
Geoffrion said. ``But I think you can still irritate him. And if
you do that, you've gained an edge.'' &QL;

Z Whiz! Four in Rangers camp have last names with rare leadoff
letter 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Zero in on the Rangers' spring training
roster, and it becomes zestfully obvious this is a team bearing the
mark of Zorro on the verge of making baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Zealously, it can been recorded that the Rangers' campers
include Todd Zeile, Gregg Zaun, Jeff Zimmerman and Mike Zywica. If
all were to make the team, the Rangers would have the first
zinc-plated roster in history featuring four players with the last
name beginning with Z.
</P>
<P>
   Zounds.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a zany etymologist's dream. Zonk would be banging
his drum in glee at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surrounded by greatness,'' Zaun said. ``Three other
guys with the last name beginning with the letter Z. What more
could a guy ask for? You grow up dreaming about something like
that, but you never think it could materialize.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaun and Zeile made history last year with the Florida Marlins
by being the first two Z's to ever appear in the same lineup
together. But that wouldn't even be in the same zone with having
four Z's on the same team.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would have to fire Johnny Oates and bring back Don
Zimmer as manager.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this. The Baseball Encyclopedia lists only 59 players
in this century whose last names begin with the letter Z. Zeile and
Richie Zisk are the only two to have played with the Rangers.
Zeile, Zaun and Twins infielder Jon Zuber were the only Z's to play
in the majors last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a thrill to be in the majors, but four Z's in the
same lineup?'' Zimmerman said. ``That would be something.''
</P>
<P>
   The big winner in all this would be Zywica, one of the Rangers'
top minor-league prospects who is in the big-league camp for the
first time. If Zywica were to zip up to the majors this year, he
would be absolutely last alphabetically among every baseball player
who ever lived.
</P>
<P>
   That singularly Zirconian honor is currently held by George
Zuverink, who pitched for the Indians, Reds, Tigers and Orioles
from 1951-59.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met anybody, I don't want to say has a worse name
than mine, but falls behind mine,'' said Zywica, who comes from
just outside of Chicago and is of Polish ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the best Scrabble names in baseball history,''
Zeile said. ``You've got to get a double bonus out of Zywica.''
</P>
<P>
   What would make Zywica's appearance even more special is that
Hank Aaron is first alphabetically. So from that zero hour on, the
major-league roll call would run the gamut from Hank Aaron to Mike
Zywica.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be nice, to be in the same company as somebody like
that,'' Zywica said. ``I've never thought about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zywica does serve at least one useful purpose in spring
training. He keeps Zaun, Zeile and Zimmerman from having to be last
alphabetically, something they've had to endure forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been persecuted all my life,'' Zimmerman said. ``Last at
my high school graduation, last guy when they were taking
attendance, you're always at the end no matter what list you're
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Zimmerman said, ``I don't think anybody could be
behind Zywica. It would have to be Zyy.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually if the Rangers did have four Z's in the same lineup,
Zaun would come first alphabetically, a mindboggling experience for
him. His previous claim to fame was hitting the first home run into
the swimming pool at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``To actually be the first among the Z's, that would be a first
for me,'' Zaun said. ``To be the first in a list of something,
anything ... wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Having four Z's on the roster also could lend Zeile moral
support in his historic pursuit of Gus Zernial, the all-time
home-run leader among the Z's. Zernial hit 237. Zeile enters this
season with 159.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something to shoot for,'' Zeile said modestly. ``It might
do something to combat my other record, four errors in a game by a
first baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether he could endure the mounting pressure
and national media attention that comes with epic home-run
pursuits. Look what happened to Mark McGwire last year.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have four Z's on the same team, lives could be changed
forever.
</P>
<P>
   All Z team P Tom Zachary Won 184 games with Browns, Senators,
Yankees, Braves and others (1926-36).
</P>
<P>

century.

   2B Heine Zimmerman Cubs infielder (1907-16) is all-time Z leader
in games (1,456), runs (695), hits (1,566) and RBI (796).

OATES DISAPPOINTED WITH RODRIGUEZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates yesterday
voiced his disagreement with catcher Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The status he has attained in this game makes him a leader
whether he wants to be or not,'' Oates said of his seven-time
All-Star. ``Now, what kind of leader he wants to be is up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates addressed Rodriguez's late arrival to camp for the first
time yesterday morning after discussing the matter with his
27-year-old catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself a leader,'' Rodriguez said Friday
after ending his eight-day absence. ``I consider myself just
another player who's got a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates argued that Rodriguez's actions seta bad example for
younger players in the Rangers' system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes much farther than just throwing and catching the
ball,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The manager reiterated his disappointment to Rodriguez during
their private conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge knows how I feel about it,'' Oates said. ``He knows
exactly how disappointed I am.''
CLAYTON GOAL ACHIEVED
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers failed twice in their attempt to acquire a No. 1
starter for their rotation, but the organization fulfilled their
No. 1 objective this winter by retaining shortstop Royce Clayton,
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe getting a shortstop was more important,''
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers expect that Clayton's presence for an entire season
will help their rotation, which posted the American League's worst
earned-run average (5.46).
</P>
<P>
   Clayton's range factor during the 1998 season ranked fifth among
the 28 shortstops who played at least 600 innings at the position.
Range factor measures the number of successful chances _ putouts
plus assists _ handled per nine innings. The top 10 were: Shortstop

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Scottie Pippen demanded a
third-quarter kill, barking his command in no uncertain terms. He
doesn't remember what he said, or didn't want to repeat it in mixed
company.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But a third-quarter Rockets collapse, so routine it might be
promised in fine print on the back of tickets, would not be
tolerated, not against Vancouver and especially not with the Lakers
having done nothing more strenuous lately than hold news
conferences and slap around the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of their third-quarter failings, and the unpleasant
prospect of having to sweat out a game with the Grizzlies, the
Rockets produced their best third-quarter stretch of the season
Saturday. They easily put away the Grizzlies early before coasting
to an 86-74 win on their way to today's meeting with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen was not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have been much easier,'' Pippen said. ``We had an
opportunity to put this team away. We have a game tomorrow. We
should have taken care of the lead and taken them out of the game.
We had our opportunities to take them out of the game. We allowed
them to regain momentum and were never able to put them away.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he can solve that with a simple order as completely as
the Rockets solved their third-quarter travails, Pippen might rival
Charles Barkley for memorable timeout exhortations.
</P>
<P>
   Having averaged 18.3 points per third quarter this season, the
Rockets outscored Vancouver 33-19 in the third period Saturday,
pushing their lead to as large as 20. They made 13 of 18 shots in
those 12 minutes, their best shooting quarter of the season. And
their offense worked so smoothly that of those 13 field goals, 10
came off assists. The Rockets had 17 assists for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told them, `Come out and keep the energy up, and let's
not have the third-quarter letdown,''' said Pippen, who tied Hakeem
Olajuwon for team-high honors with 18 points. ``That's been the
thorn that's been killing us this season. We haven't come out and
established ourselves in the third quarter. When you're playing on
the road, you have to keep the same intensity and control of the
game, and keep the fans out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a leader and made sure we stayed on top of our
game. I said, `Stay aggressive, keep our energy up, and get to the
loose balls.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets markedly improved in those areas. After forcing just
four turnovers against the Hawks on Thursday, the Rockets forced 20
on Saturday. Ranking 25th in the NBA in blocked shots with an
average of four, the Rockets had 11 on Saturday, five by Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our season high for deflections for our defense,''
Tomjanovich said of one of his favorite measures of effort. ``After
a game when we didn't get a lot of loose balls and didn't shake
things up, we went out and got a lot of loose balls and scrambled
them up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Having gotten the defensive intensity so sorely lacking in
Thursday's debacle, the Rockets made the offense seem easy. The
Rockets went the entire quarter without taking a difficult shot,
with almost everything set up by quick, precise passing and fast
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knocked things loose, got some open-court situations,''
Tomjanovich said. ``And when we move that ball and get good shots,
this is the best shooting team we ever had. We just have to trust
each other and not force things and keep the ball moving. There's
so many good shooters out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that first timeout, Brent Price had set up Michael
Dickerson and Olajuwon for layups, Othella Harrington passed
outside to Dickerson for a 3 and Pippen set up Price for a 3.
Having let a lead as large as 13 slide to just four by halftime,
the Rockets scored on nine consecutive possessions and 15 of 23
times they touched the basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were focused about going out and saying we will execute,''
Olajuwon said. ``The execution was, I think, the best (this
season). It flowed so naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Harrington: ``It definitely felt better. You can definitely
tell when everything's moving. When the ball is moving around and
guys are making their shots. It's obvious when the ball is moving
around and it's all working.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets couldn't make that last. The Grizzlies did
enough offensively to shut off the transition offense that had
worked well for the Rockets in the third quarter. And though they
continued to set each other up for good shot opportunities, the
Rockets, the second-most accurate shooting team in the NBA, fell
into a shooting funk, making just five of 17 shots in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich had begun to think about a chance to rest his
regulars as the charter warmed up. But the Grizzlies started the
fourth quarter with a 6-0 run to move within 14 and with 2:06 left
were back within nine. Price hit a 3-pointer 15 seconds later to
push the lead back to a safe 84-72.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure wanted to have that thing taken care of,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``They started to make that mini-run. We'd make a good run,
but they would get it close to single figures.''
</P>
<P>
   But having turned around other problem areas _ forcing
turnovers, blocking shots and showing up in the third quarter _
Pippen, with the slow finish, had something new to demand during
timeouts.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT wasn't The Pit, 1983 and all the majesty of one last-second play
and one breathtaking moment for all the marbles.
</P>
<P>
   It was a half-empty Hofheinz Pavilion _ half-full, if you're an
optimist. It was an emaciated talent pool of legitimate talent for
the Coogs _ thin, if you're an optimist.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the kind of iron-rattling free-throw shooting that
had to inspire only the sponsors of the upcoming Conference USA
tournament _ an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody duck. The Cougars are stepping up to the line.
</P>
<P>
   It was a couple of teams that were mediocre at best, horrible at
worst and mixing it up with a No. 4 seed in next week's C-USA
tourney on the line for the Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   But it was something. A start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it for the last two games,'' Cougars coach
Clyde Drexler said. ``It would have been nice to get that No. 4
seed.''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations, obviously, have been lowered considerably for
Drexler and Houston Cougars basketball over the years, but that's
why Coach Clyde came back in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   He came to lift spirits and banners. He came to rekindle
emotions, pride and respect.
</P>
<P>
   You start with a No. 4 seed and build to a Final Four. You start
with Gee Gervin, Kenny Younger and William Stringfellow and build
to a team that can go more than three-deep without fans having to
cover their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In a sort of torch-passing gesture from the glory days to
Drexler's days before Saturday night's game, legendary Cougars
coach Guy V. Lewis even handed Drexler a polka-dot towel similar to
the ones Lewis clutched on the way to all those Final Fours.
</P>
<P>
   This could have been a nice night, all right. A nice start.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final regular-season game of his first year as head
coach, there was no avoiding that this was a thin 10-15 team
Drexler put onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Marquette Golden Eagles tried and tried again to help the
Cougars take the bold step into the conference tournament, never
holding more than a five-point lead in the final 13 minutes. The
Golden Eagles never looked like anything but a sub-.500 team
themselves. Which they were.
</P>
<P>
   But in something of a metaphor for UH's entire season,
ultimately the basketball the Cougars played Saturday was nowhere
close to what will be needed to get over the hump.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to sugarcoat it,'' Drexler said. ``There was no
sense of accomplishing something. We played just to play. I thought
that was our worst game of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 seeds will have to wait for another year. Final Four bids
still are nothing but a dream.
</P>
<P>
   This was the pits, 1999 and Drexler practically losing his
marbles over all the silliness he had to endure Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Technical foul on Marquette coach Mike Deane with 12 minutes
left: Gervin missed back-to-back free throws.
</P>
<P>
   One-point game with 4:10 left: Younger missed back-to-back free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Two-point game with 3:47 left: Gervin missed one of two free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Three-point game with 2:48 left: There was a lazy pass and a
turnover by Stringfellow.
</P>
<P>
   Three-point game with 2:23 left: There was a bad pass into
traffic by Gervin and another turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Two-point game with 1:30 left: Derrick Fernandez missed
back-to-back free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't camouflage this,'' Drexler said. ``They kept
trying to give it to us, but we found every possible way not to
take a lead in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Cougars found a nearly impossible way to miss a chance
to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   With just 13 seconds remaining and the Coogs on a fast break,
Fernandez somehow shot an airball on a layup. By the time Younger
was fouled on a last-second 3-point attempt, meaning he could have
tied the game with three consecutive free throws, the verdict
already was in.
</P>
<P>
   Not this night. Not now. Younger missed the first of the three,
leaving the Cougars a horrendous 12-for-29 for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler rubbed his hands over his face in disgust with the first
miss and walked up the tunnel shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tough,'' Drexler said. ``We couldn't ever get over the
hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Much like the entire season, there were lots of chances
Saturday, yet it never happened. But you've got to start somewhere.

ARMOUR, CHEESMAN SHARE 1-STROKE LEAD AT TUCSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Tommy Armour III has tasted victory in the desert
before. He made the 1990 Phoenix Open his one and only PGA Tour
victory.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so that's a bit of a reach when it comes to picking a
favorite for today's conclusion at the Touchstone Energy Tucson
Open. Armour's moment of glory was nearly 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs, like the bogey-free, 5-under 67 he posted
at Tucson National on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking forward to this,'' said the man with the
famous last name, a throwback to his grandfather, Tommy Armour, the
legendary ``Silver Scot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I knew I was going to play good soon, so I've been
getting ready for this.''
</P>
<P>
   He could not have chosen a better arena. With most of the best
players in the world skipping this PGA Tour event to play in the
WGC Match Play this week, Armour has his ducks in a row. And there
are some easy potshots in this group.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Cheesman might get in his way. The former baseball player
is tied with Armour at 10 under after a 69. But he's never won.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nice, because I haven't been that hot, that's for
sure,'' said Cheesman, who has made just three cuts in seven
outings this year.
</P>
<P>
   To show how weak this field is, 30 players are within 5 shots of
the field. Of those guys, only eight have been to the winner's
circle.
</P>
<P>
   If Armour has a challenger, it's Tommy Tolles, who is tied at 9
under with some guy named Mike Weir. Tolles finished second at the
Hawaiian Open earlier in the season, and he has game, even though
he could do no better than a 71 on this sunny day.
</P>
<P>
   Weir is a left-hander, and he is not to be confused with Phil
Mickelson, even though he won the 1998 PGA Tour Qualifying School.
It's doubtful he can follow up with another 67.
</P>
<P>
   There's a whole bunch of others, like second-round co-leaders
Gabriel Hjertstedt (8 under) and Scott Gump (7 under), who are in
contention. But for the most part, it's a thin list, which brings
everything back to Armour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working on my game,'' said the 39-year-old Texan.
``But the big difference (this week) is you just make a few more
putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My season has been close. I played good in Phoenix, but I
always play good in Phoenix. But I also played well last week at
the Nissan _ I was 5 under after 10 holes and leading the
tournament. I'm close.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheesman, who was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals and played
minor-league baseball for the then-California Angels and New York
Yankees, also is hoping he can finally hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play the game for these types of situations,'' said
Cheesman, who has intrigued the galleries this week with a driving
iron called the PRGR, which he hits approximately 270 yards off the
tee instead of a driver.
</P>
<P>
   Cheesman would have had the lead outright if not for a bogey at
the 18th hole, where he bunkered his approach shot. But he did make
five birdies to offset one other bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Others of note still in contention included the Scottsdale
contingent of Kirk Triplett, Tim Herron and Jim Carter. Triplett
was 7 under after a 70, and Herron and Carter were 6 under after
shooting 71s.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a disappointment, at least from the gallery's
standpoint, it was John Daly, who was 8 under before bogeying two
of the last four holes. The nosedive left Daly in a melancholy
mood, although he said he had no regrets about coming to Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved coming here,'' said Daly, who had a 71.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the Match Play, I don't mind missing that at all.
That 12 weeks I missed last year to get my life together was a lot
more important than any golf tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he still have a shot, even though he's 4 shots off the
pace?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can shoot another 64 out there,'' Daly said,
referring to R.W. Eaks' score from the first round. ``You'd have to
make every putt, and that's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, I can't even make an 8-footer.'' &QL;

PRO STOCK WORLD A STAGE  
 DRAGSTERS PLAY HEAD GAMES TO START RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Pro Stock gunslingers Warren Johnson and Scott Geoffrion, it
might as well have been high noon at the O.K. Corral.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it was near dusk and the site was Houston, one of
several stops on the National Hot Rod Association circuit.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Geoffrion were in the finals, and each driver
cautiously approached the starting line after their burnouts.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson lit the Christmas tree's pre-stage light first.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Geoffrion.
</P>
<P>
   Then . . . nothing.
</P>
<P>
   No one budged. No one buckled.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Geoffrion each refused to be the first driver to
light the second bulb, called staging, which precedes the start of
the quarter-mile drag race.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two minutes, they remained motionless.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, NHRA chief starter Buster Couch reached his own boiling
point. He instructed both drivers to back off the starting grid and
switch off the ignitions of their race cars.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Couch got in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``He yelled at us as if we were two schoolkids,'' Geoffrion
said.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the sometimes topsy-turvy world of ``staging games,''
a ploy some drivers use in an attempt to upset the mental balance
of their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it works.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   In that particular episode at Houston five years ago, it worked
for Johnson but not for Geoffrion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make a bit of difference if I stage first or
second,'' said Johnson, one of Pro Stock's all-time greats. ``But
that Wayne County team (Geoffrion) considered themselves somewhat
renegades from the standpoint they felt they could do anything they
wanted. They made a statement that come hell or high water, they
were going to stage last. I took a little measure of dislike to
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we (returned) to the (starting grid), I decided to go
ahead and stage first. (Geoffrion) was a relative rookie, and I
could tell he was getting pretty nervous. Their engine expertise
wasn't very good, so I knew the engine was at the point that it was
already boiling water. I saw them steam, and I knew (Geoffrion) was
cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to me who stages first, either,'' Geoffrion
said. ``I just felt at that particular time that (Johnson's car)
had a performance advantage, and it would be foolish to not try and
take that away from him. He had lane choice and a faster car.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you really studied him at that point in his career, he
was as good as anybody if he staged last. But if he staged first, I
felt he was vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won that one, but I faced him six more times the rest of
the season, and I beat him all six times. And that was after he
made all those snide comments (at Houston) about me, calling us
jerks and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the NHRA rule book doesn't stipulate the amount of time
one driver has to stage after another driver already has staged,
chief starter Rick Stewart, who has replaced the retired Couch,
said, ``It shouldn't take long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let the drivers mess around a little bit in pre-stage,
but once that first driver sets the staging light on, the second
driver better get himself in there at a very rapid rate, because
I'm counting,'' Stewart said. ``My job is to maintain a level
playing field, and a drag race should be won or lost by two things,
driver reaction and car performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be won or lost by who stages first or second or
who plays the best game. My job is to make sure these games don't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch always attempted to make certain drivers stage within
three seconds of each other. In the memorable showdown in Houston,
however, it never got to the final stage. Not initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Geoffrion) says I yelled at them like two schoolkids, it's
because they were acting like schoolkids,'' Couch said by telephone
from his Georgia home. ``I had to scold them. If they were going to
act like kids, I'd treat them like kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a time when Bob Glidden and Larry Morgan did the
same thing. I finally told them to shut off their cars and I went
up to (Glidden) and said, `Bob, you're a chicken if you don't stage
first.' Then I went and told Morgan the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They about ran over each other trying to stage first.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrion, however, doesn't see anything wrong with staging
games. In fact, he believes staging games are a useful tool in
spurring more interest in the division, which mostly takes a back
seat to Top Fuel dragsters and Funny Cars as far as media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Top Fuelers and Funny Cars got us covered in noise,
excitement and blowing up,'' Geoffrion said. ``If we can't create
excitement with some staging battles, our class would be pretty
boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staging games is one way to give the fans some excitement. I
don't think we should hang out the other guy. We should have to
stage within four seconds. But if two cars want to sit there and
play games, we should let them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Staging games rarely happen in Top Fuel and Funny Car because
the longer those 6,000-horsepower machines are subject to idle
time, the more it affects the performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sit there too long and you'll upset the tuneup of the car
and put more heat in the clutch,'' Top Fuel driver Eddie Hill said.
``These cars are so expensive to run, you can't afford to throw
away runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, if somebody does it to me at this race, I'll darn
sure do it to them at the next race.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill likely won't have to worry.
</P>
<P>
   But keep an eye on those Pro Stock drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darrell Alderman and I had a deal a few years ago at Columbus,
and (Stewart) finally put down the starting mechanism and
disqualified us,'' Pro Stock driver Bruce Allen said. ``I don't
think that was right. I don't think a starter should determine the
outcome. But in that case, not staging first didn't work for either
of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of racers feel if you can control the other person,
it's to their advantage to play these games.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it still happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me one way or the other, and I think Warren
(Johnson) is a much better driver than he was (in 1994),''
Geoffrion said. ``But I think you can still irritate him. And if
you do that, you've gained an edge.'' &QL;

PEPPERDINE WINS IN `STREET FIGHT'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Players were flying to the floor, elbows
were being thrown and trash-talking had gotten out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a men's college basketball game that Pepperdine and
San Francisco were playing. It was macho street ball, and USF was
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had them thinking,'' Dons senior guard Gerald Zimmerman
said. ``We had them questioning their offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves responded with cold calculation, short on emotion but
long on results. They outplayed the Dons in the most important
second-half of their season and beat USF 67-65 on Saturday in the
first round of the West Coast Conference Tournament at Toso
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (19-11) advanced to the second round for the first
time in three seasons under head coach Lorenzo Romar. The Waves
will play either Santa Clara or Loyola Marymount today at 8 p.m. in
the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine escaped overtime when USF's LyRyan Russell missed an
eight-footer with one second left. As the players walked off the
court, Russell and Pepperdine's Jelani Gardner had a brief heated
exchange, typifying the intensity of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loyola (Marymount) is supposed to be our rival,'' Gardner
said, ``but USF is our rival. We knew it was going to be a fight
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Romar was the right to the point in the postgame press
conference: ``When you play the Dons you have to be prepared for an
all-out street fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner deserved to raise his fists in the air after the buzzer.
He was awful when the teams last played; a 1-for-11 performance
from the floor in a 56-44 loss at USF resulted in his removal from
the starting lineup for the first time in his two-year Waves
career.
</P>
<P>
   A good week of practice put Gardner back into the lineup for the
tournament, and he played 37 minutes Saturday, including the entire
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jelani put us on his back,'' Romar said.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner came out firing, making his first two shots and helping
the Waves to an early 16-8 lead. But USF (12-18) didn't buckle and
zoomed by Pepperdine in the last five minutes of the first half
with a 14-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine was down 46-35 and facing a first-round exit in the
first round for its third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that everything was at stake in the next 20 minutes,''
Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves went on a 20-7 run to start the half, and the source
of the turnaround was sophomore forward Kelvin Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, who didn't make the all-conference team, became a force
on the boards, getting all 12 of his rebounds in the second half to
go along with a team-high 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``My coaches and my teammates felt I should have been on the
all-conference team,'' Gibbs said. ``I told myself I'm going to
come out in the tournament and show (them) ... I should have been
an All-WCC selection.''
</P>
<P>
   USF hurt itself with poor shooting, especially from the
free-throw line. The Dons shot only 22 percent (6 for 27) in the
second half from the floor and at one point missed six consecutive
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had (open) shots,'' USF coach Phil Mathews said. ``We just
didn't knock them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman scored a game-high 20 but made only 8 of 24 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Pepperdine) guarded me pretty tough,'' he said. ``I ended up
taking more shots than I should have.''
</P>
<P>
   In other tournament games:
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's 65, San Diego 60: The sixth-seeded Gaels (13-17),
inspired by the return of 7-foot-3, 380-pound center Brad Millard,
who missed almost all of the past two seasons with injuries, upset
the third-seeded Toreros (18-9) in overtime. Millard, college
basketball's biggest player, scored 10 points in 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga 84, Portland 63: The top-seeded Bulldogs built a
16-point lead and cruised into the semifinals for the second
consecutive year. Richie Frahm scored 19 to lead four Bulldogs in
double figures.

REPORT-TEX 
GEEKS WHAT DOCTOR ORDERED FOR LA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The weirdo with the radically long hair, geeky horn-rimmed
glasses, ferocious picks on opponents and kamikaze dives after
loose balls? That's Kurt Rambis, new coach of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   And the weirdo with the radically colored hair, geeky tattoos,
ferocious kicks on cameramen and kamikaze dives into
cross-dressing? That's Dennis Rodman, new leader of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, they are just what the Dr. Jerry Buss ordered.
</P>
<P>
   No matter their unique style, Rambis' and Rodman's substances
are all about winning. That in itself is a significant upgrade from
the star-studded but struggling Lakers that lackadaisically
stumbled to a 6-6 start under grandfatherly coach Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who patted players on the back when he should have
kicked them in the butt, should have been fired after his
more-talented Lakers were swept by Utah in the Western Conference
Finals last season. Sure, Harris had a stay of four-plus years in
which he was coach of the year and posted increasing win totals of
48-53-56-61, but his old-school teaching didn't get through to his
Gen-X students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just looked like there was a deterioration,'' Lakers
president Jerry West said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rambis and Rodman, there will be a revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis won four championships in the '80s and long ago won the
respect of players that Harris never earned. He will put on his
shorts and bump Shaquille O'Neal in practice, then lose his cool
and yell at Kobe Bryant during games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in the trenches, in the wars,'' O'Neal said. ``He's
more like one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Rodman will miss practice, be late for games and draw
numerous suspensions and fines, he too will help the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor, he gives LA its first rebounding champion since
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1981. In his debut Friday in a 16-point win
against the Clippers, Rodman grabbed 11 rebounds and dished out six
assists. He took two shots, and didn't complain.
</P>
<P>
   His unselfishness will rub off on shot-aholic Bryant, and his
dirty work will allow O'Neal a cleaner life in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Off the court, Rodman's constant distraction will actually help
the Lakers. Instead of focusing on the grapple for control of the
team between Bryant and O'Neal, all anyone at the Great Western
Forum is going to care about today is what color Rodman's hair is.
(Here's hoping Carmen persuades him to change from the black,
yellow and purple mess that looked like moldy fungus Friday.)
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, like Rambis, also won't hold back in publicly ripping
his teammates. Even before he signed his two-year contract that
will pay him $500,000 this season and $1.1 million next, he
criticized the Lakers' lack of maturity and togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should that upset us?'' Robert Horry said. ``It's the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have beaten one winning team this season and are too
young to win a championship. But Del Harris was too nice a guy to
lead them. With the down-and-dirty Rambis and Rodman in control,
the Lakers are in the right hands.
</P>
<P>
   And, if nothing else, LA sure became more attractive to two
sitting Bulls named Phil Jackson and Michael Jordan.
SPOTLIGHT ON ... PAT RILEY
</P>
<P>
   Wonder why Pat Riley is the league's best motivator?
</P>
<P>
   It's because he keeps players from getting bored, first and
foremost. On the way to a recent practice, Riley had the team's bus
driver veer to a theater, where he treated the Heat to a matinee
showing of Waking Ned Devine. And when players showed up at Miami
Arena for their home opener, they found huge, laminated pictures of
an NBA championship ring with their names engraved on it in their
lockers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he was up to it again.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's pregame speech last week in Detroit was about a coach
dunking one of his players in a bucket of ice water, lifting the
player's head at the last minute and saying, ``You will win when
winning is as important as that next breath.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game _ an impressive Heat win _ Riley asked his
players whether they wanted to dunk his head into one of the ice
buckets used to soak feet. Of course, they declined. But Riley went
ahead and dunked himself _ long enough to scare players like
forward P.J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, man, this dude is crazy,'' Brown said. ``He
finally came up, slobbering, and he's like, `Until your last
breath. Until your last breath.'''
QUICK HITS
AROUND THE EAST
</P>
<P>
   Celtics coach Rick Pitino fined stars Antoine Walker and Kenny
Anderson for their on-court yelling match last week in Washington.
Walker yelled for Anderson to pass him the ball, to which Anderson
retorted ``Get to the right spot and maybe I will. Said Pitino:
``I'm very disappointed that it happened as a coach because it's
unprofessionalism at the highest level.'' ... After somebodies
named Rusty LaRue and Matt Steigenga soiled the sacred cubicles
with two-game stints, the Bulls last week boarded up the lockers of
Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen at the United Center. ... Grant
Hill has a legitimate excuse to not play for his country next
summer. Hill is getting married to Canadian singer Tamia Washington
in late July. ``I can't delay this,'' Hill said. `You think David
Stern's tough ...''
AROUND THE WEST
</P>
<P>
   Don't count Minnesota's Stephon Marbury among those hypnotized
by Sacramento rookie magician Jason Williams. While Williams
conjures up images of Pete Maravich with nasty crossovers,
fake-behind-the-back passes and wrap-around dribbles, the
22-year-old Marbury shrugs at Williams' immature game. ``I was
doing those crossover moves and things when I was 13,'' Marbury
said. ``He has to learn to play at two speeds. I used to play like
that, but I had to learn.'' ... Silliest feud in the league lives
on between Rockets forward Scottie Pippen and referee Hue Hollins.
What started in 1994 when Hollins' controversial foul call against
Pippen on Hubert Davis' last-second 3-pointer gave the Knicks the
Eastern Conference championship continued last week when Hollins
ejected Pippen in Orlando. ``He just needs to meet me outside in
the parking lot and we'll settle it,'' Pippen said. ... The Nuggets
posted win No. 3 last week in their 11th game, after taking 41
tries to get three last season.
OFFBEAT BEAT
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of Black History Month, here's to Earl Lloyd. He
doesn't get near the recognition as baseball's Jackie Robinson, but
Lloyd broke basketball's color barrier in 1952 as a forward for the
Syracuse Nationals.
BEST AND WORST
</P>
<P>
   Best player not chosen for Olympic team: Maybe Jason Kidd needs
to average a triple-double before he gets an invitation. The former
Mavericks player is having an early MVP season, recording four
triple-doubles in six games and willing the Suns to a winning
record. ``I don't know what more I can do,'' Kidd said. ``I already
gave them my address.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst player named to Olympic team: We can't do better than a
player who missed 29 of his first 33 free throws and is averaging
career-lows in scoring and rebounding? If it was last season, Vin
Baker was deserving. But this season he's almost an embarrassment
in Seattle.
INSIDE THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves had to wait 483 weeks for their first NBA
player of the week. The franchise that began play in November 1989
got on the board when Stephon Marbury won for posting four
consecutive double-doubles in points and assists and leading
Minnesota to a 3-1 mark. The key game was a 40-point, 12-assist,
no-turnover performance in a victory against Houston, only the
fifth time that a player has scored at least 40, dished out at
least 10 assists and not turned over the ball. The other four are:
Player Year Team vs. Opponent P-A-TO World B. Free 1986 Cleveland
vs. Atlanta 43-11-0 Alex English 1987 Denver vs. Milwaukee 46-10-0
Joe Dumars 1990 Detroit vs. Cleveland 42-11-0 Larry Bird 1990
Boston vs. Orlando 46-10-0

CELTICS TOP .500 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ This time last week, Antoine Walker was
a villain in Boston. Never mind that the name stitched on the front
of his green-and-white jersey clearly read ``Celtics.''
</P>
<P>
   Word was he was selfish, especially after arguing on the court
with Kenny Anderson in Washington. Word was he was jealous of
rookie forward Paul Pierce. Word was he needed to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody should have passed the word to the New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   If you were willing to be a general manager for a day and wanted
to trade Walker, you could make a call here and get any deal you
wanted. The fans in Continental Airlines Arena Saturday &UR;  &LR; night
would certainly take the Celtics' captain after they saw him and
his teammates defeat the Nets, 101-92.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are now 6-5, over .500 for the first time in a year.
Walker helped them get there with 28 points, 11 rebounds, 4
assists, and 3 steals. He also got his voice going.
</P>
<P>
   We're not just talking about the voice Keith Van Horn heard in
his ear when Walker tried to distract him. And we're not talking
about the voice the New Jersey bench heard when Walker made the
game-breaking 3-pointer with 1:41 remaining, a shot that gave
Boston a 91-82 lead. We're talking about the voice Rick Pitino
heard in the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every timeout he would say, `We are not losing this game.
Don't get down if you make a mistake. Even in the fourth quarter,'
'' Pitino said of Walker. ``I've coached him for a long time, but
I've never seen him like this. He showed unbelievable leadership.
He did it on the court, during timeouts. I laugh when people say he
is not a good leader. I wish they could have seen this because this
was textbook leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics needed all the leadership and guidance anyone was
willing to give. The Nets were playing before their first sellout
crowd in six home games. That group of 20,049 got quite loud when
John Calipari's win-starved team went ahead by 14 in the second
quarter. It didn't look promising. But the Celtics lopped that lead
to 3 by halftime, tied the game at 69 at the end of the third
quarter, and then turned to Walker in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   You should know that the Celtics trailed, 80-79, with five
minutes remaining. You should also know that Walker went to work
with his partner, Pierce, in the next three minutes. They scored 12
consecutive points between them, culminating with Walker's only
3-pointer of the night.
</P>
<P>
   After Walker made a jumper to put the Celtics up, 81-80, Pierce
(21 points, 7 rebounds) responded with his only successful
3-pointer in six attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it says more about him that he took it,'' Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce came into the game shooting 46 percent from ThreeLand, so
this was clearly his worst shooting night from behind the line. Was
he discouraged?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, I never get discouraged,'' he said. ``I'll
keep shooting it if the shot is open.''
</P>
<P>
   He did exactly that after Van Horn, who finished with 22 points,
made a fadeaway. Pierce hit a shot from the corner. And then Walker
dunked on a pass from Pierce. And then there was the 3, which led
to New Jersey depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the only team with injuries,'' Nets center Jayson
Williams said. ``We're not the only team missing shots (the Nets
shot 36 percent). But it seems we're the only team losing all these
games down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, picked by many to win the Atlantic Division, now
anchor the bottom with a 2-10 record. There already are whispers
about Calipari's job. Chris Gatling called the local fans
``immature'' after they booed parts of his 10-point, 17-minute
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Celtics aren't worried about that. They have won three
games in a row, two without starting shooting guard Ron Mercer
(ankle). They are on the verge of getting one of their best
pressing men, Walter McCarty, back in the lineup. They also have
Walker and Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a nice combo,'' Pierce said. ``Their bench was
making a lot of noise at me when I was missing my shots early. So
we had to come back and tell them something after we went ahead in
the fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets went home thinking about those words. The Celtics left
thinking about the winning words of Walker.

IT WAS DAVIS' SHOW BUT GADZURIC'S TREAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The wristbands were Baron Davis' idea.
</P>
<P>
   That figures.
</P>
<P>
   In a home finale that had all the appearances of a certain
sophomore's swan song, Davis sliced and diced the Washington
Huskies and incited the Pauley Pavilion crowd. So why should it be
any surprise that Davis also was behind the gesture so nice it made
Dan Gadzuric smile in spite of his pain?
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric watched the No. 15 Bruins' 79-62 win over the Huskies
Saturday in street clothes, at the end of the bench. It was the
first time his teammates had seen him since he left Wednesday's
practice limping after landing awkwardly on his left knee during a
routine drill.
</P>
<P>
   If no one seemed overly concerned at the time, there was a good
reason. Tendinitis in both knees has left Gadzuric with a gait
that's more John Elway than Johnny Gray on the best of days.
</P>
<P>
   Only Davis had reason to suspect there was more misery in store
for Gadzuric than met the naked eye. His worst fears were confirmed
when the freshman from Holland offhandedly mentioned that he had
heard his knee pop.
</P>
<P>
   Experience told Davis right then and there the news from the
doctor wouldn't be good.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't, of course. Gadzuric had torn a lateral meniscus in
his knee. He underwent surgery Thursday, bobbed in a sea of
painkillers Friday and felt well enough Saturday to hobble to the
game on crutches that looked like they belonged on either side of
the steps in the deep end of the men's gym pool.
</P>
<P>
   When he got to the arena, Gadzuric saw that his teammates had
written his name and/or jersey number (50) in indelible ink on
their wristbands. Davis, who missed the start of this season after
suffering a knee injury during the NCAA Tournament, had been the
one to suggest it and everyone followed his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the whole knee thing, it hits home,'' Davis said of
Gadzuric's season-ending setback. ``Because of everything I've been
through, I know he has to go through some tough things within
himself. I just wanted to show my appreciation for him as a player
and as a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy for Gadzuric to sit on the same floor where six
days earlier he had played one of his finest games, contributing 12
points, nine rebounds, three blocked shots and three steals in a
93-69 win over Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing,'' Gadzuric said. ``I wish I was in
there. It's a hard thing to just sit on the bench. It's a hard
concept for me to accept. I've got to just deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Providence saw to it that he'd have ample support. Gadzuric's
parents Biba and Lance just happened to be visiting him last week
(they are leaving today). His mom was at Disneyland when the injury
happened. His dad was in the stands, blithely watching practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad that it happened,'' Biba Gadzuric said, ``but it was
perfect timing. If I was in Holland and I heard (Dan) was in the
hospital I would have thought he was dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither father nor son thought it was any big deal at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it first happened, I thought I was going to recover from
it and play (Saturday),'' Gadzuric said. ``The doctors say I'm out
and I just have to settle down with that and stay positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the painkillers, but he's already managed to spot a
few silver linings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my tendinitis is going to be better,'' Gadzuric said,
``because I'm going to have a lot of rest.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said his upper body will be stronger, too. The crutches
will see to that. ``It's another part of my conditioning,''
Gadzuric said.
</P>
<P>
   If Saturday's game was any indication, there may be an
out-of-the-blue benefit for the Bruins, too. Freshman forward JaRon
Rush elevated his game _ quite literally _ in Gadzuric's absence,
pulling down a career-high 15 rebounds and scoring 12 points for
his third double-double. Rush was angling for his ninth offensive
board in the final minute when he was hit in the head and knocked
out for a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, sounding perfectly lucid, Rush said, ``We know that
with Dan gone we all have to pick up our games.''
</P>
<P>
   That they thought to pick up Gadzuric's spirits, too, might have
been worth far more than the win in the long run. After feeling
their love, Gadzuric barely felt his pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate what they did for me a lot,'' Gadzuric said.
``It's a very important aspect to know your teammates are standing
behind you. If they don't, you have no one to rely on. It's hard,
but their support makes me want to work to get back as soon as I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the way Davis has come back from his knee surgery gives
Gadzuric hope. The gritty, gifted guard plans to take Gadzuric to
lunch some time soon to explain just how it's done. In the
meantime, Baron settled for showing him spectacular plays like his
windmill dunk late in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   When Gadzuric saw that, he couldn't help himself. He stood up
sans crutches and clapped.

NORTHRIDGE ROUTS SACRAMENTO STATE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One by one they climbed the ladder and grabbed the
scissors in one hand while the other held the net steady and then,
they just snipped away. It was the icing on the cake for the Cal
State Northridge women's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ceremonial cutting of the basketball net after a
lopsided 93-59 victory over visiting Cal State Sacramento on
Saturday night. But the celebration was not in honor of dominating
the Hornets; instead, it was for capturing their first Big Sky
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good, it feels really good,'' said Lynda Amari.
``Nobody believed we were going to make it. Everyone kept bringing
up coach Michael (Abraham) and they weren't even looking at us and
it feels good to see that they were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   They huddled around the Matadors' sign at half court, arms
stretched out in support of each other and asking what all
champions ask before a game begins: What time is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's showtime,'' the Matadors answered in unison, and came out
blazing.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge women's basketball team appeared to
have an extra spring in their step as they took the floor. Maybe it
was because they had just secured their first Big Sky title before
Saturday night's match-up with a 60-47 win over Weber State on
Thursday or perhaps their confidence came from knowing that they
were facing a team with an overall record of 3-23, 1-15 and a
last-place standing in Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Matadors (19-7, 13-3) were in the zone
Saturday night and finished the regular season with an 8-0
conference record at home.
</P>
<P>
   But the question now is: What's next? The Big Sky tournament
begins March 4 with Northern Arizona and Montana State facing off
around 5 p.m. and following that game will be the Montana and Weber
State match-up. Northridge could be facing any one of these teams
on March 5 and the outcome could possibly bring them one game
closer to reaching the NCAA Division I tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to enjoy this today and tomorrow, then come Monday
we're going to re-focus,'' said Northridge coach Frozena Jerro.
``Like I said there are bigger and better things waiting for us if
we can get it done. We are two games away from the NCAA tournament
... All six teams are fighting for the same thing and it's going to
be a dog fight at the Matadome next week ... I think they can taste
it, they got a taste of this Big Sky Championship and they want
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Any one of the Matadors could have been the player of the game.
Edniesha Curry had one of her explosive nights scoring 18 points,
12 of them on 3-pointers. Keisha Harris was the story of the second
half, racking up 13 points and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was Amari's performance once again that kept this
engine running. Amari, the Big Sky Player of the Week, passed, shot
and rebounded well. But it wasn't only what her statistics said (15
points and four steals), but the hustle and defense she showed on
the floor which proved to be invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle St. Clair added 16 points. Julie Wastell had 14 for the
Hornets.

INTERNET FOUNDER GREW UP IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget cybergeek. It is immediately apparent on
meeting Vinton Cerf that he is one cool dude.
</P>
<P>
   In a dark three-piece suit, gold tie with matching handkerchief,
and clipped white beard, Cerf looks more GQ than gee-whiz. Yet the
dapper 55-year-old is one of two tech-heads who in 1973 came up
with TCP/IP, the basic technology that allows the legions of
computers that form the Internet to swap data back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, writing the empowering protocol wasn't all that
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Cerf and fellow Stanford University researcher Robert Kahn
banged out a rough version within a few weeks of accepting the
challenge from the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research
Projects Agency. But that groundbreaking work gave the pair
something akin to Founding Father status in the computer world, and
anyone who has ever sent an e-mail message or checked sports scores
from a laptop owes Cerf a debt of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably the most widely accepted father of the Internet
that we have,'' said Bill Manassero, director of the Software
Council of Southern California. ``He is incredibly well-respected
in our community and really considered quite a pioneer.''
</P>
<P>
   So what technoburg spawned such a luminary? Palo Alto?
Cambridge?
</P>
<P>
   Try Van Nuys, a San Fernando Valley suburb of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   That's right _ a Founding Father of the Internet is, or at least
was, a Val.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived on Columbus Avenue just north of Vanowen. It used to
be a walnut grove and we were the first occupants in our whole
housing tract,'' Cerf said on a recent trip to Los Angeles for his
employer, Reston, Va.-based MCI-WorldCom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an aerospace administrator, Cerf was immersed early
on in the world of science and engineering. As a Valley teen, he
spent summers interning at his father's employer, North American
Aviation, which later became Rockwell International.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up working in practically every division at North
American over the course of many summers,'' Cerf said. ``I was at
Rocketdyne twice. I was at Atomics International. Even at their
space and information systems division.''
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Van Nuys High School in 1961 and Stanford
University in 1965, and then completed graduate and postgraduate
work at University of California, Los Angeles. In 1972, Cerf
accepted a professorship at Stanford in a joint appointment to the
school's computer science and electrical engineering departments.
It was there that he began collaborating with Kahn, who under the
auspices of DARPA was developing a method of data transmission
known as packet switching.
</P>
<P>
   When two people speak on the phone, they create a closed circuit
that uses all the capacity on the phone line to transmit their
voices. Packet switching works more like an electronic post office.
Each utterance is chopped into hundreds of small electronic post
cards that are stamped, addressed and individually sent down the
line to the recipient, where they are collected and reassembled in
the proper order. Because gaps exist between the post cards, other
people can simultaneously send their own cards or ``packets'' on
the same line.
</P>
<P>
   It was a concept Kahn proved on ground-, radio- and
satellite-based networks for the military. The only trouble was,
the three systems had no way to exchange data with each other.
Because it revolved around getting separate computer networks to
talk, it came to be known as the ``inter-net problem.'' And TCP/IP
emerged as the solution.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years in academia refining the concept on government
systems, Cerf joined MCI in 1982 to, in his words, make some money.
His early work for the telecom giant was on MCI Mail, the company's
trailblazing but proprietary e-mail service.
</P>
<P>
   And other than a six-year stint at the Corporation for National
Research Initiatives _ to again work with Kahn _ he has been at MCI
ever since, proselytizing the Internet and nudging it along.
</P>
<P>
   It was Cerf who convinced the government in 1988 to let the
first commercial venture, MCI, plug in to the military's Arpanet,
arguably marking the true birth of the Internet with a capital I.
And it was Cerf who in 1992 founded the nonprofit Internet Society
to help set guidelines and standards for the beast he'd helped
unleash.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Internet Society may prove to be Cerf's greatest
legacy, as he believes enlightened regulation has been and remains
key to the Internet's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now television, telephony and radio are starting to show
up in the middle of the Internet,'' Cerf said. ``In a worst-case
scenario, somebody will say: Ah ha! The union of all the regulatory
structures established for those media should now be applied to the
Internet that's carrying them.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cerf said, the best possible outcome is essentially
what the Clinton administration has proffered in the U.S. _ a
mostly hands-off approach that leaves the bulk of policing to users
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't reject regulation on a dogmatic basis, but I think you
need to approach it with some understanding of what you're trying
to accomplish, or prevent,'' Cerf said. ``And then you have to ask,
can you implement it? The last thing you want to do is create a
regulatory framework you can not enforce.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that predicting where the Internet will
be a decade from now, particularly in the field of commerce, is as
impossible as foreseeing in 1973 what the creation of TCP/IP would
spawn, Cerf said.

LOS ANGELES: Cerf said.

<P>
   ``We're at an incredibly early stage in the evolution of the
commercial system,'' he said. ``Companies are still out in
exploratory mode, discovering ways to use the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   The efforts he admires most are those like the online auction
house EBay, which create the sense of an online community.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the direction, Cerf is certain the Internet will become
far more ubiquitous as the technology advances. And the Net itself
will extend beyond the bounds of Earth. One of Cerf's latest
projects is collaboration with Pasadena-based Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to
create an interplanetary Internet to serve future space travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his role in the evolving Internet revolution, Cerf
is all modesty. ``I just happen to be one of the guys that started
this thing,'' he said. ``Architecturally, it sort of solved
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he seems to relish the opportunities and, frankly, the
fame his efforts have brought.
</P>
<P>
   At a cocktail party in London not long ago, Cerf, an avid
science fiction reader, said he found himself before a man whose
name tag read Doug Adams. ``I said, Are you the Doug Adams that
wrote `Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?'''
</P>
<P>
   The man replied he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Geez, I always wanted to meet you.' Then he looked at
my name tag and said, `Are you the guy that did that Internet
thing?' I said, `Yeah,' and he said, `Geez, I always wanted to meet
you too!' ''

LONG ROAD TO THE TOP FOR MIKE SKINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Skinner's climb to the top of the NASCAR Winston Cup points
standings has taken 78 races and bits and pieces of 10 seasons,
time enough to realize that even running wide-open in a stock car
has its limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't turn back time. I'd love to be 21 and know what I know
now,'' said Skinner, who at 41 typically is not mentioned among
NASCAR's rising superstars. ``That's what Jeff Gordon is _ he's got
the experience and he's young. I'm 41, and I'm not probably going
to break a lot of records in my career. But it's not too late to
have a great career in Winston Cup racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the first two races of 1999, Skinner methodically has
served notice that he is this year's ``breakthrough driver,''
following the tracks laid by Jeff Burton in 1997 and Jeremy
Mayfield in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner ran fourth in the season-opening Daytona 500 on Feb. 14,
when his victory bid was foiled by the lack of a drafting partner _
a black list topped by a snub from Richard Childress Racing
teammate Dale Earnhardt. Skinner followed with a sixth-place run at
North Carolina Speedway last Sunday, when he and 1989 Cup champion
Rusty Wallace were the only drivers to record top-10s for the
second consecutive race.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the Las Vegas 400 next Sunday, Skinner has forged a
tenuous 29-point lead over Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Skinner has established himself as the best
driver not to have won a Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to win a points race,'' said Skinner, who has won
NASCAR exhibition events in Japan the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner and veteran crew chief Larry McReynolds, paired in a
shotgun marriage-style swap of top wrenches at RCR eight months
ago, have taken a pragmatic approach to the 1999 championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awfully early. This is our third \Rfull\S year in Winston
Cup, and we're excited to be running well,'' said Skinner, driver
of the No. 31 Lowe's Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``Our realistic goals
for 1999 were, first, to win a points race. The second goal was to
finish in the top 10 in points. If we can't, we'd like to be around
that area. Getting on that stage \Rat the postseason awards
banquet\S for a good top-10 would be awesome for this year.
Anything above that would be unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds, the winner of 23 Cup races as a crew chief since
1986, sent the series a message via Skinner's victory at the Twin
Ring Motegi oval in Japan last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``All winter long, I kept telling people this race team has what
it takes,'' said McReynolds, 40, who joined RCR in late 1996 after
a high-profile tenure at rival Robert Yates Racing. ``I've been in
situations where race teams were awfully good and where race teams
were not awfully good. The last time I remember feeling the fire in
my belly I feel now about a team and a program was 1994, with the
28 car and Ernie Irvan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just knew it was there, and I feel the same way about this
31 team.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner exchanged crew chief Kevin Hamlin in the swap that
brought McReynolds aboard from Earnhardt's team after 13 races last
year. With the exception of an eighth-place run in the 1998 Daytona
500, Skinner's early season was a disaster. The lowlights included
grinding crashes at Atlanta Motor Speedway (42nd-place finish) and
at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth (33rd) that left Skinner's
body and ego battered and reduced his superspeedway Monte Carlos to
scrap iron.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner sat out three consecutive races to allow his injuries to
heal, a period marked by rumors that Childress was planning to fire
the native Californian. The rumors proved false, and subsequently
were trumped by the shocking switch of crew chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Recall that McReynolds was supposed to help deliver Earnhardt
his unprecedented eighth Cup championship when he signed with the
No. 3 GM Goodwrench team. But the Earnhardt-McReynolds association
produced only one victory _ in the season-opening 1998 Daytona 500
_ with Skinner, ironically, proving a willing and able bump-draft
partner.
</P>
<P>
   An admittedly crestfallen McReynolds packed his tools for the
move into Skinner's shop last June, and immediately began
fashioning a championship-caliber outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at Mike, I don't look at age,'' said McReynolds,
who helped shape the budding career of Davey Allison before his
death in July 1993. ``I look at what type of driver Mike is and
what he's looking for. Mike and I hit it off pretty good. We are
going to do whatever it takes to win races. That's the biggest
thing we have in common.''
</P>
<P>
   During his 20-race association with McReynolds last year,
Skinner racked up three top-fives and eight top-10s. He advanced 15
positions in points to 21st, and then repeated in Victory Lane in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to get a bond there and confidence in each other's
opinions,'' Skinner said. ``Larry has been a great coach as well as
a great friend and great crew chief. Larry has brought a ton of
depth to this race team. Team-wise, I think everybody's trying to
pull the rope in the same direction. You don't hear guys walking
around the 31 shop talking under their breath. These guys want to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   They also want that first team-defining, points-paying Winston
Cup victory. Skinner believes that could happen on the flat,
1.5-mile Las Vegas track, where Skinner plans to run the same car
he won with at Twin Ring Motegi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at it as our next race is our next opportunity
to win our first Cup race,'' Skinner said. ``I think Vegas is
potentially one of our best racetracks. I'm not a bookie and don't
know where I'd put our chances ... 100-to-1 and then I'd go bet
everything on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our chances. We'd love to pull it off.''

CARD COLLECTING KID HITS JORDAN JERSEY JACKPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sason Dardashti borrowed $3 from a friend, bought
a pack of Michael Jordan basketball cards and scored the
collector's equivalent of a full-court shot _ a rare card embedded
with a piece of Jordan's jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really like him, to tell you the truth, but I like his
cards because they're valuable,'' the 12-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   True enough.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth close to $1,800, or even more if the trend continues
for this Upper Deck trading card, which just a year ago was valued
at $900, according to the company and a collecting reference book.
</P>
<P>
   If the seventh-grader has his way, he will eventually sell the
card. After all, he said he's a Los Angeles Lakers fan all the way
and more into flashy players like Kobe Bryant and Dennis Rodman
than the more sedate Jordan, recently retired superman of the sport
and former Chicago Bull.
</P>
<P>
   When he bought the card, he said he had a good feeling he had
made a good investment. ``I predicted it would be in there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Susan, smiled: ``This one, for sure, is going to be
a businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   Inserting pieces of sports memorabilia into cards _ from
game-worn jerseys to slivers of a Babe Ruth bat _ is relatively new
to the card collecting world. Unlike other cards that take decades
to increase in value, if they increase at all, memorabilia cards
are instantly hot. An Upper Deck baseball card with a piece of
Ruth's bat in it is worth $2,000 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Had Sason's card been one of 23 jersey cards autographed by
Jordan, it could net him up to $10,000 on the collector's market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's instant gratification,'' said Rob Stenzel, an employee at
Valley Baseball Card Shop in suburban Tarzana, where Sason bought
the jersey card. ``That's a big card as far as pulls we've had in
our store.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``pull'' is when the collector pulls a valuable card out of an
ordinary pack.
</P>
<P>
   The red Chicago Bulls road jersey on Sason's card was worn by
Jordan in the 1992-93 championship season, said Terry Melia, hobby
media manager at Upper Deck. The trading card company bought the
jersey at an auction for $26,000 in August 1998. Swatches of the
jersey were put in cards and inserted into one of every 288 packs.
</P>
<P>
   Upper Deck won't say how many cards have the coveted jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suffice to say, it's a rare pull for the kid,'' Melia said.
``This youngster basically paid $2.99 for a card that's worth close
to $2,000. That's a pretty good return on his investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some collectors go a lifetime without pulling a big card. Sason
has only been collecting for six months. His friend Daren Weintraub
got him interested in collecting and loaned him the cash that
netted the coveted card.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was happy for me,'' Sason said of his pal. ``I paid him
back double.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Sason might have had to settle for about $900
for the card, which lists for $1,800 in Beckett's, the Bible of
card collecting. But an Internet collecting craze on sites like
eBay means there are potentially millions of bidders for his card _
and that drives up the price.

AL WEST COULD TURN ON THE WAY KEN HILL PITCHES FOR THE ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There may not be a more pivotal player in the American League
West than Angels pitcher Ken Hill.
</P>
<P>
   If he can come all the way back from last year's elbow trouble,
the Angels are much more formidable competition for the Rangers. If
he doesn't, the Angels will have a hard time staying competitive
unless they get extremely lucky with one of their young pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing ... it's not just important for me to come
back, it's important for all of us,'' Hill told the Los Angeles
Times. ``I need to be healthy. I need to get my game back together
so I can help this club get over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill missed 21/2 months last year with elbow trouble, then was
erratic when he returned in September. So far this spring he's
thrown the ball well with the help of a more compact delivery that
puts less stress on the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's workouts have been a bright spot for a team rattled by
the injury to shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who broke his left forearm
early on his first day in camp. DiSarcina was hit by coach George
Hendrick's fungo after stepping out of the batting cage, after
taking only his first seven swings of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The injury was an emotional slap for a team that was feeling
good in the off-season after the signing of Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into camp with an upbeat attitude, we can't let this
get us down,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``We can't start
saying, `Here we go again.' I am not going to let it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are looking at Jeff Huson, Craig Shipley, Andy
Stankiewicz and Luis Rivera as possible replacements until
DiSarcina is ready in April. Third baseman Troy Glaus, a shortstop
at UCLA, may also play there, with Dave Hollins stepping in for him
at third.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also haven't solved their overloaded outfield
problem. Tim Salmon spent last year at designated hitter because of
a torn ligament in his left foot, but said he's ready to move back
to right field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have talked about rotating Salmon, Garret Anderson,
Jim Edmonds and Darin Erstad at designated hitter. But Salmon said:
``I'm healthy. I feel I can play every day in the outfield. I don't
plan on being part of any rotation in the outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   SHORT HOPS
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle has been called almost everything by fans across
the country. He said his favorite was, ``Some guy yelled at me,
`You're one hot dog away from being Cecil Fielder.' I got the
biggest laugh out of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker isn't panicking. He has lost
All-Star outfielder Moises Alou for most of the year, but he thinks
he can get by with Richard Hidalgo in left, Carl Everett in center
and Derek Bell in right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as bad as if we were to lose Jeff Bagwell or Craig
Biggio,'' Dierker said. ``We've got three everyday outfielders that
have fielding ability, strong throwing arms and can do damage with
the bat. We don't have anybody backing up second base or first
base. Nobody is going to replace Alou, but we've got guys who can
come close.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker has four members of his five-man rotation set in Shane
Reynolds, Mike Hampton, Jose Lima and Sean Bergman. He also said
Chris Holt, who missed all of last year with a shoulder problem, is
healthy and competing with Scott Elarton and Brian Powell for the
fifth spot. Dierker said Elarton is still a couple of years away
from being a dominant major-league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why people think Belle will be much more productive with
the Orioles than the White Sox. Over the past three years,
right-handed hitters have hit 7 percent more home runs at Camden
Yards than they did at the average major league park. They hit 6
percent less at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals were 40-46 before the All-Star break
last year and 43-33 afterward. They were 18-7 in September. Manager
Tony LaRussa said that shows all the attention directed toward Mark
McGwire does not distract the rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to have a flat day when that many people show up at
the stadium,'' LaRussa said. ``There's no doubt in my mind he's a
huge plus.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner has merged the Yankees with the New York
Nets of the NBA, putting together a sports and entertainment
company similar to the Rangers and the Stars. That allows the
Yankees to become much more attractive to a regional cable company
when their current contract with Madison Square Garden runs out
after 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees already get approximately $50 million a year from
local broadcasting revenues, a figure that blows all other clubs
out of the water. It could get even more lucrative if ESPN or
Time-Warner decide to step in and form a New York-based regional
cable network to compete with MSG or Fox Sports New York.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox pitcher Jaime Navarro showed up to camp one day late,
announced he didn't want to pitch in the bullpen again and got into
a clubhouse argument with outfielder Jeff Abbott. The two had to be
separated by teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas, who thought the rest of his career would be as a
DH, said he wants to play 120-125 games at first base. The White
Sox will probably accommodate him, leaving Paul Konerko as their
designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   pitcher Ed Vosberg, the ex-Ranger who missed all of last season
with a bad shoulder, showed up in camp throwing hard again and
breaking off sharp curveballs.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball's aim is not to get veteran umpires to
change their strike zone. Baseball officials are only hoping to get
the younger umpires to call the high strike and somehow reverse the
trend over the past several years of the shrinking strike zone.

 &HT;    Baptist leader is convicted
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARGO, Fla. _ Forgiveness for embattled Baptist leader Henry
Lyons will have to come from somewhere other than a jury of his
peers.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, an all-white jury convicted the leader of one of
the nation's largest African-American denominations of racketeering
and grand theft, saying he financed a lifestyle of luxury with more
than $4 million stolen from corporations that wanted to do business
with members of the National Baptist Convention. He also was found
guilty of stealing a $250,000 donation intended to help black
churches burned out by arsonists.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' co-defendant, Bernice Edwards, was acquitted of
racketeering, the sole charge she faced. Edwards broke down in
tears at the verdict, while Lyons sat stoically at the defense
table, hands clasped.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, 57, will remain free on bond pending a presentence
investigation, which should take several weeks. He faces up to
seven years in prison, although under Florida guidelines he is more
likely to receive three to five years. Both Lyons and Edwards face
a federal trial later this spring on charges of tax evasion,
extortion and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' attorneys said they believe he will remain president of
the convention until his term ends in September. But a rival within
the group called for Lyons to resign immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The day of drama began with a bizarre wrinkle. A Tampa-area news
station reported receiving an electronic message from a viewer who
stated that one of the jurors had been overheard discussing the
case outside the courtroom _ a violation of the judge's orders.
Pinellas Circuit Judge Susan Schaeffer questioned the juror, who
denied any such conversation. Schaeffer then denied the defense's
request to declare a mistrial. Lyons came under scrutiny in July
1997 when his wife set several small fires in a $700,000 waterfront
home Lyons purchased with Edwards in an upscale St. Petersburg
neighborhood. Deborah Lyons first told police she suspected her
husband was having an affair, but quickly changed her story and has
since stood by him.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident triggered state and federal investigations that
found Lyons had negotiated several lucrative deals with
corporations that wanted to market credit cards, insurance and
funeral services to the convention's membership. Although most of
the money went into convention accounts, Lyons spent it on luxury
items for himself, Edwards and a California woman who told
convention colleagues she was having an affair with Lyons. The
grand theft allegations were related to money Lyons took as a
donation for his church group.
</P>
<P>
   When a string of black churches across the South were set ablaze
by arsonists in the early 1990s, the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith, a Jewish group, stepped forward with nearly $250,000
in donations.
</P>
<P>
   While telling the ADL that all of the money went to the
churches, Lyons put at least $60,000 into his personal accounts,
prosecutors said. He eventually repaid the $250,000, but not until
the criminal investigations were under way.

 &HT;    Appeals court's ruling shows plants, animals matter
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta artist Michael Murrell's sculpture ``No Place
Wild,'' with its bare-looking metal globe sitting on a pile of
empty tennis shoes, says what I feel about America's shrinking
wilderness. It's fitting that Murrell is on exhibit in Atlanta
because an unlikely group has taken his message to heart: the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling that could set national precedent for the way the
U.S. Forest Service operates, the federal appellate judges
overturned a district court judgment and halted seven timber
projects in the Chattahoochee and Oconee national forests. The
court said the Forest Service didn't bother to consider imperiled
plants and animals in the area. Its own regulations require it to
do so. Forest Service officials admitted sensitive species and
their habitat would be destroyed by the timbering. But officials
claimed the species would be OK since they exist elsewhere in the
forest. So much for the brook trout or the cerulean warbler.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kirby, former Southeast director of the Wilderness Society
(one of several environmental groups involved), worked on the
lawsuit for five years. He notes that the appellate court's ruling
doesn't halt all logging in the forests involved, but it sets a
precedent for other challenges to the Forest Service around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   It confirms what a recent federal audit report found _ the
agency hasn't been doing the environmental assessments the laws
require. In an audit of 12 timber projects over a three-year
period, the U.S. Agriculture Department's inspector general found
the Forest Service's evaluations didn't consider sensitive species.
In fact, in one in which the forest service recorded no imperiled
species, auditors found there were 127 either threatened or
endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the landmark court ruling, there's another ray of hope
for reforming Forest Service policy, for recognition at last that
all but one third of remaining national forests now contain roads,
most built by loggers at taxpayer expense. That hope is new Forest
Service chief Mike Dombeck. Dombeck is moving slowly to change the
myth that the highest and best use of every forest is logging.
(Most of this nation's timber doesn't even come from national
forests anymore, and shouldn't.) In a speech last month, Dombeck
said, ``It's my expectation that (our) long-term road policy will
significantly limit, if not eliminate, costly new road construction
in sensitive areas that can cause erosion, imperil rare species or
fragment habitat.'' He's enforcing an 18-month freeze on road
building in roadless areas.
</P>
<P>
   I stood at the end of an invigorating hike atop Georgia's
second-highest mountain, Rabun Bald, last weekend. I gazed on
roads, golf courses, cellular towers and other interferences with
the 365-degree view of the glorious Blue Ridge Mountains. In the
past 10 years, protected roadless acreage on Rabun Bald has shrunk
by half. In fact, only 15 percent of Georgia's forest lands are
preserved as wilderness, compared to 30 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   It's good that the 11th Circuit set a precedent with a case out
of the Southeast. We need it most. I can't hike this week, but I
can take in works of Murrell at City Hall East in Atlanta. His
reverence for nature also helps soothe the soul.

 &HT;    Former truck driver says he paid for funeral of Jasper victim
 &HT;    By Brad Mayhari
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ A former Los Angeles truck driver says that he _
not basketball star Dennis Rodman _ helped pay for the funeral of
Jasper dragging death victim James Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   After a 12-man jury sentenced the first of three white suspects
in the crime, John William King, to the death penalty, 62-year-old
Henry Crump told The Lufkin Daily News he wanted the world to know
that he paid for the vault at Byrd's gravesite instead of the
flamboyant Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his Southern California home,
Crump, who has experience working in funeral homes, said he felt
compelled to go public about his contributions to Byrd's funeral
after continuing to hear the victim's family attribute the deed to
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'm going to do something so that it can be with me in
my heart and I'm going to keep my mouth closed, so that I can do
something that is right and will always be with me,'' Crump said of
why he waited almost nine months after Byrd's funeral to go public
about his contribution. ``So I did it, and I kept my mouth quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one of my family members knows about it, and one neighbor
and about 13 other people _ over half of them I don't even know.
The reason I mentioned it to them is because I was in the grocery
line, and they was all hyped up about what Dennis did, and I said
I'm the one who did this or I bought that, and they just looked at
me. When I tell the average person that, they resent it. They
resent this because I'm just a nobody knows who I am, little black
dude out here in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Crump said Rodman kept his promise of sending money intended to
cover funeral expenses to the Byrd family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's accepted because of who Dennis Rodman is, and I feel sad
for him, because they bring him on nationwide TV knowing that they
didn't use the money _ knowing they didn't do it,'' Crump said.
``They know right from wrong. I don't know if (Rodman) sent it to
them or took it to them, but he's been on nationwide TV saying he
paid for the service, which he probably gave money, but it was
kept. Who knows what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Crump said he took offense when members of the Byrd family did
not contact him last fall when they traveled to Los Angeles to
appear on ``The Roseanne Show'' with Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two sisters came out on the Roseanne Barr show, and I live
two and a half miles from the doggone studio, and they didn't have
guts enough to say: `Henry Crump, we're in town. Thank you, bye
bye, can't see you, but we'll see you later,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's sister Mary Verrett of Houston, said Crump's name sounded
familiar, but she could not recall who paid for the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received so much mail and so many contributions from
individuals,'' Ms. Verrett said. ``It this point it's hard to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of Byrd's sisters, Clara Taylor, could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Crump on Friday afternoon faxed The Lufkin Daily News several
documents, which included a copy of his sales receipt from the
Robinson Community Funeral Home in Jasper. The receipt listed
expenses totaling more than $2,400 for the bronze triune vault, a
service fee, as well as tents and chairs used at Byrd's graveside
service, which Crump paid for with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The faxed papers also included a thank you note from the funeral
home on a company letterhead, Crump's credit card bill for the
month of June 1998 and a typed thank you note from the Byrd family,
which Crump cited as the only time he ever heard from the family.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing of Byrd's brutal murder last summer, Crump said he
decided to help the family because the crime reminded him of a past
personal experience in which his cousin fell victim to a fatal hate
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'm going to do it to have a lasting memory inside of
me of all the things that I've seen in my life,'' he said. ``I did
it for James Byrd because I felt so bad, but I did it so the family
would always have a beautiful remembrance to always remember that.
I did it from the bottom of my heart. I didn't do it to tell
everybody the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Crump said U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno contributed the
remaining funeral expenses, however, no documentation of Ms. Reno's
contributions were available as of presstime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to go down in the history books,'' Crump said.
``If we don't clear it up, the lie is going to go down in the
history books. I'll be dead and gone, but those kids that are going
to be reading about this maybe when all of us are gone are going to
be reading a lie.''

   CRACK-LEGACY-II (Alburquerque, N.M.) _ Special Weapons and
Tactics squads, once used exclusively for the rare urban terrorist
incident or shootout, have transformed themselves through the crack
years into everyday parts of city life. In big urban areas,
paramilitary units now do everything from routine street patrols to
nightly house raids. Even small towns have formed paramilitary
police units. The Cape Cod town of Harwich, Mass., for example,
population 11,000, has trained a 10-man SWAT team. Encouraged by
federal grants, surplus equipment handed out by the military, and
seizure laws that allow police departments to keep much of what
their special units take in raids, the special units have grown
dramatically, even in the face of plummeting crime figures. (Second

`HOTHOUSE': PINTER FOR PINTERPHOBES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production Notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What's with the boss? He can't get through two
sentences without contradicting himself. He sees murder and
insurrection in the blandest faces of his subordinates. All those
fancy words and phrases he keeps piling on with such assurance,
wallowing in the sound of his voice: Do you think he has any idea
what they mean?
</P>
<P>
   All right, maybe so far Roote, the bureaucrat in Harold Pinter's
``Hothouse,'' which has been given a bright fever dream of a
revival by the Atlantic Theater Company, sounds pretty much like
most of the bosses you've known. But does your boss pull out a
sword to slice a cake that an employee has just given him as a
present? Does he mechanically throw drink after drink into your
face? Does he get all teary and pugilistic over the issue of
whether his mother breast fed him?
</P>
<P>
   Even if he or she does (and it's true, I've heard stranger tales
of corporate behavior), you undoubtedly should make the
acquaintance of the executive now being portrayed with such
splenetic savoir-faire by Larry Bryggman in Karen Kohlhaas' expert
production of this early Pinter comedy. As the addled, angry and
childishly petulant Roote, Bryggman gives a blissful demonstration
of how power not only corrupts but dements.
</P>
<P>
   Looking like a hybrid of T.S. Eliot, Col. Blimp and Arturo Ui,
Brecht's Hitlerian sociopath, this actor makes sense of his
character's nonsense in ways that chill even as they tickle you to
the point of delirium. Bryggman's Roote is the ultimate clueless
man in charge, his mind steaming ahead on a wayward track of
paranoia and mindless protocol that connects only fitfully with the
reality of the rest home he oversees. It has seldom seemed lonelier
at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it's lonely everywhere in the world of Pinter, where a
failure to connect is the basis of any conversation. You need only
sit through the 40 minutes of his most recent and more solemn
offering, ``Ashes to Ashes'' at the Gramercy Theater, to see he
hasn't changed in this regard. But ``The Hothouse,'' which was
written in 1958 though not produced until 1980, is an unusually
antic variation on the usual Pinter themes (you know, Fascism,
humanity's inhumanity, the unknowability of people, the
slipperiness of memory and language).
</P>
<P>
   This fractured farce, which Pinter shelved after the hostile
critical reception of his ``Birthday Party'' that same year,
suggests that had the discouraged playwright pursued other
directions, he might have flourished as a member of Monty Python or
``Beyond the Fringe.'' Like many of their sketches, ``The
Hothouse'' applies the rhythms of old music hall and vaudeville
routines to the darker complexities of the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   It is not, by Pinter standards, a subtle play. (In this sense,
it's the perfect Pinter for Pinterphobes.) Nor, with its jolting
detours into apocalyptic darkness, is it of a whole in the manner
of the dramatist's more mature works. But like the best of Pinter
it reminds us of just how surreal our own everyday reality is, and
in doing so it is criminally good fun. At least that's the case
with the Atlantic's highly polished interpretation, which has a
confidence and linguistic ease not usually associated with American
productions of this most English playwright.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kohlhaas brings the discipline of a military drill to the
unseemly, frantic goings-on at the play's state-run convalescent
home (although there is some disagreement about whether that is
indeed what the institution is). Every member of the ensemble
creates a distinctly individual comic construct, while clicking
right into the overall Swiss-watch precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hothouse'' takes place on one bizarrely warm Christmas
Eve. (``The snow has turned to slush'' becomes an exasperatingly
reiterated mantra in the play's second act.) There is no rest,
however, for the weary Roote, who learns that he has confused two
of the institution's patients, who are known only by their numbers,
which in this case are 6457 and 6459. This is especially
unfortunate, since one of them has mysteriously died, while the
other just has been delivered of a baby, presumably fathered by a
member of the staff.
</P>
<P>
   The bearer of this news is the officious, steel-spined Gibbs,
beautifully played by Jordan Lage, who mixes sycophancy and
superciliousness into something like a demon version of P.G.
Wodehouse's Jeeves. Other institutional staff members include the
louche, all-too-casual Lush (Patrick Breen); the humble Tubb
(Stephen Mendillo), a Dickensian representative of lower-class
workers, and the innocent, ambitious Lamb (Liam Christopher
O'Brien), who of course will be sacrificed before the evening is
over.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the comely Miss Cutts (Kate Blumberg, who seems to
have borrowed Marlene Dietrich's legs), who brings to mind a
hard-angled, cool-headed variation on the naughty nurses of the
Ealing comedies. She appears to be the mistress of Roote and,
possibly, of Gibbs, and she is all ice one minute and all
insecurity the next. In this sense she is the perfect match for
Bryggman's Roote, whose behavior is to manic depression what
pneumonia is to the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   The activities of these mutually suspicious co-workers, which
range from competitive sniping to torture by electric shock, occur
against Walt Spangler's exquisitely appalling set, a model of
mid-century clinical tastelessness. The same sensibility, which
somehow achieves parody without exaggeration, is reflected in Rick
Gradone's tacky but hip costumes and in the radioactive glow of
Robert Perry's lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond D. Schilke's sound effects, which include eerily
amplified sighs and groans from undisclosed sources, round out the
requisite atmosphere of evil banality. In contrast, Pinter's
inclusion of scenes of torture and descriptions of wholesale
carnage feel like uncharacteristic overkill. The play doesn't need
them and would probably be more effective at two-thirds its length.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, these moments don't overwhelm the potent joys of
the rest of the evening. Pinter's conceit of a powerful bureaucracy
run by ambiguous, dangerously capricious creatures isn't new, of
course. It was what Kafka specialized in, and what latter-day
satirists like Paddy Chayefsky built their careers on. But few
artists have rendered the absurdities of administrative jargon and
jingoism with such scathing assurance.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to Roote piously describing his institution's
founder: ``He was sanctioned by the ministry, revered by the
populace, subsidized by the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Or how about his irate response when Lush spits out a piece of
Christmas cake: ``You have insulted me, you have insulted the cook,
and you have insulted Jesus Christ.'' You think people really don't
talk that way? Just turn on C-Span whenever Congress is in session.
The difference is that the Atlantic Theater Company provides much
more stylish acting.

WHITNEY PICKS ALL CURATORS FOR BIENNIAL FROM OUTSIDE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Texas, Calif., Ill. ,  Mass., Conn.)   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time in its 68-year history, the
Whitney Museum of American Art will be producing its mammoth
Biennial with a team of outside curators, representing different
regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to open in March 2000 and to occupy all six floors of
the museum, the always anticipated and argued-about show, a survey
of contemporary American artists, will break with the Whitney's
tradition by not having one of the museum's own curators in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for divergent points of view,'' said Maxwell L.
Anderson, the Whitney's recently named director. Anderson plans to
head the curatorial team himself and will be the only
representative on it from a New York institution.
</P>
<P>
   The Biennial, which has become a hot button in the art world _
it is often called the show everyone loves to hate _ has long been
criticized for reflecting too much of the sensibility of the closed
and cliquish New York art establishment and not enough of what is
going on in contemporary art across the country. Although Whitney
curators often have worked with consultants to help give them a
broader perspective, the Biennial's basic premise and ideas have
generally come from within the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years critics have accused the show of many things:
lacking proper representation of painters, being too politically
charged, reflecting insiders' tastes too heavily and seeming too
much of a hodgepodge. But for those whose work is chosen,
especially emerging artists, being included in a Whitney Biennial
gives them added credibility.
</P>
<P>
   For this Biennial, however, by reaching out to curators from as
far away as Texas, California and Illinois, Anderson is hoping to
bring a more balanced, national scope to the show, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the curators ``in their various lives have had a
connection to New York and are seasoned to the life and fabric of
the New York art world.'' He declined to say what the curators were
being paid.
</P>
<P>
   In May, four months before Anderson became the museum's
director, the Whitney announced that Thelma Golden, a 10-year
Whitney veteran, would be in charge of the Biennial. But a month
after Anderson joined the Whitney he reorganized the staff, and
when Ms. Golden learned that she would not be given a specialized
area of the museum's collection to oversee, as other curators had,
she resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Before Ms. Golden's departure Anderson had said he wanted Lisa
Phillips, the Whitney's contemporary-art curator, to direct the
Biennial with Ms. Golden working under her. But in December Ms.
Phillips resigned from the Whitney after 23 years to become
director of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he had not appointed another in-house curator to
organize the Biennial because the ``museum is in the midst of
planning the largest exhibition in history.'' He was referring to
``The American Century: 1900-2000,'' a two-part show that will run
from April 23 through January 2000. With this show consuming his
staff, he said, ``no one was ready to drop anything.'' This will be
the 70th Biennial in the museum's history. The concept of the
Biennial was born two years after Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney
founded the museum in 1930. At first there were alternating shows
every year of either painting or sculpture; then for a while the
museum produced what it called Annuals, mounting a sculpture show
every spring and a painting show each fall.
</P>
<P>
   The two mediums were combined in the present Biennial format in
1973. But this Biennial is a break from its regular schedule. It
should have taken place this year, but because of the enormousness
and length of ``American Century'' and because the Whitney curators
want the Biennial to be seen as the next chapter to that show, it
was put off until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Biennial is more than a year away and the team just
put in place, Anderson said, no theme has been selected, nor have
any specific artists been chosen.
</P>
<P>
   The curators who have agreed to work on the show are Michael G.
Auping, chief curator of the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth;
Valerie Cassel, director of the visiting artists program at the
School of the Art Institute of Chicago; Hugh Davies, director of
the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego; Jane Farver, director
designate of the List Visual Arts Center at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology; Andrea Miller-Keller, an independent
curator in Hartford, and Lawrence R. Rinder, director of the CCAC
Institute at the California College of Arts and Crafts in San
Francisco and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Of them, only Rinder has worked on projects at the Whitney. He
was a consultant for the 1991 and 1993 Biennials and the curator of
``Theresa Hak Kyung Cha: Other Things Seen, Other Things Heard,''
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   All the curators say they are hoping this Biennial will
represent a different point from the past ones. ``I'm hoping to
bring a West Coast perspective, which some say has been sadly
lacking,'' Davies said. ``My sense is that this has been a New York
event and has been ever since the 1970s. Even though a few Los
Angeles artists have been let into the party, it's been limited.
Having a more national perspective is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some curators said they realized that the task was fraught with
problems. For starters, organizing an exhibition by committee is
generally difficult, and the exhibition is the art world's punching
bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably decided to do it because everyone told me I
shouldn't,'' Auping said. ``It's a very loaded situation when you
have a new director who is still the whipping boy, when the
Biennial is the show everyone loves to hate and when it's the 2000
Biennial. It's almost a caricature of the worst possible Biennial
scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``maybe we can make it different.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was the closest you could get to a debutante party
in the mud-slinging, ego-bruising, advertising-hungry world of
magazine publishing.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion: a dinner in early February hosted by the American
Jewish Committee in the ballroom of the New York Hilton, in honor
of Cathleen Black, the president of Hearst Magazines. But, alas,
all eyes were not on Ms. Black.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, heads swiveled toward Tina Brown and Ron Galotti, the
editor and publisher of Talk magazine, the Hearst Corp &UR; . &LR; 's newest
joint venture _ who sat, smiles firmly in place, at a table behind
Ms. Black, in their first public appearance as affianced partners
of the Hearst company. And a Hearst executive, noticing the
rubbernecking, nodded his head toward the pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're showing them off tonight,'' he said in the tone a proud
father might use to describe a glowing daughter. ``Our new gems.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Hearst executives were swooning over Ms. Brown
demonstrates the dynamic of what has become an emerging strategy at
Hearst: partnership. In this case, the muscle of Hearst coupled
with the ceaseless chattering chorus that seems to follow Ms. Brown
everywhere. At a time when magazine publishers, feeling a squeeze
at the newsstand, are wary of introducing new magazines unless they
are guaranteed sure things, the partnership formula seems to be
working for Hearst. The company's two other joint ventures, Smart
Money (which is published in conjunction with Dow Jones &AMP; Co &UR; . &LR; )
and Marie Claire (with Marie Claire Album, a French company) are
two of the strongest titles in the industry. With the Talk deal,
Hearst has attracted attention from the advertising community by
teaming up with two well-known magazine figures _ but only assuming
half the financial risk and half the estimated $50 million start-up
costs.
</P>
<P>
   But not all eyes will remain glued to Talk; many will be
monitoring Ms. Black's progress in changing the company to increase
advertising revenue. This decision to become a partner with Miramax
Films is a definite change of pace for Hearst. Hearst's
$1-billion-a-year magazine division _ which publishes 19 titles in
the United States, including Cosmopolitan, Popular Mechanics and
Good Housekeeping _ has long been considered the most middle of the
road, least daring of the four major magazine companies, as
compared with the stylish Conde Nast, the mainstream but
news-oriented Time Inc. and the scrappy, growing Hachette
Filipacchi Magazines. This decision adds one ingredient advertisers
love: glamour. And at half-price.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Black has changed the company slowly; in three years, she
has fired or reassigned only a handful of publishers and editors.
(By contrast, when Steven T. Florio, the chief executive of Conde
Nast, was named publisher of the company, the magazine division of
Advance Publications, he made dozens of personnel changes in the
first months.) She has concentrated on rehabilitating the magazine
company's image among advertisers, who had grumbled loudly in 1995
when Hearst cut its magazines' guaranteed circulation rates. (The
decision prompted many big advertisers to slash their spending for
advertising in Hearst magazines.)
</P>
<P>
   She has maintained Cosmopolitan's status as a market leader,
despite high-level editorial changes, and it routinely pummels its
arch rival, Conde Nast's Glamour _ now edited by former
Cosmopolitan editor Bonnie Fuller _ at the newsstand, a success
that must be sweet for Ms. Black. In December _ in another
advertiser-oriented move _ she restructured the company's magazines
into two groups, in an attempt to encourage advertisers to buy
pages in several magazines at once, in effect offering package
deals.
</P>
<P>
   An extroverted and aggressive seller, Ms. Black is known for her
close ties to the advertising industry, and sits on the boards of
two of the country's largest advertisers, the Coca-Cola Corp &UR; . &LR;  and
IBM. She said that to woo advertisers, brand names like Dow Jones
and Miramax, a unit of the Walt Disney Co &UR; . &LR; , are essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do a joint venture with anybody,'' she said, ``we want
them to be major corporations. Apart from the consumer audience,
your advertiser audience is saying, `Gee, Dow Jones and Hearst,' or
`Gee, Miramax and Hearst are behind this,' then they know we're
putting a lot of resources and talent and energy behind the product
that an individual entrepreneur just doesn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Like her company, Ms. Black is frill-free. A self-described
Catholic school girl from Chicago, she started her career at
Holiday magazine, then moved to New York magazine, becoming
advertising manager of Ms. Magazine when it was founded by Gloria
Steinem in 1972. (``It was real lick-your-own-envelopes-at-midnight
work,'' she said.) She was named publisher of New York in 1979, but
made her mark at USA Today as publisher in the 1980s by smartening
it up in the eyes of advertisers wary of a newspaper nicknamed
``McPaper.'' In 1991, she became president of the Newspaper
Association of America and then moved to Hearst as president of the
magazine division in January 1996. (Her husband, Tom Harvey, is a
lawyer; they have two children, a dog, and a country house in
Connecticut.)
</P>
<P>
   Hearst is a privately held company, and Ms. Black will not
discuss numbers, even good ones, choosing instead to highlight the
successes of Smart Money and Cosmopolitan. In an effort to build on
Cosmopolitan's growth and the popularity of magazines for
teen-agers, Cosmopolitan plans to test a title aimed at teen-age
girls in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But onlookers say Hearst still is not sufficiently focused on
fresh editorial product. One advertising agency media director who
works with Hearst and spoke on the condition of anonymity said:
``Nothing's really happened since she's gotten there. At Conde
Nast, they love to toss the thing around. You get the sense that
they're constantly stirring the pot. At Hearst, it still feels
status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Fennell, the chief operating officer at Hachette
Filipacchi, who has worked with several editors who are now at
Hearst, said that Ms. Black had stepped into an insider culture.
``Hearst used to be a country-club, old-boy environment,'' Fennell
said. ``For Cathie to step in at the level she did and make the
changes she did, even if they are not enormous ones, was a dramatic
move.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Former Hearst editors say the company's culture is not directed
toward creative tinkering. ``At Conde Nast, editors are treated
like entertainment impresarios. At Hearst, they're expected to put
on green eyeshades and sign expense vouchers from the photo
department,'' said Randall Rothenberg, an editor at Wired, which is
owned by Conde Nast, and a former executive editor at Esquire,
which is owned by Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Black sees no conflict between the bottom line and
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an incredible group of lively, energetic, talented
editors here, who break new ground every day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Talk deal is a change of tactics for Hearst, it
signals a shift for the magazine industry in general as more
companies move toward joint ventures in a publishing economy that
feels increasingly unsure. Among other problems, magazine newsstand
sales are suffering. And editors worry about consumers who spend
more time surfing the World Wide Web than curling up with their
favorite magazine, a trend that is ominously called ``usage
erosion'' in the industry. The general interest category that Talk
is entering is already crowded, with advertisers increasingly drawn
to niche publications.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in this tenuous market there is only room for sure
things and joint ventures. Later this year, Smart Money will test
what could become yet another Hearst joint venture, a magazine
aimed at parents concerned with their children's financial futures.
</P>
<P>
   E. Daniel Capell, an authority on magazine circulation and the
editor of Capell's Circulation Report, said that joint ventures are
very appealing, especially to a company like Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearst has all these other arms available: subscription
fulfillment, distribution, circulation, so that makes it very easy
to do joint ventures,'' he said. ``The amount of money required to
launch a new magazine is so big and you have so much at risk, that
when you can split the risk it makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hearst had time to mull the deal, because the Talk team
approached both Time Inc., which is part of Time Warner Inc., and
Hachette Filipacchi, a unit of the Lagardere Group, first. But Time
executives balked because they believed that Ms. Brown had never
run a profitable magazine in the United States. At Hachette,
executives simply did not want to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   In an intriguing hint of that much-overused term, synergy, Talk
may be able to offer unprecedented package deals to advertisers,
because its other corporate parent is Disney's Miramax. Galotti has
said that advertised products may even get placement in Miramax
films. Say, for example, Prada buys 50 pages of ads, does that mean
that Gwyneth Paltrow will wear Prada loafers and tote a Prada
handbag in a Miramax film?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to help people market products to consumers
whatever way we can,'' Galotti said. ``If there's an opportunity to
work with them that way, then we will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hearst editors seem to bear no ill will against the new
venture and the $25 million Ms. Black will sink into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad she's made Hearst give her the resources to class
up the joint,'' said one Hearst editor, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity. ``And that's part of the reason she wanted Talk. She
has realized that there is an upside to pursuing glamorous things.
It gets advertisers excited.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, advertisers await their invitations to the
launch party, the all-important soiree at which guests are plied
with cocktails and enjoy solicitous bowing and scraping by the
publisher. Will it be held at the Four Seasons? Nobu? Or in London?
Will there be many supermodels in attendance? Galotti said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do something more low key,'' he said. ``How about a
cookout?''

QUESTIONS OF CHARACTER: THERE'S NO EGO AS WOUNDED AS A WOUNDED
ALTER EGO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (This is the first in an occasional series, ``Writers on Writing,''
in which American writers explore literary themes. In this column,
an alter ego exposes John Updike.) (DW) 
 By HENRY BECH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One _ not the only one _ of the spiritual burdens of being a New
Yorker is an undue reverence for The New York Times; when a minion
of that sacrosanct rag approached this above-signed ancient penman
and asked him to interview, not for the first time, a writer a tad
less ancient but inconveniently resident hundreds of miles up the
Atlantic Seaboard, I could not find it in my heart to say no. John
Updike was the name of my designated victim, on the slender but
penetrating excuse that he had chosen to perpetrate, in his
impudence and ignorance, a book ostensibly about me _ ``Bech at
Bay,'' five tales full of fantastic details concerning the
latter-day life of a Jewish-American prosist bearing my name.
</P>
<P>
   My traducer's lonely aerie was not easy to locate, though I had
been there once before, on a similar journalistic errand. North of
Boston, the landscape becomes a drab pudding of rocks and conifers,
of abandoned factories and clapboarded shacks boasting (the houses
wear wooden badges, with names and dates) of pre-Revolutionary
origins. The nondescript burg that gives Updike refuge lies, along
the tattered coast, one urban notch north of the second-rate port
where Hawthorne once spun his dismal witcheries.
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1835, as I recall, Hawthorne felt that the good times,
the majestic times, had gone by. And indeed today's autumnal air,
with its dutiful postcard splash of flaming maples, savored of the
mellowly bygone, of once-vital cultural impulses now subsided into
a wide spatter of mock-Georgian educational institutions and a
quaint liberalism that gives Massachusetts its all-Democrat
representation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Along a winding road that bisects a girls' college, past an iron
fence that once stood guard before the summer residence of Henry
Clay Frick, my nervous limo driver and I went; we traveled (if I
may, in so self-reflective a piece, quote from my earlier account)
``across some railroad tracks to what I presumed was the wrong
side, where, after a few divagations into the driveways of
indignant gentry, we eventually came upon the author, looking as
elderly and vexed as his neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite ``vexed'' this time, perhaps _ his step more hesitant,
his white hair skimpier, Updike greeted me with a fraternal
cordiality that I found, frankly, offensive. Though he lives, in
the manner of suburban princelings, surrounded by folilating
excrescences, I did not beat about the bush. Pulling out my
Zippo-size tape recorder, I asked him:
</P>
<P>
   Q. How could you have done this to me?
</P>
<P>
   A. This further book of your uproarious adventures? I love you,
Henry _ isn't that reason enough? You are the person I, once a
woeful country boy, wanted to be: a New York writer, up to his ears
in toxic fumes. But I came to the metropolis, inhaled, and fled.
What remains of that ignominious episode are the words ``New York''
on my elder son's birth certificate, and you. You have stayed the
course. I envy you. I envy you your city banter, your zaftig women,
your dignified ennui, your underground ability to tell uptown from
downtown and the express from the local. Me, aboard the subway, I
find myself hurtling toward Harlem when I want to get to Little
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. John, you aren't trying. You're taking a disingenuous delight
in this pose you have of being a hick. It excuses you from
shouldering the discontents of civilization, from delivering, if I
may say, the authentic depleted fin-de-siecle goods. Look at this
so-called ``Bech at Bay.'' You really think I go about murdering
people? You really think I could sleep with the Latina paralegal
assistant of my attorney in Los Angeles when I was being sued by
some quite implausibly loathsome talent agent? You think I go about
jumping on women like that?
</P>
<P>
   A. (ominously) People do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (brushing past the obvious hot topic) And this Jewishness you
give me. What do you know about being Jewish? Tres peu, I venture
to estimate. As much as you learned listening to the Jack Benny
program back in Shillington, Pa. Ask Cynthia Ozick. Ask Leon
Wieseltier. Ask Orlando Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   A. Cohen is my invention. Don't internalize your critics, Henry.
It's death to the creative spirit. It breeds fictional tirades.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You're no more Jewish than Henry Adams, and not near as funny
about it.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is my American right to give it a try, even in today's
strident climate of defensive diversity. To be a writer at all, it
seemed to me, is to be to some extent Jewish _ outsiderish but
chosen, condemned to live by your wits. Anyway, Henry, I don't see
you as a Jewish writer. I see you as a Jewish writer, all but
overwhelmed by the awesome possibilities of our trivialized
profession. Like the whisky priest in ``The Power and the Glory'' _
no matter how bad it gets, he can still put God in men's mouths. We
can still put truth in men's heads. We share that, yes? _ that
boyish awe?
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'll ask the questions, thanks. What I got out of your five
tales, skimming through the galleys on the shuttle _ a bumpy
flight, by the way, especially over Providence _ wasn't so much awe
as terminal discouragement. If this is the literary life, give me
le silence eternal de ces espaces infinis anytime.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's true, the life isn't what it seemed in the tweedy days
of Thornton Wilder and Bennett Cerf. And you reach an age when
every sentence you write bumps into one you wrote 30 years ago.
Each hard memory has only so many bits. Still, even into the
shadows one must walk with faith. The enterprise has ever been
thin, a mere dusting of words on the surface of the unsaid. That
silence you mention always hangs on the other side of the paper.
Still, in my limited experience, the barrel bottom remains moist,
there has invariably been one more thing to say. Last summer, for
me, you were it. I missed you. I missed New York. I had one
leftover story, about Czechoslovakia, that came too late for ``Bech
Is Back,'' and wrote some to go with it, to make a book, a
quasi-novel. You were my one more thing, and now, here we are, I am
yours.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (grudgingly) That's cute, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   A. Excuse me, I must trim some bushes.

MARKET PLACE :  DRAGON SYSTEMS GETS READY FOR MARKET

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dragon Systems, a developer of speech-recognition software in
Newton, Mass., that is scheduled to sell shares to the public
sometime in the next few weeks, is not your typical software
debutante. Its two fiftysomething founders can remember when
computers filled entire rooms, not just entire briefcases. It has
no debt, and real revenue. It even has profit.
</P>
<P>
   And it has very impressive products.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of full disclosure: Early in 1997, I was hit
with a mild but stubborn case of carpal tunnel syndrome that
continues to make long typing sessions painful. As a result, this
column (and everything else I have written over the last year, from
personal letters to a nearly finished book) was written with the
help of the company's Dragon Naturally Speaking software, which
converts words spoken conversationally into a computer's microphone
into words typed on the computer's screen. In fact, I now find it
so much faster to dictate an article than to type it that I would
continue to use Dragon's product even if typing were once again a
pain-free option.
</P>
<P>
   But great products do not always add up to great investments.
Ask folks who still have a Sony Betamax in the closet. And one
cannot gauge the success of an initial public offering by the
testimonials of injured journalists.
</P>
<P>
   What Dragon Systems has besides balance-sheet strength and good
products, is a young and extremely fluid market niche that it
already shares with big scary competitors like IBM, Royal Philips
Electronics NV and Microsoft. Microsoft alone could change the
rules by simply knitting speech technology into future versions of
its ubiquitous Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has already said it is planning to include speech
capabilities in Windows 2000,'' said Peter Fleming, an industry
consultant in Watertown, Mass., although he notes that such product
bundling could invite the same kind of government scrutiny that the
giant software maker is already facing in its antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, too, is ideally situated to bundle its speech programs into
its hardware, said Jackie Fenn, a vice president at the Gartner
Group, a research and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   And John Earle, president of Chant Inc., a speech-technology
software and services company in Marina del Rey, Calif., added,
``The risk, if that happens, is that no one will need a separate
application like Dragon's.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the founders of Dragon Systems had been reluctant
to face long odds, they might never have set out to turn an
ordinary personal computer into the modern equivalent of a 1950s
steno pool.
</P>
<P>
   Janet and James Baker, a married team of computer scientists,
started Dragon Systems in their living room in 1982, later telling
MIT's Technology Review magazine that they named it after the
pattern on their trousseau china. They met as graduate students at
Rockefeller University in New York in 1970 and have been working
together on speech technology ever since, including a stint at IBM
in the mid-70s.
</P>
<P>
   In Dragon's early years, Defense Department contracts and a
short-lived foray into personal computer applications kept the
company in the black, albeit on a shoestring. Then, in 1990, the
Bakers introduced Dragon Dictate, one of the first
large-vocabulary, general-purpose software products that could
convert spoken words into text on a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the words had to be separated by maddening little
pauses. And with a $9,000 price tag, the product was far from a
mass-market star.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hardly was any consumer market, in fact, beyond people
who were disabled and a few wealthy futurists, perhaps,'' Fleming,
the consultant, said.
</P>
<P>
   And at that point, Ms. Fenn explained, the early
voice-recognition programs from Dragon and a few competitors were
too awkward to be attractive to most corporate and institutional
customers, other than hospitals and law firms that valued the speed
of transcription enough to put up with the unnatural speech
required.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, IBM soon introduced its own program, Voice Type,
and other companies were not far behind. Suddenly, a new software
niche was up for grabs _ and it would belong, everyone knew, to the
first affordable software that could recognize natural,
conversational human speech, without the artificial pauses. That,
the scientists believed, would expand the market for speech
technology into all sorts of futuristic applications, like
telephones that dial themselves and videocassette recorders that
follow spoken instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts thought that dream was a decade away. But the
Bakers realized that the accelerating improvements in computer
speed and memory would put the prize within reach much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   While marketing new Dragon Dictate applications _ which by 1993
were generating annual revenue of $13.2 million and profit of $2.1
million _ the Bakers threw everything they had into the
continuous-speech sweepstakes. To help finance their effort, they
sold a stake of about 35 percent of the company to the computer
disk-drive maker Seagate Technology for $26.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The result, which Dragon introduced in April 1997, was Naturally
Speaking, a simple-to-use program that does indeed recognize
continuous human speech with remarkable speed and accuracy. The
product won numerous awards from trade publications including PC
World, Byte magazine and Popular Home Automation.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only then that the competition began in earnest. Even
as Naturally Speaking, with an initial retail price of $695, was
still taking its bows, IBM introduced its own lower-cost rival,
called Via Voice. Lernout &AMP; Hauspie followed with Voice Xpress. And
Philips aggressively continued to develop voice-driven corporate
applications, including the Swiss rail system's telephone
information line and Lufthansa's airline reservations system.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Dragon was forced to cut its price _ just when it was
struggling to gear up production and customer support services to
meet a tidal wave of consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some consultants in the field feared for the little company's
survival during the summer of 1997. But survive Dragon has,
improving its flagship program and introducing specialized
applications ranging from medical-transcription software _ tailored
to understand terms like ``nontransmural myocardial infarction'' _
to Naturally Speaking for Teens, which is tuned, for instance, to
know that ``Spice Girls'' should be capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The company's efforts have paid off.
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine months of 1998, Dragon's revenue nearly
doubled, to $49.6 million from $26.8 million in all of 1997. And
the losses generated by the high cost of racing for the
continuous-speech prize began to shrink in 1997, to $4.9 million
from $5.3 million the year before. In the first nine months of
1998, the red ink evaporated, and Dragon saw a profit of $8.6
million, of which $4 million came from continuing operations.
</P>
<P>
   A corner of the retail software market that supported sales of
just 12,253 units as recently as 1996 had sales of 773,520 units
last year, according to the market research firm PC Data. And fully
37 percent of that 1998 market belonged to Dragon.
</P>
<P>
   But the field has ``had a lot of false springs,'' said Brian
Lewis, the editor of Speech Technology magazine in Wilton, Conn.
Moreover, the future of speech technology is unlikely to revolve
just around freestanding personal computer applications like Dragon
Systems' _ if only because such programs are too vulnerable to the
Microsoft threat.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, said Judith Markowitz, an industry consultant in
Chicago, speech technology will grow by embedding itself into
products that the laptop generation uses every day _ phones,
automated teller machines, videocassette recorders, home and office
security systems and the like.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: Lernout &AMP; Hauspie and Microsoft, an investor in
L&AMP; H, teamed up on the software that runs Clarion Corp.'s Auto PC,
a dashboard-mounted personal assistant that responds to spoken
commands.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's underwriter for its proposed stock sale is Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. With Baker now serving as chairman of
Dragon's technical advisory board, the management team is led by
Ms. Baker, as chief executive, and the president, John Shagoury.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary prospectus reports that the company is already
at work on the alliances necessary to embed Dragon's technology
into the postcomputer future. These include recently announced
pacts with Intel and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon also says it is poised to exploit the trend toward
smaller, lighter computerized devices. A laptop equipped with
voice-recognition software doesn't need a large, comfortable
keyboard. And if the speech technology is good enough, it doesn't
need a keyboard at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Bakers and Seagate Technology together will retain a
controlling interest in Dragon Systems. But the future minority
investors _ members of the public _ would be betting that this
little company's speech technology will be good enough, either on
its own or in partnership with one of the industry giants like Sun
Microsystems or Intel _ or maybe even Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, though, that the little Dragon is definitely
dancing with the elephants here. If it catches the rhythm, it could
be a star act. One misstep, and it will be a design on the carpet.

<P>
   In Los Angeles, the Century Plaza Hotel and Tower has renamed
its 30th floor the  &UR; Ronald Reagan &LR;  Suite, and you can drop on in

selected memorabilia and knickknacks to convey the greatness of the
former president. Among the suite's amenities:
</P>
<P>
   Bullet-proof glass windows; a library of Reagan-connected books,
including ``The Uncommon Wisdom of Ronald Reagan''; a video library
that includes ``Bedtime for Bonzo'' and ``Brother Rat''; and a jar

 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Norman Podhoretz is not one of my ex-friends. Over
the years, in many wide-ranging conversations, we have not had any
stormy arguments. Though I have written for Commentary, which he
edited for 35 years, I never pulled a piece from the magazine in
outrage. I have never attacked him in print or conversation. We
have never wrestled over issues involving anti-Communism,
anti-anti-Communism or anti-anti-anti- Communism. We don't avoid
each other at parties.
</P>
<P>
   But this shows the serious limits of our friendship because
there are probably few friends of his who have not engaged in some
of these activities, which makes them very similar to some of the
ex-friends he describes in his new memoir, ``Ex-Friends'' (Free
Press). So hotly contested is he as a political and intellectual
figure that simply the declaration of friendship or ex-friendship
with him has tended to be viewed in some circles as a declaration
of war.
</P>
<P>
   I mention all this because something has changed about the
nature of friendship on the intellectual scene during the last 30
years. Friendship now tends to be less fractious and enmity more
ruthless. Podhoretz focuses in his book on the ways in which his
positions on various issues in the 1960s and 70s caused tensions
with such friends as Norman Mailer, Hannah Arendt, Lillian Hellman
and Lionel and Diana Trilling. He even describes how opposition
could lead to a peculiar form of closeness, as when he served as a
nemesis to Allen Ginsberg.
</P>
<P>
   But all these relationships were formed in an intellectual and
cultural universe far different from the one in which we now dwell.
They involved the close-knit group of intellectuals that gathered
around such publications as Commentary and Partisan Review in the
decades before the 1960s counterculture hit its stride. Murray
Kempton called that group the Family; Podhoretz made the term
common parlance. The Family, though, was itself riven with
controversies and jealousies. At old Family parties, Podhoretz
points out, one of the passions was for ``gossiping with the
wittiest possible malice about anyone who had the misfortune not to
be present or to be out of earshot in another part of the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Enmities may have been more extreme versions of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   That was part of the Family romance. I would guess that nearly
every intellectual who began to come of age in the 1970s read
Podhoretz's 1967 autobiography, ``Making It,'' assuming that, in
some way, the harsh self-critical glare of Family life lay waiting
in the wings. But by then, as Podhoretz points out, the Family was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the varied intellectual circles I occasionally sample,
friendship is far less aggressive and enmity far more absolute.
Circles of acquaintance seem circumscribed by shared premises about
culture and politics. Internal disagreements tend to be muted;
premises are taken for granted; a sense of beleaguered opposition
to external forces is common.
</P>
<P>
   This is not completely new, of course. There were lines in the
sand in earlier eras. Podhoretz, for example, was surprised to meet
Lillian Hellman at a party at Lionel and Diana Trillings', because
Hellman had been Stalinist in her views and the Trillings were
liberal anti-Communists. I doubt whether many of the group
Podhoretz calls ``country club Republicans'' ever showed up at the
left-leaning Family gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   But within the Family the range of disagreement was often
startlingly combative. Not even Philip Rahv and William Phillips,
the editors of Partisan Review, could be counted on to be in
alignment. Podhoretz's writings from the late 1950s embodied
opposing trends in themselves. His first book of literary
criticism, ``Doings and Undoings,'' for example, contains traces of
radicalism (urging Saul Bellow, for example, to start to take on
the ``institutions'' of American life) as well as conservatism
(attacking, for instance, the low intellectual standards of the
``Beat'' writers and ``their poisonous glorification of the
adolescent in American popular culture'').
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Family began to break apart in the late 1960s,
there was still an extraordinary assemblage of disparate figures
finding common cause in the pages of Commentary, ranging from
Irving Howe and Paul Goodman to Irving Kristol and Hilton Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to this contentious assemblage?
</P>
<P>
   Many suggestions have been offered in recent years: The change
in the nature of political confrontation in the 1960s, the leftward
movement of liberalism, the rightward movement of neo-conservatism.
Podhoretz adds another: Family members needed one another. They saw
themselves as more brilliant, more subtle, more visionary than the
American populace, government politicians or university scholars.
``Who else,'' Podhoretz writes, ``could properly understand the
things they were writing and saying and the ways in which they were
writing and saying them?''
</P>
<P>
   But after the late 1960s they no longer wrote solely for one
another. They dreamed of wider influence. Academe became more
powerful. ``Policy'' intellectuals eventually settled into
Washington, and higher fees were offered by magazines like The New
Yorker or even Vanity Fair. There was a vast assimilation of Family
life into American culture.
</P>
<P>
   This weakened clan allegiance, but for some time a unifying
sentiment remained. Lionel Trilling called it ``adversarial'' and,
when not directed at American power, it tended to be opposed to the
American middle-class and middle-brow culture.
</P>
<P>
   Podhoretz suggests that ``Making It'' inspired such animus among
Family members because it was an assault on one of their core
notions. It celebrated the bourgeois aspects of intellectual life _
ambition for success, fame, power _ and the values that
intellectuals and the wider liberal culture considered vulgar and
demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   But over time even scorn of the middle class became one of the
defining characteristics of the middle class. Meanwhile the idea of
middle brow weakened under the impact of popular culture. In the
1950s most intellectuals shared a devotion to the highest
achievements of art, music and literature; in the 1980s many
writers were arguing that such distinctions had little meaning.
</P>
<P>
   So the social and intellectual bonds loosened. At the same time,
the life-and-death issues that define Family life metastasized.
Compare the three or four decisive responses to Communism in the
1950s with the opposing positions that began to multiply in the
1960s over race, culture and foreign policy. One of the most
divisive issues now among intellectuals may be whether one agrees
with Podhoretz about the existence of a ``regnant leftist culture''
and its effects.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate it is now far more comfortable to use premises to
define friendships than to use friendships to explore premises. We
have a Balkanized politics to match our Balkanized culture. So
friendships become more like alliances and enmity makes argument
seem futile. Podhoretz is elegiac, missing the Family and honoring
it, despite its errors and frenzies. I never knew Family life, but
I'm not about to disagree.

   What's the difference between reading a newspaper or magazine on
the Internet or in print? The articles tend to be the same in both
versions, and aside from saving a few dollars, the only real
difference is that one can be read on the subway and the other
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   But this is beginning to change. The number of articles written
exclusively for Web sites of newspapers and magazines is growing,
according to a study to be released Tuesday by Middleburg &AMP;
Associates, a public relations and marketing agency.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth annual Media in Cyberspace Study was based on a survey
sent to managing and business editors at 1,400 newspapers and 2,000
magazines last fall and completed by 192 newspaper editors and 170
magazine editors. The study focuses on two aspects of the
relationship between the print media and cyberspace: the elevation
of newspaper and magazine Web sites to the status of full partner
with their print counterparts and the willingness of journalists to
use the Internet to find sources and to use e-mail to get
information from them.
</P>
<P>
   The study reports that the growth in Web sites over the last
four years has been sharp. In the 1995 study, 25 percent of
respondents said that their publications had a Web site; in 1998,
that figure had more than doubled, to 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And as the number of Web sites has proliferated, the amount of
original material on the sites has grown as well. Only 11 percent
of respondents who worked at magazines with Web sites said that the
sites had less than 5 percent original content, down from 27
percent in 1997. Newspaper respondents reported a drop to 22
percent from 39 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``News organizations have clearly broken away from the trend to
use Web sites solely as a delivery tool,'' said Don Middleburg,
chairman and chief executive at Middleburg, who was co-author of
the study with Steven R. Ross, associate professor of professional
practice at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
``They've begun treating them as a new medium.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the growing use of multimedia elements _ mainly audio
and video recordings _ on Web sites as the prime example of this;
nearly a third of the respondents said that their publications
integrate multimedia material into Web articles.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists working at these publications are also making a
greater use of the Internet. A majority said the most important
information they find on it is contact information. But once they
have that information, journalists are still relying on
old-fashioned methods for evaluating the trustworthiness of
sources; most of the respondents said they would rather see the
face or at least hear the voice of a new source before exchanging
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   After that initial meeting though, many preferred e-mail to a
phone call or lunch date.

   Praise From `60 Minutes'
</P>
<P>
   Last March, the CBS News program ``60 Minutes'' attracted a
burst of attention with an interview in which Kathleen Willey, a
former White House volunteer, accused President Clinton of making
unwelcome sexual advances toward her in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, ``60 Minutes'' drew volleys of criticism for not
checking Ms. Willey's background thoroughly enough, as other news
organizations reported inconsistencies in her various accounts,
along with reports that she had been pursuing a book deal.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months later, NBC News had an exclusive interview in
which Juanita Broaddrick, a former Arkansas campaign volunteer,
accused Clinton of unwanted sexual advances _ indeed, of rape _ 21
years earlier. In this case, the TV network attracted criticism
from some quarters for ``suppressing'' the interview, as NBC brass
spent weeks double-checking Mrs. Broaddrick's account.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, ``Dateline NBC'' executives did not want a Kathleen
Willey-type boomerang flying back in their faces. Even after the
interview ran last Wednesday night, some critics said Mrs.
Broaddrick's uncorroborated, 21-year-old account and her motives
for disliking President Clinton were such that it should not have
been broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Don Hewitt, the executive producer of ``60
Minutes,'' who ordinarily criticizes the standards of ``Dateline''
at the drop of a hat, think this time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `Dateline' did a very creditable job,'' he said.
``They checked it out, and they put in the caveats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she telling truth?'' he added. ``I don't know. If I didn't
know his track record for wagging a finger at the American people
and lying to them on national television, I might have taken what
she said with a grain of salt. But as it is, I agree with Patricia
Ireland: If it's a `he says, she says' story, he ain't got a very
good track record on that subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ireland, the president of the National Organization of
Women, made a statement along those lines Thursday, when asked
about Mrs. Broaddrick's story.
</P>
<P>
   In both the Willey and Broaddrick cases, President Clinton
issued statements denying the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Considering his praise for NBC's due diligence in checking its
story, did Hewitt have second thoughts about his own handling of
the Willey interview? He said he had ``no regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All Kathleen Willey said to Ed Bradley was exactly what she
had told a grand jury under oath,'' he said.

A NEW OFFENSIVE IN BRITAIN'S WAR OF WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Are interviewers on British television and radio
programs too rude? Are British newspapers too obsessed with trivia?
Are reporters irresponsible scandal-mongers who overlook important
policy questions?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, would be the answer if you asked the Labor government,
which has had an extraordinarily rocky relationship with the news
media here since it came to power on a tidal wave of good will
nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the government's complaints are the same as those
frequently leveled against the American press. But in Britain,
where there is no sense of open government or of the public's right
to know, the government has had little compunction about openly
attacking the news media when it does not like the way it is being
covered.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, relations between the two sides took a turn for
the worse when The Sunday Telegraph published an article about a
leaked government-sponsored report on racism and the police.
Furious that his carefully laid plans to release the report in its
own time had been so badly thwarted, the home secretary, Jack
Straw, persuaded a judge to issue an injunction forcing the
newspaper _ which had already printed and shipped off some 290,000
early edition copies _ to remove the article from later editions.
Though Straw was forced, embarrassingly, to back down the next day,
the move stirred up the ire of the news media yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Straw's reaction was not unusual in a country where there is no
American-style tradition of freedom of the press, and where the
judiciary is temperamentally inclined to support the government in
disputes with the news media. And it was not a surprise, said
reporters and editors, who have become used to the Labor
government's efforts to manage the news and to its reluctance to
pursue media-friendly legislation it once supported, like a freedom
of information bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are an extremely controlling bunch,'' said Alan
Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian, a liberal-leaning
newspaper. ``They are adept at manipulating the press, so when
something like this happens, their reaction is to suppress and
control. They went right over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   How did things get to this point?
</P>
<P>
   Elected by an overwhelming majority in 1997, the Labor Party
soon seemed to squander much of its built-in advantage with the
news media, pursuing a series of highly public disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were particularly irked by what they saw as rough
treatment from BBC interviewers, who tend to be far more combative
and aggressive than their American counterparts. In 1997, for
instance, the Labor Party protested after Harriet Harman, then the
social security secretary, underwent a particularly rough interview
on the ``Today'' radio program.
</P>
<P>
   In a discussion of government proposals to cut welfare benefits
to single mothers, John Humphrys, the program's take-no-prisoners
interviewer, asked the same question 13 times in an increasingly
irritated way. Afterward, the party's chief media spokesman, David
Hill, complained bitterly about ``the John Humphrys problem'' and
threatened to withdraw the party's cooperation from ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John Humphrys interrupted so much that she was never permitted
to develop a single answer,'' Hill said. The BBC responded that one
of Ms. Harman's answers had, in fact, lasted a full minute, and
argued that Humphrys was simply ``seeking a direct answer to a
simple question'' about benefit cuts. ``I thought the encounter
demonstrated John's characteristic strengths,'' said Jon Barton,
the editor of ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight took another turn last summer, when Alastair Campbell,
the government's chief spokesman, attacked the notion that Labor
officials seem reluctant to submit to radio and television
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Most government officials, Campbell said, hate the way they are
treated by BBC interviewers like Jeremy Paxman, one of the hosts of
``Newsnight,'' a late-night show that is similar to ABC's
``Nightline.'' Paxman, who has a biting intellect and a
super-confident manner that many feel borders on arrogance, is
known for his ability to ``kebab'' guests when they dodge or
waffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``As one minister said to me recently when I tried to get him to
appear on the program, `What is the point of traipsing out late at
night so that Jeremy can try to persuade the public that I'm
actually some kind of criminal?' '' Campbell said in a letter to
The Times of London.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But many journalists say that in the absence of a strong
Conservative Party _ Tony Blair, the prime minister, holds an
overwhelming majority in Parliament and is subject to very little
in the way of serious opposition _ it is up to the news media to
ask the tough questions. ``There are two sides to every story, and
no one has a monopoly on the truth,'' Paxman said. ``There are
those in government who cannot see the need to explain themselves
to the public. You can see their point. `What's in it for me?' as
one minister put it to me when I suggested he might like to explain
a policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Campbell went on the attack again. In a
speech in London, he denounced what he called the news media's
tendency to report on ``scandal, gossip, personality clashes, the
price of a Concorde trip'' at the expense of things like jobs,
transportation policy and education.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their disillusionment at the failure of the BBC ``to
let democratic politicians speak for themselves,'' Campbell said,
government officials were more likely to appear on ``soft''
interview shows and to bypass the usual media outlets for things
like regional newspapers and ``the women's media.''
</P>
<P>
   The mainstream news media were not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop trying to tell us how to do our jobs,'' Humphrys, the
``Today'' host, said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Rawnsley, a political columnist for The Observer of
London, said that in Campbell's dream world, there would be ``one
television channel, one newspaper and one radio station'' _ all run
by the government.

 &HT;    Term limits set to rattle politics in Florida
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Tuesday, March 6, 2001, some are convinced,
is the day Florida politics goes to the dogs: decency and
statesmanship disappear, with all power shifting to unelected staff
and hired-gun lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   No, others argue with equal passion, the morning of March 6 will
bring a breath of fresh air, an end to a system that rewarded
mediocrity and staying power over talent and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever side is correct, one thing is certain. March 6, the
first day of that term's new legislative session, will bring a new
face to Florida politics: at least 54 new faces in a House of 120
members, at least 11 freshmen in the 40-member Senate, as ``term
limits,'' the overwhelming will of Florida's electorate, finally
take their toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock strikes 12 and everybody goes home,'' said
Jacksonville's Jim King, who recently left a House seat doomed to
expire in another year to jump at a newly opened spot in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   King's departure is only slightly ahead of the wave, as six
dozen of his colleagues likewise must choose between finding
another position to run for or retiring from politics altogether.
Indeed, over the next decade, term limits will sweep both chambers
clean of every single member currently there.
</P>
<P>
   And as senior members go, so will the level of seniority. In
past years the elder members of each chamber typically have served
16, 18, even 20 years. Starting in 2001, the most senior House
members will have served but six.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, with its staggered four-year terms in districts
redrawn every decade, will always have half its members permitted
to serve a total of 10 years. And members elected in out-of-cycle
special elections will likewise be eligible to serve just under 10
years in the House and just under 12 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Those exceptions notwithstanding, the reduction in seniority in
both chambers is dramatic. Seniority of the average House member
will drop from 4.9 years this year to _ if all eligible incumbents
run and win; historically, not a bad assumption _ 1.9 years. In the
Senate, the number drops from 6.5 years to 3.8.
</P>
<P>
   Not all ``term-limited'' legislators, of course, are willing to
step down so easily. A pair of perennial senators, Gainesville's
George Kirkpatrick and Quincy's Pat Thomas, as well as two-term
colleague Jim Hargrett, of Tampa, hope to overturn the
constitutional amendment through a lawsuit filed by some of their
constituents. Oral arguments before the Florida Supreme Court are
scheduled for early this summer, with a decision expected this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Sen. Jim Scott, R-Fort Lauderdale, plan to raise
money and have made it plain to those who would replace them that
they aren't giving up just yet, in case the court should rule in
their favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think eight years is not enough time for someone to come up,
learn the process and leave,'' Scott said, adding that many of his
constituents are urging him to try and stay.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature's longest serving member, Sen. W.D. Childers,
R-Pensacola, said he isn't waiting on the court for anything. He's
definitely running: as a write-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they got to do is write `W.D.' It's like a literacy
test,'' Childers said. ``If they can't do that, I don't need their
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding those few hoping to undo or outmaneuver the 1992
mandate, though, most legislators have come to accept the notion of
leaving whatever office they currently hold and planning for their
next.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings about another interesting side effect of limiting
lawmakers' and Cabinet members' terms: The intense competition
among legislators for an ever fewer number of seats available at
the next level.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Dudley, two years away from being forced from his Fort
Myers Senate seat, decided to try to knock off incumbent Attorney
General Bob Butterworth. Two fellow Republican House members fought
to replace him. Sen. Burt Saunders won; former House member Ralph
Livingston is out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Pruitt and Rep. Sharon Merchant, also both Republicans,
are also both campaigning hard for the seat held by Sen. William
``Doc'' Myers, R-Hobe Sound. King even abandoned the coveted
chairmanship of the House budget committee to run for the vacated
Senate seat of Bill Bankhead rather than sit out two years and run
against an incumbent for it in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The departing members take with them their institutional
knowledge, the years of seeing why some approaches to things work
while others do not. ``Knowing how to get something done is as
important, almost, as knowing what's a good thing to get done,''
said King, who was and is, nonetheless, a term-limits supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a society without any grandparents,''
complained term-limit opponent Rep. Lois Frankel, a West Palm Beach
Democrat who, thanks to a gap in her 10 years in the House, will be
spared the term limit ax for two more years. ``It's very scary.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that argument that ``good government'' groups like the
League of Women Voters and Common Cause unsuccessfully used against
the measure in 1992. Big contributors who provide the bulk of
campaign money will figure even more prominently in determining who
among a host of inexperienced candidates will win, said Common
Cause of Florida director Sally Spener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special interest groups will be able to pick the next guy, or
gal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More important, she said, whatever power given up long-serving
legislators will most likely devolve to the legislative staff and
the lobbying corps.
</P>
<P>
   Term-limit supporters counter simply by pointing to how the
legislature works today: Lobbyists already write most bills and
most amendments, with staff performing the analyses and legislators
most of the time voting on bills and amendments that they have
never read.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Warner, who will quit his House seat this summer for a
job in Butterworth's office rather than be forced out the following
fall, remembers when he came to the House in 1992. ``Health-care
lobbyists were writing all the health-care bills, with staff,'' he
said. ``Members weren't writing those bills. It's up to the members
to pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Feeney, the first likely beneficiary of term limits,
said Warner is right, to a degree, but thinks term-limit opponents
do make a point, particularly on complicated legislation involving
telecommunications or insurance. ``There'll be fewer legislators
able to know what a lobbyist is up to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Feeney, who interrupted his legislative service for two years in
1994 to become Jeb Bush's running mate in his first run for
governor, is likely to become the first House speaker in the term
limit era. Had he not left the chamber five years ago, he, like
nearly half of his colleagues, would have been forced to retire in
2000. Yet his four years of experience prior to leaving give him an
advantage seeking the speakership over those elected for the first
time in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He said the chamber's leadership cadre will potentially suffer
the most under term limits. Where under the old system would-be
speakers and budget chairman had many terms to develop the
expertise and friendships to work with a large, diverse body, the
new era will give House members only six years before they take the
reins. The likely Republican candidate for speaker in 2002, Plant
City Rep. Johnnie Byrd, came to the House just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Senate, which traditionally has been
filled with former House members, will probably continue in that
regard, so that many if not most new senators will have six or
eight years of experience in the House, Feeney said.
</P>
<P>
   The ascension of Byrd and Feeney, of course, presumes that
Republican control of the House, now a comfortable 73-47 majority,
will be able to survive an election with at least 54 open seats _
traditionally seen as wild cards.
</P>
<P>
   And it is that potential for suddenly and radically
reapportioning the balance of power that Frankel, who would become
speaker should her Democrats win back 14 seats next year, sees as
term limits' only saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Term limits are terrible, unless of course they let the
Democrats come back to power,'' she quipped. ``In that case, I
think they're great.''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: EXPLOITING _ AND PROTECTING _ PERSONAL
INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., S.C., Fla., Colo., N.H., Va.) (lh) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last few weeks, the data privacy battle has been waged
with such fury that privacy advocates have not known whether to
cry, cheer or simply assume the fetal position.
</P>
<P>
   Personal privacy _ the disposition of all those pieces of
information that computers hold about each of us _ has been debated
in the electronic world for almost two decades. Although the issues
are complex, the bottom lines have always been pretty clearly
drawn.
</P>
<P>
   People and companies that sell personal data want to be able to
collect and distribute it pretty much with abandon, and they fight
like cornered weasels at even the suggestion of government
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, most people online _ 87 percent in a 1997 Georgia Tech
survey _ want ``complete control'' over their personal data. And if
they feel violated by data collectors, they often scream bloody
murder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, for example, Lotus Corp. was forced to cancel shipments
of Marketplace, a CD-ROM data base, after receiving thousands of
angry e-pistles from people who took grievous offense at the data
base's content: the names, addresses, income levels, numbers of
children and other data for every household in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, privacy advocates wrested a partial victory from
Intel Corp., after the company announced that its new Pentium III
chips contained embedded electronic serial numbers for
authenticating documents, e-mail and copyrighted material.
Watchdogs warned that the numbers could be used to identify a
computer to prying software, or to allow companies or agencies to
track a person's movements across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Intel refused to remove the number, but agreed to provide
software that allows computer makers to hide it behind a digital
fig leaf.
</P>
<P>
   And the California Legislature, often a bellwether for
technology issues, is considering more than a dozen privacy laws,
including one that would restrict the collection and disclosure of
personal information by government, business or nonprofit
organizations. It specifically includes information gathered via
Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Still, plenty of others are rushing to cash in on the data gold
rush.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates were extremely cranky after discovering that
Florida, South Carolina and Colorado were selling residents'
driver's license information to a New Hampshire-based company,
Image Data LLC.
</P>
<P>
   They were even more outraged to discover that the Secret Service
had financed another private company's efforts to develop a
national data base of driver's license photographs.
</P>
<P>
   And in the most telling testament yet to the commercial value of
personal data in the Internet economy, a start-up called Free PC
announced that it would provide a free Internet connection and a
free Compaq computer to anyone willing to ``apply'' by answering a
detailed questionnaire and then accepting constant bombardment by
advertisers based on the personal profile created from the
questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Le Furgy, chairman of the Internet Advertising Bureau, an
industry group, said that advertisers haven't even begun to tap the
Internet's potential. They are now investigating how to aim
promotions at individual consumers based on their online behavior:
Vendors want to co-market products in much the same way that
convenience stores did after discovering, for example, that people
who buy beer often buy diapers at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   That is not exactly music to the ears of a privacy-sensitive
consumer. Obviously, online advertising organizations find
themselves straddling a very pointy fence between companies that
pay for advertising and customers who are subjected to that
advertising. The constituencies have very different viewpoints, and
finding a solution palatable to both is not a task for the
squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Le Furgy said, ``it would be a beautiful thing''
for consumers to control their personal data _ especially if it
meant avoiding legislation and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy is an enabler of commerce,'' he said. If consumers can
get money for their personal information and still control it,
``they'll be much more willing to provide it.''

<P>
   In fact, a new breed of Internet company is already making a
business of that concept.
</P>
<P>
   These companies, known as infomediaries _ a term coined by John
Hagel, co-author of ``Net Worth: Shaping Markets When Customers
Make the Rules'' (Harvard Business School Press, 1999) _ will step
in and help consumers regain control of their personal data.
</P>
<P>
   For a price, of course.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Wired News feature predicts that a coming pack of these
entrepreneurs will ``cut the consumer in'' on the deal when
information about them is bought and sold. Infomediaries keep a
percentage for themselves for providing the security mechanisms by
which consumers can control exactly who buys their personal data
and for what purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But some privacy advocates would eliminate even the infomediary
and pass laws granting consumers not just civil rights to their
privacy, but property rights to their private data, ending the
free-market eminent domain that data marketers have exploited for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a Virginia law that forbids the use of anyone's name or
likeness without permission, Ram Avrahami unsuccessfully sued U.S.
News &AMP; World Report in 1996 for selling his name to another
magazine. At the time, Avrahami's opponents ridiculed him for suing
over 8 cents, which is what the magazine had paid for his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is this: It's 8 cents for me, for you, for 100
million other Americans, which becomes big money,'' said Avrahami,
who has since become a leading advocate of private data ownership.
``Think of it this way: Free PC proves that our personal
information is worth hundreds of dollars. Now, who should get those
dollars, if not us?''

NEW DATA PIPELINE HOLDS PROMISE OF A BETTER INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Colo.)  (lh) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The promise of a super-fast, highly reliable
Internet moved a step closer to reality last week when three dozen
universities across the United States were linked to a new national
research network that moves data 1,600 times faster than the T-1
lines that universities and businesses use today.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of the new data pipeline, known as the Abilene
Network, were highlighted Wednesday night in a ceremony at
Washington's Union Station that included a demonstration of remote
surgery in which doctors collaborated over the network while
hundreds of miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to telemedicine, applications that require huge data
pipelines include interactive distance learning, digital libraries,
multimedia entertainment and even tornado forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between motion pictures and flipping
through the pages of a book,'' said Guy K. Cook, vice president of
Internet services for Qwest Communications of Denver, one of the
companies that helped develop the network.
</P>
<P>
   Spanning more than 10,000 miles, the $500 million Abilene
Network links 37 universities at 2.4 billion bits, or gigabits, per
second. One of a half dozen next-generation Internet networks
developed by the privately financed Internet 2 consortium and the
federal government in recent years, Abilene is faster than all but
a few highly experimental government networks. By the end of 1999,
it is expected to link more than 60 research institutions.
</P>
<P>
   For now, access to Abilene is limited to academics and other
professionals, but experts believe that consumers will begin
realizing its benefits in a few years. Professional and research
applications demonstrated Wednesday night will open the way for
technologies that will, for example, enable home computer users to
rent and view films online.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important long-term impact is the promise of a
thoroughly reliable Internet, said Douglas Van Houweling of the
University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development, which
oversees Internet 2 projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, since the Internet is a best-effort network, you
can't be sure when you log on and use it whether or not it's going
to work very well,'' he said. ``If the Internet is going to fulfill
its promises for the future, you have to be able to count on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Named after a seminal railroad founded in the 1860s, the Abilene
Network was developed with a total investment of $500 million in
equipment and services from Qwest, Cisco Systems Inc., Nortel
Networks and Indiana University.

UKRAINE JOURNAL: TOUGH TIMES AND BRIBES KEEP SMUGGLERS IN
BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAVA-RUSKAYA, Ukraine _ When Andrei needs a few things from the
market _ and he always needs a few things from the market _ he does
what a lot of people around here do: He climbs into the car and
drives to Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Once across the border, he drops by a few wholesalers and farms,
buys as much butter, milk and fat as he reasonably can, and stuffs
it all out of sight, under the back seat and in the trunk. On the
way back, he stops at the Ukrainian border and slips the guard a
few hundred hryvnias. Then he drives carefully home so as not to
attract the police, who tend to want a few hundred hryvnias of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   All that, and he does not even get to eat the food. ``I'm a
middleman,'' he said the other day, huddling in the front seat of
his car, chain-smoking nervously. ``I don't go for big business,
and I don't carry much. I get less profit, but I think in our
situation, the slower you go, the more success you have.''
</P>
<P>
   When the going gets tough, the cliche goes, the tough go
shopping. Things in Rava-Ruskaya are awfully tough. The economy is
depressed; unemployment is endemic and the town, a one-stoplight
sort of place with a few aging storefronts and a two-lane main
street, seems to have but one thing going for it: It is 3{ miles
from much wealthier Poland.
</P>
<P>
   And so it has become not just a smuggler's den, but a smuggler's
kitchen, bedroom, garage and driveway. The main street is littered
with minivans, small diesel trucks and, oddly enough, used British
postal trucks, all preferred vehicles for hauling goods across the
border. The bar attracts passing traffickers; the local grocery is
laden with tins of Polish sprats, Polish canned meat and Polish
sausages.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from town, enterprising folks have converted a couple of
empty buildings into warehouses _ transshipment points for the tons
of food, household cleaners, electronics and other sought-after
items that cross the border daily.
</P>
<P>
   The goods flood in for one reason only: They are cheaper in
Poland and can be resold to Ukrainians at a huge profit. They are
especially cheap if nobody pays the sky-high duties that the
Ukrainian government has imposed on many goods to protect domestic
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   That is the basis for what officials politely call the ``shuttle
trade,'' much of it aboveboard and legal, but a healthy share also
solidly rooted in bribery and stealth.
</P>
<P>
   The business is not confined just to Poland. The Ukrainian
government estimates that shuttle trade accounted for more than 11
percent of all imports in 1997 _ perhaps $2 billion. A survey last
October by the firm Socis-Gallup International concluded that about
one in 35 adults is a shuttle trader, carrying on brisk commerce
with Russia, Hungary and even Turkey, across the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But along Ukraine's depressed western border, the share of
shuttle traders is dramatically higher, partly because there are so
few other jobs and partly because it is so lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Some smuggled Polish products sell for as little in Ukraine as
half the price of identical Ukrainian versions. U.S.
consumer-products giants like Procter &AMP; Gamble and S.C. Johnson,
which have factories in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe, have
complained loudly that they are competing against themselves here _
and losing.
</P>
<P>
   For Andrei, who not only refused to give his last name, but also
refused to confirm that Andrei is really his first, smuggling is
about the only way to exercise the skills he gained in the 1980s at
the Cooperative Teknikum in nearby Lviv.
</P>
<P>
   There, he said, he earned the Ukrainian equivalent of an MBA,
but could find no better job than assistant manager at a pizza
parlor. With a small family to support, that was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have continued my work there, but I wasn't satisfied
with my salary,'' he said. ``I calculated that I'd be able to earn
more money by myself.'' He has. These days, he said, he makes a
daily run to Poland _ usually for food that can be easily resold to
the hordes of sidewalk vendors in cities like Lviv, but from time
to time for stereos, televisions and even the occasional
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Asked directly how he manages to get such booty back over the
Ukrainian border, Andrei was almost comically circumspect. ``Take
margarine: to bring in 200 kilograms,'' _ about 440 pounds _ ``one
has to pay $1,100 in customs taxes,'' he said. ``People look for
opportunities to carry things, not paying taxes _ somehow to hide,
to agree with the customs officers that it can come through.'' But
doesn't that require a bribe? ``I wouldn't like to talk about
that,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Others do, however. Under Ukraine's customs regimen, anyone can
bring a small amount of food or other goods into the country _
about $75 worth _ and pay a minimal duty. Above that, the fee
skyrockets. Trying to clamp down on the shuttle trade, the
government doubled and even tripled duties on more than 600
consumer products last April.
</P>
<P>
   That cut into cross-border business, but at the cost of making
bribery an even more attractive option for traders and customs
officers alike. These days, a gratuity to a customs officer runs
from $10 for a small-time trader like Andrei to $2,000 for one of
the tractor-trailer loads of goods brought in by organized gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the state customs service fired one in every 13 of
its 17,000 customs officers for violations, mostly involving
bribery and abuse of power. City police at the port of Odessa,
another major smuggling center, arrested one customs officer last
fall who was found to have $523 U.S. dollars and a ``substantial
amount'' of Ukrainian currency in his pockets. The officer had been
arrested just after lunch; most of his working day lay before him.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the take from bribery is said to flow up the chain of
command. Only last November, German police arrested the director of
customs operations for half the Poland-Ukraine border as he was
withdrawing more than $1.1 million in German marks from a German
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Gen. Oleksiy Chernyshov, was allegedly part of a
smuggling ring that traded alcohol and cigarettes. How the general
managed to rise from third-class adviser, at two customs
checkpoints, to head of the region in the space of several months
is yet to be explained.
</P>
<P>
   The government, aware that bribery is costing it hundreds of
millions of dollars in lost tax revenues, is trying to break the
links between customs officers and traders. Customs officers are
rotated periodically to new posts to discourage familiarity with
the people they inspect. Recently, the person in charge of the
checkpoint near Rava-Ruskaya was moved to another town, leaving
traders to wonder whether a crackdown is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is. For now, Andrei is a fairly accurate barometer of
how the traders are faring. ``Look,'' he said, a trace of pride in
his voice. ``I've got a new car.''

 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGOLA, La. _ By any measure, Wilbert Rideau has compiled an
impressive resume during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist and editor, he has been honored with some of the
profession's most coveted prizes, including the George Polk Award
and the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award. A collection of his
reporting was published n 1992 and is now in its seventh printing.
</P>
<P>
   When he diversified into broadcast journalism, National Public
Radio eagerly retained his services. Now he has branched out into
film making, and only his second work, ``The Farm,'' has been named
the best documentary of 1998 by several groups, including the
National Society of Film Critics. Earlier this month, it became one
of five movies nominated for the Oscar for best documentary
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Everything Rideau touches, it seems, turns to gold.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, that is, except for the iron bars surrounding his
dormitory at the Louisiana State Penitentiary here, where Rideau
has entered the 38th year of a life sentence for one of the most
vicious murders ever committed in Calcasieu Parish.
</P>
<P>
   While Liz Garbus and Jonathan Stack, the New York-based
producers and directors of ``The Farm: Angola U.S.A.,'' will join
the glitterati in their tuxedos and sequined gowns at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles on March 21, Rideau (pronounced
REE-doh) plans to watch the broadcast, in his prison denims, from
the cluttered office of The Angolite, the prison magazine he has
edited since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Rideau, 57, is credited as the co-director of the film, and he
is acknowledged by all involved as the guiding spirit of its
humanizing, and yet dispassionate, portrayal of life within one of
America's most infamous prisons. Nonetheless, Rideau realizes that
if the film wins an Academy Award, it will make little difference
in his daily routine, and may complicate his 23-year crusade to
gain clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Oscar wouldn't alter my existence one iota,'' he said in an
interview in the Angolite office. ``The one thing about winning
awards when you're in prison is that it keeps everything in
perspective for you.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory on Oscar night might blast Rideau, already one of
America's most celebrated inmates, into a new stratosphere of fame.
But unlike those actors and directors whose currency inflates with
each gold statuette, Rideau has found that prominence is not his
friend.
</P>
<P>
   While Louisiana governors have commuted hundreds of life
sentences over the years, including those of a number of
first-degree murderers with lesser records of rehabilitation,
Rideau has been repeatedly denied clemency. On three occasions
between 1984 and 1991, the state's pardon board recommended that
Rideau be freed, only to have governors reject the advice of their
own appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Rideau and his considerable band of supporters argue that he is,
in essence, a political prisoner. In the current tough-on-crime
climate, which seems to value punishment far more than
rehabilitation, Rideau maintains that he has become a victim of his
own celebrity, an inmate so conspicuous that no governor can afford
to release him.
</P>
<P>
   If he had done his time quietly, without ambition or
achievement, he would have been freed long ago, Rideau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way,'' he said. ``It has worked for everybody
else. It has worked for all the lifers of my generation. It worked
for everybody who was on death row with me the day I got there.
What distinguishes me from them? It's my prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   The recurring theme of Rideau's work, both in print and on film,
has been the persistence of hope in a place that would seem to
defeat it. In ``The Farm,'' so named because Angola is an
18,000-acre former plantation where the crops are now tended by
inmates rather than slaves, that theme is explored through the
stories of six prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Because Academy Award rules specify that only two names can be
attached to each documentary, Rideau is not cited in the
nomination. But both Ms. Garbus and Stack, who made an earlier film
with Rideau about an execution at Angola, praise their colleague as
an invaluable, if sometimes difficult, collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilbert is really the genesis of the film,'' Ms. Garbus said.
``What has made `The Farm' successful is that we were able to
achieve some kind of truth that was hard to achieve by outsiders.
And that is because of Wilbert.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideau, a school dropout and self-taught writer who earns 20
cents an hour as editor of The Angolite, is presumably one of the
few inmates in the United States with his own business cards. Fit
and trim with a bushy mustache , he works in an office with
computers purchased with proceeds from inmate enterprises like
Angola's annual rodeo. He is reasonably free to roam the main
inmate housing complex and to use the Angolite's telephones to
receive calls from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Angola, which is bordered on three sides by the Mississippi
River, was once considered the most violent prison in the country.
In an effort to relieve inmate tensions by giving them a voice,
prison officials began allowing The Angolite to publish without
censorship in the mid-1970s. Over the years, it has thoughtfully
addressed topics like homosexual rape and prison hospital
conditions, and its revelations have led to reforms that make
Angola a safer place today.
</P>
<P>
   Rideau ranks fifth out of Angola's 2,324 murderers in length of
imprisonment, and two of those with longer tenure committed murders
while incarcerated. By contrast, Rideau has been written up for one
infraction in 38 years, that coming in 1976 when he took a bottle
of Wite-Out from the Angolite office back to his dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   ``His record has been impeccable,'' said N. Burl Cain, Angola's
warden. ``From what I know of Wilbert here and how he's done his
time, sure, I would vote to let him go. But I don't know the crime.
And for the victim, there's no appeal from the grave.''
</P>
<P>
   His continued imprisonment, Rideau contends, reflects a betrayal
of American ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think that in America you would reward productivity
and initiative as opposed to punishing it,'' he said. Instead, he
said, his example demonstrates that inmates seeking freedom should
not draw attention to themselves. ``Forget all that rhetoric about
making amends and trying to make a contribution and all that,'' he
said. ``It's going to come at great cost to you, especially if you
do good, because you can do too good. And that shouldn't be so.
Nobody in this country or this world should ever be able to do too
good.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In Calcasieu Parish, near the Texas line, Rideau's victims and
the prosecutors who put him away retch at such moralizing.
</P>
<P>
   What they recall about Rideau, in detail that has not faded over
four decades, is that he walked into a Gulf National Bank branch in
Lake Charles as it was closing on Feb. 16, 1961. He forced the
manager at gunpoint to fill a suitcase with $14,000 and ordered the
manager and two tellers into a car. Rideau, who had turned 19 and
had no prior record, worked in a nearby fabric shop and knew all
three employees.
</P>
<P>
   The abduction ended in a swampy area outside of town where
Rideau ordered the three out of the car, lined them up and shot
them one by one, said Frank Salter, the former district attorney
who prosecuted the case. The branch manager, J.H. Hickman, stumbled
into the bayou and escaped. One of the tellers, Dora McCain, was
shot in the neck and played dead, even as Rideau kicked her
repeatedly to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   The other teller, Julia Ferguson, begged for her life, reminding
Rideau that she took care of her father. ``Wilbert, think of my
poor daddy,'' she said. ``What will he do without me?'' Brandishing
a hunting knife, Rideau responded, ``Don't worry, this will be
quick and cool.'' He then stabbed her in the heart and slit her
throat. Ms. Ferguson died, but Hickman and Ms. McCain survived.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Bryant, the current District Attorney in Calcasieu Parish,
maintains that Rideau has received more clemency than he deserves.
He was tried three times _ the first two convictions were reversed,
one because of excessive pretrial publicity and one because of
improper jury selection _ and each time he was sentenced to death.
But in 1972, the U. S. Supreme Court invalidated the death penalty,
and after more than a decade of confinement Rideau was released
from death row and given a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that he received his commutation in 1972,'' Bryant
said. ``He's very fortunate to be alive today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideau signed a confession shortly after his arrest, and has
never denied responsibility for the crimes. The argument he makes
is one of equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been the first to point out, I've got no right to
freedom,'' he said. ``But the fact of the matter is when you are
letting everybody else out, isn't it wrong to single one guy out
and keep him in when his qualifications probably exceed all the
rest of them?'' He added: ``One guy that got out of here killed
four people. He sends me Christmas cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda LaBranche, a coordinator of the Rideau Project, which is
affiliated with the Twomey Center for Peace Through Justice at
Loyola University in New Orleans, found that nearly 700 clemencies
have been granted to Louisiana murderers during Rideau's 38 years
in prison. Of the 31 murderers sent to Angola in 1962 with
sentences of either death or life in prison, all but Rideau have
gained their freedom through either clemency or court reversals,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Louisiana lifers once were paroled routinely after 10{
years, a life sentence today means just that. These days, the only
avenues for hope for Rideau and the 2,875 other lifers at Angola
are appeals to the courts for reversals and to governors for
commutations.
</P>
<P>
   Jaymee O. Burleigh, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Board of
Pardons, which was created in 1975, said that governors have signed
2,707 commutations during the board's existence. Of those, 458 were
granted to inmates serving life sentences, including 21
first-degree murderers.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards, who commuted scores of murder
sentences, has said he promised Ms. McCain, one of Rideau's victim,
that he would not release him as long as she objected. Former Gov.
Buddy Roemer, who twice rejected Rideau's appeals for clemency,
said he too was persuaded by the nature of the crime and the pleas
of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Rideau, he said, is ``just hiding behind'' the argument that
politics played a role. ``Anytime you let somebody go, it's going
to be in the newspaper,'' Roemer said. ``Now admittedly, with him
it might be with a picture above the fold.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's current governor, Mike Foster, has not commuted any
sentences during his three years in office and is not likely to
grant relief for violent offenders, said Cheney C. Joseph, his
executive counsel.
</P>
<P>
   That has led Rideau to place his faith in the courts, where he
is challenging the racial composition and selection process of the
grand jury that indicted him. A federal magistrate recommended in
1997 that his conviction be overturned, but Judge Frank Polozola of
U.S. District Court has yet to rule.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Rideau is considering his next project. Perhaps
he will write an autobiography. Perhaps he will make a film about
religion behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Warden Cain is considering how an Academy Award should be
celebrated at a maximum security prison. ``I tell you what,'' he
said, ``if we win, the next day we're going to have Cokes on the
yard for all the inmates. We're going to have a party, at least as
much as you can have a party in prison.''

<P>
   So after looking into the JonBenet Ramsey case for two years and
conducting, with his researcher Charles Brennan, some 571
interviews with nearly 200 people, does Lawrence Schiller
(``American Tragedy,'' about the O.J. Simpson case) have any idea
who killed the 6-year-old daughter of John and Patsy Ramsey?
</P>
<P>
   No. Like the rest of us he hasn't a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, like the Boulder, Colo., police, he has 1,038 clues.
They point him to the conclusion that ``what I know now with
hard-earned certainty is that since I was not present when JonBenet
was killed, I have to question my right to offer an explanation, a
best guess or a likely scenario of the events of Dec. 25-26,
1996.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``So, I find myself getting angry when I hear
someone say, `Patsy did it because . . .,' or `John did it, you see
. . .' Every time I hear yet another theory, I understand all over
again why I wrote this book. I came to learn that I saw it as my
job to find out as much as I could and therefore create the most
accurate record available for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Why then rush to print while the Boulder grand jury is still in
session, with a book so riddled with misprints that even an errata
slip correcting about a third of them includes an erratum?
</P>
<P>
   Schiller did so for several reasons, presumably: to fill the
vacuum created by the ending of the impeachment trial. To exploit
the already intense public fascination with the case. To feed the
reader fresh information about the murder. To clarify why the case
has created so much turmoil in Boulder, pitting the police against
the district attorney, and both against the press; laying waste
certain prominent careers, and prompting suspicion that the wealthy
Ramseys were being given privileged treatment.
</P>
<P>
   All of which ``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town'' assuredly
accomplishes. It reveals, for instance, that in the view of Linda
Hoffmann-Pugh, the family's housekeeper, the white blanket found
wrapped around JonBenet's body would have been available only to
someone with detailed knowledge of the household.
</P>
<P>
   It tells you that the police have established that four fibers
found attached to the duct tape sealing the mouth of JonBenet's
corpse matched those on a red-and-black checkerboard-design jacket
that Patsy Ramsey had been wearing both the night before and in the
morning (although Schiller quickly adds that in the opinion of one
forensics expert fibers are not unique like fingerprints and that
they could have been transferred from the coat to the tape
indirectly).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Schiller makes more understandable why the
Ramseys were reluctant to cooperate with the investigation: he
writes that the police, after failing to question John and Patsy
formally during the first three days, then tried to bully them by
withholding their child's body from burial. He places in a broader
context the hostility between the Boulder Police Department and
Alex Hunter, the Boulder County District Attorney: the police were
institutionally trained to press for convictions while Hunter,
attuned to Boulder's cultivated reputation as a peaceful place,
preferred what amounted to a plea-bargaining route.
</P>
<P>
   The book makes all too vivid how certain members of the press
would stop at nothing to snatch scraps of gossip off the plates of
officials trying to do their jobs: One reporter used a professed
desire to find religion as an entree to people with information he
could use.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the story leads you to see why two of the most
prominent people to resign their jobs in protest over the way they
perceived the case did so for opposite reasons: Police Detective
Steve Thomas because he felt the district attorney was failing to
go after the Ramseys aggressively enough, and Lou Smit, the
district attorney's investigator, because he felt the Ramseys were
being persecuted.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Schiller's witnesses points out, the case was such an
overwhelming puzzle that no single theory would accommodate all the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all it accomplishes, the book is frustrating to read.
Pieced together out of news articles, anecdotes, first-person
recollections and passages of reporting, the narrative forms a
pattern whose dots the reader is meant to connect. But doing so
isn't always easy, because you sometimes don't know what a fragment
means.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an early passage tells you that the broken window
in the cellar had an intact spider web blocking it on the morning
after the murder. Later several passages suggest that an intruder
might have entered the window anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Still later another passage goes into detail to show that web
was a kind that was ``constantly reworked and added to by the
spider,'' as opposed to one that is ``regularly replaced by the
spiders and can be completed at any hour of the day, in less than
12 hours.'' From this you switch back to the position that an
intruder couldn't have climbed through the window.
</P>
<P>
   But in the closing pages of the book Schiller writes: ``The
spider web on the window-well grate was not conclusive proof that
nobody had entered through the window opening. The sudden rise in
temperature the morning after the murder allowed for a spider to
come out of hibernation and spin a new web, and some people argued
that the web itself was elastic enough to survive disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Multiply this example many times, and you get a sense of the
book's ambiguity. You never stop feeling oppressed by a sense that
the mystery of who killed JonBenet is just not going to be solved,
at least not within the space of ``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town.''
</P>
<P>
   As one group of experts points out, even if you conceded that,
in Schiller's words, ``the intruder theory, given the existing
evidence, was untenable,'' prosecutors were left ``with the
troubling question of which parent _ if either parent _ had
knowingly caused the child's death.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes, ``Until investigators could identify each parent's
individual actions, two suspects meant no suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   What heightens this sense of oppression is Schiller's correction
of JonBenet's videotape image as a grotesque prodigy of sexuality.
The beauty pageant stuff was a small part of her life, he explains.
She was really a bright, sensitive child who was curious to know
things like what a year was (``So I've been around the sun five
times?''), and if ``roses know their thorns can hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Her murder and its aftermath, he argues in this somewhat
pasted-together book, has diminished us all.

EXPERT TO HELP DEVISE FORMAT FOR DELIVERING MUSIC ON INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lh) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recording industry, anxious for a way to move safely and
profitably into the era of Internet delivery of music, has taken a
major step by putting an influential digital architect in charge of
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   At a seven-hour, closed-door meeting of 200 top executives in
the music and technology industries, Leonardo Chiariglione was
named on Friday to head the Secure Digital Music Initiative. The
group is seeking to create a technical format for the copyrighted
sale and digital delivery of music over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Chiariglione, an Italian researcher, was instrumental in
creating the industry-standard formats for converting and
compressing video and audio information into digital form, known as
MPEG.
</P>
<P>
   The Secure Digital Music Initiative, announced in December, is
an attempt by the recording industry associations of North America,
Japan and Europe to create a standardized way to distribute songs
and albums on the Internet. The technical challenge is to do so in
a way that protects copyright holders and foils the many audio
pirates who copy and distribute digital music illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, one of the MPEG formats that Chiariglione helped
create, MP3, has become the favorite way for Internet pirates to
copy and transmit music. So the music industry, in essence, has
recruited the man who opened the Pandora's box of Internet piracy
to ask him to close it.
</P>
<P>
   After his selection at Friday's meeting, Chiariglione startled
many in the audience by announcing an ambitious timetable, one that
may confound the many Internet skeptics who have derided the
secure-music initiative as coming too late to turn back the
free-music tide. He said he planned to have preliminary standards
on paper by June to ensure that an industry-backed format would be
approved in time to let recording companies start using it to sell
music online by Christmas and to enable electronics companies to
have compatible devices ready to play the newly formatted songs.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, it took an equivalent standards group five years
to develop a format for recording and playing back audio on the new
generation of DVD disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was told that in six months they'd have a result, I
didn't think it was possible,'' said Marina Bosi, who attended
Friday's conference. She is president of the Audio Engineering
Society and one of the creators of AAC _ a higher-fidelity sequel
to MP3. ``But knowing the background that Chiariglione is bringing
to this process I think there's a chance this might happen,'' she
said, although she added a note of caution: ``It's a very tough
schedule, and we're talking about meetings every two weeks. Just
the travel alone is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Another conference attendee, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the enormity of the task ahead became apparent to
him the night before the meeting, after he drew up a list of 14
variables _ including problems posed by removable personal computer
hard drives, the new challenges of cable modems and the onslaught
of portable devices for playing the music. Each of the 14 issues
could require its own subcommittee, this person said.
</P>
<P>
   And even Chiariglione acknowledged that there was a considerable
amount of work to be done in a relatively short time. ``We have to
integrate a range of technologies that was probably never attempted
before by anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chiariglione is an executive at the corporate research center of
Telecom Italia, working there since 1971. Although known as an
eccentric leader, he is a relentless taskmaster and a stickler for
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 he founded the industry's MPEG committee, which
standardized not only MPEG-1 and MP3 but also the newer MPEG-4,
which has a built-in copyright protection system. The committee is
now at work on MPEG-7, which will have built-in capabilities for
letting users search for specific audio or video information within
a file.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for one of the handful of people in the world
who would be able to pull together an effort as ambitious as this
one that would enable the kinds of future business models we all
are interested in pursuing,'' said Cary Sherman, the general
counsel of the Recording Industry Association of America, who led
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Chiariglione's selection as head of the Secure Digital Music
Initiative, whose members are paying $10,000 a year to participate,
suddenly makes him an even more influential man: Companies with
technologies that end up being incorporated into the standard
format stand to make millions simply from patent royalties or
licensing fees.
</P>
<P>
   Internet anarchists, pirates and utopians have been predicting
that the delivery of music on the Internet would put record labels
out of business. Their vision seemed to be confirmed late last year
when the industry began a series of lawsuits motivated out of fear
_ blocking bands like the Beastie Boys from putting MP3 files of
their music online, for example, and unsuccessfully suing Diamond
Technologies, which put the first portable Walkman-like MP3 player
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   But attendees at the meeting, who saw presentations about
Internet business models by the heads of technology at Universal
Music and BMG Music, said that the record labels now seemed to have
a focused notion of what must be done to help the industry migrate
successfully from the CD era to the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the music business, however, were less enthralled by
the meeting. These critics saw it as a step forward for the record
industry but a move backward for a long-nurtured Internet dream. In
that vision, artists have seen the Internet as a way for their
music to reach fans directly; as a way for fans to get music at
lower prices because there are no materials costs for transmitting
music online, and as a way for musicians to get a bigger share of
the profits from their work by avoiding the record-label middle
man.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Crowley, who runs the Massachusetts Music Industry
Coalition, a national artist's rights organization, noted the
absence of musicians and artists at Friday's meeting. ``It's
probably the only chance artists have had in 30 years to gain back
some ground,'' she said. ``But the RIAA is going to beat them to it
if they don't take some control.''
</P>
<P>
   And won't some pirates feel betrayed that the person who helped
open the Internet to music fans is now trying to restrain it for
big business? Maybe. But Chiariglione said he never set out to abet
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   When the initial standards were set for MPEG, home recording
devices for digital piracy did not exist. But now piracy is a
primary concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the technology to be put to good use,'' Chiariglione said,
``you have to create a boundary.''

years into everyday parts of city life. In big urban areas,
paramilitary units now do everything from routine street patrols to
nightly house raids. Even small towns have formed paramilitary
police units. The Cape Cod town of Harwich, Mass., for example,
population 11,000, has trained a 10-man SWAT team. Encouraged by
federal grants, surplus equipment handed out by the military, and

their special units take in raids, the special units have grown
dramatically, even in the face of plummeting crime figures. (Second

FURNITURE AND WEAKNESSES: OUR FAMILY TRAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A daughter is relocating to more spacious lodgings and is
desperate for furniture to fill the place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It means for us, the parents, an opportunity to unload some
things we no longer need. There's even a chance that, in time, I
might once again have use of the garage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the pieces we let go was a low, daybed kind of affair that
I've always heard spoken of as the fainting couch. In my memory, no
one around here has ever fainted. But nevertheless that's what it's
been called: the fainting couch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My wife brought this curiosity to our marriage, along with her
white cat, and it served as our first sofa. There's no knowing how
many friends it may have cost us. For while it would be ideal for
use by anyone who has just lost consciousness, it's an agony to sit
upon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Either you perch on the front edge, without any support for your
back. Or it can be placed against a wall. But then, if people of
normal height are to take advantage of the wall's support, they
must sit with their legs thrust out straight before them, like
infants in a highchair or dolls on a shelf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In later years _ the last 25 or so _ it has been in an upstairs
back room that briefly was my writing place, but then evolved into
a catch-all storage area. No sooner had the thing been carted away
than my wife announced plans for the space thus liberated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to bring the sewing machine up from the basement,''
she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If we hadn't already given away the fainting couch, I might have
used it right then! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What in heaven's name for?'' I screeched. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sewing machine is of the treadle kind, manufactured by the
Singer company and very popular 50 or 100 years ago, but found now
only in the thatched huts and sweatshops of Third World countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or in basements like ours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you want that upstairs?'' I demanded to know. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' she said defiantly. ``I might want to sew.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But you hate sewing!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a girlhood project _ for home economics class, it must have
been _ she set out to make some simple garment, but ripped out
seams and restitched them so many times that, before she could
finish it, the fabric just disintegrated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She has many gifts, but sewing is not among them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You're about as likely to use that machine as I am to take up
plumbing,'' I said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She considered that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said. ``I'm more likely.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She was, of course, alluding to the drippy bathroom faucet,
about which I once recklessly observed that all it needed was a new
washer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From that moment, hardly a day has passed when she has not asked
if I intend to replace the faucet washer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have any washers on hand,'' I tell her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you'll have to get one, won't you. Probably at the
hardware store.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``First I'll have to find out the size.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You could measure the old one.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, and I'll do it, too,'' I tell her. ``One of these
days.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, I haven't any clear notion at all about how one
goes about changing a faucet washer. Or if the washers come in
different sizes. Or if that model faucet even has one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm bluffing _ just as she's bluffing about taking up sewing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You sometimes hear that marriage is two people combining their
strengths. But we've come together, merging our baggage of
weaknesses, and somehow we've made a life. &QL;

IT LOOKS TO BE AN OFF YEAR FOR TAX RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taxpayers become orphans in nonelection years, which probably
means significant tax cuts aren't likely in '99. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats seem dead set against major relief, preferring to
push the claim that anticipated budget surpluses should be used to
``save'' Social Security. It's a con game, to be sure, but a
complex enough scam to gull most average Americans. A standard line
being used to fend off tax-cutters is tax cuts would be reckless. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, meanwhile, lick their wounds as polls show they
lost ground politically from their efforts to oust the president.
There is talk in GOP circles of mounting a tax-relief effort, but
it seems merely talk without much passion for really doing it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, unless a presidential hopeful in the Reagan mold
happens along to champion the taxpayer cause, the future of working
Americans looks bleak indeed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How bleak? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Current estimates put total federal revenues during the first
decade of the next century at $22 trillion. Somewhat more than 10
percent of the income is forecast to be in excess of what Uncle Sam
will spend. If projections are correct, it will equate to an
average cumulative overpayment of $27,000 by each taxpaying
household, according to an analysis by the Citizens for a Sound
Economy Foundation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The key characterization here is ``overpayment,'' because it's a
reminder that the money belongs in the first instance to the
taxpayers. Unfortunately, those who would keep the money in
Washington have become increasingly successful in selling the
notion that they should have carte blanche dibs on all paychecks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If taxpayers understood how heavy their aggregate burden has
become, there might be more grass-roots support for tax-relief
champions in Washington. Tax revenues during fiscal year 2000 are
forecast to be 20.7 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, which is
the value of all economic output. As a share of GDP, this would be
almost as much as the federal government spent in the last full
year of World War II, when America was fighting for its very
existence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Washington takes nearly as much as it needed during
the darkest days of the gravest threat ever mounted to this
country's existence. This is happening despite the fact that the
country is in the midst of the longest peacetime economic expansion
in its history and perhaps the greatest period of sustained overall
prosperity ever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans faced similar depredations at Washington's hands in
the 1970s, when bad policy created inflation that propelled workers
into ever higher tax brackets that allowed government to profit
from its own mistakes at taxpayer expense. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things obviously are much improved, but it should be remembered
that it took some of the worst economic times in history to
convince Americans to make the political moves that would improve
their economic situation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What the '70s and '90s do have in common is a federal government
ignoring the interests of those whose labor and income make all
things possible and acting instead as though all such hard-earned
tax money belongs to the state. When that idea becomes politically
acceptable enough to dominate fiscal policy, working folk are
reduced to serfdom. &QL;

BOOKBINDER'S THRIVING BUSINESS IS WORTH A BOOK OF ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SELDEN, Kan. _ In any given year, about 100,000 books move in
and out of tiny Selden in northwest Kansas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody reads them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a word,'' said Richard Koerperich, owner of Selden's
biggest business, Koerperich Bookbinders, one of only 34 such
enterprises in the nation certified by the American Library
Association. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people here, say at lunch, looking through books,''
and the books are ``going to get messed up,'' Koerperich said.
``That's not what we're in business for.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company binds all sorts of books _ law books, town and
county histories, student theses, family genealogical works, high
school yearbooks, old Zane Grey yarns, scientific treatises, back
issues of cattle breed publications, even self-published novels and
books of poetry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, an occasional life-and-death situation has
resulted from those last two categories. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had rush orders,'' Koerperich said. ``Some old person's
worked on a novel or a book of poetry for years. And it's finally
done, and they bring it to us. Then they take sick. They're
literally on their death bed. And what is that one thing they want
more than anything? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see their book between its covers before they
die. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not kidding. That's happened more than once, too.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, most of the work is rarely that intense. The
majority of the work is the binding of new books and the mundane
restoration of library and law books and schoolbooks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those latter volumes, what's between the covers is still
fine. But the outside is frayed, dog-eared, beat up _ probably the
result of too many library loans, innumerable legal consultations
or the busy fingers of bored youngsters, who figure what's inside
the spine of a book is far more interesting than any of the words
on its pages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The books come from all over the United States and arrive in
Selden _ all of 240 souls about 25 miles from Colby _ to be sewn,
trimmed, cut, edged and stamped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A tiny sign outside the front door of what once was a bank and a
liquor store before it became a bookbindery gives the only clue as
to what's inside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Koerperich doesn't advertise. His business is all by word of
mouth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, he said, just a few years ago, the word around was that
his business and others like it were albatrosses. Computers and
video screens, the big brains predicted, would send books the way
of the great auk and along with it, the bookbinding business. Who,
the thinking went, would look at a book instead of a video screen?
Or ever want to rebind one? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hasn't happened, said Koerperich. Business is booming. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People will always want books,'' he said, adding that some
folks just like to leaf through the pages and pick and choose.
Plus, there will always be special books. Koerperich made his point
by taking from a shelf a small volume a grieving family put
together in remembrance of a 22-year-old local man killed in a car
accident. The title was /{Brad, We Hardly Knew You/}. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This belongs in a book,'' said Koerperich, 58. ``Not on a
screen.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, one category of bookbinding has taken a nosedive over the
past few years. Most newspapers now are preserved electronically,
much to Koerperich's relief. No longer does he have to work with
pages that don't want to stay even and cheap, mediocre paper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate newspapers,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What he does love is binding books, a skill that goes back to
the fourth century. Compared with bookbinding, printing is a recent
innovation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Koerperich apprenticed himself four years to an
uncle who was a bookbinder in New Mexico. He learned the trade,
returned to Selden, farmed, and started bookbinding in his garage.
He moved to town a couple of years later. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And there he's been ever since, the business growing, his sons
joining him, and taking care of clients, be they printers who sends
boxloads of unbound pages to be turned into thousands of books or
the individuals who show up with a single beloved volume, scuffed
and worn from uncountable readings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He still farms some. But bookbinding is his passion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several towns have come to Koerperich, offering everything short
of the moon if he'll relocate. With 12 to 24 skilled employees,
depending on the time of year and the workload, getting Koerperich
would be a feather in the cap of any municipality wanting to expand
its employment base. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No thanks,'' has been Koerperich's reply. He likes Selden.
It's home. He likes small-town people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to give tours until our insurance company made us quit
because of liability,'' Koerperich said. ``It was funny. People
were just fascinated with how the books are bound. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd always tell them anybody can bind books. All you need
is a needle, thread, cardboard and paper. And maybe a pencil to
write the title on the book. It's easy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Koerperich smiled. Well, maybe not that easy. &QL;

PROPOSED CONCEALED-WEAPONS LAW LACKS SUPPORT IN KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Kansas Citians have their way, Missouri won't pass a
concealed weapons law any time soon, according to a poll by The
Kansas City Star. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the Kansas City voters surveyed, 60 percent oppose legalizing
concealed handguns, compared with 23 percent in favor. If voters
approve the ballot measure April 6, Missourians will be able to
carry concealed weapons for the first time since 1875. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   City residents also solidly reject the argument that a
concealed-carry law would reduce crime, the poll showed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City alone will not decide the election on concealed
weapons. Gun advocates are counting on strong support from rural
areas. Concealed-carry opponents are hoping that expected
opposition from Kansas City _ and from St. Louis _ will be enough
to defeat the issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City a majority of every group except gun owners
opposes the concealed-weapons measure, according to the poll of 601
registered voters in Jackson, Clay and Platte counties. Even among
gun owners support was tepid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet interviews with people surveyed showed a strong streak of
ambivalence in their responses, fueled in large part by fear of
crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mitchell, 29, of south Kansas City, reflects those
conflicting feelings. He said he planned to vote against concealed
weapons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It would just make things worse,'' Mitchell said. ``You
couldn't tick anybody off. You step on my shoes, and I get mad and
pull out a gun and bam! Another one bites the dust. This is not
going to solve anything.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if Missouri voters approve concealed weapons, Mitchell plans
to go through the training and get a permit. Just to even up the
odds, he says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be for protection,'' Mitchell said. ``If everybody in
Kansas City is carrying, there's no way it would be a fair fight.
So I'd want to be able to defend myself.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The poll uncovered several key trends. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Men, for example, were twice as likely as women to support the
proposal and were nearly 2 1/2 times as likely to own a gun. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Black and white voters showed similar support for concealed
weapons, but blacks were twice as likely to say they would apply
for a permit to carry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suburban Kansas City residents who live in Clay or Platte
counties also supported concealed weapons slightly more than their
neighbors in Jackson County. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, no matter their gender, race or residence, a majority of
Kansas Citians surveyed Feb. 10-14 said they opposed concealed
weapons. The survey had an error margin of plus or minus four
percentage points. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve McGhee, president of Missourians for Personal Safety,
which supports concealed weapons, said his group had found
ambivalence toward concealed weapons even among gun advocates.
People are accustomed to thinking that only bad guys carry
concealed guns, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of soft supporters who think it's a good idea
but don't know whether they want everybody carrying guns,'' McGhee
said. ``I say people already are carrying guns. They are called
criminals. Is the person who goes through all those hoops to get a
permit really going to worry you?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The poll's findings indicated that many Kansas Citians rejected
two of the gun advocates' key arguments: that women want to carry
guns for protection and that concealed weapons deter crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say a gun in a woman's purse can even the odds against
a male attacker, who is usually bigger and stronger. McGhee said
women made up more than 80 percent of the students in his firearms
training classes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City women, however, opposed concealed weapons nearly 5-1
in the poll and were far less likely than men to say they would
apply for permits. One in three men would apply, while one in 13
women would be interested in a permit to carry a concealed
firearm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women also were much less likely to say concealed weapons would
reduce crime. Many also did not think they would ever need to use a
gun to stop a crime. While 60 percent of men thought they would
need to draw their weapons, only 33 percent of women expected to do
so. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mary Howard, 61, who lives in the Waldo neighborhood, opposes
concealed weapons. She says too many guns are on the streets
already. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so frightening when I watch the news every night and even
little kids are involved with guns,'' Howard said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alyce King, 75, who lives south of the Plaza, said she would not
carry a gun herself but supported concealed weapons for
philosophical reasons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a governmental body has overstepped its bounds when
they prohibit people from protecting themselves,'' King said.
``Policing is rather impossible when criminal elements can arm
themselves and the rest of us are left at a disadvantage.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deidre Thurman, 23, of south Kansas City, wants a permit because
she believes carrying a concealed gun would make her feel safer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As a female it's not safe to ride home alone late at night _
on the bus or in a car,'' Thurman said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even gun owners, however, do not put much stock in the power of
concealed weapons to deter crime. Only 37 percent thought concealed
weapons would; 55 percent said they would not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gun owner David Boyle, 53, belongs to the minority who do
believe concealed weapons can reduce crime. He bases his view on 4
1/2 years in Houston, where, he said, crime was so rampant he
learned to work a bank cash machine while holding a gun in one
hand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminals have to be reluctant to commit a crime if they know
the victim might be armed and might be faster than them,'' said the
Kansas City, North, resident. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Black residents polled were more likely to expect to use a gun
to stop a crime, even though they were less likely than whites to
say concealed weapons reduced crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Emanuel Cleaver said most blacks opposed concealed weapons
because they did not want their community to grow even more
violent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the victims,'' Cleaver said. ``African-Americans are
disproportionately transported to funeral homes with gunshot
wounds.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. William Clay Jr., a St. Louis Democrat, said he never
bought the argument that concealed weapons reduced crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said most black residents opposed the referendum because they
feared they would be victims of shootings done in the name of
self-defense. But others in the black community want concealed guns
to protect themselves from others who have guns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver agreed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans tend to be paranoid, with some
justification, about not being able to protect themselves,''
Cleaver said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The poll backed up Cleaver and Clay. About 30 percent of black
respondents said they were inclined to get a gun permit if the
measure passed, compared with 15 percent for whites. &QL;

JOURNALISM'S GREATEST HITS: TWO LISTS OF A CENTURY'S TOP STORIES

(With JOURNALISM'S-BEST-LIST)

 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometime, somewhere, some anthropologist must have
explored that tribal ritual: the greatest-hits list. These lists
date back at least to the seven wonders of the ancient world. They
reflect the importance of some area of tribal endeavor _ monumental
architecture, say, or rock-and-roll. And they establish
hierarchies; how better to show your pre-eminence in the pecking
order than to rank everyone else?
</P>
<P>
   Journalists, trained to make their value judgments in neat
pyramid style, most important facts first, could hardly be expected
to resist the millennial listing urge. If the Modern Library can
cause a stir with its list of 100 best novels and the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame can take abuse for its top 500, why shouldn't
journalists share in the fun?
</P>
<P>
   So, within four days of each other, come two
100-best-of-the-century lists of journalists, by journalists, for
journalists. One, done under the aegis of the Freedom Forum's
Newseum, came out last week and ranks the best news stories of the
century. (It can be found at www.newseum.org.) The second, under
the aegis of New York University's journalism department, ranks the
best works of 20th-century journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Listing, of course, involves its own ritual behavior. First,
members of the tribe read the list. Then they attack it. Like this:
The Newseum's 67 judges collectively put the discovery of the Nazi
death camps at No. 7, behind the Wright Brothers' first flight (No.
4). The genocides in Armenia, Cambodia and Rwanda don't appear.
Neither does the Iranian revolution or anything connected to
religion _ unless you consider Communism its own kind of religion.
</P>
<P>
   The NYU list, compiled by 36 judges, is a little harder to
kvetch about. It focuses less on events than craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The two lists do, in some ways, converge: The No. 1 news event
on the Newseum's list is the dropping of the atomic bomb on
Hiroshima; the No. 1 work of journalism on NYU's list is John
Hersey's ``Hiroshima.'' The 1940s and 1960s dominate both lists.
Events of those years held 39 of the 100 spots on the Newseum's
list. NYU's list included 43 works of journalism that were
published in those decades.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the difference between the two lists parallels
the difference between a great headline and a wonderfully turned
piece of writing. Both take skill and thought, spiced with
arbitrariness and whimsy. But it's hard to linger over headlines.
</P>
<P>
   The NYU list includes events that were important mostly because
of who was watching. The documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman's
``Titicut Follies,'' (1967, No. 56) about the dehumanization of
inmates in an institution for the criminally insane speaks as
eloquently about the bizarre cruelty of indifference as other
journalists have spoken about the bizarre cruelty of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of list is needed in journalism,'' said Mitchell
Stephens, chairman of the NYU journalism department. ``People have
their own lists of the best novels or the best songs. But
journalism doesn't get thought of that way. Nobody thinks of
journalism in terms of decades or centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Greenfield of CNN, one of the judges, said: ``The cliche of
journalism is that it is a first rough draft of history. This makes
you go back and look at what journalistic works endure and why.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the works show off muscular reporting, the kind that
moves history _ the Watergate reporting of Bob Woodward and Carl
Bernstein of The Washington Post (1973, No. 3) or Seymour Hersh's
account of the My Lai massacre (1969, No. 12) for Dispatch News
Service. Some show the arc of history: A troika of works cover the
rise and fall of Soviet Communism, from John Reed's ``Ten Days That
Shook The World'' (1919, No. 7) to Harrison Salisbury's Moscow
correspondence for The New York Times (1949-54, No. 52) to David
Remnick's book ``Lenin's Tomb.'' (1993, No. 57).
</P>
<P>
   And some are windows on the passions that animated an era, from
Ida Tarbell's ``History of the Standard Oil Company'' (1902-1904,
No. 5) to John Steinbeck's reporting on Okie migrant camps in
California (1936, No. 31) to Hannah Arendt's coverage of the
Eichmann trial (1963, No. 20). Other works helped ignite passions,
like Huynh Cong Ut's photograph of a naked, napalmed girl in
Vietnam (1972, No. 41).
</P>
<P>
   And all are windows on the values of the 16 women and 21 men who
sat in judgment, from Stanley Crouch of The Daily News to Mary
McGrory of The Washington Post to Dorothy Rabinowitz of The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   For Stephens, the final value of the list is what it says about
the role of the craft in making people see themselves. ``You can
see the 20th century understanding itself through its journalism,''
he said.

TINY BE INC. CALLS MICROSOFT'S BLUFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md., Mass.) (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, the burden of proof.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the tiny software company Be Inc. briefly came into
focus at the Microsoft antitrust trial, when a Microsoft executive
asserted that Be could soon become a major competitor to his
company. No matter that Microsoft controls some 90 percent of the
personal computer operating system market and Be has virtually no
market share.
</P>
<P>
   With publicity nine-10ths of the law, Be's flamboyant founder
and chairman, Jean-Louis Gassee, has come up with a novel way to
test Microsoft's hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   In a column posted on Be's Web site on Thursday, Gassee made a
proposal to any computer maker willing to confront Microsoft's
stringent licensing requirements: His company will license its Be
operating system free for one year to any computer maker willing to
install it on new machines and make it an option for buyers to
select the first time they switch on the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Gassee said that he had had no takers, despite several
``nibbles,'' but that he was discussing the idea with at least one
major PC maker, which he declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles to his challenge appear to be formidable. But that
may be the point.
</P>
<P>
   Gassee described in his column how one computer maker has loaded
the Be operating system on its computers. But he said that the
manufacturer, which he did not identify in the column, has noted
this fact only deep in the accompanying documentation because the
company interpreted Microsoft's licensing provisions to bar
non-Microsoft systems from being displayed during the start-up
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to expose something that has been right under my
nose for years,'' said Gassee, who ran Apple Computer's hardware
business before founding Be in 1990 in Menlo Park, Calif.
``Microsoft wants to smother the baby in the cradle.''

   Linux.com Doesn't Go to the Highest Bidder
</P>
<P>
   When Fred Van Kempen registered the linux.com Internet domain in
June 1994, nobody but a handful of programmers around the world had
heard of Linux _ the precocious software operating system, written
by a graduate student named Linus Torvalds and released free on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as the Linuxworld trade show opens in San Jose, Calif.,
the program has begun to pose real competition to the Unix and
Windows NT operating systems that dominate the market for business
computing. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that Van Kempen, who
now works as a network engineer for a consulting firm in the
Netherlands, says he has received 500 e-mail messages in the last
six months asking if the linux.com domain is for sale.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Van Kempen plans to announce that he is selling the
domain to VA Research, a start-up in Mountain View, Calif., that
sells and supports Linux systems for business enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Van Kempen said in an interview Sunday, was not the
highest bidder. But then, as seems to be the inexplicable norm
among many involved in Linux, money was not his main objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure no one could take it and make it into
some commercial playground,'' said Van Kempen, who wrote much of
the early networking code for Linux. ``I don't really need the
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Kempen declined to say how much VA Research is paying. He
said the company plans to make linux.com into a clearinghouse for
Linux information for the growing base of commercial users. He and
several other representatives from the Linux community will serve
on a board that will monitor the site.

   Cars, Sex and Stocks on One Web Site
</P>
<P>
   For some people, few things are as sexy as a new Internet stock.
At least that's the assumption of Joseph Preston, a 28-year-old
entrepreneur in Bethesda, Md. Preston plans to file documents with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday stating his
intention to raise $7.5 million in a stock offering for Efox.net.
</P>
<P>
   The business, he said in an interview, will be an
electronic-commerce Web site that focuses on ``the heterosexual
man's favorite pursuits: ladies, automobiles, sports, and stocks.''
He said the women who pose provocatively for his site _ the ``eye
candy,'' he calls them _ will each be paid with 500 shares of
Efox.net stock.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in this realm, air-brushed surfaces can be deceiving.
The company is only a month old, and its Web site right now is
little more than a come-hither home page. To date, Preston has
raised only about $100,000 for the operation from private
investors. And he plans to dispense with the usual step of finding
an investment banker by underwriting the stock issue himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a market where companies raise millions and millions with
decidedly less sexy topics like books, Internet broadcasting and
online access, Preston's venture raises the question: Why hasn't
anyone yet married Internet sex and the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   Sex, as a business proposition, does not necessarily magnetize
the average investment banker, said Mark Hardie, senior analyst
with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., who is skeptical about
Preston's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Adult-themed sites are among the few that actually make money on
the Internet. But they are risky business as far as the financial
community is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going public is about convincing a host of risk-averse
financial service firms who manage the assets of retirees to plunk
down tens of millions of dollars on a porn business,'' Hardie said.

 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Mariano Rivera hits targets instinctively. This is
the easy part of what he does. As a boy, he used to whip rocks at
cardboard or hurl tightly wound string at tiny inner tubes on the
beaches of Panama. As a man, he aims baseballs at a catcher's mitt
and almost never misses. All the same, really.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, and allowed the Yankees' Rivera to become
perhaps the most dominant relief pitcher in the American League, is
his subtle mastery of a baseball's movement. Rivera's fastball _
typically in the range of 93 to 96 mph _ used to be as straight as
a city street; now it possesses more turns and bends than a
mountain highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more mature as a pitcher,'' said Joe Girardi, one of the
Yankees' catchers. ``He understands more about how to close, about
that mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera reached into his locker here the other day and pulled out
a baseball. How, he was asked, are you making the ball move so
much? How do you make the ball veer into the hands of left-handed
batters, or dive at right-handed batters?
</P>
<P>
   Leaning forward in his chair, Rivera held the baseball nearly at
arm's length; enveloped in his fingers, it looked like a stunted
tangerine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how you grip the baseball,'' said Rivera, two
fingers and a thumb tucked underneath the ball, his right index and
middle fingers extended over the top, slightly bent, flexing. ``You
can get it to cut more if you do this. ...''
</P>
<P>
   His fingers didn't appear to move. He apparently had changed the
pressure applied by his fingertips. ``Or you do this, to get more
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera struggled to explain, but then, Hendrix might've had
trouble accounting for the sounds that emerged from his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   This is Rivera 101, through the eyes of his catchers: When he
first emerged in the major leagues, in 1995 and '96, his primary
pitch was a sailing four-seam fastball that he usually threw high
in the strike zone. Rivera would throw a 96-mph fastball thigh high
for a strike, and then he would throw the next belly-button high,
and the next chest high, and they would keep swinging, mostly
missing. In 1996, when Rivera served as the setup man for John
Wetteland, he struck out 130 batters in 1072/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   But major league hitters are adaptable. ``They started making
adjustments on him, once they had seen him,'' Girardi said. ``They
didn't always swing at that high ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera realized, too, that all those strikeouts would take their
toll on him, eventually. And, in fact, some American League scouts
felt he tired at the end of the 1997 season. Rivera wanted to
become more efficient, to pitch in the bottom half of the strike
zone and generate more ground balls, rather than strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera found that, with the right grip, he could throw what is
known as a cut fastball. When throw by a right-handed pitcher, a
cutter veers toward a left-handed batter. Because Rivera throws his
so hard, however, the movement is explosive, very late and very
sharp. ``It's just nasty,'' said Jorge Posada, the Yankees'
starting catcher.
</P>
<P>
   A left-handed slugger like Mo Vaughn will start swinging at a
fastball that appears to be over the heart of the plate, and by the
time he whips around his bat, Rivera's cutter will have turned and
jammed Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, left-handed batters had 115 at-bats against Rivera
and hit exactly zero home runs and accounted for just nine
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton, the Yankees reliever, believes Rivera's cut
fastball to be something of a freak of nature, because Rivera
releases his cutter in almost the same way a quarterback throws a
football _ the fingers held to the side of the ball, rather than
over the top, as almost all fastballs are thrown.
</P>
<P>
   When facing right-handed batters, Rivera sometimes use a
two-seam fastball. When thrown by a right-handed pitcher, it will
veer back into a right-handed batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has become someone who really likes to pitch inside,''
Posada said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, and down. Girardi said that in 1995 and 1996, he would
set a high target with his mitt, and Rivera would throw high
fastballs. Now the Yankees catchers set low targets, in the bottom
half of the strike zone, often just underneath the hands of both
left-handed and right-handed batters.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera struck out 36 batters in 611/3 innings in 1998, and there
was much speculation that Rivera had lost his fastball, that he was
in jeopardy of losing his stuff. To the contrary: Rivera had simply
become more efficient, as he wanted, and evolved from a strikeout
pitcher into a ground-ball pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he averaged 0.65 ground balls for every fly ball and
needed an average of 18.7 pitches to get through each inning. In
1998, he had 1.6 ground balls to every fly ball and needed 14.9
pitches per inning.
</P>
<P>
   The efficiency, and manager Joe Torre's conservative rationing
of Rivera through the summer, paid off in October. ``He cut down on
his pitches, and that was important in the long run, over a full
season,'' Girardi said. ``He was really strong in the playoffs this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for last year's playoffs, an American League advance
scout trailing the Yankees said that Rivera ``is the best closer in
baseball right now, and there's really nobody close to him.'' In
one scouting assessment, it was noted that 93 percent of the
pitches thrown by Rivera were fastballs but very different
fastballs, cutters and four-seamers and two-seamers.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera didn't surrender any runs in 131/3 innings in the
playoffs and World Series, and with the finish line in sight, he
overpowered opposing hitters once more, striking out 11 and
allowing six hits.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman, San Diego's hard-throwing closer, appeared in 12
more games than Rivera during the regular season, threw more
pitches and had more strikeouts and his fastball was clocked at a
mediocre 88 mph in Game 3 of the World Series, when he allowed
Scott Brosius' decisive three-run homer. Rivera, on the other hand,
was throwing 95-97 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just unbelievable,'' San Diego manager Bruce Bochy
said, after the Yankees swept the Padres in the World Series.

   Part of Rivera's daily regimen now is to sign dozens of pictures
and magazine covers that bear the image of his arms outstretched,
his face possessed by joy and by Girardi's bear hug in the first
moment after the Yankees clinched last year's World Series.
</P>
<P>
   It is an expression that comes easily to Rivera. He loves his
life. Rivera is always the same, his teammate Derek Jeter said.
Easygoing, gracious, quick to offer a pat on the shoulder as he
passes, constantly smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter would go to the mound before the most crucial innings last
season and say to Rivera, ``Let's go, let's get it done now,'' and
there was never any doubt Rivera would succeed. There was always
the sense that on the mound, Rivera could barely contain his grin,
that he was absolutely sure he would prevail and that like a little
kid, he was having the best time.
</P>
<P>
   Tension? Nervousness? Please.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of fun out there,'' Girardi said.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera believes his own demeanor closely resembles that of his
father, also named Mariano. ``He thinks you should be responsible,
and that you should respect other people,'' Rivera said, ``and that
you should enjoy your life.''
</P>
<P>
   His father is a fisherman who now captains a boat; when Rivera
was growing up, his father was part of a crew that would go out for
nets full of sardines, a week at a time. But even in his father's
absence, Rivera was surrounded by family, cousins and his mother.
If he did something wrong, his relatives or his teachers punished
him immediately, and he waited mournfully for his father to come
home for more punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would give me a whipping,'' Rivera said. ``It's so
different here. I see little kids be disrespectful to each other,
or to their parents, and I cannot believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera and his friends played soccer or football, or baseball,
though they almost never had baseballs. They would cut three
grapefruit-sized holes in a strip of cardboard, and hang this from
two stakes jammed into the sands of a nearby beach. They would have
contests on who could throw a rock or whatever object they had
through a particular hole. When Rivera was a teen-ager, he started
joining his father on the boats, and could not believe how hard the
work was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't the life I wanted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was thrilled to sign with the Yankees at age 20, became
stronger and started throwing harder, and realized immediately how
much he liked what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the national rotation of reporters would ask Rivera
two or three times a week about the game-tying home run Sandy
Alomar hit against him when the Yankees were four outs away from
winning the division series in 1997, about the homer's impact on
Rivera's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of these questions increased dramatically once the
playoffs began, and Rivera always patiently and respectfully
answered. But it was apparent, if you happened to eavesdrop
repeatedly on these conversations, that Alomar's home run did not
haunt Rivera at all, that he truly believed the blow to be a
one-time phenomenon, and if not for the endless inquiries, he would
have all but forgotten about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could throw the same pitch in the same spot,'' Rivera said,
shrugging, ``and he probably couldn't hit it the same way again. I
supplied the power for that. He just put the bat on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad at the time. But, when it was over, what could I do
about it? It was already behind me. What's the sense in worrying
about it? What good does that do you? Why get upset? Just enjoy
yourself. When you have doubts, you're done, you're history, you're
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera saved 43 games in 52 attempts in 1997 and 36 in 41
chances in '98; he has become better each year, better and more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to work on my sinker this year,'' Rivera said. ``You
will see more sinkers, and I think the ground balls will go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Throwing strikes is easy. But making the ball move, that's what
Rivera is all about now. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An intensifying late winter storm near Montreal will draw mild,
moist air into northern New England on brisk winds from the
southeast. Heavy rain will taper off during the afternoon, but
flooding is likely on some streams and rivers due to the combined
rainfall and snow melt. A swath of relatively dry, but cooler air
will cover southern New England where winds will be brisk.
</P>
<P>
   The backwash of chilly, moist air associated with a large vortex
at 20,000 feet over New York will bring clouds and snow showers to
much of the eastern Ohio Valley and central Appalachians. Several
inches of wet snow will accumulate from southwest New York through
western Pennsylvania to central West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of high pressure in the eastern Gulf of Mexico
and the storm over Quebec will produce a dry and cooler air flow
over the Southeast. Abundant sunshine will boost afternoon readings
to seasonal levels. Florida will be less humid with bright and
pleasant conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A push of very warm air into the central Plains will proceed a
cold front from the Pacific. Near record temperatures are likely
from west Texas to central Kansas. Clouds will vary in coverage
over the Midwest and northern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Light snow will fall in northern Wyoming and parts of Montana as
cooler air pushes into the region. Onshore winds will promote
clouds and some showers along the Northwest Coast. The Southwest
will be sunny and a bit warmer as high pressure builds inland
across California. It will become windy in the deserts.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Two Faces of Spring &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tornado drills had to be canceled in North Carolina last week
due to a wintry weather. On Sunday, forecasters in the Carolinas
found themselves in another quandary. A strong cold front was
promoting the risk of severe thunderstorms near the coast while
cold, moist air rushing into the Smokeys was prompting winter
weather advisories for snow. Winter and summer conditions can meet
in March as large temperature contrasts are juxtaposed by powerful
fronts. Indeed, this week should feature more incidents of winter
and summer in the same state due to a front in the middle of the
nation. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Late on a chilly October night three years
ago, Larry Harper told his family that he felt life was no longer
worth living, and headed out the door with a handgun. He had
slipped back to using crack cocaine after being in drug treatment,
and was ashamed to face his wife and brother.
</P>
<P>
   The family called the Albuquerque police for help. In response,
a paramilitary unit _ nine men clad in camouflage and armed with
automatic rifles and stun grenades _ stormed into the park where
Harper had gone in despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go get the bad guy'' were the last words Hope Harper
heard as the Special Weapons and Tactics squad brushed by her on a
hunt for her husband, leaving the family in the dark at the edge of
the park.
</P>
<P>
   Police marksmen chased Harper through the woods, found him
cowering behind a juniper tree, and shot and killed him from 43
feet away. He had committed no crime and had threatened only
himself. The police said the fact that he was holding a gun made
him a target.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, a 33-year-old plumber, was one of 32 people killed by
Albuquerque officers in the last 10 years, 11 of them by the SWAT
team. The police here have killed more people than any other
department of its size in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Harper case proved to be the one that broke the Albuquerque
SWAT team. The family sued. And last fall, the city dismantled the
squad as a full-time unit and paid the family $200,000 in an
out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Why a city of 400,000 would need a full-time paramilitary unit
is a question that should have been asked years ago, said the new
police chief, Jerry Galvin. The answer, a decade ago, would have
been crack cocaine and the heavily armed gangs fighting over the
crack trade. But what started as a response to the violent front of
the war on drugs has evolved, here and in cities across the nation,
into a new world of policing.
</P>
<P>
   Special Weapons and Tactics squads, once used exclusively for
the rare urban terrorist incident or shootout, transformed
themselves through the crack years into everyday parts of city
life. In large urban areas, paramilitary units now do everything
from routine street patrols to nightly raids of houses. Even small
towns have formed paramilitary police units. The Cape Cod town of
Harwich, Mass., for example, population 11,000, has trained a
10-man SWAT team.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by federal grants, surplus equipment handed out by
the military and seizure laws that allow police departments to keep
much of what their special units take in raids, the Kevlar-helmeted
brigades have grown dramatically, even in the face of plummeting
crime figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the militarization of Mayberry,'' said Dr. Peter Kraska,
a professor of criminal justice at Eastern Kentucky University, who
surveyed police departments nationwide and found that their
deployment of paramilitary units had grown tenfold since the early
1980s. ``This is unprecedented in American policing and you have to
ask yourself: What are the unintended consequences?''
</P>
<P>
   It was the escalation of the drug war that brought
military-style policing into most American cities. The police felt
outgunned and underarmored against gangs. But now that the worst
violence associated with the gang and crack wars of the '80s has
faded, the police presence has remained and, in many cases,
escalated.
</P>
<P>
   Some police officers say the expansion of SWAT into a role as
the fist of the drug war and beyond is good police work. With
proper training, these units should reduce loss of life, not add to
it, they say. And some communities plagued by violence and turf
battles over drugs say they welcome a paramilitary presence in
their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   During a routine SWAT patrol in a poor neighborhood in Fresno,
Calif., Sgt. Randy Dobbins said: ``You look at the way we're
dressed and all these weapons and this helicopter overhead _ we
could not do this if people in the community didn't support us.
Some people are afraid to be seen with us, but a lot of others come
out and cheer us when we show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraska found that nearly 90 percent of the police departments he
surveyed in cities of more than 50,000 people had paramilitary
units, as did about 75 percent of the departments of communities
under 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   In South Bend, Ind., the police have used SWAT teams to serve
warrants on small-time marijuana dealers. In St. Petersburg, Fla.,
the teams were deployed, to considerable criticism, to ensure order
during a civic parade.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in black or olive camouflage known as battle dress
uniforms, the paramilitary squads use armored personnel carriers,
stun grenades and Heckler &AMP; Koch MP5s, which are submachine guns
advertised to police departments with the line ``From the Gulf War
to the Drug War _ battle proven.''
</P>
<P>
   When earlier this month New York police officers fatally shot a
West African immigrant named Amadou Diallo, firing 41 bullets at
the unarmed man, it was considered by some critics as a logical
consequence of a police department that views patrolling certain
neighborhoods as war duty.
</P>
<P>
   In other cities, Kraska found in his study, police paramilitary
units got into trouble when they were used beyond their original
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Some police chiefs and academics acknowledge the enormous growth
of paramilitary police but dispute the criticism of how they are
used. Most SWAT teams rarely shoot anyone, and 96 percent of all
raids end with no shots fired, according to the National Tactical
Officers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want people who are highly trained and highly
disciplined,'' said David Klinger, a professor of sociology at the
University of Houston, who is studying SWAT teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense to me for Bubba Bob the sheriff to have on his
staff a couple of guys or girls who have been through extensive
tactical training,'' Klinger, a former Los Angeles police officer,
added. ``But if what you have is some cowboy idiot who wants to be
the tough guy, that doesn't help anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the squads stay in existence because there is too much
incentive not to, police officers say. Forfeiture laws passed by
Congress at the height of the crack scare were designed to take the
profit out of drug dealing; assets like cars, boats, guns and cash
can be seized, regardless of whether the person who owns them is
later convicted.
</P>
<P>
   But the laws have given the police a profit motive for fighting
drugs, because their departments can use what they seize to
subsidize their budgets or buy extra equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And since the end of the Cold War, the military's giveaway of
surplus hardware has proved irresistible to many SWAT teams. An
amphibious armored personnel carrier has just been picked up by the
Boone County sheriff's office in Indiana, and bayonets were
recently accepted, then rejected, by the police in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was offered tanks, bazookas, anything I wanted,'' said Nick
Pastore, former police chief of New Haven, Conn. ``I turned it all
down, because it feeds a mind-set that you're not a police officer
serving a community, you're a soldier at war.''

<P>
   The Patrol
</P>
<P>
   Police in Armor, Residents on Bikes
</P>
<P>
   ``War'' is the word most often used in Fresno, a depressed city
of about 400,000 people in the San Joaquin Valley. In Fresno, more
than in any other city, paramilitary police have become a part of
everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when the moon was full and night temperatures so low
that the oranges held a wisp of frost, the Fresno SWAT squad,
called the Violent Crime Suppression Unit, was back in familiar
territory: the poor and largely black section of town known as the
Dog Pound, where drug dealing is concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe what this place used to be like,'' said
Dobbins, leading a group of camouflaged officers on their nightly
patrol. ``People were prisoners of their homes. Police officers
were shot at routinely. The bad guys had no fear.''
</P>
<P>
   An 11-year veteran, Dobbins is proud of the fact that crime has
fallen in Fresno, as elsewhere. Like other members of the unit, he
has a semiautomatic Beretta pistol, a Heckler &AMP; Koch MP5 submachine
gun and a 12-round shotgun called the Street Sweeper at his
disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Since its start, the Fresno unit has tried to recruit ethnic
minorities, though it remains overwhelmingly white. The 34-member
unit has access to two helicopters equipped with night-vision
goggles and people-detecting heat sensors, an armored personnel
carrier with a turret, and an armored van that serves as a portable
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The armored personnel carrier, a gift from the military with the
words ``FRESNO SWAT'' brightly painted on it, is used mainly to
serve drug warrants in potentially dangerous situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't like the perception,'' Dobbins said.
``They wonder why the heck does the Police Department need this
kind of equipment. But you can't understand what it's like to be
shot at, and what a difference it makes when you're in one of
these.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood was relatively quiet. Two pedestrians were
stopped and searched for drugs. A car with a missing headlight was
stopped; its driver was handcuffed and told to sit on the sidewalk
while the trunk was searched. Nothing was found.
</P>
<P>
   Several cars from the unit went on a high-speed chase of a
stolen car. The occupants, tracked by dogs, dashed from the car and
were chased through several yards but escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a small house behind a high fence, said to be a drug
haven, Dobbins said, ``We've raided this house five times.'' Drugs,
mostly crack cocaine, are what keep the Violent Crime Suppression
Unit in business. People are stopped for minor offenses, and can
then be arrested for possessing drugs or having outstanding
warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say anyone we're going to find milling around here is
usually involved with crack or high on crack,'' said Gunther Meiss,
a former Los Angeles police officer now with Fresno's SWAT squad.
He described his work as ``a lot of fun.''.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the young men seen on the neighborhood streets were
riding bikes. ``That's what has happened to a lot of the drug
dealers,'' Dobbins said. ``We've impounded their cars.''
</P>
<P>
   People in the community seemed to accept all the action, the
police lights, the constant presence of screeching tires and
barking dogs that sound like firecrackers, as the price of a
certain kind of peace. City officials say they have received very
few complaints from citizens, and random interviews confirmed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be drug addicts everywhere,'' said Lydia
Covarrubio, who has lived in Fresno for 30 years, speaking as
officers with dogs chased two people through back yards in her
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Fresno had a record 85 homicides and 2,810 robberies,
and officers were fired at a dozen times. The crime spike was
blamed on gangs selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a real sense that the bad guys had control of the
streets,'' said the Fresno police chief, Ed Winchester. ``We were
desperate. But we certainly could not have deployed heavily armed
SWAT-like units without the support of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit became a permanent part of the department the following
year, in 1995. In four years, crime has fallen dramatically,
matching the plunge across the nation. Winchester said the
paramilitary units deserved part of the credit, though he
acknowledged other factors.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in crime raises a question about how long the city
needs to keep paramilitary patrols on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we pulled out, the drug dealers would come back with a
vengeance,'' said Lt. Greg Coleman, the unit commander. ``Drug
dealers are replaced right away. If you arrest one, there's another
to take his place.''
</P>
<P>
   So they are left with each other, the officers with submachine
guns and helicopters, and the drug dealers on bicycles, in what the
police say is a ceaseless struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The Message
</P>
<P>
   Small Arrests Show Who Is in Control
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 57,000, Meriden, Conn., does not fit the
image of an urban crime nightmare. But in Meriden, as in Fresno,
crack and other drugs prompted a desperate move to create a special
paramilitary unit.
</P>
<P>
   Meriden formed its SWAT team in 1986, when crack cocaine was
starting to appear all over the United States. The unit now has 29
members who are used nearly full time. Other small cities and towns
have SWAT-trained officers but use them only occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street-level drug dealing just took off with crack,'' said Lt.
Steve Lagere, who heads the Meriden SWAT team. ``We could pull up
to the projects and have five youths selling drugs at one time,
right out in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in Meriden, as in Fresno, the team arrests people for minor
offenses, attacking small crimes as a way to send a larger message
about who is in control. About 90 percent of the unit's
deployments, Lagere said, involve drug-related work, primarily in
the city's housing projects and surrounding neighborhoods, which
tend to be black and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Kraska's survey found that paramilitary units in small and
medium-sized communities were most often used to knock down the
doors of houses to search for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The police acknowledge the change. Some shrug; others are
alarmed. ``I don't think it was intended to be used this way,''
Lagere said. But a well-trained tactical squad can better serve a
drug warrant in a potentially dangerous situation than a community
police officer can, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it is, my officers are not of the military,
shoot-first assault style,'' he said. ``We have a different
attitude. We're going to use everything we can to ensure there is
little violence. And we don't care if we're dealing with the lowest
vermin in the street, it's `yes sir, no sir.' We never dehumanize
these people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Overall crime is down about 30 percent in the past five years,
Lagere said. But when asked if the original purpose of establishing
the paramilitary unit _ to reduce heavy drug use and dealing, by
maintaining a heavy show of force _ had been achieved, he was less
sure. Like most police officers interviewed in the trenches of the
drug war, he expressed a sense of futility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be looking at some other option,'' he said. ``It's
politically incorrect to say that as a cop. You really can't
discuss it much here, because people will think you're soft on
drugs. But I don't see crack use going up or down, no matter what
we've tried to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the Quinnipiac River from Meriden, the city of New Haven
has been through a similar scourge of drugs and violence. And in
the last five years, it has also seen crime rates fall
dramatically. But the city did not expand the role of its rarely
used SWAT team. Instead, the police say, they brought the crime
rate down by rejecting the militarized approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some tough-guy cops in my department pushing for bigger
and more hardware,'' said Pastore, who was the police chief from
1990 to 1997. ``They used to say, `It's a war out there.' They like
SWAT because it's an adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   New Haven, a city of 130,000, emphasized community policing,
making officers walk the beat on city streets or in housing
projects. ``The approach you take creates a mind-set,'' Pastore
said. ``If you think everyone who uses drugs is the enemy, then
you're more likely to declare war on the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagere, in Meriden, said his town used both community policing
and a heavy SWAT presence. The SWAT team has never killed anyone,
he said. But other police officers argue that using paramilitary
squads for assaults, sweeps and raids increases the likelihood of
accidents or shootings.
</P>
<P>
   They point to two cases in New England. When the SWAT team in
Fitchburg, Mass., stormed an apartment looking for a drug dealer in
December 1996, it ended up gutting an entire apartment house. A
stun grenade, designed as distraction, flashed in a predictable
burst but also ignited a sofa, which grew into a fire that consumed
the building. Six officers were injured, and 24 people were left
without a home.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a SWAT team's drug raid on the wrong apartment
in Boston led to the death of a minister, the Rev. Accelyne
Williams, from a heart attack. A settlement with Williams' widow
cost the city $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Evolution
</P>
<P>
   Less Militaristic and More Selective
</P>
<P>
   As small and midsized cities expand the reach of their
drug-fighting paramilitary squads, the nation's original SWAT team,
in Los Angeles, has gone in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   The unit that introduced the term SWAT into the popular lexicon
was formed in 1966, largely in response to a fear of urban
terrorism and riots. Over the years, the Los Angeles squad became
notorious for its battering rams connected to armored carriers, its
constant helicopter presence, its assault-style raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea back then was a lot more militaristic,'' said Officer
Eduardo Funes, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
Now the 67-member team reacts to extremely violent situations,
rather than carrying out assaults. It is rare for it to be called
out on suicide threats or drug warrants, unless there is a strong
likelihood of gunfire, Funes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you see on those TV shows like `Cops' or in the
movies,'' Funes said. ``The philosophy is to have a well-trained,
well-armed group of police officers who can respond and back up
other officers in dangerous situations.''
</P>
<P>
   What fed the expanding role of SWAT teams across the country
were the forfeiture laws that allow the police to keep much of what
they take in raids. There are no figures on the total amount of
property seized by all police departments nationwide, but the
federal government seized more than $4 billion in assets from 1986
to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that the more police departments conduct forfeiture
raids, the more they come to rely on them. ``I call them forfeiture
junkies,'' Pastore said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has upheld the forfeiture laws, but a few
states, including California, have changed the statutes so that a
conviction is required before the police can keep the property.
</P>
<P>
   Surplus military gear has also flooded into SWAT squads'
lockers. Between 1995 and 1997 alone, the Department of Defense
gave police departments 1.2 million pieces of military hardware,
including 73 grenade launchers and 112 armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But Klinger, who patrolled the streets of South Central Los
Angeles before he became a scholar on police behavior, said he does
not think the raids ultimately do much to curb drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should legalize drugs, and law enforcement should get out
of the business of treating drugs as a crime problem,'' Klinger
said. ``This is not an unusual position in the tactical squad
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alternatives
</P>
<P>
   Measuring Success by Those Who Live
</P>
<P>
   When Sam Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the
University of Nebraska at Omaha, reviewed the cases of all the
people killed by the Albuquerque police, he was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of killings by police was just off the charts,'' said
Walker, who was hired by the city to study the department. ``They
had an organizational culture within their SWAT team that led them
to escalate situations upward, rather than de-escalating.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what happened to Larry Harper, his family
believes. At the time the police shot him, as he cowered behind a
tree, he wanted to live and was ready to go home, said his brother
James Harper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking of my brother crying out, `Leave me alone, I
haven't done anything,' and their response, which was to kill
him,'' said Harper, who comes from a line of law-enforcement
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin, the Albuquerque police chief, also saw a need for change
after he was hired last year. ``I did away with the SWAT team,''
Galvin said in an interview. ``We have SWAT capability, because I
think it is a necessary function of any police department. But
there is no longer a full-time unit in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Most drug raids, suicide calls and other types of volatile
police actions do not need a full paramilitary response, he said.
``If you have a mind-set that the goal is to take out a citizen, it
will happen,'' Galvin said. ``A successful intervention for us now
is one where nobody gets killed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, the paramilitary unit has been taken off most drug
raids, which are carried out instead by the narcotics squad. In
Seattle, the SWAT team is also out of the business of drug raids
and suicide calls. Nor do the Seattle police use a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   But in Fresno, or Meriden, or Champaign, Ill., where the SWAT
teams serve most of the drug warrants, there are no plans to
retreat. The officers in camouflage and helmets, carrying MP5s and
Street Sweeper shotguns, are part of the night.

PUSHING THE ENVELOPE FOR A GREAT PASTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Oggie, oggie, oggie, oi, oi, oi!''
</P>
<P>
   You won't hear that cheer rising from a crowd at the Kingdome,
KeyArena or Husky Stadium. That's because Seattle's sports teams
don't attract nearly enough athletes or fans from Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   Can Gary Payton, Ken Griffey Jr. or Mike Holmgren accurately
describe an oggie? I doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   Have any Seattle fans ever tasted an oggie? Not likely. Their
mouths are stuffed with hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   As any Cornishman could tell you, a ``tiddly oggie'' is a
meat-and-vegetable-filled delicacy also known as the Cornish pasty.
The crust is shaped something like an envelope, which is why some
Welsh miners described it as ``a letter from home.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife was raised on pasties in Butte, Mont., where Cornishmen
once arrived in great numbers to work in the mines. We were
reintroduced to them a year ago when we traveled through the
village of Polperro, where pasty shops outnumber churches and
public houses.
</P>
<P>
   One bite of a steaming-hot pasty immediately inspires
enthusiasm. Which is why Cornish sports fans holler, ``Oggie,
oggie, oggie, oi, oi, oi,'' in support of local heroes at rugby
matches and the occasional women's lawn bowling final.
</P>
<P>
   They take their pasties very seriously in southern England.
</P>
<P>
   An authentic Cornish pasty must contain potato, onion, meat and
turnip. The vegetables must be sliced, not cubed. The meat must be
cut, never minced. Some of the toughest kinds of beef, like skirt
or chuck steak, produce the best pasties.
</P>
<P>
   A law passed in 1967 decreed that any pasty sold in a shop or
restaurant must contain 12.5 percent meat. Tradition dictates the
dough surrounding the filling should be crimped across the top, not
the sides. It must be brushed with water or milk and a small slit
in the top acting as a chimney is judged both on size and neatness.
</P>
<P>
   The pasty was mentioned in English literature as early as 1300.
The cook in ``Canterbury Tales'' was chastised for serving pasties
that had been reheated.
</P>
<P>
   Pasties are recommended as a meal to be taken into the mine.
Carried aboard a fishing vessel, it is an evil omen more dangerous
than a floating mine. If the captain discovers a pasty aboard his
vessel, his only remedy is to immediately break off both ends. This
lets the devil out.
</P>
<P>
   The above information is contained in ``The Pasty Book'' by
Hettie Merrick. She apparently is known far and wide as the Pasty
Queen of Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   My wife never claimed a similar title in Butte. But she makes a
pretty good pasty and she makes it like this.
</P>
<P>
   Alice's Pasty
</P>
<P>
   For pastry:
</P>
<P>
   3 and three-quarters cups flour
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-quarter cup shortening
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vinegar
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup very cold water
</P>
<P>
   For filling:
</P>
<P>
   4 cups peeled and thinly sliced red potatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 medium onions, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 turnips, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half pounds skirt or flank steak, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   Cut the shortening into the flour and salt until crumbly. You
can do this by juggling six carving knives or, better yet, with a
kitchen tool known as a pastry blender.
</P>
<P>
   Beat egg and vinegar together. Add cold water and stir. Add
liquid to flour and shortening and mix just until dough holds
together. Divide into 6 balls.
</P>
<P>
   Roll each section of dough out on a floured board. What you want
to create is a crust 8-by-8 inches with rounded corners.
</P>
<P>
   Create a layer of potatoes in the center of the pastry square.
Salt and pepper. Top with a layer of onion and turnip, then a layer
of meat, then more salt and plenty of pepper. Repeat until you have
six pasties.
</P>
<P>
   Bring two sides of each pasty together and crimp the dough
across the top, folding ends in. Create a small hole or vent in the
top of the pasty. Bake in a 350-degree oven for about an hour,
brushing the dough with milk halfway through the baking process.
</P>
<P>
   I like my pasty served with beef gravy on the side, but that's
not going to be practical if you insist on eating yours at the
bottom of a tin mine.
</P>
<P>
   Do your own thing. I think I'll add a side dish like this one.
</P>
<P>
   Devonshire Carrots
</P>
<P>
   5 carrots, peeled and quartered
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon ginger
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup orange juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Cover carrots with water in skillet and cook just until tender.
Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, mix sugar, cornstarch, salt, ginger and orange juice.
Stir-cook to thicken. Add the butter and when it has melted, pour
the sauce over the carrots.

paramilitary units now do everything from routine street patrols to
nightly house raids. Even small towns have formed paramilitary
police units. The Cape Cod town of Harwich, Mass., for example,
population 11,000, has trained a 10-man SWAT team. Encouraged by
federal grants, surplus equipment handed out by the military, and
seizure laws that allow police departments to keep much of what
their special units take in raids, the special units have grown
dramatically, even in the face of plummeting crime figures. (Second

A POPULAR CHANCELLOR, EVEN IF HIS GOVERNANCE SOMETIMES WAVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ There he was last week, the German chancellor, no less,
on a television talk show being asked if he would submit to a test
that would determine if the color of his abundant dark brown hair
was real. Yes, Gerhard Schroeder said with a coy grin, ``This is
all genuine, really everything.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment that captured the extent of Germany's
transformation during the four-month rule of the 54-year-old
Schroeder. His predecessor, Helmut Kohl, rarely appeared on talk
shows, let alone to talk about his (gray) hair. Schroeder, a
white-toothed modern image merchant, has popularized the exercise
of power.
</P>
<P>
   Germans tend to like the change: Schroeder's personal popularity
remains high. But has Germany's first Social Democratic chancellor
in 16 years also trivialized governance, to the point where
Europe's most powerful country is sublimely coiffed at the top but
dangerously rudderless?
</P>
<P>
   Abrupt policy shifts on immigration and nuclear power,
discordant ministerial voices, rising unemployment, signs of
recession and messy decision-making by committee have all raised
sharp questions about Schroeder. ``Where is the line?'' the
conservative weekly Die Zeit asked. The centrist Berlin Tagespiegel
was blunter last week, alluding to ``lunatic amateurism.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodo Hombach, the chancellor's chief of staff, said in an
interview that the government needed time. ``In many ways we are a
blocked society, but you cannot push things through here over the
objections of others,'' he said. ``Action by consensus is an old
German tradition, and we will build the necessary bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   But time seems short. Uncertain government matters less when an
economy is strong and a country's self-image stable. But Germany's
combination of stalled growth, an aging population, disappearing
jobs, uneasy relations between its eastern and western regions,
charged politics of immigration and a continuing quest for a
``normal'' identity appears treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, Europe's infant common currency, has fallen 7 percent
against the dollar in a month as Germany's economics minister has
done something long unthinkable: He has bickered with central
bankers. The German economy shrank 0.4 percent in the last quarter
of 1998, a grim sign when unemployment under Schroeder, far from
falling by 1 million as he promised, has already surged to 11.5
percent, from 10.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the international front, Germany's relations with its
European allies and with the United States are in the midst of a
difficult adjustment reflecting the arrival in power of a new, more
assertive postwar German generation.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Glavany, the French agricultural minister, expressed his
country's dismay by declaring last week that Schroeder's demands
for a cut in Germany's huge contribution to the European Union
budget reminded him of Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   From a Gallic source, such criticism suggests that the
French-German alliance, long at the heart of European integration,
is in trouble _ or at the very least in flux.
</P>
<P>
   Elected, like Bill Clinton in 1992, on a largely domestic
agenda, Schroeder has found himself thrust abruptly into difficult
international issues _ among them reform of the European Union
budget and NATO _ for which his government has sometimes appeared
poorly prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allies are somewhat flabbergasted,'' said Joachim Krauze,
deputy director of the German Society for Foreign Affairs.
``Germany demanding its interests in an assertive way, Germany no
longer viewing the independence of the European central bank as
sacrosanct. It's worrying and I don't think it's productive.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it is what most Germans want. Although opinion polls
have recently shown that Schroeder's coalition of Social Democrats
and environmentalist Greens would be defeated if a new election
were held today, the chancellor's own popularity was estimated at
more than 70 percent last month by Der Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that the chancellor's glad-handing style, his
informality, his preference for talking about the future rather
than the trauma of Germany's past, his popular touch, even his
readiness to talk hair have struck a chord with a generation of
Germans tired of Kohl's history lessons and ``visions'' of
Germany's place in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Schroeder has understood that people want to be left in
peace,'' said Bernhard Schlink, the novelist. ``What we have is a
generation of nice passive consumers who are busy in a nice passive
way. Why should they bother about big ideas, projects, goals and
ambitions?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, though, that Germany does appear to have to resolve
some basic problems in order to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   One is whether this is ``a country of immigration,'' as
Schroeder's coalition initially proposed. Another linked question
is whether Germany's vaunted ``social market'' economy, built on
consensus between unions and employers and on extensive social
insurance, has stalled irrevocably. If it has, immigration could
clearly become an explosive question. No sinking economy embraces
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Schroeder was obliged to reverse course on a major
element of his proposal to make German citizenship easier to
acquire for the country's 7.3 million foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Faced by a petition that had already gathered 1 million
signatures against his plans, and by a defeat last month to
Christian Democrats in a state election in Hesse, he dropped a
proposal that dual citizenship be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was important because many of Germany's more than 2
million Turks are reluctant to give up Turkish citizenship (that
alone confers the right to buy land in Turkey) although they want
to become Germans, and gain, for instance, the right to vote in all
elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the chancellor perceived _ albeit belatedly _ that his
entire immigration revision, aimed at changing a 1913 citizenship
law based largely on blood lines, would collapse if this measure
was not abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, as in an earlier reversal on banning the export of
nuclear waste, he appeared to have been carelessly drawn into an
untenable position by his Green coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We underestimated the reaction on dual citizenship, but we
will still get a new immigration law that will critically redefine
German identity,'' said Karsten Voigt, a Social Democratic Foreign
Ministry official. ``That is the main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder seems certain to face a battle even on the rest of
his proposed law allowing foreigners to request citizenship after
eight years of residence _ instead of 15 _ and granting automatic
citizenship to children born here who have at least one parent who
has lived in Germany since the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Stoiber, the powerful conservative governor of Bavaria,
was in a thunderous mood in Parliament last week as he declared,
``The majority of German people don't want this law.'' Wolfgang
Schauble, leader of the Christian Democrats, said Schroeder was
``responsible for chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that the immigration issue has become steadily more
sensitive as Schroeder has so far failed in his central electoral
pledge: to reduce the number of unemployed in Germany by at least 1
million people.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, unemployment lines have lengthened by more than 500,000
people in just four months.
</P>
<P>
   If the chancellor has a discernible passion _ rather than issues
that are merely material for image management _ it is putting
Germans back to work. Unlike Kohl, the new chancellor does not seem
deeply moved by either European integration nor the trans-Atlantic
relationship. In personal and political terms, unemployment is
critical.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Schroeder, who likes to moderate quietly between
opposing factions rather than lead from the front, has asked
Hombach to take the initiative at the head of a so-called Alliance
for Jobs. This group of labor unions and employers is reviewing
issues including taxation, social security, working hours,
pensions, wages, training and education.
</P>
<P>
   Call it German consensus-making writ large. It is unwieldy,
slow, and just possibly productive. A lot of people seem to agree
on the basic problem: the German labor market is too regulated and
too weighed down with high social security charges to generate
jobs. But, as Hombach said, ``To get from knowledge to action in
this society is extremely difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hombach, about $350 billion is earned annually in
the German black economy. ``We probably have four times more worker
hours in this black economy than we need to get rid of unemployment
completely. So the problem is clear: How do you get this labor out
from under?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, he said, was clear enough: bring down the taxes and
charges on legal salaries that make people prefer the combination
of off-the-books wages and unemployment benefits to a regular job.
</P>
<P>
   But that, of course, might eventually imply a partial
dismantling of the health and other insurance benefits enjoyed by
Germans and immigrants _ an explosive suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as Nixon was the only American who could go to China and
make peace, the Social Democrats are the only ones who can
eventually push through a reform of our economic model,'' Hombach
said. ``But any solution has to be one that allows everyone to
benefit from our economic success. American style ultra-liberalism
is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany still seems very far from agreement on reform. Indeed a
wage rise of 4 percent (with inflation at close to zero) won last
month by the huge IG Metall engineering union _ which sets the bar
for all other unions _ had many business executives in a fury.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Schroeder is tempted to emulate Tony Blair of
Britain. But Blair, of course, could build on what Mrs. Thatcher
had already done. The chancellor, by contrast, has everything to do
and a divided Social Democratic Party to deal with, in which
resistance to market reform and deregulation remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   The figurehead for that resistance is Oskar Lafontaine, the
economics minister and party chairman. He and the European central
bank governor, Wim Duisenberg of Holland, have been engaged in
extraordinary low-level warfare as Lafontaine suggests lower
interest rates are really the answer to Germany's _ and Europe's _
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Duisenberg said pointedly _ and huffily _ that he had
never read the book on economics written recently by Lafontaine and
his wife, and that he had ``absolutely no intention'' of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   As in many of his government's tiffs and travails, Schroeder has
not intervened decisively, leaving the impression that Germany is
ready to abandon its long sacrosanct monetary orthodoxy in pursuit
of murky new goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basic decisions have been left untaken, basic lines left
unclear,'' said Krauze, the foreign policy expert. ``A lot of time
has been lost on issues that are basically luxuries _ like giving
up nuclear power. We need direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has promised to provide it soon, speaking of
``technical problems'' in the first months. He leads a coalition
made up of a party that has not been in power for almost a
generation and another that has never been in power. Teething
problems were probably inevitable. But further drift looks
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will get there,'' Hombach said, ``and with a style that is
less encrusted, more relaxed, more open, more frank.''

years, North Korea posed a threat to 37,000 American troops and the
South Korean capital of Seoul,'' Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., told
his committee Thursday. ``Now they are threatening our mainland. In
short, we must now worry about our safety in Seattle, not just
Seoul.'' Gilman was referring to reports by U.S. and Japanese
defense experts that North Korea now has the technology to launch a
long-range ballistic missile capable of reaching the northwest
coast of the United States.

HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES TOP ALBRIGHT'S AGENDA IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Every time a secretary of state comes to China,
Congress watches closely. And perhaps no more so than on this
week's brief visit by Madeleine Albright, who arrived here Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before she left, the Senate passed a unanimous resolution
calling on the Clinton administration to condemn China's human
rights policy at the meeting this month of the U.N. human rights
commission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   While she was en route, the State Department released its annual
human rights report chastising China for regression on the matter
and expressing disappointment that China had not delivered on the
improvement in human rights it had promised.
</P>
<P>
   On board her plane, Albright's spokesman, James R. Rubin,
described as deplorable the detention of one dissident and the
18-month sentence given another late last week by the Chinese
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has prided itself on broadening its China
policy in the last several years from being focused on just human
rights to encompassing other issues, including trade and developing
what the administration dubbed a ``strategic partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the budding relationship with China in retreat,
Albright will touch on a host of problems that enrage the Chinese,
from a proposal for a theater missile defense system in Asia to the
cancellation of the sale of a U.S. satellite to a company with ties
to the Chinese military.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will also grill the Chinese on why they cannot help out
more in controlling nuclear developments in North Korea, and gauge
their readiness to join the World Trade Organization,
administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, insisting on anonymity, declined to put an order
of priority on the long list of problems that the Chinese would
raise with Albright or that she would put to them.
</P>
<P>
   But one of her tasks, Rubin said, will be to ``tell it like it
is'' about Washington's expectations on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rubin and other administration officials who
have prepared Albright for this trip said they were uneasy with the
approach of many in Congress who believe that sponsoring a
resolution against the Chinese in Geneva is the best policy.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have argued in recent weeks that a
resolution against China may make members of Congress feel good but
does not necessarily reap results.
</P>
<P>
   China objects to the resolution as an infringement of its
sovereignty. It sounded a similar tone in its official response to
the State Department human rights report, expressing indignation
and resentment at what it termed U.S. meddling in China's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Chinese officials have argued that because of
the nation's mounting economic problems and unprecedented numbers
of unemployed, they cannot allow political dissent from the ruling
Communist Party. The government has expressed concern about the
potential of sudden widespread social instability, particularly in
the 50th anniversary year of the Communist takeover of China and
the 10th anniversary of the student protests and deaths in Tianamen
Square.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Albright's talks could serve to assess how the Chinese would
react if Washington went ahead with a resolution in Geneva in late
March. The problem is made even more vexing because the Chinese
prime minister, Zhu Ronghi, is due in Washington for an official
visit on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time since 1991, Washington did not
introduce a resolution against China in Geneva, saying China had
made some progress in human rights. The Chinese would see any U.S.
move toward a resolution this year as a sharp deterioration in
their relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But with three democracy activists jailed late last year for 11
to 13 years and deepening pressure from Congress to take a stand in
Geneva, the administration must decide soon what to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva resolution has become such a flash point among China
policy makers in the administration that one senior official
involved in the decision said he refused to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   This official said Albright would not merely ask the Chinese to
release political prisoners, or review their number, but encourage
China to develop its legal system to provide more protection for
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong office of the Information Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement in China said Sunday night that the
organizers of a planned seminar on human rights in Wuhan over the
weekend had been detained.
</P>
<P>
   The office also said members of the banned Democracy Party in
Beijing had written a letter to the National People's Congress,
which is scheduled to meet here on Friday, urging its deputies to
ratify two U.N. covenants on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In what the administration viewed as a move forward, the Chinese
government signed the covenants last year. But they have yet to be
ratified, and the State Department human rights report complained
that the Chinese had not given any indication when that might
happen.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Wu Yilong, the founder of a banned political party,
was detained in Hangzhou for questioning, and a liberal
intellectual, Peng Ming, who had tried to run an independent
discussion forum in Beijing, was sentenced without trial to 18
months in a labor camp.

BOEING'S MACHINIST UNION DOING P.R. IN ADVANCE OF NEGOTIATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Worried that Boeing's management may try to please
Wall Street at the expense of workers, the company's Machinists
union is launching a campaign to woo public support before contract
negotiations begin this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The International Association of Machinists District Lodge 751
has a Seattle public relations firm, Pyramid Communications, and is
working to counter the extraordinary reach of Boeing's lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, union leaders met with President Clinton's National
Economic Council and members of Vice President Al Gore's staff at
the White House, and with Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Machinists plan to carry on the campaign in
Seattle, meeting with state and local elected officials, editorial
boards, and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to give our message to the community and also some
of our elected officials back here, to give our union's perspective
of how we think Boeing is doing leading up to negotiations,'' said
Linda Lanham, legislative and political director for the
Machinists. ``We wanted to tell a little bit about ourselves, what
we'd like from them, the economic impact we have on our community,
so that they are well informed long before we go into the process
of negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The machinists' four-year contract expires Sept. 1, and formal
talks aimed at the next contract are expected to begin in August.
But the two sides have already been talking informally for six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations come at a tough time for Boeing, whose stock
price has been rocked by production troubles and whose upper
management is under fire. The company has set out an ambitious
production schedule this year, even as it is making dramatic
reductions in its payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Although union leaders say they want to avoid labor strife this
year, recent history is not encouraging _ the machinists struck in
1995 and 1989. And the union leaders make no bones about pointing
out how harmful a strike can be, not only to workers, but also to
the company and to area businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing points out that the company's leadership has changed
since the last labor strife, and that the company has negotiated 30
union contracts over the past two years without a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our point of view is that we do not want a strike, and we are
working very hard at all levels to avoid such an outcome,'' said
company spokesman Peter Conte. ``Any prudent company can not go
into this type of negotiation without at least preparing for any
eventuality, but that is not a threat. Our driving intention
throughout this year, and as we go through the negotiations, is to
avoid that outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The union, the largest single-employer private sector bargaining
unit in Washington, has 40,000 active members and 10,000 retired.
The members _ who work in the Seattle area, Spokane, Portland,
Ore., and Wichita, Kan. _ are overwhelmingly male, highly paid and
experienced, with an average age of 43 and an average 10 years at
Boeing, according to union representative Larry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Union President Bill Johnson said the machinists have four major
contract goals:
</P>
<P>
   _ Job security. The union wants to stop the company from
``out-sourcing'' _ transferring jobs from machinists to non-Boeing
workers. This issue has become particularly important to the union
as the company reduces its payroll through layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health care. The union is insistent that its members should
not have to pay any portion of their medical costs, and Johnson
said any proposed co-payment requirement ``is the quickest way to
have a strike in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Pensions and retirement. The union wants better retirement
benefits for former Boeing Machinists, some of whom, they say, now
live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work schedules. The union says Boeing wants to make people
work on weekends without paying them overtime. Johnson say this is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are adamant _ they want the option to have
weekends at home with their families,'' he said. ``If the company
demands that they work on the weekends, we demand premium pay. This
issue is crucial _ our members want more time with their families.
They will strike over this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Conte said none of the issues mentioned by Johnson come as a
surprise. On the issue of weekend work, he said the issue must be
negotiated, but that ``the bottom line is that Boeing needs to be
more competitive, and one area to pursue in becoming more
competitive is having a workforce that is as flexible and talented
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the company and the union agree that a work stoppage would
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any disruption of Boeing is a serious blow to our regional
economy,'' Lanham said. ``The 1995 strike cost Boeing billions of
dollars. Boeing has announced plans to deliver 620 aircraft, up
from 559 in 1998. A strike this year would be devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said she came away from her briefing optimistic about the
union's posture.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I heard them say is that they really want to avert a
strike, and they want to work together as they did in Long Beach,''
she said, referring to the union's ability to reach an agreement
with Boeing over the possible transfer of some 737 jobs to
California. ``Historically, these negotiations have been
contentious, and everybody wants to make sure we go into this
without that kind of rancor.''

<P>
   DETROIT _ Engineers at Lear Corp., the world's largest
independent supplier of automotive interiors, labored for months
last year to come up with a vehicle that would meet all the needs
of older Americans. The seats swivel out for easy access, the
dashboard controls and displays are unusually large and the trunk
floor partly rolls out at the back for easy loading.
</P>
<P>
   When the engineers were finished, they showed the prototype to
the 82-year-old father of the company's chairman _ and were
crestfallen at his response. Looking at the swiveling seats in
particular, he was dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he didn't need it,'' said Marilyn Vala, Lear's
product-analysis manager.
</P>
<P>
   The aging of the U.S. population poses quandaries for businesses
in many industries, but few companies face as many difficult
decisions as automakers and their suppliers. Power, sex and youth
have long been used to sell cars, so anything that suggests to
buyers that they might not be as virile and agile as they once were
could easily backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers don't want to admit they're getting older,'' said
John Wolkonowicz, an auto industry consultant at Arthur D. Little.
``You can't be too catering to age; you have to do it invisibly _
you have to give people vehicles they can get excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet driving or even climbing into a car can be difficult and
sometimes painful for aging bodies. And with millions of baby
boomers every year now entering their 50s, the auto industry is
starting to redesign its vehicles to meet the needs of older
Americans _ without being obvious about it.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons, the average age of new-car buyers is
rising even faster than the average age of the overall population.
Many of these older buyers would be better served by vehicles
designed differently from vehicles for younger buyers, to reflect
the less acute vision and reduced muscular flexibility of bodies
that are 50 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, older Americans have shown little interest in buying
vehicles tailored to their needs, and automakers have paid fairly
little attention to selling such vehicles. Automakers have long
been obsessed with luring young buyers in the hopes that brand
loyalties, once formed, would persist over the 10 or 15 new cars a
prosperous American might buy in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Even car divisions like Buick, Cadillac, Jaguar, Lincoln and
Oldsmobile, which have done very well selling to older Americans,
have shifted their marketing focus to drivers in their 40s and
younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is always going after the young buyer,'' said Ben
Level III, Ford Motor Co.'s executive director of market research.
``You very rarely hear about anyone going after the old buyer _
maybe it's cultural.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs now that attitudes are beginning to change.
The main reason for the subtle shift is the enormous and growing
market that older, more affluent Americans represent. As automakers
try to accommodate their needs, however, they are trying to be as
subtle as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The result _ new car features that are easy to overlook but
reflect a new awareness of older Americans' needs. When the new
Chevrolet Impala midsized sedan goes on sale later this year, for
example, it will have the ignition on the dashboard rather than the
side of the steering column _ a seemingly unimportant choice.
</P>
<P>
   But the ignition will be on the dashboard because General
Motors' engineers and consultants found that slightly arthritic
hands could turn a key sideways more easily if the wrist was not
already bent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the new Ford Focus, a small car that will replace the
Ford Escort later this year, has front-door openings that extend
farther forward on the car at knee level, to make it easier for
older drivers to swing their legs into the car. The Focus and the
new Dodge Neon also have seats that are slightly higher off the
street, partly because many older Americans find it harder to climb
in or out of a low vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Even the new Chevrolet Corvette sports car, long a symbol of
youthful virility, has been redesigned to make it easier for aging
baby boomers to climb in and out. And the trunk has recently been
enlarged to carry golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Auto suppliers say that they are starting to receive many
requests from automakers for parts that are designed for older
Americans. ``The interest is there now _ why it wasn't there five
years ago, I don't know,'' said Kenneth Way, the chairman and chief
executive of Lear.
</P>
<P>
   Lear will publicly display its prototype for an older person's
vehicle on Monday, at the opening of the auto-parts industry's
annual convention here, an event that is expected to include many
products aimed at an aging America. Lear extensively modified a
Dodge Caravan minivan to show all the products that could be
installed on cars to make them easier for older people to use.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, seat-belt manufacturers are working on belts that are
mounted on both sides of each seat and clasp in the front, so that
older customers will not have to twist their bodies to find and
pull seat belts around and across their bodies. Manufacturers are
designing thicker door handles with more contoured grooves for
passengers' fingers, to make them easier to grip.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler and other automakers are experimenting with
prototypes of sedans that would not need side pillars. The rear
doors would open backward with hinges at the rear, so that there
would be more room to climb into the vehicle and so that disabled
drivers could readily swing a folded wheelchair in behind the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Dashboards increasingly feature big knobs and large displays
that are easy to read even with imperfect eyesight. Auto designers
say that such details also attract young buyers at a time when
other fashions include kitchen tools like ice-cream scoops with big
rubber handles that were originally designed for arthritic hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming from the younger generation; they're showing us
that suspenders are OK, and the little granny glasses,'' said Jerry
Hirshberg, Nissan's president of North American design. ``It used
to be if there were a lecture with ergonomics in the name, I'd
probably skip it, but now it has a zing to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto designers and consultants say that no single car will
include all of the possible devices for older Americans, but many
cars will quietly incorporate some features. An old, slightly
ageist, adage in the auto industry says that an old man will buy a
young man's car, but a young man will not buy an old man's car.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Detroit automakers are leery of going too far in
catering to older buyers. They recall the early 1980s, when younger
customers defected in droves to foreign automakers and domestic
manufacturers like Chrysler were left with mostly older drivers,
said David Bostwick, DaimlerChrysler's director of North American
corporate market research.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the median age of new-car buyers in the United States has
risen to 47 from 40 over the last decade, while the median age of
buyers of sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickups has climbed
to 43 from 39, according to automakers' research. Over the same
period, the median age of all Americans has only crept up about
three years to 34.9.
</P>
<P>
   Americans over the age of 55 make up a fifth of the population
but control up to three-quarters of the nation's financial assets,
market researchers estimate. They have benefited handsomely from a
nearly two-decade-long stock-market boom, so they can afford new
cars even though the average price is now around $20,800.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harvey Kornblit and his wife, Doris, who are both 71 years
old and live in Houston, have just bought a new $30,000 Jeep Grand
Cherokee Limited with such features as radio controls on the
steering wheel, so that they no longer have to lean over to change
stations. But the couple chose the vehicle not because of these
features but because they liked the solid feel of its exterior,
Mrs. Kornblit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want is a sturdy body that's metal, not plastic,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Late-model, well-equipped used cars have become increasingly
popular as substitutes for smaller, similarly priced new cars, but
this national trend has taken place mainly among younger buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ideas now being considered to accommodate older
drivers represent a revival of concepts tried and abandoned before.
The former Chrysler Corp., for example, offered optional, swiveling
seats in the late 1950s, although they were not powered and were
marketed to women leery of clambering into cars while wearing tight
skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Piaskowski, DaimlerChrysler's director of passenger-car
and minivan interior design, said that the company would take
another look at swiveling seats. ``Sometimes old ideas,'' he said,
``are good ideas.''

NORTH KOREA MISSILE THREAT BECOMES MORE OF A CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was just a brief comment by the chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, but it was enough to make
Northwesterners sit up and take note.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 40 years, North Korea posed a threat to 37,000 American
troops and the South Korean capital of Seoul,'' Rep. Benjamin
Gilman, R-N.Y., told his committee in Washington, D.C., on
Thursday. ``Now they are threatening our mainland. In short, we
must now worry about our safety in Seattle, not just Seoul.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilman was referring to reports by U.S. and Japanese defense
experts that North Korea now has the technology to launch a
long-range ballistic missile capable of reaching the northwest
coast of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department says the liquid-fueled Taepodong-2 missile
could be tested as early as this year, for the first time putting
this corner of the continental United States within possible range
of North Korean weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scenario that worries a lot of people, including
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Testifying before Gilman's
committee, Albright called North Korea a ``huge threat'' to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The menace posed by North Korea and other so-called ``rogue
states'' has brought renewed calls for a national missile defense
system. On Thursday, the House Armed Services Committee
overwhelmingly approved legislation to make it national policy to
deploy such a system to defend against incoming missiles. It does
not specify a time frame, the costs or the specifics of the system.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's activities also have added urgency to the ongoing
debate among policymakers on how best to deal with one of the
world's most reclusive and repressive regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Why, for example, should the United States and the United
Nations provide millions of dollars in food and other assistance to
prop up a government that spends an estimated 25 percent of its
gross domestic product on the military while its population starves
to death? Why not just leave the nation of 21 million people in
isolation, letting it collapse from within?
</P>
<P>
   That may no longer be an option, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a hardliner on North Korea,'' says Bill
Taylor, senior vice president for international security at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.
``My position has always been that the best policy toward North
Korea is to do nothing _ don't hurt them but don't help them either
_ and eventually that regime is going to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   But as North Korean leader Kim Jong Il shows no sign of losing
his grip on power and fears grow of Pyongyang's military
capabilities, Taylor is questioning some of his past assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe they would lash out, like some fear, if they
implode,'' said Taylor, who has traveled extensively in North
Korea. ``But now I'm beginning to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a country with the world's worst human rights record _
the biggest Stalinist regime on the planet. It's a starving country
_ two to three million people have starved to death _ where
industry is totally on the rocks and they have no fuel but what we
give them.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite its weaknesses, North Korea always seems to have an
ace in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its ballistic missile program, Taylor said, it
has a ground force of some 1.1 million troops, two-thirds of them
deployed near the demilitarized zone and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   It has hundreds of short-range missiles that threaten the
region.
</P>
<P>
   It has a suspected underground nuclear facility at Kumchangni
that U.S. intelligence officials believe is large enough to house
facilities for making plutonium and other weapons-grade material.
The North says the United States can have a look, but first must
agree to pay $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed to have a sizable stockpile of chemical weapons,
including nerve, blister, choking and blood agents, and has been
conducting intensive research on biological weapons for three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seoul is naked,'' says Taylor. ``Pyongyang knows it has got
Seoul, Tokyo and Washington in a bind. There is no missile defense
of Japan, where we've got U.S. troops, and there is no missile
defense of the South, where there are 80,000 Americans _ troops and
other residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the strongest proponent of engagement with North
Korea today is the South, a radical switch from the days when Seoul
opposed any contacts, particularly by third countries. Now, under
President Kim Dae Jung's so-called ``sunshine policy,'' business
and social ties are encouraged while northern provocations are
played down.
</P>
<P>
   But this comprehensive engagement policy, while beginning to
show some signs of success, is also out of necessity, Taylor says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South Koreans have to do it. ... It's a necessity if
they're going to recover economically, if they're going to reduce
tensions and get international investment. If tensions go up, it
will be the end of the South Korean economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, North Korea knows that the South cannot for the
foreseeable future afford reunification _ however it might happen.
Estimated costs for South Korea of a German-style reunification of
the peninsula range from $200 billion to as much as $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Koreans want reunification in their hearts, but they
can't afford it,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea has us over a barrel right now and they know it
and they're going to get what they want.''

TOP-TIER POSITIONS STILL FALL BEYOND GRASP OF MOST WOMEN
DOCTORS  (lh) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This should be the perfect time to be a woman in
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The days of women toiling as a mostly unwelcome presence in the
country's medical schools are long over: Women now account for
roughly 45 percent of all medical students, up from about 25
percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   And once they graduate, they are in high demand: Many patients,
especially women, now request female doctors because, among other
reasons, they are perceived as spending more time with patients.
Further, women's health issues _ breast and ovarian cancer most
prominently _ are front and center in medical research and
political agendas, fostering star-studded fund-raisers, road races
and the like in every major city in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these gains, the top tiers of medicine have remained
inaccessible to many women, largely, experts say, because they are
unwilling or unable to find a balance between the years of study
those specialties require and a life outside of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the picture is bad,'' said Dr. Wendy Chavkin,
editor of the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association.
``Women comprise very few dean and tenured faculty positions, and
there are a lack of them in surgical specialties.'' The main
reason, Dr. Chavkin, said, is that in medicine ``there are still
issues about career pathways that are the least bit off-track, like
taking time off for child rearing.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than giving up their medical careers for their
families, as so many of their predecessors felt forced to do, or
forgoing motherhood altogether, more women doctors today are
finding ways to practice medicine part-time _ as some women in law,
journalism, finance and other demanding fields have been doing for
years.
</P>
<P>
   They are forming practices with other women, or working as
employees for practices run by managed-care companies that give
them a chance for an office life that is closer to 9 to 5,
willingly sacrificing higher salaries for a flexibility that until
recently was virtually unheard of in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study, the Commonwealth Fund, a large private
philanthropic organization in New York, found that 25 percent of
female doctors who were surveyed said that they worked fewer than
40 hours a week, compared with 12 percent of male doctors. And 17
percent of female doctors said they worked 30 hours a week or
fewer, compared with only 8 percent of males.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, the trend of women working fewer hours is
borne out most dramatically among younger doctors. Overall, female
doctors work 9 percent fewer hours than male doctors. But among
female doctors under 45, the number jumps to 15 percent, said
Edward Salsberg, director of the Center for Health Workforce
Studies at the State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergence of managed care has introduced the idea that you
can be an employee,'' said Dr. Erica Frank, an assistant professor
at the Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta, and the principal
investigator of the Women Physicians' Health Study, the largest
national study of female doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can mean more flexible hours and fewer of them, and the
ability to think about medicine as a profession that doesn't
require complete consumption,'' Dr. Frank said. ``And clearly women
are leading the way. The pay is lower. But this might be acceptable
to some people to have more life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rayze Simonson works as an obstetrician in a six-person
practice on the Upper West Side. The practice is run by St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, which takes care of
administrative tasks like billings. That relieves the doctors, five
of whom are women with children, of some of the time-consuming
hassles of running a medical office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was that in a larger group you could balance more
your life and career,'' Dr. Simonson said. ``We are only on call
every sixth night and every sixth weekend, which in ob-gyn is huge
flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while this kind of work has become a welcome option for some
doctors looking for more balanced lives, experts say that is has
created a ``pink-collar'' level of medicine _ in which more women
are concentrated in the lowest-paying, least prestigious
specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the number of women practicing medicine has more
than tripled in the last 20 years, female doctors still earn
roughly two-thirds of their male counterparts' salaries, largely
because they work fewer hours a week and because there are far
fewer of them in the most prestigious and highest-paid specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34,882 female residents in the country in 1997, one-tenth
of 1 percent were in the surgical subspecialties. Or, looked at
another way, of all residents studying surgical specialties, only
17.2 percent of them were women.
</P>
<P>
   And while the average male doctor in private practice in the
United States makes $273,690 a year, his female counterpart makes
$155,590 on average, according to Medical Economics, a trade
journal. Further, 50 percent of female doctors surveyed by the
Commonwealth Fund reported incomes of $100,000 or less, compared
with 22 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   While health experts, including many women, said there was still
sexism in medicine, particularly in the top echelons of academia,
they cited the difficulty of combining a demanding profession with
a family life as the biggest hindrance most female doctors faced in
rising higher in their fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of male doctors still have housewives at home,''
said Dr. Simonson, who has four children, one of them a newborn.
``They can stay at work until 10 p.m., and when they get home,
their kids are bathed, and there is food in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't have the luxury of staying at work late,'' she
added.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   While women in other high-intensity fields face similar
challenges, medicine presents conflicts for women that appear more
intractable, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   There are years of study and grueling hospital training
programs, followed by demanding schedules and unpredictable
patients. And unlike, say, investment banking, there are constant
critical advances in medicine: stay out of the field for two years
to raise children, and one would miss out on entire bodies of
research and treatment developments vital to patients' health.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many women are attracted to pediatrics and primary
care ``simply because there is not as much training,'' said Dr.
Holly Andersen, a 36-year-old cardiologist in Manhattan, especially
since most of that training coincides with a woman's prime
child-bearing years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do men care about this?'' she said. ``They can always
marry 25-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gail Bauchman got her first taste of compromise in medical
school in the 1980s. Although her dream had been to specialize in
obstetrics, she felt that she would have a hard time managing a
family life while tending to patients in labor on weekends and in
the middle of the night. So she chose family medicine instead, and
built a bustling private practice on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   At 36, she decided to try to get pregnant. ``I realized it was
now or never,'' she said. But after giving birth to twins, Avital
and Natalia, in August 1997, compromises turned to disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to return to her full-time practice, but found life
unmanageable. So she looked for a part-time position. ``Most
practices said, `You work full-time or you don't work here,''' Dr.
Bauchman said.
</P>
<P>
   Her solution was to take a part-time job at the Mount Sinai
Adolescent Health Center, for a fraction of her earnings as a
private practice doctor. She said the situation works for her, but
was hardly what she had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this problem with finding the middle ground,'' Dr.
Bauchman said. ``I shouldn't be struggling to find part-time work.
And if these practices close their doors to part-timers, they don't
have the benefit of having a female doctor, and therefore you lose
patients, because patients say that they want that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even while they are earning less on average, female physicians
are more in demand than ever, experts say, particularly in
specialties that cater to female patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alison Estabrook, a prominent breast surgeon and associate
director of the breast center at St. Luke's, remembers sitting
around her family's kitchen table just a decade ago, listening to
her mother's friend say that she would never let a female surgeon
touch her.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a female breast surgeon can ``basically write her own
ticket,'' Dr. Estabrook said. ``As more women patients are seeking
power in their own care they are attracted to strong women
doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Estabrook concedes that part of the market value of female
surgeons is based on supply and demand, because far fewer women
than men are willing to devote their lives to surgery. ``Surgery
creates tremendous conflicts,'' said Dr. Estabrook, 47, who is
married to another doctor. She deliberately chose not have
children, she says, because she could not imagine where she could
trim her professional day.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital administrators say that the demand for female doctors
is not limited to specialties that serve women. ``The minute we put
a female physician in a practice,'' said Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt,
chairman of medicine at New York Presbyterian Hospital, ``the
appointment book becomes fully booked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not only women who appreciate these physicians,'' Dr.
Weisfeldt added. ``I think it deals with professional attitudes.''
He said that studies have shown women tend to spend more time with
patients and to focus on them as people rather than on the
procedures they need.
</P>
<P>
   Some women find that when they become mothers, they need to
scale back or forgo jobs with prestigious academic medical centers,
and instead choose work in large practices, often ones that serve a
high HMO base.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Genevieve Lambert worked for eight years at the
Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, mostly in the Pediatric HIV unit.
After giving birth to each of her two children, she cut back one
work day. As she awaits her third, she has bagged her career at the
hospital altogether to loosen her schedule and has joined a private
practice on Long Island where she works two and a half days a week
and is paid per-diem.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least half of my female friends from medical school are
working part-time now,'' said Dr. Lambert, 41. The women, she said,
are generally not doing this willingly, but because society as a
whole still makes child-rearing primarily a mother's
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine is fairly egalitarian in that a woman who chooses to
rise to the top of medicine can do so now,'' she said. ``The issues
of how to bring women to parity with men in the workplace is
finding ways to relieve women as primary care givers to children.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anderson, who was chief medical resident at Cornell in
1994-95 and is now one of only a handful of female cardiologists in
Manhattan, said that she is beginning to appreciate the conflicts
she will face if she chooses to have a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a woman in medicine there are not that many paradigms we
can look to and say `This is how they did it this is the way I can
do it too,' '' said Dr. Andersen. ``You have to work on it
yourself.''

   TWO ALLIANCES SEEK NEW ROUTES TO INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   Two separate industry alliances to be announced Monday share a
similar goal: creating alternatives to the personal computer _ and
to Microsoft's operating systems _ for access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In one announcement, IBM, Motorola, Sun Microsystems, Lucent and
10 other companies have agreed to create standards based on Sun's
Java programming language to connect smart devices ranging from
computers to dishwashers. In a separate deal, US West and Network
Computer plan to announce a schedule for trials of AT-TV, which
will integrate the Internet, telephone and television.
</P>
<P>
   DATA FLOW IN A SUPER-FAST PIPELINE
</P>
<P>
   The promise of a super-fast, highly reliable Internet moved a
step closer to reality when three dozen universities across the
United States were linked to a new national research network that
moves data at 1,600 times the speed of the high-speed lines that
many universities and businesses already use.
</P>
<P>
   A WORDY BATTLE OF BRITAIN
</P>
<P>
   The Labor government of Tony Blair, the prime minister of
Britain, has had an extraordinarily rocky relationship with the
news media since it came to power on a tidal wave of good will
nearly two years ago. In a nation where there is no sense of open
government or of the public's right to know, the government has had
little compunction about openly attacking the news media when it
does not like the way it is being covered.
</P>
<P>
   FOR OLIVETTI, MINNOW HUNTS WHALE
</P>
<P>
   As Olivetti pursues its $60 billion unsolicited bid for Telecom
Italia, Italians seem captivated by the sheer daring of a minnow
seeking to swallow a whale. But many question what the bid means
both for Telecom and for Italy's drive to be a more open market.

   OMNIPOINT SET TO END ROAMING FEES

<P>
   Following in the footsteps of communications giants, Omnipoint,
a small wireless phone carrier that operates mainly in the

<P>
   INVESTING IN MACHO HOME PAGE
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to capitalize on the allure of Internet stocks, an
entrepreneur in Bethesda, Md., plans to raise $7.5 million in a
stock offering for Efox.net, an electronic-commerce Web site that
focuses on ``the heterosexual man's favorite pursuits: ladies,
automobiles, sports and stocks.'' The women who pose for the site
are to each be paid with 500 shares of Efox.net stock.
</P>
<P>
   MORE ORIGINAL CONTENT ON WEB
</P>
<P>
   The number of articles written exclusively for the Web sites of
newspapers and magazines is growing, according to a study to be
released tomorrow that is based on a survey completed by 192
newspaper editors and 170 magazine editors. The study reports that
the amount of original material on Web sites has grown along with
the proliferation of the sites.

OMNIPOINT MAY ELIMINATE ROAMING FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Northeast, Fla., Mich., Ind.)  (lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of communications giants, Omnipoint
Corp., a small wireless phone carrier that operates mainly in the
Northeast, is expected to announce new calling plans Monday that
eliminate long-distance and ``roaming'' charges, according to
executives close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Omnipoint, which has tried to make its service especially
attractive to foreign visitors to the United States and to people
who often travel overseas, also intends to offer flat-rate calling
at low rates to 42 other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest communications
company, became the first wireless carrier to offer a plan with no
long-distance fees and with none of the roaming fees most wireless
companies charge when customers use their phone while in an area
served by another company. Bell Atlantic Corp., which provides
wireless service in the Northeast and middle Atlantic states,
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   But in following the path of these much bigger companies,
Omnipoint is bound to raise an important question among
communications experts and financial analysts: How can Omnipoint
afford it?
</P>
<P>
   When AT&AMP;T introduced its plan, it cited its own extensive
national network and said that it was willing to lose money when
its customers roamed by absorbing the fees demanded when the calls
required a transfer to other carriers' networks. Omnipoint has
nowhere near the financial resources of AT&AMP;T, and its network is
limited to the Northeast, southern Florida and parts of Michigan
and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Omnipoint, however, said the new plan would
be feasible because less than 5 percent of the company's wireless
traffic comes from roaming customers. Perhaps more important, they
said that Omnipoint had probably been able to negotiate lower
roaming rates with its wireless partners than AT&AMP;T had managed to
negotiate with the companies that would pick up AT&AMP;T's roamers.
</P>
<P>
   But that advantage might be offset to some extent by the
geographic limits of Omnipoint's roaming arrangements. Omnipoint is
one of 15 North American companies that use a wireless technology
known as GSM, which is the dominant technical format in Europe but
has been adopted in this country mostly by smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   Only 163 million of the roughly 270 million people in the United
States live in areas reachable by GSM phones. By comparison, AT&AMP;T's
wireless network and alliances provide almost universal coverage in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   GSM's popularity in Europe, however, may give Omnipoint an edge
in the cosmopolitan New York City market among customers who might
want to make calls when they travel overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Within the United States, the new Omnipoint plan will require a
minimum monthly commitment of $99.99 for 700 any-time, anywhere
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The company also intends to offer a rate of 29 cents a minute
for calls to 18 foreign nations, mostly in Europe, and a rate of 59
cents a minute for calls to 24 other countries, largely outside
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Omnipoint currently charges up to $1.99 a minute for calls to
the nations that will now come under the new international plan.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military ruler
who campaigned as being the only man capable of holding together
this vast and fractious country, on Sunday appeared to have won an
overwhelming victory in the first presidential election here in 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   His challenger, Olu Falae, immediately disputed the fairness of
the vote, held Saturday after years of promises by dictators to
move Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, toward
democracy. It remained unclear, however, whether he would formally
contest the result.
</P>
<P>
   International election monitors, led by former President Jimmy
Carter, said they had witnessed fraud by both sides and other
irregularities, but probably not enough to have swayed the outcome,
which was substantially in Obasanjo's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Official results on Sunday night showed that the retired general
had garnered 62 percent of the votes, compared to 38 percent for
his opponent, from 33 out of 36 states, plus the federal capital.
</P>
<P>
   A victory for Obasanjo would cap a tumultuous period in the
history of Nigeria, ruled until last June by a dictatorship that
had turned the country, the world's sixth-largest oil producer and
the biggest military power in West Africa, into an international
pariah.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be the culmination of an extraordinary personal
journey for Obasanjo, who was released just eight months ago after
serving three years in prison for criticizing the military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Falae, a former finance minister, disputed the fairness of the
election early Sunday evening. ``I said if General Obasanjo won a
free and fair election I would congratulate him but clearly this is
not a free and fair election,'' Falae told journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear whether Falae would formally contest the
results, particularly since they showed him trailing by almost 7
million votes, with the margin widening in Obasanjo's favor as more
returns came in.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials are scheduled to announce final results on
Monday when they will also formally declare the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who led a team of American election monitors, praised
the current military government's commitment to the transition to
civilian rule and the conduct of officials at the Independent
National Election Commission, which oversaw the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute said in
a report on the elections that there was ``no evidence indicating
that electoral abuses would have affected the overall outcome of
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been a pattern of nationwide fraud or
irregularities,'' Carter said in an interview. But he said that
monitors had observed fraud and irregularities in a number of
states, including ballot-boxes that were stuffed, vote tallies that
were inflated and results that were manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   Clement Nwankwo, chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group, an
umbrella organization of Nigerian organizations that dispatched
thousands of observers on Saturday, said that Obasanjo would have
to win over the public, because the irregularities had been serious
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winner must immediately embark on popular measures to deal
with the severe economic problems of this country and build popular
support for himself,'' Nwankwo said.
</P>
<P>
   If Falae contests the results, he will have to appeal his case

areas or throughout the country. The new president is scheduled to

   Most significant for Obasanjo might be the effect of a challenge
by Falae on people in the south. According to the results released
Sunday night, he performed according to expectations by winning
most of the north. But Falae won the southwest, which is dominated
by the Yoruba, one of the three main ethnic groups in Nigeria,
along with the Ibo in the southeast and the Hausa-Fulani in the
north.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are Yoruba. But because of Obasanjo's close ties to the
North, many of his fellow Yoruba distrust him and consider him a
candidate imposed by the northern-dominated military.
</P>
<P>
   The Yoruba have been angry especially since one of their own,
Moshood K.O. Abiola, a billionaire businessman, had his apparent
victory in the 1993 presidential elections annulled by a northern
general. That led to five years of brutal dictatorship under
Abacha, which ended only with his sudden death last June. After
Abiola also died unexpectedly a month later, Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, the current president, announced a timetable for
elections and handover to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Falae was the candidate of the Alliance for Democracy, which is
essentially a Yoruba party with little reach outside the southwest.
The All People's Party, which is strongest in the north, joined
forces with the Alliance for Democracy and presented Falae as their
common candidate.
</P>
<P>
   During a weeklong campaign period, Falae attacked Obasanjo as a
soldier in civilian disguise and described an Obasanjo presidency
as a continuation of military rule. The theme resonated among many
Nigerians weary of the military, which has ruled Nigeria for all
but 10 years since independence from Britain in 1960. But Falae was
unable to spread his message because of poor organization and the
shakiness of the alliance that backed him.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Obasanjo tried to use his military past to his
advantage by arguing that he was the only one close enough to
military officers to prevent them from snatching back power, as
they have done in the past. He would serve as a bridge, his
campaign argued, to a civilian administration.
</P>
<P>
   His party, the People's Democratic Party, enjoyed the most money
and the backing of the retired military elite. The party dominated
in elections since December for local and statewide government
seats, as well as the national assembly.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, an
uncompromising conservative who heads a national group called the
Traditional Values Coalition, has built his career on denouncing
homosexuals. But Sheldon may back a prospect for the Republican
presidential nomination whose oratory on the subject has been
decidedly tame: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pragmatic,'' said Sheldon, who has never been known as
pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   April Boling, an accountant who is active in California's
Republican Party, said the issue most important to her is support
for abortion rights, but that she too favored Bush, even though he
is against abortion. ``I'm not as uncomfortable with his politics
as some of the others,'' she said. ``And his father used to be pro
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon and Ms. Boling, both of whom attended the California
Republican Party's winter convention that closed here Sunday,
represent opposite, often antagonistic, wings of their party.
</P>
<P>
   But their support of Bush underscores an extraordinary turn in
Republican politics: an early, and colossal, outpouring of
Republicans of all stripes who have set aside their ideological
convictions to support a governor who has yet to formally announce
his intentions _ and who is untested and largely unknown on the
national stage.
</P>
<P>
   From Capitol Hill to state legislatures, Republicans around the
country have declared their support for Bush in what has become an
almost daily drumbeat of endorsements that has been encouraged _
but not always choreographed _ by the governors' advisers. On
Friday, for example, more than half of the nation's 31 Republican
governors professed their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, George Bush, did not enjoy such vast support at
this point when he ran for president in 1988 _ and as vice
president, he was the heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   But here at the state party convention, there were several
telling demonstrations of Bush's immense popularity. While seven
presidential contenders traveled to California to make their case
to hundreds of partisans, Bush kept to his past practice and stayed
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in dozens of random interviews, rank-and-file
delegates, political professionals and state legislators said they
intended to back Bush. Though many said they had never even heard
him speak in person, they spoke as if Bush's nomination was
inevitable. Twenty-six state legislators in California have signed
a petition urging Bush to run.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy has left Bush's rivals stunned, envious and, in some
cases, deeply dispirited and feeling shut out of the competition a
year before the actual voting begins. Already, it has transformed
the presidential nomination battle into a contest not of who is the
best candidate but who would be the best second choice.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle found himself being quizzed on
national television this morning about what he had to offer that
Bush did not. And privately, advisers to some candidates said their
best hope was that Bush would succumb to an as-yet-unknown scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee has been trudging
through Iowa and New Hampshire seeking the nomination for years but
has only been endorsed by two governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking about all the governors who came up to me
after the nomination last time and said, `If we had supported you,
we might have won the election,''' Alexander lamented in an
interview. He contrasted his years of experience with Bush, whom he
described as ``off to a promising beginning,'' adding that ``the
last fresh face the party nominated was Dwight D. Eisenhower.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate who is also running for the
second time, likened the commotion to the case of Colin Powell, who
ultimately decided not to seek the Republican nomination in 1996.
``Part of it is being able to project on to somebody anything you
want,'' he said in an interview. ``You saw it with the Powell
phenomenon. You saw it back in '72 with Muskie before he hit the
campaign trail. So I think you can watch it with wry amusement.''
</P>
<P>
   Short-lived or not, many Republican politicians here and around
the country said they had never seen such early rallying, and that
it was all the more stunning because Bush was not an heir apparent
like a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in interviews why they were so enthusiastic, most
Republicans cited pragmatic concerns, namely polls showing that
Bush, overwhelmingly, is the early favorite for the nomination and
could beat Vice President Al Gore in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   These supporters say they are so starved to regain the White
House that they concede that they do know too many details of
Bush's stewardship _ and do not particularly care. Ms. Bolling, for
instance, said she did not know the extent of Bush's opposition to
abortion, but was confident that ``at least he has not taken a
position that's so offensive that it's unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives and moderates alike seem to have convinced
themselves that Bush shares their views. Bruce Thompson, a
three-term California assemblyman who describes himself as one of
the most conservative legislators in the state, said, ``Listen,
this is the next Ronald Reagan _ there's no question in my mind.
The main thing is the guy can win. We're a party out there just
floating around.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has never met Bush, and never heard him speak _ except
on television. Yet that did not stop him from establishing a group
that printed and distributed thousands of ``Bush 2000'' placards
and lapel stickers at the convention here. He spent all weekend at
a booth where he showed delegates the Bush web site he created, and
a homemade videotape of assorted Bush television appearances.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Thompson and four other legislators staged a rally
at a pizza parlor in Sacramento to express their devotion. Rather
than attend a lunch featuring Forbes, about 200 delegates wandered
to the pizza party, where participants chanted, ``Bush 2K! Bush 2K!
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only game in town,'' Allan Hoffenblum, a longtime
Republican analyst based in Los Angeles, said as he scanned the
crowd at the pizza rally. ``We're so desperate for a candidate who
gets more than 38 percent of the vote statewide.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other contender who was popular at this gathering, and
at similar Republican events around country, was Elizabeth Dole,
who, like Bush, was a no show.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Alcox, who sells T-shirts and buttons at Republican
events around the country, said his homemade Bush and Dole
paraphernalia are by far the best sellers. ``Bush and Dole are
always neck-and-neck everywhere I go,'' said Alcox. ``The rest? You
can forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whom she would support for president, Cheryl Brandwood, a
53-year-old delegate here, said with certainty, ``George Bush and
Elizabeth Dole will be the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Schroeder, the outgoing chairman of the California
Republican Party, warned that there are dangers in people pinning
all their hopes on one candidate. He noted that Bush may have
difficulty meeting the now astronomical expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way too early to say the race is in the hands of one
person unless he makes a mistake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides frustration among the other candidates, the ardor for
Bush, who was elected two a second term last year by a huge margin,
has caused bruised feelings. Alexander was taken aback when Gov.
John M. Engler of Michigan recently said that Bush would make a
more appealing candidate because ``you've got a governor of the
'70s versus the governor of the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows better than that,'' said Alexander who was governor
of Tennessee from 1979 to 1987. ``I can remember very well when an
attractive young state senator named John Engler in 1983 came to
Nashville and spent 30 minutes with me asking what it would take to
make a good governor.''

   CRACK-LEGACY-II (Alburquerque, N.M.) _ Special Weapons and
Tactics squads, once used exclusively for the rare urban terrorist
incident or shootout, have transformed themselves through the crack
years into everyday parts of city life. In big urban areas,
paramilitary units now do everything from routine street patrols to
nightly house raids. Even small towns have formed paramilitary
police units. The Cape Cod town of Harwich, Mass., for example,
population 11,000, has trained a 10-man SWAT team. Encouraged by
federal grants, surplus equipment handed out by the military, and
seizure laws that allow police departments to keep much of what
their special units take in raids, the special units have grown
dramatically, even in the face of plummeting crime figures. (Second

OLIVETTI'S MOVE FOR TELECOM ITALIA WAS AIMED AT SURGING WIRELESS
MARKET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ROME _ As any traveler here knows, the tribe of Italians who do
not walk around with a cell phone hanging from one ear is facing
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that roughly 48 percent of Norwegians and
Swedes, and fully 58 percent of Finns own them, Italy is more in a
league with France and Britain, with roughly 60 million people
each. Among Italians, 36 percent of potential users have wireless
phones, compared with 22 percent in Britain and 18.8 percent in
France. Even fewer Germans _ 17 percent of 80 million _ use them.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that something like this might happen led Carlo
De Benedetti, the chairman of Olivetti SpA, the typewriter maker
turned computer company, to decide in the 1980s that mobile phones
might be what Olivetti needed to replace its ailing computer
business.
</P>
<P>
   The shift cost him his job. By 1996, Olivetti had generated so
much red ink and debt that its main shareholders _ British and
American pension funds _ replaced De Benedetti with one of his
proteges, Roberto Colaninno.
</P>
<P>
   By last year, Olivetti had joined with several big international
partners, including Germany's Mannesmann AG and Bell Atlantic and
Vodafone of the United States, to form a phone business with six
million subscribers, making it the No. 2 Italian phone business
after the former state phone company, Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   So eyebrows were raised when Colaninno, 55, announced a week ago
that Olivetti would sell its phone business for $8 billion to its
phone partner, Mannesmann, then raise $50 billion more through debt
and make a $60 billion unsolicited bid for its far bigger rival,
Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are these guys, and can they handle this?'' Franco
Bernabe, the Telecom chairman, asked about Colaninno and the
investors around him, an associate recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The remark, a tone of wonder mingled with doubt, appeared last
week to catch the ambivalent mood of Italians, who seemed
captivated by the sheer daring of a minnow seeking to swallow a
whale, yet questioned what the bid meant both for Telecom and for
Italy's drive to be a more open market.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's decision to swallow Telecom, a company five times its
size, represents one of the biggest hostile takeover attempts by
any company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure there really is a rational explanation,'' said an
analyst at a large German brokerage who requested anonymity. Eighty
percent of Olivetti's value was its mobile phone business, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Colaninno's bid, he noted, was ``predicated on asset
stripping'' by selling off Telecom businesses _ possibly including
a share in Telecom's mobile phone unit, Telecom Italia Mobile, at a
time when the phone business is rapidly shifting from fixed-line to
wireless. The enormous debt would drain Telecom at a time when
increased competition was putting intense pressure on phone costs
throughout Europe, squeezing industry margins.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts, however, said the potential for turning Telecom
into a leaner, more efficient phone company gave Colaninno's plan
an inner logic.
</P>
<P>
   From an industrial point of view, said Peter Roe, an analyst at
Paribas Securities in London, ``it makes sense, and you can justify
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Telecom has a very strong position in the domestic market and
a strong balance sheet,'' he said. ``It's a very significant
company in Italy and a large international player as well. So
you're going up the size scale very quickly when you take on
Telecom Italia.''
</P>
<P>
   Telecom had floundered since the Italian government took it
public, and successive executives have done little to sort out its
tangled problems _ not the least of which is getting its cost
structure down by reducing its bloated staffing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had aspirations to take it, molding it to your image,
now is the time to do it,'' Roe said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, was that Telecom shareholders, disgusted
with management's dithering, voted last fall to hire Bernabe, 49,
who earned his spurs in the preceding six years reorganizing the
former state oil giant, ENI SpA, and taking it public. So the
question came down to Colaninno versus Bernabe.
</P>
<P>
   Bernabe lost no time elaborating a turnaround plan, proposing to
Telecom's board that he merge it with the profitable mobile phone
unit, Telecom Italia Mobile, shed noncore activities like phone
equipment manufacturing, and sell minority stakes in foreign phone
companies that had no strategic value.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Telecom's board ordered Bernabe to move ahead,
despite Olivetti's hostile bid, and present them with detailed
plans.
</P>
<P>
   But Italian securities regulators hampered that effort over the
weekend. They had rejected Olivetti's offer, saying it provided
insufficient details, but they approved a renewed bid on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Under corporate governance laws enacted in July, companies
subject to takeovers are precluded from adopting ``poison pill''
maneuvers meant to block bids. Only a favorable vote from more than
30 percent of the company's owners at a shareholders meeting can
decide otherwise, and analysts said that would be unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bernabe is seeking to persuade Italians,
generally more committed not to the quick kill but to finding
competitive edge, that Colaninno's bid, if successful, would
fatally weaken Telecom _ and with it, Italy's telecommunications
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Telecom's union leaders, he cited figures meant as
much for Telecom's shareholders as for its employees. If
successful, he calculated, Olivetti's leveraged bid would leave
Telecom with annual debt service of $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As if to impress Italian politicians fearful of higher
unemployment and their union backers alike, he declared that
Telecom, to offset such financial burdens, would be forced to lay
off up to 35,000 of its 126,000 employees, beyond the 20,000 to
25,000 he believes must go if Telecom is to be competitive.

REED STARTING TO RESPOND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Bruins were faltering. Their lead was fading,
their attack was stagnating and Washington was rolling. Who else to
the rescue but . . . Travis Reed?
</P>
<P>
   In this season of changing lineups and rotation roulette, Reed,
a sophomore forward, has gotten lost in the lunacy. A regular in
December, his confidence and minutes plunged in the second half of
conference play.
</P>
<P>
   It all changed Saturday, when Washington chopped a 21-point
deficit to eight midway through the second half. Reed entered with
6:39 left and quickly stopped the Huskies' surge with a driving
layup. On the ensuing possession, he found Jerome Moiso for a short
baseline jumper. A minute later, Reed scored the first of six
consecutive points.
</P>
<P>
   When he was done _ when he had scored eight points in three
minutes _ UCLA's lead was 18 and the Bruins were cruising to a
79-62 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were real loosey-goosey and Trav came in hungry,'' guard
Baron Davis said. ``That's what we need from him. He provided a
spark off the bench. He took over the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Reed's best performance since Feb. 4, when he scored 13
points against Oregon. In the next six games _ with big men Jerome
Moiso and Dan Gadzuric injured and the Bruins desperate for
frontcourt production _ Reed was no help, with 11 points and 11
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Inconsistent play led to inconsistent minutes: seven one game,
20 the next, then two, then 11. He was not comfortable and he could
not gain confidence. Now, with Gadzuric out for the season, the
Bruins need him desperately. Saturday, finally, he responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show I can still play,'' he said. ``I've been
struggling lately. Subbing in and out messes with my confidence,
but we were winning. I've been practicing real hard lately; I know
you play like you practice. That's what I've got to do without the
big guy.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Loyd farewell: Seldom-used senior guard Brandon Loyd played
his final home game Saturday and departed without remorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask if I wish I had stayed closer to home, and I
don't,'' said Loyd, a native of Tulsa, Okla. ``I don't regret one
moment here. I've made some incredible friends. It's paradise here
compared to Oklahoma. I'd love to do it all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Loyd has at least three games left, the Bruins aren't
likely to displace his fondest memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sophomore year, all the stuff we went through after coach
(Jim) Harrick got fired, and about eight of us were playing,'' he
said. ``It was a special group to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Stats of the weekend: UCLA scored 100 points Thursday against
Washington State, the most by a Pac-10 team in a conference game
this season. The Bruins' 39-point winning margin Thursday was their
largest in Pac-10 play since a 40-point victory over Washington in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   __ Short and painful: Reserve guard Rico Hines has not fully
recovered from the broken right foot that forced him to miss six
weeks. Although UCLA's medical staff prefers he not play, Hines
insists, so he's been placed on a limited-minutes program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hard-headed and stubborn and I won't leave my guys,''
Hines said. ``I can only play five or six minutes a game. Even if I
wanted to go more, I couldn't. It hurts too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines played six minutes against Washington (one assist) and
then iced his foot.
</P>
<P>
   __ There's no Rush: Kareem Rush, JaRon's younger brother and a
UCLA recruiting priority, visited campus this weekend. A 6-foot-4
shooting guard, he has narrowed his choices to UCLA and Missouri
and won't decide until April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the school and I like the program,'' he said. ``Having
JaRon here is an added bonus.''

OFF THE WALL: How will this Worm turn? 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any armchair Toni Grant _ or, if you're Chick Hearn, any Travis
Grant _ can predict what's next in the Lakers' ``As The Worm
Squirms'' made-for-NBA soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   For Dennis Rodman, it'll be one of two things:
</P>
<P>
   1) Los Angeles, a city where cross-dressing is not a crime, will
provide him with a comfort zone he's never experienced before and
he'll thrive.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be on a 24/7 adrenaline rush, making the short hop to
Vegas between morning shootarounds and prime-time games, playing
HORSE at the Chateau Marmont driveway at 4 in the morning, partyin'
like it's 1999. And he'll cause enough distraction so Kobe Bryant
and Shaquille O'Neal can do their own things.
</P>
<P>
   Or . . .
</P>
<P>
   2) Los Angeles, a city that tends to yawn at even the most
absolute absurdity, won't be shocked enough by his behavior and
that'll drive him even more into a funk.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing one more teammate say, ``We don't care what he
does off the court, it's what's on the court that matters,'' he'll
feel used, abused and even more confused. And one day, he just
won't show up, wandering aimlessly down Melrose looking for another
instant-credit tattoo parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are convinced his behavior adds up to a classic case
of ADD _ that's Attention Deficit Disorder to those who are just
skimming this _ wonder why he hasn't already been a disruptive
force on a juvenile team trying to find its identity.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, two games into his Lakers career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be on his best behavior for a couple of games, eager to
please and to prove everyone's wrong about him, but eventually
he'll go back to what we've seen because that kind of person bores
him,'' author David Halberstam was saying last week to anyone who'd
ask.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam, who while compiling his book ``Playing For Keeps:
Michael Jordan and the World He Made,'' had a chance to observe
Rodman for all of last season, says he has heard from NBA
beat-writer friends that Rodman's selfishness will get the best of
everyone eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more volatile today than earlier in his career and no
amount of success or public adulation will fill that essential hole
within him,'' Halberstam said. ``That hole may push you to succeed,
but it never gets filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``His binge drinking will catch up with him and his behavior
will get more and more erratic. There were times when Phil Jackson
and Michael Jordan really had to sit him down and talk to him about
it. He's not someone who can take care of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   So where's Jack Haley? . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Bulls GM Jerry Krause told the Chicago Tribune about Rodman:
``We didn't have a problem with him in practice. That was one of
the biggest misperceptions while he was here. He missed very few
practices. He was always on the verge of just getting fined _ he'd
show up two minutes before. But he didn't (routinely) miss
practices and nobody ever covered for him while he was here.'' . .
.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Lakers locker room now has a two-drink minimum. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Last team to change coaches in a season and win an NBA title
was the '82 Lakers, who canned Paul Westhead at Magic Johnson's
behest and yanked Pat Riley out of the broadcast bin. . . .
</P>
<P>

   __ Fashion-police alert: The New Jersey Nets are going to break
out the first non-tank-top jersey in NBA history for their game
Thursday. It'll look more like that sleek sleeveless V-neck that

<P>
   __ Shaq is supposed to appear at a fashion trade show later this
month when his TWISM sportswear line is relaunched. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ According to some who care, Vancouver Raptors rookie guard
Vince Carter might have the best odds in the ``Next Jordan'' race.
Just three problems: a) he's in Vancouver, b) he's in Vancouver,
and c) can't shake this image of him screaming at Gomer Pyle. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ !racpay!Spike Lee's new movie, ``Love and Basketball,'' has
Keyshawn ``Just Give Me the Damn Cue'' Johnson reading for the lead
role since the New York Jets receiver quit work on the Oliver Stone
flick ``Any Given Sunday,'' reports the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's agent, Jerome Stanley, said KeyJ wasn't happy with
Stone because ``the character was ill-defined.'' Or was it more
that he felt neglected sitting around on the set all day without
being used. . . .

<P>

called ``Mr. Octobears'' to raise dough for his kids group. . . .
</P>

   __ Now if they can only figure out a way to hold a World Match
Play championship so that the final four isn't Magee College vs.
the University of Huston and Maggert A&AMP;M vs. UPate. . . .

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel conducted an aerial bombardment Sunday night
of what it said were four Party of God guerrilla strongholds deep
inside Lebanon, stung into action by a week of attacks that
culminated in the killing of a general and three other Israelis in
southern Lebanon earlier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The airstrikes took the conflict away from the Israeli-Lebanon
border and into the heart of Lebanon, risking an escalation of
ping-pong attacks between the Israeli army and the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy bombing ended a day of intense conflict in the
low-level war in South Lebanon, beginning with unsuccessful rocket
attacks on northern Israel. The final catalyst for their attack,
Israeli officials said, was a roadside bomb Sunday morning that
killed the four Israelis, including Brig. Gen. Erez Gerstein, 36,
who became the highest-ranking officer to die in southern Lebanon
in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   A journalist, Ilan Roeh, 32, of Voice of Israel Radio, was also
among those killed. He was accompanying the general in order to
``see things up close,'' his boss, Shalom Oren, said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear late Sunday night what toll Israel's bombing
raids had taken, and whether there were any civilian casualties. At
midnight, Israel's Channel Two television reported at least 10
dead, citing Lebanese media reports.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting counterattacks, the army ordered residents of northern
Israel to report to shelters, and Qiryat Shemona, the northernmost
town, emptied out on Sunday night, as residents fled south or took
refuge underground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight you hear the thunder of jets coming back from inside
Lebanon,'' said Army Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz at a 9:15 p.m.
press conference in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Mofaz said that fighter planes struck Party of God headquarters
in the heart of the Bekaa Valley city of Baalbek and three other
targets, all of which were chosen because they were ``pure
Hezbollah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggest we wait until the pilots land and for our
investigation to get clear answers,'' Mofaz said. ``But the planes
carried out their mission well. There were good hits on the
targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning's roadside bomb was the second serious blow to
the Israeli army in less than a week in southern Lebanon, following
a guerrilla ambush that left three elite unit officers dead last
Tuesday. The ambush, in which Hezbollah fighters attacked Israeli
paratroopers with machine guns and grenades, was unusual in that it
involved direct conflict rather than bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush had revived the episodic political debate here over
Israel's longstanding military presence in southern Lebanon. Israel
has occupied a nine-mile-deep border zone in southern Lebanon since
1985 to protect its northern towns.
</P>
<P>
   Along the border and inside Lebanon, the Israeli army skirmishes
daily with Hezbollah, or Shiite Muslim, guerrillas, who are backed
by Iran, with weapons supplied through Syria. With each year,
Israel has faced increasing pressure, internationally and at home,
to withdraw its troops.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is particularly volatile when a fresh wave of deaths
takes place during an election campaign, as is happening now.
Public pressure builds for the Israeli government to act: to
withdraw troops unilaterally; to pursue peace negotiations with the
Syrians, who effectively control Lebanon; or to conduct heavy
airstrikes in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Elections often bring out an incumbent's urge to be bold. Sunday
night's raids will inevitably be seen as partly a political move by
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, an effort to strengthen
his image as a tough defender of Israel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1996, during the last campaign, Shimon Peres began a
retaliatory battle with Hezbollah that became a troubled
16-day-long air assault in which about 200 Lebanese citizens were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not seek a deterioration of the situation in Lebanon,''
Netanyahu said Sunday night. ``But we cannot accept what is
happening there. We cannot accept these losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was putting northern Israel at risk, Netanyahu said,
``People in the north say: `Don't worry about us; we'll manage. Go
ahead. Beat up on them. We're willing to sit in the shelters.' If
we don't act, things will get much worse. If we were to sit with
our hands folded across our chests, then I would fear for the
northern settlements.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup opinion poll published on Friday found that 63 percent
of those surveyed did not believe the Netanyahu government was
doing enough to resolve the situation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bombing was made public Sunday night, Linda Ben Zvi,
a spokeswoman for the Fourth Mothers' Movement to Leave Lebanon,
said she feared that the government's reaction would be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing our boys home in boxes, so we can't think in
terms of macho and pride,'' she said. ``It was a failed policy from
the beginning, and the longer it gets, the clearer it gets, and the
higher the price we're paying. We should unilaterally withdraw, and
then, like every other country, defend ourselves from within our
own borders.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Sunday night what Israel planned militarily
beyond the initial airstrikes. At the 9:15 p.m. conference, Defense
Minister Moshe Arens, Netanyahu and Mofaz all said they would not
back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's response will not be the last if the situation
doesn't change,'' Arens said.

FORMER `WASHINGTON WEEK IN REVIEW' HOST WAS JUST GETTING HIS COAT
ANYWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The irony, said Ken Bode, munching on chips and
salsa on an afternoon when he would normally have been at work, was
that he had planned to give up his Washington gig anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Commuting here from Evanston, Ill., where he is dean of the
Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, to be the
host of ``Washington Week in Review,'' meant spending two and a
half days a week away from his wife, and he was tired of missing
her.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to renegotiate his contract for the PBS
program, he said, ``I was going to say, `Let's do this for one last
year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, that won't be necessary. After clashing with a
new boss who thought the show's quiet discussions of targeted tax
cuts and Kosovo needed a little more edge and attitude, Bode was
pushed out last week and had to tune in from a friend's place and
watch his fill-in smile and thank him for his five years of
service.
</P>
<P>
   He had wanted to go on one last time and, before saying ``So
long,'' get a panel of four Pulitzer Prize winners talking about
the nature of punditry, the argument culture and the ``TV
wasteland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make Tom Friedman come on and say what he thinks about
Clinton's morals!'' Bode said of the New York Times columnist, one
of his regulars. ``He talks about the collapse of the Asian
economy, and if that's too dull, OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward news reporters, who are supposed to be
objective, loudly sharing their opinions all over television has
been a concern of Bode's for years. A decade ago, as a political
correspondent for NBC News, he asked his bureau chief to forbid him
to go on ``The McLaughlin Group'' because he did not have the
stomach for what he calls ``that food fight.''
</P>
<P>
   One small comfort is that Bode (pronounced BO-dee), 59, appears
to have beaten back ``attitude.'' For now, he has probably saved
the show from such proposed improvements as visiting high school
journalists and man-on-the-street interviews.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of bad publicity and questions about whether even
public television now requires journalists to break chairs over one
another's heads, the program's producer, WETA-TV, has made clear it
won't be fiddling with the format. WETA even announced that for a
few months the host will be Paul Duke, who was moderator for 20
years and makes Bode look like Geraldo.
</P>
<P>
   Bode seems hurt, certainly, and a bit at loose ends. After a
long lunch, he seems to feel there ought to be some place to hurry
off to. But it is also clear that the real compensation for him is
that he has a life to go back to.
</P>
<P>
   His friends tell you right off he's not one of these
ultra-driven Washington types who thinks a night off television is
dead air _ as do, frankly, a couple of his regular guests, who in
interviews seemed quite moved by the nobility of their sacrifice in
staying off Friday's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's outstanding, but he also seems normal,'' said Elizabeth
Piersol, Bode's producer, who was also dismissed, apparently for
remaining loyal to him. She called him ``the person I've worked
with with the most integrity,'' adding, almost by way of
explanation, ``He doesn't have to live here full time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Which is how he wanted it. Ten years ago, in the prime of his
career as a national political correspondent, Bode quit and moved
his family to Indiana so he could spend more time with them. At the
time, he says, laughing, even they didn't really get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me one day. I was in Boston debating Pat Robertson on
journalism ethics and I had to get home because my daughter was
giving the commencement address for her sixth-grade class. I called
her and told her I'd be there. Then you know how you put the phone
down and it rings right away? It was the New York desk saying, `On
Friday I need this piece.' I said, `I'll do it, but after the
commencement.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew then,'' he said, ``that my problem was, I've got the
best job but I've also got one chance to be a father, and I'm
losing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bode grew up in Hawarden, Iowa, where his family owned a small
dairy that went under when milk bottles gave way to cartons. He
earned a doctorate in political science from the University of
North Carolina and taught at Michigan State and the State
University of New York at Binghamton before moving into journalism.
Soon after his epiphany in Boston, he returned to academia, to
build a broadcast journalism program at DePauw University and to
raise his family in Greencastle, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   They were not immediately grateful. ``I was on a bike ride with
my 11-year-old, and she's crying. Finally, she says, `Dad, I think
it's a big comedown to go from being a Washington national
correspondent for NBC to teaching where Dan Quayle went to
college.'''
</P>
<P>
   But she came around, and both daughters ended up loving Indiana,
where they collected ``19 varsity letters between the two of
them,'' he brags, and he spent evenings in school gyms. Last year,
with both girls at Kenyon College, he took the Northwestern job.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the ugliness of the last week, it is hard to feel
sorry for Bode when he talks about how his family reacted. His
daughter Matilda, president of her senior class, sent flowers. His
daughter Josie, captain of the rugby team, wrote, ``Tell me the
name of this guy. I've got a bunch of pals.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Margo, a writer and designer of educational materials
for children who are learning disabled, penned a love letter. ``She
said, `We are starting another new phase together. Let's have
fun.'''

   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ He's back, after yet another year of
involuntary leave. Well, officially he resigned from his job with
the Baltimore Orioles, but Davey Johnson opted for that path rather
than wait to be fired, which would inevitably have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson nearly missed gaining his new job. He was hired a couple
of weeks after Felipe Alou rejected it, deciding instead to remain
with the Montreal Expos. So Johnson is wearing Dodger Blue, or gray
(Saturday's workout uniform of the day) or white (Monday's).
</P>
<P>
   ``At times I have been envious of guys like Walter Alston and
Tommy Lasorda, who made their careers in one spot,'' Johnson said
of two of his predecessors, who managed the Dodgers for a combined
43 years. ``But I've been blessed in that I've had the opportunity
to manage some great Mets teams and some great athletes in
Cincinnati and Baltimore. Now I've got a fine club here.''
</P>
<P>
   An expensive club, to be sure. How fine? He will find out as the
season progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the infusion of Rupert Murdoch's money, the Fox-owned
Dodgers have been the talk of the off season, mostly critical talk.
Kevin Brown's $105 million contract has been the object of most of
the criticism, but contrary to popular belief, the nouveau riche
Dodgers are still pikers compared with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   With 22 players signed by each team, the Dodgers have a $77.5
million payroll, the Yankees $86.7 million _ although at those
rates, who wants to quibble over a few million here or there?
</P>
<P>
   The point is that General Manager Kevin Malone, backed by Fox's
desire to have a championship team, has positioned the Dodgers for
a run at not only a division title but also something beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Brown, Malone has added Devon White in center field and
Todd Hundley behind the plate, plus the relief pitchers Alan Mills,
Mel Rojas and Greg Cadaret, to go with the holdover newcomers from
last season: Gary Sheffield, who will play left field while Raul
Mondesi returns to right; Mark Grudzielanek, who is competing with
Jose Vizcaino for the shortstop's job; the starting pitchers Carlos
Perez and Dave Mlicki, and the closer Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the financial resources Fox brings to the table, it
allows this team to go into spring training with as much experience
as we've had since I've been here,'' said first baseman Eric
Karros, who, with seven years, is the team's senior member. ``All
of the positions except for third base have experience. In the
past, because of payroll constraints, you'd have a couple young
guys, unproven guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The third baseman is Adrian Beltre, who will celebrate his 21st
birthday the day of the team's third game of the season. He batted
only .215 in 77 games for Los Angeles last season, but Johnson is
intent on having him in the lineup instead of the more veteran Dave
Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third base is settled as far as I'm concerned,'' Johnson said.
``I'm impressed with this kid. I'm glad the general manager and the
people in the front office like to go with a young player. I like
to help them get established. I like young players to step up. It
gives energy to ball clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   When a young player from a team's minor league system makes the
major league team, Johnson said, it excites the other players in
the system. ``I like that,'' he said. ``I'm going to do everything
I can to make it easy for him to establish himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, though, is not the team's biggest question mark. That
punctuation is reserved for Hundley, whose surgically repaired
right elbow could hold the key to how far the Dodgers go. Hundley
himself said the elbow is fine, and Johnson concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was a gamble we could make,'' Johnson said. ``We
needed more left-handed bats and a left-handed bat to protect
Sheffield. It was really a no-brainer gamble. It was something you
had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, Hundley's elbow does not hold up under
the stress of daily throwing to second base to get runners who will
surely test him, the Dodgers have as replacements only the kind of
young players Johnson said he likes. Between them, Angel Pena and
Paul LoDuca, who was born in Brooklyn 14 years after the Dodgers
left, have 12 games of major league experience.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson sees Hundley making a strong comeback from a season
in which he was willing to humiliate himself by playing the
outfield for the Mets, just to be able to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's kind of driven, if you want to know the truth,''
Johnson said. ``For a lot of reasons, maybe several million reasons
involving New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has 105 million reasons driving him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the contract will be that big a deal,'' said the
right-hander, who has pitched in the past two World Series with two
teams. ``All the hubbub about the contract will be there to a
degree, but once we get started the emphasis will be on what we do
as a team. The contract isn't going to change what I do as a
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, like his No. 1 pitcher, has been a winner. He leads all
active managers with a .575 winning percentage, and the 10 teams he
has managed for entire seasons have finished first (six times) or
second. Yet he keeps getting time off, two years between New York
and Cincinnati, one year between Baltimore and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stress in this job can age you,'' Johnson said, seeking
something positive in the periodic interruptions to his managerial
career. ``I've been very fortunate that I've been healthy. And I
had a year off from being second-guessed.''  &QL;

KACZYNSKI EXPESSES HIS ANGER IN MEMOIR  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From prison, Theodore Kaczynski, who pleaded guilty to the
Unabomb killings, has a message for his brother, who turned him in
to the government.
</P>
<P>
   In a book to be published this spring, Kaczynski says he could
forgive what he calls his brother's treason. But forgiveness will
come only if the brother, David Kaczynski, leaves his wife and
joins with groups fighting modern society or, as Theodore himself
did, lives in rural isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this way he would not only earn my personal forgiveness;
what is more important, he would be cleansed and redeemed of his
treason against the values that he once held in common with me and
many other people,'' Kaczynski writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to put him in touch with environmental radicals,
and I believe they would accept him if he came to them repentant,''
Kaczynski adds in his manuscript, a copy of which the book's
publisher provided to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The book, an argumentative memoir titled ``Truth Versus Lies,''
does not acknowledge that Kaczynski was the bomber who conducted an
anti-technology campaign that killed three people, injured at least
22 and lasted from 1978 until his arrest in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the Unabomber, Kaczynski wrote prolifically, most notably in
a long manifesto of his ideas for which he won publication in
exchange for his promise of a moratorium on killing and maiming.
But the book offers his first extensive public comments since his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The 548-page manuscript includes angry assertions about the
media, women he knew, neighbors, teachers and acquaintances. One
promiscuous woman, he says, was a ``damned animal.'' A school
official was ``prissy.'' As a youth, he remembers, he called his
mother a ``fat pig.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme, however, is that contrary to what his lawyers
contended, the author is not mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski was sentenced last year to life in prison without
possibility of parole, after pleading guilty so as to avoid a trial
in which his lawyers intended to argue that he was acutely
schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
   His family had been complicit in the idea of a mental illness
defense, he says, lying about him not only to avert a trial that
might have led to a death sentence but also to skirt embarrassment
over abuse that his book says had been inflicted on him since
childhood. It was this abuse that led to social difficulties for
him, he says, but it was more convenient for his family to maintain
that he was sick.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski ``knows very well,'' the book says, ``that
imprisonment is to me an unspeakable humiliation and that I would
unhesitatingly choose death over incarceration.'' But David also
knew, his brother writes, that a trial in which an insanity defense
was offered would be too agonizing for Theodore to bear.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony P. Bisceglie, a lawyer for David Kaczynski and the
brothers' mother, Wanda, said that during Theodore's prosecution,
investigators looked closely at his story and concluded that he had
not been abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is symptomatic of Ted's illness,'' Bisceglie said, ``and
it is not uncommon in schizophrenia for this kind of nasty, angry,
unpleasant striking out to occur.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although the book barely mentions the crimes of the Unabomber _
so called because his earliest targets were university employees
and airlines _ it makes passing references that appear intended to
burnish the bomber's image. For instance, the book says a news
report that the Unabomber panicked when spotted as he dropped off a
deadly parcel on one occasion lacked any basis.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to illustrate that his past has been distorted,
Kaczynski recounts what he describes as inaccurate anecdotes about
his life that were widely reported after his arrest. But in many
cases his own version differs from them only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   One news account, he notes, said he had once placed on a wall a
limerick that referred offensively to a female co-worker who had
rejected him. In fact, he writes, he placed the limerick on a
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski says &UR;  &LR; that when he was 12, his father, who has since
died, began calling him ``sick'' and compared him to an
acquaintance who had been placed in a psychiatric institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother imitated him in this respect,'' the book says, ``and
from then on until I was about 21 years old, both parents would
apply to me such epithets as `sick,' `immature,' `emotionally
disturbed,' `creep,' `mind of a 2-year-old.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski, a math prodigy who graduated from Harvard and became
a promising academic at the University of California at Berkeley
before embracing the life of a recluse at a Montana cabin,
expresses particular anger toward his brother, describing him as a
homely youth who grew into a lazy adult.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of identifying him to the authorities, Kaczynski says,
his brother could have sent him a message saying he suspected him
of the bombings and would expose him if there were more attacks.
``If I were the Unabomber,'' he writes, ``that would have been an
effective deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski is serving his sentence at a federal maximum-security
prison in Florence, Colo., near Pueblo. In letters from there and
in conversations with visitors, he has said he was pressured to
plead guilty and now wants a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Richard J. Bonnie, a professor at the University of
Virginia School of Law and nationally known expert on psychiatric
legal issues, said in an interview that he had agreed to handle
Kaczynski's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth Versus Lies'' is being published by Context Books, which
describes itself as a new book publishing company in New York. The
editor in chief of Context, Beau Friedlander, said any royalties
would be placed in an escrow account to be distributed to the
Unabomber's victims or their survivors, as required by Kaczynski's
plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript, like the Unabomber's manifesto, includes
detailed footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   In one passage, Kaczynski writes, ``To those of us who regard
the system as evil, my brother is another Judas Iscariot, except
that, unlike the original Judas, he doesn't even have enough
courage to go hang himself.'' The footnote says, ``I trust my
readers will realize that, in comparing my brother to Judas
Iscariot, I do not intend any comparison of myself with Jesus
Christ.''

CHINA SAID TO BE TRYING TO SMUGGLE WEAPON TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal agents in California quietly arrested a
Chinese citizen last week and charged him with trying to obtain a
component vital to missile guidance systems. Officials said the
arrest shed light on what many in Washington say is an effort by
China to smuggle U.S. technology to improve the accuracy of its
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service has yet to make a public announcement of the
arrest of the man, Yao Yi, but federal officials and a criminal
complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Boston say Yao tried to
buy fiber-optic gyroscopes from a Massachusetts defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   After the State Department refused to approve the deal, Yao
dealt with another Boston company, which promised to help get the
gyroscopes out of the United States. But that company was a dummy
corporation set up as part of a sting operation by the Customs
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The news came as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived
Sunday in Beijing, where she is likely to complain of a missile
buildup by China in her talks with leaders there.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are trying to determine whether Yao, who was
arrested while attending a conference on fiber optics in San Diego,
was working as an entrepreneur or as a purchaser for the Chinese
military. During the transaction, Yao said he was representing a
Beijing firm called Lions Photonics and insisted that the
gyroscopes were destined for a Chinese university that was working
on a railroad project.
</P>
<P>
   While such gyroscopes can, indeed, be used in railroad projects,
federal officials do not believe the story, because an associate of
Yao said they also were seeking infrared sensors, which are
commonly used in missiles to detect heat-generating targets.
</P>
<P>
   One federal official said that using this kind of gyroscope for
a railroad project ``would be like flying an F-14 to the grocery
store.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Yao, who is believed to be 33 years old, came only
hours after the Clinton administration, in an unrelated case,
decided to prevent Hughes Electronics from exporting to China a
$450 million communications satellite, ordered by a Singapore
consortium with links to officers of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The State and Defense departments said they feared that the
satellite and the technology to launch it into precise orbit could
further improve the accuracy of Chinese missiles.
</P>
<P>
   And as Yao was being escorted into federal court in San Diego on
Friday for a hearing at which he agreed to be transferred to Boston
to face charges, the Pentagon delivered a report to Congress
detailing China's buildup of tactical missiles on the coast facing
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that China is ``still decades'' away from
being able to project military force far beyond its borders, but
that its cruise and ballistic missiles ``will give Beijing the
`credible intimidation' needed to accomplish political and military
goals without having to rely on overwhelming force-on-force
superiority.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the gyroscope case, a man identified by authorities as an
associate of Yao _ Collin Xu, a Canadian citizen of Chinese origin
_ was arrested two weeks ago in Boston after he allegedly took
delivery of the fiber-optic gyroscopes _ all but one of which was a
dummy _ and he is being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Xu pleaded not guilty and his lawyer, Richard Egbert, declined
to discuss the case on Friday, saying, ``The facts will come out
when we develop them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to an affidavit filed in Boston by a special agent for
the Customs Service, Timothy Gildea, Lions Photonics first sought
to buy four advanced gyroscopes in December 1997, from a
Massachusetts firm that is not named in the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the case say the company was Fibersense
Technology Corp., a firm in Canton, Mass., that manufactures
fiber-optic gyroscopes for the military, chiefly for missiles,
aircraft and space vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, the company told Yao and Xu, who
said the gyroscopes would be used for a ``superspeed train
navigation system,'' that they would need permission from the State
Department, because the gyroscopes are on the State Department's
Munitions List, a compilation of technologies that can only be
exported with a license.
</P>
<P>
   Two such applications were filed in May 1998, one listing the
end user as ZheJiang University in China, and another listing the
final user as Changsha Rail University in Hunan province. The
applications were immediately denied by the State Department, which
noted that China is a ``prohibited destination'' for the
gyroscopes.
</P>
<P>
   In August, a new order was received by the Massachusetts company
for nearly identical equipment, listing a new company as the
purchaser: Micro Techland, in Montreal. An exemption to the State
Department licensing rules permits the shipment of some types of
equipment without a license to Canadian firms, for use in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Their suspicions aroused, officials at the defense manufacturer
alerted the Customs Service, which soon began a sting operation.
Yao was referred to the undercover firm and told that ``they have
handled similar sales in the past'' and would keep the
manufacturer's name off the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The undercover operation soon received an identical order for
the gyroscopes. An expert on military gyroscopes, who asked not to
be identified by name, said the type the Chinese were attempting to
buy were ``tactical'' gyroscopes used on missiles, on the gun
turrets of tanks, and sometimes on railroads.
</P>
<P>
   For months the undercover firm negotiated back and forth with
its Chinese customers by e-mail, arguing over price and
specifications, and even warranty conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The final order amounted to about $70,000, and at one point,
according to partial transcripts of the conversations included in
the criminal complaint, Xu asked: ``Do you also do infrared
sensors?''
</P>
<P>
   Xu ultimately picked up the gyroscopes in the Boston area,
federal officials say, and was arrested on his way to a Federal
Express facility. On Feb. 19, Yao entered the United States; he was
arrested last Monday night in San Diego.

ARTFUL WORKOUT ON THE STAIRMASTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This city declared a snow emergency on Thursday, and
the opening of a four-day engagement by Mark Morris' company was
canceled at the Wang Center for the Performing Arts. Such are the
vagaries of living in a car culture.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday night, the theater was packed for two fresh and
vigorous premieres on a program billed as Mark Morris Dance Group
and Yo-Yo Ma. The pieces are very different.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston premiere of ``Falling Down Stairs,'' which Morris
has adapted from choreography for a film, his dancers actually do
fall down steps and perform a staircase dance that Bill (Bojangles)
Robinson would admire.
</P>
<P>
   In the world premiere, ``The Argument,'' three couples in search
of a marriage counselor finally make peace. The latter work, which
featured Mikhail Baryshnikov as a guest, was the crowd pleaser; it
is clever and witty. But ``Falling Down Stairs,'' more legible in
its broad strokes of movement, is richly textured and one of
Morris' best works in years, largely because it is so original.
</P>
<P>
   Ma, the cello soloist in ``Falling Down Stairs'' and playing
with the pianist Ethan Iverson in ``The Argument,'' was onstage in
both works. He was in the pit for the familiar ``Rhymes With
Silver,'' set to Lou Harrison's music. Ma was the living link among
the works, but there is another link between the two newest pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Both are set to dance forms, although they are very different in
style and period. Bach's Baroque dance forms in his Third Suite for
Unaccompanied Cello are virtually unacknowledged as such by Morris
in ``Falling Down Stairs.'' But the folk dances evoked in
Schumann's ``Five Pieces in Folk Style'' get an occasional
good-natured nod in ``The Argument.'' Nonetheless, there are no
rustic lads and lasses among the three combative and sophisticated
urban couples here, despite an occasional mock mazurka.
</P>
<P>
   One might say that Morris is working against the music in ``The
Argument,'' and that in ``Falling Down Stairs'' he is working with
it in an oblique way. He captures the shifting mood of the Baroque
dances in the Bach suite; his sculptured groupings translate the
gravity, for instance, of the suite's stately sarabande.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the program was indeed ``Falling Down Stairs.'' If
Morris and Ma have embarked on what looks like a good humored
journey in compatibility, it is thanks to Ma's initiative.
``Falling Down Stairs'' was originally choreographed by Morris for
one of six films that Ma commissioned for ``Yo-Yo Ma, Inspired by
Bach,'' a series of videos that explore Bach's Six Suites for
Unaccompanied Cello.
</P>
<P>
   The stage version, performed only once before, in Berkeley,
Calif., in 1997, will be seen at a single performance at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music on March 30. Baryshnikov will perform
that night, but unlike Ma will not tour with the company to other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   To consider a musician of Ma's stature an accompanist in this
context would be unjust and misleading. Because he is part of the
show when he is onstage, it is easy to see how invigorated he is by
the dancers' response to his playing. The physical proximity of the
music creates less of a distance between sound and movement than is
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Morris used the descending scale as a conceit for his opening
image. Most of the 15 dancers on a set of bleacher-style steps turn
to the audience and fall prone. Isaac Mizrahi's costumes, velvet
robes that range from long to very short, reveal the bare-legged
dancers' undies during their frequent leaps, runs and tilts. But
under Michael Chybowski's grand lighting, the rich hues of the
velvet suggest a social mix of the courtly and the cloistered: a
polite orgy in a cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The suite's prelude suggests a series of simultaneous solos and
introduces the falling, running and rising motifs of the
choreography. Often some dancers are on the floor while others rise
and thrust up a fist.
</P>
<P>
   The allemande section is the closest to a Baroque pattern. The
dancers perform several line dances. But even here there is some
hearty arm swinging, the same sense of unruliness. The courante
brings in several trios and small circling groups before there is a
wonderful onrush of chain dances that end in revolving swirls and
whirlpools. A dancer is tossed up.
</P>
<P>
   The sarabande is slow and the choreography concentrates on
dancers moving arms while rooted to one spot. The dancers pose in
groups and at the end a woman holds her arms out atop the steps.
The bourree is humorous and an exercise in structure. Nine dancers,
divided into trios on the tiered steps, move their palms in
prayerlike gestures in unison, and finally in canon. In between, a
group below is set loose.
</P>
<P>
   The closing gigue is the staircase dance done with two or four
dancers running up and down at different times as the ensemble
below turns and whips around. At the top of the stairs, three men
eventually strike a woman in slow motion until she shoots up, her
arms out in an instant resurrection. Below, the populace raises
fists and runs out, vanquished by the final image.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Argument'' starts off with Morris running in and out and
then Marjorie Folkman, marvelously supercilious, in a combative
duet with Baryshnikov in the kind of male chauvinist pig role he
had in Twyla Tharp's ``Nine Sinatra Songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, as there, he grabs a partner's arm and she throws him off.
The choreography is straightforward and both dancers are
wonderfully understated.
</P>
<P>
   If Baryshnikov, in a black turtleneck, looks gaunt and austere,
Morris, virtually popping out of his shirt, looks cheerfully portly
as he embraces Tina Fehlandt to a slower folk tune. The dance is
less hostile but the movement quirkier. Ruth Davidson and Shawn
Gannon have the tantrum duet, full of stamps and fist shaking. It
is the eye-catching section and very well performed, right up to
the momentary truce of a waltz.
</P>
<P>
   There is a section for two overlapping pairs and one in which
Morris, still the best dancer in his company, offers an arm-waving
generic folk dance until a reprise of the first section's music
assembles the entire cast.

   WASHINGTON _ When the federal government said on Feb. 5 that
wine makers could put educational labels on their bottles, there
was rejoicing in the nation's vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   For too long, wine had been wrongly characterized as inherently
dangerous or even sinful, said John De Luca, the president and
chief executive of the Wine Institute. ``The label approval
represents a defining new chapter in the evolution of federal
policy towards wine in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The powerful trade association of California vintners struggled
for years to achieve the breakthrough. Luck and timing played a
part. So did some statements, official and unofficial, that sounded
innocuous at the time but were anything but that.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the ``defining new chapter'' is hardly the last
word.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican, has proposed
legislation that would overturn the Feb. 5 decision by the Treasury
Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, whose mission
is to regulate the marketplace and collect taxes on alcohol rather
than monitor health effects.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond would transfer labeling authority to the Department of
Health and Human Services and tax wine more heavily to finance
studies of its ill effects. He called the new labels ``health
statements'' that are a danger to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The labels approved on Feb. 5 do not talk about health
``benefits.'' That word was prohibited. One label, offered by the
Wine Institute, says, ``To learn the health effects of wine
consumption, send for the federal government's Dietary Guidelines
for Americans.'' The other, proposed by a California vintner,
reads, ``The proud people who made this wine encourage you to
consult your family doctor about the health effects of wine
consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   De Luca, who described himself as a wine lover, said the
institute is straightforward about the pitfalls of alcohol abuse,
and that it would fight Thurmond. ``Wine makes your food taste
better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is well financed and has the ear of many on
Capitol Hill, including the California Congressional delegation.
For now, the wine makers can imply, if not state outright, that
wine is good for you.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials of the Department of Health and Human Services
tried to head off the new labels. In mid-1997, Dr. John M.
Eisenberg, then Acting Assistant Secretary for Health, wrote John
W. Magaw, director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
that the labeling idea was ``a thinly disguised attempt to make an
affirmative health claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg, now director of the health department's Agency for
Health Care Policy and Research, warned that labels ``could be
construed by the public as encouraging the consumption of alcoholic
beverages.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgeon General David Satcher conveyed similar misgivings to the
Treasury Department. ``Our concern was about the balance of the
message,'' he recalled last week. He said he feared that, despite
the neutral tone of the labels, too many people would misread them
as an encouragement to drink _ an unfortunate message when some
scientists have recommended classifying alcoholic beverages as
carcinogens and when alcohol abuse by teen-agers and collegians is
high.
</P>
<P>
   But the Treasury Department's general counsel, Ed Knight, said
it was powerless to block labels that were not false or misleading.
Moreover, Eisenberg's arguments already had been undercut by a
predecessor in the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the wine makers' real victory came on Jan. 2, 1996.
That day, the new edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans
was issued. The guidelines are updated every five years by a joint
committee of the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human
Services and heavily influence nutritional planning.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines contained some new language on alcohol. They
referred to mounting evidence that moderate drinking may lower the
risk of heart disease for some individuals. Even more
significantly, they said, ``Alcoholic beverages have been used to
enhance the enjoyment of meals by many societies throughout human
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines' new stance on alcohol drew wide publicity and
opened the door for wine makers to campaign for promotional labels.
And the wine people had a strong ally: Dr. Philip Lee, then the
assistant secretary of Health. ``In my personal view, wine with
meals in moderation is beneficial,'' he said that day in 1996, to
the dismay of some people concerned about alcohol abuse. Several
weeks later, the doctor said he had not meant to detract from the
guidelines' warnings about alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Lee grew up in California wine country. His father had a small
vineyard and he learned to enjoy wine with meals. ``I was open to
looking at new evidence,'' the doctor, now head of the Institute
for Health Policy Studies at the University of California at San
Francisco, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Three people who toiled in the background were also crucial to
the wine industry's breakthrough. They made up the Dietary
Guidelines subcommittee on alcohol. ``How incredibly naive we
were,'' one member, Dr. Marion Nestle, recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Nestle, who heads the department of nutrition and food studies
at New York University, said she and the other subcommittee
members, Dr. Irwin Rosenberg and Dr. John Suttie, thought the
Dietary Guidelines' stronger emphasis on a low-fat diet and a
high-exercise life style was more important than references to
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he anticipated the wine industry's exploitation of
the new guidelines, Rosenberg, who is dean of nutrition at Tufts
University, replied: ``No, not at all. It caught all of us by
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   But Suttie, the retired chairman of the nutrition department at
the University of Wisconsin, said he was not that surprised. He
said he agreed with Lee that the previous guidelines had an
excessive ``moralistic flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   ( Satcher and all three subcommittee members emphasized their
respect for Lee, notwithstanding his comments in 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   The first Dietary Guidelines, published in 1980, stated that if
a person drank, he or she should do so only moderately. The second
edition, in 1985, contained similar language. The third, in 1990,
retained the previous language and stated pointedly that alcohol
was not recommended.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1995, scientists and doctors could not ignore the
increasing evidence of the benefits of moderate drinking, at least
for some people. So the guidelines referred to them, while
retaining the earlier caveats.
</P>
<P>
   As for the reference to wine's enhancement of meals, Rosenberg
said it was written into the guidelines merely to justify having
any language about alcohol in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QR; 
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the timing was lucky for the wine interests: the
new guidelines came out soon after a segment of the CBS News
program ``60 Minutes'' explored the relatively low incidence of
heart disease among the French and raised the possibility that it
was due to the French fondness for red wine.
</P>
<P>
   When it announced approval of the labels, the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms pointed to a survey of current wine drinkers,
conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services, which
found that the drinking habits of most would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has suggested that the Wine Institute sought the new
labels to reduce wine consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on alcohol abuse agree that some people wishfully
equate ``moderate'' drinking with their own habits, whether they
have four drinks a week or four before dinner. The Dietary
Guidelines define ``moderate'' as no more than one drink a day for
women, two for men.
</P>
<P>
   Wine bottles bearing the new labels will continue to bear older
labels, mandated by the federal government for the past decade,
warning pregnant women not to drink and drinkers not to drive. The
labels symbolize the contradictions about alcohol: the liquid that
complements a holiday roast or warms a gathering of friends can set
off domestic violence, ruin careers and lives.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg said he would prefer to see no mention of alcohol in
the next edition of the guidelines, due in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond said he was pleased that beer brewers and makers of
hard liquor have not sought labels like those won by the wine
interests. The Treasury Department has conceded that, if they do,
they will be on strong ground, because the guidelines regard beer,
wine and spirits as the same. The beer and liquor lobbies are
waiting and watching.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Suttie suggested, tongue in cheek, that if wine is good
for the heart, maybe grape juice is too. ``Although I haven't seen
a stampede for it,'' he said.

   If you're not convinced the game will interfere with the
delivery, the site also has a link to Mapquest that gives detailed
instructions and a map from whatever sporting venue you'll be at to
the nearest hospital.

 &HT;    Remlinger seeks control, stability
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ To say this is a fresh start for Mike
Remlinger is redundant.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old left-hander has spent his entire career bouncing
around from place to place, and it was only two years ago that
Remlinger became a full-time major leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   He was a first-round draft pick of the Giants after leaving
Dartmouth College. Since then, he's been traded four times and
played in 11 cities in the minors and majors, from Phoenix to
Calgary, Seattle to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   But this move to Atlanta _ which came as part of the Denny
Neagle for Bret Boone deal _ feels different.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time I went to Atlanta for Camp Leo, just meeting the
people I met there, I finally feel comfortable,'' Remlinger said.
``I feel at home. The attitude of the players, the staff, the
people of Atlanta just driving around looking for a place to stay,
people were real friendly. Basically everything is geared toward
one thing and that's winning. To me that's been my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   So have control problems.
</P>
<P>
   He has long been known for having good pitches _ a curveball,
two different fastballs and a changeup he's developed in the past
several years. But he has failed to consistently getting them over
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger was Cincinnati's Opening Day starter last year, but by
the end of the season he was back in the bullpen after winning only
five of his last 18 decisions. He finished with an 8-15 record and
a 4.82 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati did give him the chance to pitch 80-100 more innings
than he would have if he'd been a reliever all year. But when his
name came up in trade talks, he was ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger had heard Philadelphia, Seattle and Tampa Bay
mentioned as possibilities, but the end result was what he liked
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with enough organizations to know the grass isn't
always greener,'' Remlinger said. ``This is ideal for me. Stay in
the National League, have the best pitching staff in baseball. Guys
you have to work with every day, just watch and learn. Plus having
a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't start, unless Kevin Millwood or Bruce Chen falters or
someone gets hurt. But for Remlinger, that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I need to do, whatever they ask me to do, I don't
care because I'm going to help this team win,'' Remlinger said.
</P>
<P>
   He said part of his past problems came from wanting to do too
much, and playing for a team like Atlanta, he won't feel like he
has to. Plus he'll be around two of the best control pitchers in
baseball in Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That alone will make a big difference,'' Remlinger said.
``Watching those guys and learning from them, their habits, what
they do to keep themselves in that groove or what they do to get
back into it if they're a little bit off.''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger also sought some advice for his control problems this
offseason, though he didn't want to say from whom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a point where I wasn't happy to just be here and just
getting by,'' Remlinger said. ``What I'd seen myself do at times
was what I felt I should do all the time. I feel like people who
are saying `You could be one of the best lefties in the National
League' are right. So to myself I said, `What do I need to do to
get there?' For me it all comes down to focus and concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I'm going to pitch as well as I've ever pitched
before,'' he said. ``I've shown flashes of it in the past. So it's
not a question of whether I can do it, it's a question of whether I
can do it time and time again.''

 &HT;    Implicated IOC members deny wrongdoing
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The top International Olympic Committee
official investigating the Salt Lake bidding scandal said Sunday it
was urgent that the committee end the crisis to ``stop the
bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking fatigued as he returned to his hotel from a second day
of closed-door meetings over the scandal, Dick Pound, the IOC
member from Canada, said his inquiry was not yet finished even
though it had hoped to wrap up its work Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to discuss details of the inquiry but said his
commission will probably complete its report within a week and send
its recommendations to the IOC executive board. The board can
exonerate members, warn them or ask for their expulsion by a vote
of the full IOC membership at an emergency session scheduled March
17-18.
</P>
<P>
   Pound's commission has spent more than two months reviewing
allegations related to Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002
Winter Game. So far, 24 members _ a fifth of the committee's
membership _ have been implicated. Pound's commission thus far has
recommended the expulsion of nine members, four of whom have
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials have indicated that few of the remaining members
under investigation have done anything to merit expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Sunday if he was feeling pressure to conclude the
investigation, Pound wearily nodded yes. ``We've got to stop the
bleeding by March 17,'' he said. ``This death by a thousand wounds
isn't much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   At least three members appeared Sunday before the inquiry
commission, which met under tight security at Olympic headquarters
here. Phil Coles of Australia, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, and
Ashwini Kumar of India each told the six-member commission that he
had done nothing to violate IOC ethical standards.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo, who has been recommended for expulsion, said he spent a
half hour with the commission and expressed optimism that he would
be reinstated. ``I told them the truth, which is my habit,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a January report, Pound's commission said Arroyo and his
daughter accepted payments from the Salt Lake bidding committee.
Arroyo said the allegations were false.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar, who was accused of improperly accepting a plane ticket
from the bidding committee from a relative, also said he has been
falsely accused.
</P>
<P>
   Coles, appearing with his lawyer, denied charges he made four
unauthorized visits to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Salt Lake ethics panel reported that the IOC
members or their families benefited from more than $1.2 million in
cash, travel, medical care and other improper inducements.

ANGER AND FEAR STILL STALK GUATEMALAN SURVIVORS

<P>
   CHICHICASTENANGO, Guatemala _ Ana Morales, 80, walks one hour
each day to an exhumation site here in the highlands, and one hour
back. Curled up in her multicolor Quiche Indian dress and shawl,
she sits on the edge of a road off a main highway, but rises to her
feet whenever a team of anthropologists makes a find _ a sock, a
bone, a set of teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Her only goal now, she said, is to find a son who was abducted
while working as a street vendor in Guatemala City in 1981. He was
the second son she lost in the more than 30 years of civil war here
that left 200,000 Guatemalans dead or missing.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the first one, who, Mrs. Morales, said was
bludgeoned with a shovel by people who accused him of being a
guerrilla, was left for her to claim and give a proper burial.
Exactly what happened to her second son, she may never know.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when a truth commission blamed the Guatemalan
government for acts of genocide against the Mayan people during the
war, it sought to nurture national unity by offering the first
official acknowledgment of the atrocities committed in the
conflict, which ended with a peace accord between the government
and guerrillas in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But even now, for thousands of survivors like Mrs. Morales, the
idea of reconciliation remains abstract. The war is over, they say,
but the effort to trace loved ones and to bring those responsible
for their deaths to justice goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assassins are alive, with their families, and I lost two
children,'' Mrs. Morales said, speaking through a Quiche
interpreter. ``I want to know who killed my children. I want to
know the face of the assassins.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission found that the military and allied paramilitary
groups were to blame for an overwhelming majority of abuses during
the war, and that the political and judicial systems acted as
accomplices. It cited instances of gross cruelty, including the
killing of children, and said civilians had often been forced by
the army at gun point to rape, mutilate and kill.
</P>
<P>
   The department of Quiche, in Guatemala's west, was a major site
of massacres during the war, and the ``truth'' spoken by the
commission simply put an official seal on what many here had
already seen.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, among the small crowd gathered around two pits where
forensic scientists dug up remains of some of the Guatemalans left
buried in hundreds of clandestine cemeteries scattered around the
country, those looking for children, parents and husbands said they
welcomed the report for vindicating the victims and bringing the
world's attention to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission contributed to spreading the word about what
happened in Guatemala so that the tragedy is not repeated,'' said
Isabela Mejia, 45, who said her husband was fatally shot during a
1981 army incursion as he sought refuge in the mountains. ``My hope
is that my children never have to live through that again.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Guatemala tries to repair itself, fear remains among
the Mayan people who make up about 60 percent of the country's
population. It was they who suffered most during the war, the
commission found, largely because of institutional racism and
because the Guatemalan army saw them as natural allies of the
Communist insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Morales, who said she saw neighbors killed in a 1982
massacre and was forced out of her home for two years during
``scorched earth'' operations that wiped out entire Mayan
communities, still cringes when she runs into soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could happen all over again because the army is always on
the road,'' she said. ``I saw it with my own eyes that they killed
people. We are waiting for the army detail to withdraw. There's
peace, but the army is still in our community. When I see them, I
still feel like running.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sara Vazquez, a board member with a victim's group called Group
of Mutual Support, which is assisting in the exhumations, said she
last saw her husband in 1984, when neighbors saw two armed men
throw him into the back of a Jeep. A few hours later, three dozen
military police officers stormed her house, she said, telling her
that they were acting on a call accusing her husband of harboring
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Ms. Vazquez, 39, says she has not told her three
adult children the truth about their father, who was a 24-year-old
labor organizer when he disappeared. Instead, seeking to keep them
from vengeance and the bitterness that consumes her, she has
convinced them that he left the family for another woman. ``I don't
want them to be resentful,'' she said. ``I'd rather have them think
their father abandoned them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vazquez keeps searching for her husband even though five
years ago she started a new family and now has a fourth child with
her boyfriend. She criticized the truth commission for not giving
the names of the military officials responsible for criminal acts.
She scoffed at its recommendation that President Alvaro Arzu
Irigoyen and the ex-guerrilla commanders assume responsibility in
the name of the state and ask all Guatemalans for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forgive assassins,'' she said, breaking down.
``They left my home disintegrated. I want them to tell me where my
husband is. After 15 years of struggling to find out, I haven't
achieved anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said it was too late for official apologies since the
military governments that caused the most suffering are no longer
in power. Some were also skeptical of the commission's call for
reparations. Although some victims' groups are seeking compensation
for material losses and ``moral damages,'' some here said they
doubted that a government that has neglected its poor population
for so long would now make any meaningful amends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it would happen,'' said Ana Albatian, 25, who
came here with two of four children in tow searching for her
missing father. ``What for? So that we forget our loved ones?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some day there will be social justice, but we have to get
organized and fight for it,'' she added. ``And there has to be
international pressure for the Government to abide by the peace
accords.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Mayan people, their suffering is all the greater, as
they believe that a body must be given proper burial before the
spirit can progress to the next world. That is why Mrs. Morales,
who lives with her three other children, has traveled here for
years looking for her missing son, who was 40 when she last saw
him. ``I don't know whether he's alive or dead,'' she said. ``I
have to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is dead, she said, she worries that his body could have
been thrown into a river or a down a ravine and that his spirit is
not at rest. She wants to be able to bury him in a cemetery and
bring him flowers. Only then, she said, could she herself die in
peace.

COMMENTARY: TAXPAYERS: REVOLT! 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A half-century ago, government at all levels
controlled a fourth of our economy. Today it's up to a third; this
is the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   This year's rough handling of tax relief was best analyzed by an
economist-humorist:
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless something is done _ and soon,'' writes Dave Barry, ``to
relieve the massive buildup of excess tax receipts, the Treasury
Building will explode and release its contents into the atmosphere,
forming an immense cloud of money. ... If the wind were to shift,
the money could fall back to Earth, where some of it could,
conceivably, wind up _ this is referred to in top-secret government
documents as `The Doomsday Scenario' _ back in the hands of
taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   With the government awash in the profits of prosperity, why has
there been no taxpayers' revolt _ no demand that a chunk of today's
surplus be left in the pocket of its source?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that maintaining today's high rate of taxation is
being falsely sold as ``saving Social Security'' _ as if we were
squirreling away the decades of anticipated surplus for the
boomers' rainy day. But that trust fund is always on loan to the
Treasury; it's a pocket-switching business that does not deal with
real reform, which would be to raise the next generation's
retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the unrevolt is that much of the suddenly
discovered bonanza in Rosy Scenario's ``projected surplus'' could
be used to reduce the national debt. Conservatives like that; it
means that when massive Treasury borrowing is needed to send out
checks to boomer-geezers, interest rates would probably be lower.
</P>
<P>
   So let's deal with reality. If two-thirds of the surplus is
earmarked for debt payment, what sort of tax cut is likely? Clinton
would veto a one-size-fits-all 10 percent rate cut, while his array
of tailored loopholes would not be passed.
</P>
<P>
   1. A PARTIAL FIX OF THE MARRIAGE PENALTY: Social conservatives
argue rightly that government should not discourage marriage.
Today, two people making $100,000 each have to pay up to an
additional $10,000 a year just to have children in wedlock. That's
anti-family, and it's time to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   2. AN EQUAL REDUCTION OF EVERYBODY'S RATES, SHAVING ONLY A
COUPLE OF PERCENTAGE POINTS OFF THE FORTYISH TOP RATE: This is part
of what economic conservatives urge to keep the boom booming. If it
benefits the top third most, that's because the top third pays most
of the taxes and would use that money most productively _ saving,
buying, investing, employing. That system has left the
redistributive world far behind.
</P>
<P>
   3. SOME PROGRESS ON ``DEATH TO THE DEATH TAX'': By confiscating
55 percent of your savings beyond a certain amount when you die,
the government punishes you for saving for your children. Tax
policy now says: You can't take it with you, and you can't leave it
behind, so spend it. But most Americans, and not just richies,
think that you should be able to leave most of what you save to
your kids. A reduction of the estate tax to the percentage of the
top income rate is considered fair.
</P>
<P>
   Such a package of tax cuts might be difficult to vote against.
Vice President Al Gore would think twice before opposing it. It
does not have the sweeping benefit of the historic 1986 reforms,
but today's Senate Finance Committee does not have Bob Packwood and
Bill Bradley to conceive a daringly simple and fair plan and to
build a surprise coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Presented with such a modest but sensible package worked out in
the Congress, what would Clinton do? My guess is that he would
declare victory on ``preserving the surplus'' and averting the full
10 percent across-the-board rate cut, scrap his unsalable
retirement entitlement and cut a deal on the sartorial tax
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated Clinton price for tax cuts: Let's take a $200
billion slice of our projected pie in the sky, and let me plan to
spend half on education while you spend half on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Would Democrats in Congress go along with this sort of a
tax-budget deal? The education lobby would like it; California
could use the anti-missile money; some creative credit could be
found to pay off contingency-fee lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   There; that would comfort the overburdened taxpayer. Let's keep
moving on.

 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAVA-RUSKAYA, Ukraine _ When Andrei needs a few things from the
market _ and he always needs a few things from the market _ he does
what a lot of people around here do: He climbs into the car and
drives to Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Once across the border, he drops by a few wholesalers and farms,
buys as much butter, milk and fat as he reasonably can, and stuffs
it all out of sight, under the back seat and in the trunk. On the
way back, he stops at the Ukrainian border and slips the guard a
few hundred hryvnias. Then he drives carefully home so as not to
attract the police, who tend to want a few hundred hryvnias of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   All that, and he does not even get to eat the food. ``I'm a
middleman,'' he said the other day, huddling in the front seat of
his car, chain-smoking nervously. ``I don't go for big business,
and I don't carry much. I get less profit, but I think in our
situation, the slower you go, the more success you have.''
</P>
<P>
   When the going gets tough, the cliche goes, the tough go
shopping. Things in Rava-Ruskaya are awfully tough. The economy is
depressed; unemployment is endemic and the town, a one-stoplight
sort of place with a few aging storefronts and a two-lane main
street, seems to have but one thing going for it: It is 3{ miles
from much wealthier Poland.
</P>
<P>
   And so it has become not just a smuggler's den, but a smuggler's
kitchen, bedroom, garage and driveway. The main street is littered
with minivans, small diesel trucks and, oddly enough, used British
postal trucks, all preferred vehicles for hauling goods across the
border. The bar attracts passing traffickers; the local grocery is
laden with tins of Polish sprats, Polish canned meat and Polish
sausages.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from town, enterprising folks have converted a couple of
empty buildings into warehouses _ transshipment points for the tons
of food, household cleaners, electronics and other sought-after
items that cross the border daily.
</P>
<P>
   The goods flood in for one reason only: They are cheaper in
Poland and can be resold to Ukrainians at a huge profit. They are
especially cheap if nobody pays the sky-high duties that the
Ukrainian government has imposed on many goods to protect domestic
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   That is the basis for what officials politely call the ``shuttle
trade,'' much of it aboveboard and legal, but a healthy share also
solidly rooted in bribery and stealth.
</P>
<P>
   The business is not confined just to Poland. The Ukrainian
government estimates that shuttle trade accounted for more than 11
percent of all imports in 1997 _ perhaps $2 billion. A survey last
October by the firm Socis-Gallup International concluded that about
one in 35 adults is a shuttle trader, carrying on brisk commerce
with Russia, Hungary and even Turkey, across the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But along Ukraine's depressed western border, the share of
shuttle traders is dramatically higher, partly because there are so
few other jobs and partly because it is so lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Some smuggled Polish products sell for as little in Ukraine as
half the price of identical Ukrainian versions. U.S.
consumer-products giants like Procter &AMP; Gamble and S.C. Johnson,
which have factories in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe, have
complained loudly that they are competing against themselves here _
and losing.
</P>
<P>
   For Andrei, who not only refused to give his last name, but also
refused to confirm that Andrei is really his first, smuggling is
about the only way to exercise the skills he gained in the 1980s at
the Cooperative Teknikum in nearby Lviv.
</P>
<P>
   There, he said, he earned the Ukrainian equivalent of an MBA,
but could find no better job than assistant manager at a pizza
parlor. With a small family to support, that was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have continued my work there, but I wasn't satisfied
with my salary,'' he said. ``I calculated that I'd be able to earn
more money by myself.'' He has. These days, he said, he makes a
daily run to Poland _ usually for food that can be easily resold to
the hordes of sidewalk vendors in cities like Lviv, but from time
to time for stereos, televisions and even the occasional
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Asked directly how he manages to get such booty back over the
Ukrainian border, Andrei was almost comically circumspect. ``Take
margarine: to bring in 200 kilograms,'' _ about 440 pounds _ ``one
has to pay $1,100 in customs taxes,'' he said. ``People look for
opportunities to carry things, not paying taxes _ somehow to hide,
to agree with the customs officers that it can come through.'' But
doesn't that require a bribe? ``I wouldn't like to talk about
that,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Others do, however. Under Ukraine's customs regimen, anyone can
bring a small amount of food or other goods into the country _
about $75 worth _ and pay a minimal duty. Above that, the fee
skyrockets. Trying to clamp down on the shuttle trade, the
government doubled and even tripled duties on more than 600
consumer products last April.
</P>
<P>
   That cut into cross-border business, but at the cost of making
bribery an even more attractive option for traders and customs
officers alike. These days, a gratuity to a customs officer runs
from $10 for a small-time trader like Andrei to $2,000 for one of
the tractor-trailer loads of goods brought in by organized gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the state customs service fired one in every 13 of
its 17,000 customs officers for violations, mostly involving
bribery and abuse of power. City police at the port of Odessa,
another major smuggling center, arrested one customs officer last
fall who was found to have $523 U.S. dollars and a ``substantial
amount'' of Ukrainian currency in his pockets. The officer had been
arrested just after lunch; most of his working day lay before him.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the take from bribery is said to flow up the chain of
command. Only last November, German police arrested the director of
customs operations for half the Poland-Ukraine border as he was
withdrawing more than $1.1 million in German marks from a German
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Gen. Oleksiy Chernyshov, was allegedly part of a
smuggling ring that traded alcohol and cigarettes. How the general
managed to rise from third-class adviser, at two customs
checkpoints, to head of the region in the space of several months
is yet to be explained.
</P>
<P>
   The government, aware that bribery is costing it hundreds of
millions of dollars in lost tax revenues, is trying to break the
links between customs officers and traders. Customs officers are
rotated periodically to new posts to discourage familiarity with
the people they inspect. Recently, the person in charge of the
checkpoint near Rava-Ruskaya was moved to another town, leaving
traders to wonder whether a crackdown is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is. For now, Andrei is a fairly accurate barometer of
how the traders are faring. ``Look,'' he said, a trace of pride in
his voice. ``I've got a new car.''

VISCOUNT ECCLES, 94, A TORY INTELLECTUAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Viscount Eccles, a bookish British businessman turned
Conservative politician who served in the Cabinets of four prime
ministers without quite breaking through to the top ranks he had
seemed destined for, died on Wednesday. He was 94 and had ended his
public career as head of the independent British Library he had
helped create.
</P>
<P>
   When Lord Eccles, then David MacAdam Eccles, let it be known in
1950 that he was the intellectual leader of the Tory party, there
was perhaps more truth to the boast than needed to be mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   As a well-read collector of rare books, paintings and sculpture
and a man of considerable cultural refinement, his credentials were
impeccable. But what some saw as a preening elegance and an
overweening arrogance did not sit well with his political rivals.
They promptly dubbed him ``Smarty Boots,'' a sobriquet that stung
as well as it stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, throughout his two-decade career in the House of
Commons, Lord Eccles' tendency to put his foot in his mouth, or
drop bricks, as he put it, made him his own worst political enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he managed to do effective work during two stints as
minister of education and one as president of the Board of Trade,
Britain's rough equivalent of secretary of commerce, and even more
in a late-career turn as paymaster general, the de facto minister
of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   But for Lord Eccles, a man who envisaged himself as a chancellor
of the Exchequer or even a prime minister, that was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   The son and grandson of prominent physicians and the
great-great-grandson of the developer of macadam paving, Lord
Eccles had no interest in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after studying economics at Oxford, where he helped
support himself by the shrewd buying and selling of rare books, he
created something of a family scandal by going into commerce.
Beginning as a clerk, he rose to a senior position in an investment
company whose holdings included a Spanish railway.
</P>
<P>
   Although on his way to making a major fortune, after World War
II began he was recruited into the Ministry of Economic Warfare and
assigned to Spain and Portugal, where he swiftly proved as adept at
giving away money as he had been at making it.
</P>
<P>
   In a position he later described as ``an apostle of bribery,''
he concluded sweetheart trade agreements and funneled millions to
politicians, generals and other influential figures in what turned
out to be a successful effort to keep Spain and Portugal neutral
and deny the Nazis an entree into North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1942, concerned that his free-wheeling ways abroad were
threatening his marriage to his childhood sweetheart, Sybil Dawson
_ the daughter of Lord Dawson of Penn, the turn-of-the century
royal physician _ he abruptly abandoned what seemed to be a highly
promising career and requested reassignment to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Eccles, who once described his husbandly ways as ``constant
but not chaste,'' saved his marriage, and after the death of his
wife in 1977 published ``By Safe Hand,'' a moving collection of the
couple's wartime correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year of his return, Prime Minister Winston Churchill
asked him to run for a parliamentary seat in Chippenham, in
southwest England, and Lord Eccles obliged.
</P>
<P>
   He had never given a speech, but once he did he became so
enchanted that after he was elected he became one of Parliament's
most frequent orators, after the 1945 Labor victory, as the
designated opposition expert on economic matters.
</P>
<P>
   After Churchill and the Conservatives returned to power in 1951,
Lord Eccles was appointed minister of works, a decidedly declasse
Cabinet post that took on added glamour after the death of King
George VI put Lord Eccles in charge of the coronation of Queen
Elizabeth II in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   What should have been seen as an unqualified triumph of pomp and
planning was marred when Lord Eccles offhandedly likened the
coronation to show business and described the queen as a perfect
leading lady.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the queen rewarded him with a knighthood and he was
promoted to minister of education, a post he held under Churchill
and Sir Anthony Eden until 1957 when the next prime minister,
Harold MacMillan, made him president of the Board of Trade, a
position Lord Eccles saw as a sure stepping-stone to chancellor of
the Exchequer.
</P>
<P>
   Although he concluded Britain's first trade agreement with the
Soviet Union, after two rancorous years he was shifted back to
minister of education, where he remained until 1962 when Macmillan
asked him to return to the Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Eccles, who had expected to be named chancellor of the
Exchequer, was so outraged that he refused the assignment and
resigned, soon being named a baron, a comparatively lowly position
that he took as a slight until the succeeding prime minister, Sir
Alec Douglas-Home, had him elevated to viscount two years later.
</P>
<P>
   He pursued his successful business career until 1970, when Prime
Minister Edward Heath named him paymaster general. As the minister
in charge of the arts, Lord Eccles, who had been chairman of the
British Museum, helped push through a bill creating a British
Library incorporating what had been the main reference library at
the museum. After he left the Cabinet in 1973 he became the
library's first chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Eccles is survived by his second wife, Mary Hyde; two sons,
including John Dawson Eccles who becomes the second Viscount
Eccles; a daughter; seven grandchildren, and 11
great-grandchildren.

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Ethiopia declared ``total victory'' Sunday over
Eritrea in their border conflict after a four-day offensive
dislodged the Eritrean army from a craggy piece of borderland both
sides conceded all along was not worth very much.
</P>
<P>
   The brief but furious fighting may have cost thousands of lives,
and it was too early to predict whether it was over for good.
Indeed, Eritrea said that fighting continued Sunday morning in the
Badme region, the central point of contention along the two
nations' 600-mile border.
</P>
<P>
   But Eritrea said it had no plans for a counteroffensive. On
Saturday night, Eritrean officials agreed before the U.N. Security
Council to accept the only peace plan on the table, which Ethiopia
had already approved.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia unleashed a fierce offensive on Tuesday that has been
described as a World War I-style assault on Eritrean trenches. The
Ethiopian government said Sunday that it had not decided whether to
accept what seemed to amount to an Eritrean admission of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take a position and we will make it public as soon as
we do,'' said Selome Taddesse, an Ethiopian spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many conflicts raging around Africa, the war between
Ethiopia and Eritrea has been watched with particular worry by
other nations because the combatants are so heavily armed and well
organized. Fighting had flared briefly last spring, and since then
both nations have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on modern
weaponry that is rare in Africa, including fighter planes and
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   As predicted, the casualties may be stunningly high. Eritrea
said Sunday that it had killed 14,000 Ethiopians since fighting
began again 22 days ago, more than 9,000 of them since Tuesday
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia dismissed the number as ``ridiculous,'' yet it said it
had ``captured, killed and wounded tens of thousands.'' It provided
no details.
</P>
<P>
   The front has been off-limits to foreigners, and there are no
reliable estimates of casualties, though one U.S. official
estimated 3,000 dead before Ethiopia began its offensive on
Tuesday. Since then, Ethiopia has pounded Eritrean positions with
bombs and artillery and finally launched a human assault on
Eritrea's trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia's war with Eritrea, which was part of Ethiopia until
six years ago, was long in coming but seemingly impossible to head
off.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the two proud nations were accustomed to war and
had fought side by side for years against the former Ethiopian
military government of Mengistu Haile Mariam, who was toppled in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea, which had been the northern region of Ethiopia,
declared independence with Ethiopia's blessing in 1993, although
its departure left Ethiopia without a port and thus landlocked.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of disputes arose in 1997 concerning trade and
Eritrea's introduction of its own currency over Ethiopia's
objections. More broadly, Eritrea never seemed convinced that its
independence had been accepted by Ethiopia. Many Eritreans believe
Ethiopia has been fighting this war to re-annex the much smaller
nation.
</P>

<P>
   ``There were indications that the final destination was
Asmara,'' said the Eritrean government spokesman, Yermane
Gebremeskel, referring to Eritrea's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taddesse, the Ethiopian spokeswoman, said it has no designs
on Eritrean territory. ``But,'' she said, ``we have said repeatedly
we will regain our sovereign territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Who owns exactly what has been confusing because the two nations
never officially drew up their border. Last May, Eritrea said that
it had rights to Badme, a sparsely populated and hilly region, and
invaded it.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrean soldiers appeared to have dug into positions in the
high ground in Badme, and few experts predicted that Ethiopia would
be able to dislodge them so quickly. But on Sunday Gebremeskel
acknowledged that Eritrea had withdrawn completely after Ethiopian
troops overwhelmed their positions in fighting on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were coming in waves,'' he said. ``We had a good
defensive position but when they pushed through we withdrew. In
real terms we have not suffered in terms of human casualties or
lost hardware, but we have lost space.''
</P>
<P>
   If the fighting is in fact over, focus now will turn to the
peace proposal, drafted last year by the Organization of African
Unity. The plan calls for a cease-fire and for both armies to
withdraw while an international team settles the boundary issue.
Eritrea had previously objected to restoring Ethiopian civil
administration in the region, preferring instead to rely on a team
of international monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Gebremeskel said, however, that Eritrea decided to accept the
plan once it was ousted from Badme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we are not in Badme anymore it doesn't make much
sense to talk about who will be administering it,'' he said.

BETTY ROCHE, BLUES SINGER WITH ELLINGTON, DIES AT 81  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Betty Roche, a singer who performed with Duke Ellington in the
1940s and '50s and was noted for her strong, dramatic delivery of
blues material, died on Feb. 16 at the Mainland Manor Nursing and
Rehabilitation Center in Pleasantville, N.J. She was 81.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a soul inflection in a bop state of intrigue,''
Ellington wrote about Ms. Roche in his oblique style of praise,
``and every word was understandable despite the sophisticated hip
and jive connotations.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Mary Elizabeth Roche (pronounced ro-SHAY) in Wilmington,
Del., she began her career by winning an amateur contest at the
Apollo Theater in Harlem. In 1941 she sang with the Savoy Sultans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roche joined Ellington in 1943, replacing Ivie Anderson just
before Ellington's first Carnegie Hall concert and scored highly
with the critics and audience in her section of the Ellington suite
``Black, Brown and Beige.''
</P>
<P>
   Her feature within the suite was the ``Blues'' sequence, meant
to express the feelings of blacks who settled into urban life at
the start of the 20th century. With its famous pyramidal lyric
scheme _ it begins, ``The blues/the blues ain't/the blues ain't
nothing/the blues ain't nothing but a cold gray day'' _ it became
one of Ellington's greatest pieces for a singer.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Roche's rendition, in a concert recording, was not
released until the 1970s because when Ellington made a studio
recording of the suite in 1944, Ms. Roche already had been replaced
by Joya Sherrill. In a similar bit of unfortunate luck, Ms. Roche
sang ``Take the A Train'' with Ellington in the 1943 film
``Reveille With Beverly'' but wasn't recorded singing Ellington's
signature tune until nine years later, in a be-bop style, on the
album ``Ellington Uptown.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roche also performed and recorded with the pianist Earl
Hines, the trumpeter Clark Terry and the singer and pianist Charles
Brown. She made three recordings under her name for the Bethlehem
and Prestige labels in the late 1950s and early 60s.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by three grandchildren. &QL;

MORE THAN 10,000 WELFARE RECIPIENTS HIRED BY FEDERAL AGENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal agencies have hired more than 10,000 former
welfare recipients in the last two years, meeting a goal set by the
White House 19 months ahead of schedule, administration officials
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore plans to announce the numbers on Monday
at a meeting in San Francisco with companies that have hired people
off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered government agencies to hire welfare
recipients in a radio address in March 1997. At the time, Clinton's
goal seemed ambitious because the government was not hiring many
people, and the number of civilian federal employees was at the
lowest level in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore will report that the federal government has hired
10,187 former welfare recipients since March 1997. The White House
had set a goal of hiring 10,000 people from the welfare rolls by
the end of the next fiscal year in September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has repeatedly prodded private employers to
hire welfare recipients. Gore coordinated federal hiring efforts,
and he says he believes that ``the federal government should lead
by example.''
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department has hired 3,194 former welfare
recipients, or 76 percent of the number it was supposed to hire by
the end of the next fiscal year. Some of the new employees are
helping the government prepare for the census next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has hired 2,094 people from the welfare
rolls, exceeding its quota of 1,600, and the Department of Veterans
Affairs has hired 1,323, far above its quota of 800.
</P>
<P>
   But data compiled by the White House show some agencies haven't
yet reached their goals. The State Department, for example, has
hired only 56 former welfare recipients, representing 25 percent of
its quota of 220 through the year 2000. The Justice Department has
hired 245 former welfare recipients, or 54 percent of the 450 it is
supposed to hire by September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services has met its goal,
hiring 300 people who were receiving public assistance. Most of the
new employees work outside Washington, in offices and clinics of
the Indian Health Service.
</P>
<P>
   The White House itself has hired eight former welfare
recipients, two more than it had promised to hire.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fewer than 8 million Americans are on welfare, the lowest number
in decades. The number stood at 14.1 million in January 1993, when
Clinton took office, and has fallen 35 percent since August 1996,
when he signed a comprehensive bill overhauling the welfare system
and establishing strict work requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in federal welfare policy come at a time of strong
economic growth, when many companies are avidly seeking workers.
</P>
<P>
   A private nonprofit group, the Welfare to Work Partnership,
formed in 1997 with support from Democrats and Republicans alike,
helps companies hire welfare recipients. Gore will say the 10,000
companies in the Welfare to Work Partnership have now hired 410,000
welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Eli J. Segal, president of the Welfare to Work Partnership, said
companies hiring welfare recipients described them as good,
productive employees. ``Companies report higher retention rates for
welfare recipients than for other newly hired employees,'' Segal
said.
</P>
<P>
   Employers often provide extra training to welfare recipients,
and they have discovered that it is useful to assign a mentor, or
job coach, to each person hired off welfare, Segal said.

BANSHEE BREEZE WINS EASILY AS 2 STAR FILLIES ARE WITHDRAWN FROM
RAMPART HANDICAP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ The Rampart Handicap fell apart as a prime
test for star fillies Sunday when Harpia was withdrawn because she
didn't seem frisky, and later when the speed filly Lines of Beauty
was scratched and Angel of a Mom unseated her jockey during the
post parade and was also withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   So, Gulfstream Park was left with James Tafel's Banshee Breeze,
last year's champion 3-year-old filly, who stepped smartly forward
in her 1999 debut and flew home 5{ lengths in front of Glitter
Woman to win the Rampart.
</P>
<P>
   Banshee Breeze did it after her trainer, Carl Nafzger, said she
would be operating at 95 percent of her customary form. She had not
raced since November, when she ran second by a nose to Escena in
the Breeders' Cup Distaff. But before that, she had clicked off
victories in the Coaching Club American Oaks, the Spinster and the
Alabama, and closed the year by winning 6 times in 10 starts and by
running in the money all 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was impressive today,'' said Nafzger, who also trained
Banshee Breeze's sire, Unbridled, winner of the 1990 Kentucky
Derby. ``There wasn't anybody in there. I wanted Harpia in there
for the speed. I'm disappointed for anyone who couldn't run. I know
how it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the wave of scratches, the field was cut to five
fillies and the only one with a true chance of outrunning the star:
Glitter Woman, who had run in the money in 20 of her 21 races. But
the scratches removed the two fillies expected to show early speed
and force the issue: Harpia, who had won her last five starts, and
Angel of a Mom, who had won 5 of 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought this morning that the speed horses
would both be scratched?'' said Mike Smith, the rider on Glitter
Woman. ``I had no choice but to go to the lead. I tried to set a
slow pace, and I had a horse left when the winner challenged me.
But my horse just wasn't good enough. After all, that other horse
is a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Shug McGaughey, who trains Glitter Woman, agreed. ``The race
changed with the scratches,'' McGaughey said. ``She got beat by a
good horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey, who switched off his regular ride on Glitter Woman
to ride Banshee Breeze, said: ``It was a champion-type race, and
that's what she is. Just awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Banshee Breeze loped along easily, while Glitter Woman inherited
the early lead from the missing speed horses. She ran second after
half a mile, still second after three-quarters. Then, as they
turned for home, Bailey reached for his whip but never used it.
Banshee Breeze shot into the lead and beat Glitter Woman, who had
four lengths on Timely Broad.
</P>
<P>
   The winner ran the mile and a sixteenth in 1:42 4/5, paid $3.20
for a $2 bet to win and added $120,000 to a bankroll that passed
$1.5 million. Next, Nafzger said, she will continue her pursuit of
another championship in the Apple Blossom at Oaklawn Park on April
10.  &QL;

IN BREAK WITH TRADITION, JAPAN ALLOWS TRANSPLANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ For the first time in Japan, doctors performed a legal
heart transplant on Sunday, striking at a taboo on taking organs
from patients whom Japanese traditionally do not consider dead.
</P>
<P>
   As 100 reporters watched on closed-circuit television, doctors
removed an ailing heart from a man in his 40s and stitched in a
healthy one. The operation was an ethical and emotional milestone
in a country that has long believed that death comes only after the
heart stops beating and the body turns cold.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, Japan was locked in a fiery debate over
transplants and was pondering the definition of death. Many
Japanese feel uneasy about defining brain death as the end of life,
and doctors usually continue to treat patients as long as their
hearts are still beating.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the developed world, however, a person is considered
dead if the brain stops functioning, when healthy organs can still
be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese Parliament passed a law in 1997 permitting doctors
to remove organs from brain-dead patients, and compromised on the
definition of death, saying that brain-dead patients would be
considered dead only if they had specified that they wanted to
donate their organs. But the law had not been applied until
Sunday's heart transplant, which is only the second in Japan's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Juro Wada performed the first 31 years ago in a legally
ambiguous environment, and when the recipient died, the doctor was
accused of murder.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, thousands of Japanese have flown overseas to
get transplants, or have simply died.
</P>
<P>
   In the first stage of Sunday's operation, doctors at the Kochi
Red Cross Hospital in western Japan removed the heart, liver and
kidneys from the brain-dead patient, the nation's first legal organ
donor, who was in a coma after suffering a stroke and a brain
hemorrhage. Details about the donor, even sex and age, are being
kept confidential until after the funeral, at the request of the
family.
</P>
<P>
   The recovering heart recipient spoke a few words at a university
hospital in Osaka, where his operation was performed.
</P>
<P>
   The liver went to a 43-year-old resident of Nagano, in Japan's
first such transplant. The kidneys are going to people in the south
and north.

   DENERAL JANKOVIC, Yugoslavia _ More than 2,000 people fled their
villages during heavy fighting in southern Kosovo Sunday and
swamped a major border post in a desperate effort to cross over to
safety in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav army artillery and anti-aircraft guns could be heard
battering the mountainous region west of the border post of Deneral
Jankovic in the late afternoon. It was the most serious fighting in
the Serbian province since the peace talks with ethnic Albanian
separatists ended inconclusively last week. Serbia is one of two
provinces in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign observers trying to monitor a cease-fire in Kosovo for
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have
watched the army move large amounts of armor and troops into the
border region in recent days. Now they seem to be putting it to use
to clear and take control of a swathe of territory along the border
and overlooking the main road.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from several villages just west of the border post said
that fighting had started early in the morning and that soldiers
had stormed their villages in large numbers. About 90 percent of
Kosovo residents are ethnic Albanians, most of whom are Muslims,
and many thousands have fled their villages because of the fighting
since the government cracked down on separatist rebels a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Imam Hasan Hasalari, the Muslim leader of the village of
Rejance, said an army troop truck pulled up outside his home at
7:30 in the morning. The soldiers fanned out and two took up
positions in his garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid to go out,'' he said. ``Then just 500 yards away
heavy shooting broke out and big explosions. Then I was afraid to
stay in the house. I saw people running out the back and I climbed
out of a window and ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasalari ended up with 2,000 to 3,000 others clamoring to cross
the border at Deneral Jankovic, but they found their way blocked by
Serbian police. Turned back because they had no papers or
passports, the refugees stood in the street all day in rising panic
as police carried out house-to-house searches in the border
village.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening the refugees had been given shelter in houses
there.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one house just off the main street, about 30 women and
children filled a single room. Shemsije Sermjani, a nervous young
woman with dark rings round her eyes, told of how they had fled
their village, Palivodenica, at 10 in the morning. ``We heard
shooting and saw army patrols moving up into the hills above,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two weeks, we had been watching the troop movements
around. We were all ready to leave at any moment.'' She said that
her 80-year-old father and her brother had stayed in the village to
watch their house and animals. ``We don't know what will happen,''
she added. ``It is very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Villagers said Serbian forces had begun Sunday's action by
attacking the village of Pustenik, a known stronghold of ethnic
Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, and then swept
on through neighboring villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are ethnically cleaning villages in a five-kilometer area
of the border,'' said one monitor there, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity. He said he thought Serbian forces were trying to take
territory before peace talks resume on March 15 and that the
operation did not specifically seem to be against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have moved to reinforce their position,'' he said. ``It
is all part of the politics.''

ARGENTINE PRESIDENT ADMITS INTEREST IN 3D TERM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Seven months after he announced he was
leaving office, President Carlos Saul Menem says he will run for
re-election if his supporters can legally overturn a constitutional
ban prohibiting a third consecutive term.
</P>
<P>
   Menem's aides say that he is convinced the country needs him in
office to resist the financial contagion spreading from neighboring
Brazil and that he is committed to negotiating a treaty with the
United States over the next few years that would replace the peso
with the dollar as Argentina's currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a possibility of running in the primaries, I'll do
it,'' Menem said in a radio interview on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Menem remains far behind in the polls, and, with the ruling
Justicialist Party's primary vote due in May or June and the
general election scheduled for October, he may be running out of
time. But since he was first elected as a dark-horse candidate in
1989, he has repeatedly surprised analysts with his political
resourcefulness and cunning.
</P>
<P>
   After Brazil's problems accelerated with its Jan. 13
devaluation, Menem's standing in opinion polls improved somewhat.
He is generally credited with ending Argentina's long history of
hyperinflation by pegging the peso's value one-to-one to the dollar
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine constitution prohibits three consecutive
presidential terms. A 1995 amendment specifically barred Menem from
a third term, since the Constitution was written after he was
already in his first term. Menem's supporters are appealing to the
Supreme Court to strike that amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say the case will be a test of the independence of
the judiciary. Over the years, court rulings have favored Menem.
But since he announced he would step down, the courts have shown
increasing independence.
</P>
<P>
   Menem's aides said he could run in the primary while waiting for
the Supreme Court to make a ruling. They said Carlos Reutemann, a
senator from Santa Fe Province, could run as Menem's vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Menem is a bitter enemy of Eduardo Duhalde, the Buenos Aires
governor and current leading Justicialist candidate for president.
Even if Menem were to lose re-election to the Buenos Aires mayor,
Fernando de la Rua, who is the Alianza presidential candidate,
analysts say Menem does not want to risk losing his leadership of
the Justicialist party to Duhalde.
</P>
<P>
   The former president, Raul Alfonsin, a leader of the Alianza
opposition coalition, said Congress should consider impeaching
Menem for attempting to subvert the Constitution. He said Menem was
acting strangely due to a ``strange psychological state.'' Menem
responded angrily, saying no one should listen to Alfonsin because
``he couldn't govern the country.''

USC, NIT SEPARATED BY TWO DESERT VICTORIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC has not won at Arizona since 1985, but the
Trojans will probably need an upset at McKale Center on Thursday
for any chance of making the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road is tough, but we've been in some road games,'' USC
coach Henry Bibby said. ``I'm happy going into the Arizona and
Arizona State games. Both of those teams are beatable. But we can't
have any lulls in our game there. We have to play consistent on
both ends of the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The daunting scenario for the Trojans (14-11, 6-10) is that even
if they somehow buck the odds and defeat the seventh-ranked
Wildcats, they probably also have to beat Arizona State in Tempe on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't beat Arizona and then not beat Arizona State,'' USC
center Brian Scalabrine said. ``That won't really help us.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Improved defense: USC's defense continues to improve. The
Trojans have held opposing teams to 43 percent shooting or less in
the past seven games and given up 68 points or less in six of
those.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we understand now that Bibby has a lot of concepts,''
Scalabrine said. ``Now guys are starting to understand where and
when to play defense, when to play man-to-man and when to play
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Better intensity: USC is now 4-5 in the second half of Pac-10
play, not exactly impressive but far better than the Trojans' 2-7
record in the first round of conference games. What's the
difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more experienced and focused on what we have to do,''
freshman forward Sam Clancy said. ``In the beginning, I feel we
were going through the motions.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Subtle stat: USC sophomore center Greg Lakey has quietly put
together an impressive streak. Lakey has made 17 straight free
throws and is shooting 87 percent for the season, well above last
season's average of 53 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military ruler
who campaigned as being the only man capable of holding together
this vast and fractious country, on Sunday appeared to have won an
overwhelming victory in the first presidential election here in 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   His challenger, Olu Falae, immediately disputed the fairness of
the vote, held Saturday after years of promises by dictators to
move Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, toward
democracy. It remained unclear, however, whether he would formally
contest the result.
</P>
<P>
   International election monitors, led by former President Jimmy
Carter, said they had witnessed fraud by both sides and other
irregularities, but probably not enough to have swayed the outcome,
which was substantially in Obasanjo's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Official results on Sunday night showed that the retired general
had garnered 62 percent of the votes, compared to 38 percent for
his opponent, from 33 out of 36 states, plus the federal capital.
</P>
<P>
   A victory for Obasanjo would cap a tumultuous period in the
history of Nigeria, ruled until last June by a dictatorship that
had turned the country, the world's sixth-largest oil producer and
the biggest military power in West Africa, into an international
pariah.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be the culmination of an extraordinary personal
journey for Obasanjo, who was released just eight months ago after
serving three years in prison for criticizing the military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Falae, a former finance minister, disputed the fairness of the
election early Sunday evening. ``I said if General Obasanjo won a
free and fair election I would congratulate him but clearly this is
not a free and fair election,'' Falae told journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear whether Falae would formally contest the
results, particularly since they showed him trailing by almost 7
million votes, with the margin widening in Obasanjo's favor as more
returns came in.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials are scheduled to announce final results on
Monday when they will also formally declare the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who led a team of American election monitors, praised
the current military government's commitment to the transition to
civilian rule and the conduct of officials at the Independent
National Election Commission, which oversaw the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute said in
a report on the elections that there was ``no evidence indicating
that electoral abuses would have affected the overall outcome of
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been a pattern of nationwide fraud or
irregularities,'' Carter said in an interview. But he said that
monitors had observed fraud and irregularities in a number of
states, including ballot-boxes that were stuffed, vote tallies that
were inflated and results that were manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   Clement Nwankwo, chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group, an
umbrella organization of Nigerian organizations that dispatched
thousands of observers on Saturday, said that Obasanjo would have
to win over the public, because the irregularities had been serious
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winner must immediately embark on popular measures to deal
with the severe economic problems of this country and build popular
support for himself,'' Nwankwo said.
</P>
<P>
   If Falae contests the results, he will have to appeal his case
to a tribunal, which can decide to hold elections again in certain
areas or throughout the country. The new president is scheduled to
take over on May 29.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most significant for Obasanjo might be the effect of a challenge
by Falae on people in the south. According to the results released
Sunday night, he performed according to expectations by winning
most of the north. But Falae won the southwest, which is dominated
by the Yoruba, one of the three main ethnic groups in Nigeria,
along with the Ibo in the southeast and the Hausa-Fulani in the
north.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are Yoruba. But because of Obasanjo's close ties to the
North, many of his fellow Yoruba distrust him and consider him a
candidate imposed by the northern-dominated military.
</P>
<P>
   The Yoruba have been angry especially since one of their own,
Moshood K.O. Abiola, a billionaire businessman, had his apparent
victory in the 1993 presidential elections annulled by a northern
general. That led to five years of brutal dictatorship under
Abacha, which ended only with his sudden death last June. After
Abiola also died unexpectedly a month later, Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, the current president, announced a timetable for
elections and handover to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Falae was the candidate of the Alliance for Democracy, which is
essentially a Yoruba party with little reach outside the southwest.
The All People's Party, which is strongest in the north, joined
forces with the Alliance for Democracy and presented Falae as their
common candidate.
</P>
<P>
   During a weeklong campaign period, Falae attacked Obasanjo as a
soldier in civilian disguise and described an Obasanjo presidency
as a continuation of military rule. The theme resonated among many
Nigerians weary of the military, which has ruled Nigeria for all
but 10 years since independence from Britain in 1960. But Falae was
unable to spread his message because of poor organization and the
shakiness of the alliance that backed him.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Obasanjo tried to use his military past to his
advantage by arguing that he was the only one close enough to
military officers to prevent them from snatching back power, as
they have done in the past. He would serve as a bridge, his
campaign argued, to a civilian administration.
</P>
<P>
   His party, the People's Democratic Party, enjoyed the most money
and the backing of the retired military elite. The party dominated
in elections since December for local and statewide government
seats, as well as the national assembly.

HOWIE HAAK, BASEBALL PIONEER IN LATIN AMERICA, DIES AT 87  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Howie Haak, a pioneer of baseball scouting in Latin America and
a key figure in the Pittsburgh Pirates' snaring of the future Hall
of Famer Roberto Clemente from the Brooklyn Dodgers' farm system,
died on Feb. 22 in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 87 and a baseball
scout for nearly a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   Long before major league teams built sophisticated training
centers in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, Haak, a protege of
Branch Rickey, was scouring Latin America by automobile, plane and
boat for the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Haak (pronounced Hake) was a catcher in the Cardinals' farm
system in the 1930s and early 1940s, when Rickey was the St. Louis
general manager. Having moved to the Dodgers, Rickey hired Haak as
a scout after he was discharged from the Navy following World War
II. When Rickey left Brooklyn for Pittsburgh after the 1950 season,
he took Haak with him to build a youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1954, the Dodgers signed Clemente, then 19, out of
Santurce, P.R., and sent him to their Montreal Royals farm team.
Rickey heard about Clemente's potential and sent Haak to watch him
play. But when the Royals' manager, Max Macon, saw Haak, he refused
to put Clemente in the lineup, fearing the Pirates might be so
impressed that they would grab him in the next minor league draft.
</P>
<P>
   As Haak would recall it: ``I did see Clemente play in Puerto
Rico after the season was over and my eyes almost popped out. I
told Rickey: `We gotta draft him. He's better than anything we
have.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates took Clemente for $4,000 in the November 1954 draft,
and when Clemente displayed his talents at the Pirates' spring
training in 1955, Rickey told Haak to travel through Latin America
looking for more players like him.
</P>
<P>
   Haak, a burly man who would be known to young Latin Americans as
Big Daddy, signed scores of players for the Pirates, including
Manny Sanguillen, Omar Moreno and Rennie Stennett of Panama; Tony
Pena, Jose DeLeon and Cecilio Guante of the Dominican Republic, Al
McBean of the Virgin Islands and Roman Mejias of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thank God for him,'' Sanguillen once said. ``He's opened
the door for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The epitome of the baseball lifer, Haak accumulated countless
mileage on his trips in Latin America and the United States, often
in a Cadillac equipped with a spittoon as befit the game's champion
tobacco-chewer. He wasn't the first major league scout in Latin
America; the Washington Senators' Joe Cambria had signed many Cuban
players in the 1940s. But Haak traveled more widely than other
scouts in Latin America and opened up new territory for major
league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Haak became involved in controversy in May 1982 when he
suggested that Pirate fans were staying away from Three Rivers
Stadium because they wanted more white players in the lineup. The
Pirate owner, John W. Galbreath, called Haak's remarks ``very
unfortunate,'' but blacks on the Pirates defended Haak, presumably
mindful of all the black players from Latin America he had signed.
He remained with the Pirates through 1988, then spent five years as
a scout with the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Haak looked for pitchers with a good fastball and position
players with speed and strong arms, figuring that pitching
mechanics and hitting techniques could be taught. He took copious
notes and had his wife, Crystal, who survives him, type them up.
</P>
<P>
   He never took Spanish lessons, learning the language in the
course of his scouting trips. As he put it: ``I know enough Spanish
to run tryout camps and get the good guys' signatures on
contracts.''  &QL;

FOR CSUN FOOTBALL, SPRING IS IN AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Spring isn't officially here for another three
weeks. But the calendar is different in the Cal State Northridge
football office. Spring practices begin today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few teams go this early,'' head coach Ron Ponciano said.
``Most teams go in April. I like getting it done quickly. I do not
want to drag out spring football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just as soon get it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN expects to dress 85 players for the first practice. The
Matadors will be out on the field five days a week for the next
three weeks and will scrimmage every Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect CSUN to be doing anything intricate. Ponciano has a
different plan this spring than last year: He wants simple drills
and simple schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to focus more on the fundamentals,'' he said.
``We've got to be more sound. There will be nowhere near the amount
of blitzing you saw last spring.''
</P>
<P>
   With the season opener against Southern Utah six months away,
Ponciano also gets to see the results of the offseason workouts he
designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done more long-sprint work,'' said Ponciano, who doubles
as the strength-and-conditioning coach. ``Some of our fat guys have
lost some weight. This is the only time we're going to improve our
physical standing in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano wants the Matadors to be tougher and leaner. He says he
wants a team that will push Big Sky opponents around. He wants to
shed the ``finesse'' label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitudes and our bodies are changing a little bit,'' he
said. ``Time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in offensive linemen like Ernie Fierro (6-foot-6, 310)
and Johnny Acosta, a transfer from Chaffey College who signed on
Feb. 4, helps. Fierro, a transfer from Nevada, and Acosta, who is
still attending Chaffey, will not participate in spring drills, but
Ponciano believes they will make an impact in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two guys will be sorely missed this spring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal for the Matadors in the next three weeks is to
determine a backup quarterback behind Marcus Brady, last year's Big
Sky newcomer of the year. Josh Fiske, a senior, is listed second on
the depth chart (see box) behind Brady. The 6-foot-3, 205-pounder
from Santa Ynez has been considered a good candidate to move to
wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Fiske) is an athlete we need to have on the field
somewhere,'' Ponciano said.
</P>
<P>
   David Lins, a senior from Crespi High and Valley College, is the
third quarterback who should battle Fiske for the backup spot.

SCHUMER, AS SENATOR, CHANGES TACTICS FROM HIS DAYS IN THE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Charles Schumer says his personal life has not
changed that much since he became New York's junior senator. He
still buys suits at a discount clothier, stays at budget hotels and
urges people to call him Chuck.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer, a Democrat, is sweating the details of a change in
his political life. No longer just the representative for parts of
Brooklyn and Queens, he now must understand the problems, weather
the complaints and be the voice of 17 million constituents,
including many who think he is a city-centric liberal who could not
care less about them.
</P>
<P>
   With his straight-A-student relentlessness, Schumer, 48, has
immersed himself in issues important to upstate communities, from
rising air fares in Syracuse to falling milk prices in Watertown,
from low pay at Fort Drum to high electric rates in Jamestown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason why Rochester, with its great companies and
its great institutions, shouldn't be a high-tech mecca in the
entire Northeast,'' he told reporters at the opening of his
Rochester office last month. ``That's one of the things I intend to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer is also worrying about how he will play to another
audience: his 99 fellow senators. Theirs is a more intimate and
courtly club than the House; individual members have far more power
to shape legislation, personal relations are paramount to success,
and brass-knuckle politics are usually frowned upon.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Schumer was widely considered an effective and
tireless legislator and made himself an expert on a range of
issues, including gun control and banking. But his critics, and
many allies, also viewed him as an incorrigible self-promoter who
could be abrasive and partisan at times. To succeed in the Senate,
they say, he will have to rein in some of those tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to understand that better than Schumer. Accused in
the past of grabbing credit for legislation that others wrote, he
says he plans to allow more senior senators to take the lead on
legislation he once sponsored in the House. He has also been
turning down invitations to appear on television talk programs, he
says, partly to avoid causing resentment among his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   And after years of attacking House Republican leaders, he says
he is learning about bipartisanship in the Senate, vowing to style
himself after the late Sen. Jacob K. Javits, a liberal New York
Republican known for working well with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of renewed bipartisanship that emerged during
impeachment is real, he said in a recent interview. ``I go into a
room with senators, I start thinking, `I get 50 of these guys to
support me on something, I can pass it,''' he said. ``You don't
begin to think that way when there are 435.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on what he described as his attempts to defer to more
senior colleagues, he said: ``As a freshman member, you do things
differently. Whenever there is a group of people talking, I'll
defer to my senior colleagues first, then say my piece.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then added slyly, ``But it's a small group, so it's
less of a wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, old habits can die hard. Some of Schumer's colleagues
expressed amazement at how often he appeared before the microphones
outside the Senate chamber or on television interviews during the
Senate impeachment trial in January.
</P>
<P>
   And when he delivered a stand-up routine at the Washington Press
Club Foundation's congressional dinner last month, Schumer was
widely panned when he took several barbed shots at House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The act, which was written by his staff with the assistance of
the comedian Al Franken, a fellow Harvard graduate, opened with
Schumer poking fun at himself for being a publicity hound. But the
ballroom fell silent when Schumer quipped that Rep. Bob Barr, a
conservative Republican from Georgia, was preparing legislation
titled the Defense of White Marriage Act.
</P>
<P>
   And the silence broke into hisses when Schumer turned to House
Speaker Dennis Hastert and said, ``I'd like to congratulate Denny
on his appointment by Tom DeLay.'' DeLay, the House whip, has been
singled out by some Democrats as being the most powerful Republican
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debacle,'' one Washington weekly, Roll Call, called the
performance. ``Over the top,'' several Republicans said. Even Josh
Isay, Schumer's chief of staff, said, ``I wanted to crawl under the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   No one seriously thinks that the performance will damage
Schumer's standing in the Senate. But it confirmed some people's
impressions of Schumer as hard-edged and partisan, congressional
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   His friends say the misstep has already been forgotten. Schumer,
they contend, is destined for Senate stardom because he is a
natural-born legislator, a pragmatist who can sidestep ideology to
get things done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate is a very wide open place,'' said Sen. Richard J.
Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois who shares a town house on Capitol
Hill with Schumer. ``That plays to his strength. He's a bright
fellow _ I guess you'll have to write that, won't you? _ and he
will be a major player.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has devoted much of his time since the election to
traveling around the state, particularly to the regions north of
the New York City suburbs, traditionally Republican territory that
he has vowed to win in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   He has pledged to put three upstate issues at the top of his
legislative agenda: reducing air fares, cutting utility costs and
creating jobs. He has also said he will travel anywhere in the
country to lobby executives to locate offices upstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has blessed me with a lot of energy,'' Schumer said in
Rochester. ``And I want to put a lot of that energy into helping
companies understand what a great place upstate New York is for
relocating.''
</P>
<P>
   During his upstate tours _ he has made about a dozen since the
election _ Schumer plays the eager student, not shy about asking
questions, or showing off a bit.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with Kodak executives in Rochester, Schumer
noted that he majored in chemistry for two years at Harvard, and
offered some educated guesses as to why silver is light sensitive.
And in a private meeting with officials at Monroe County Community
College, he apparently let slip about his perfect scores on the
Scholastic Aptitude Test.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got more people skills than you'd expect for someone who
got 1600 on his SATs,'' Dr. Peter Spina, the college president,
said after the session.
</P>
<P>
   In his fashion, Schumer has also tried to demonstrate that he is
not just another downstate politician who has no interest in
upstate's problems until election time. One technique: tell jokes
about the city.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner of business leaders in Jamestown, Rep. Amo Houghton,
a Republican from Corning, gave Schumer a red corduroy hat with the
letters, A-M-O. Schumer put the hat on his head, and said with a
wide grin, ``In my district, they would pronounce this ammo.'' The
room broke up.
</P>
<P>
   His trips, Schumer contends, have already affected his votes.
During a November visit to Fort Drum, he rode in a tank and
received a tour from a two-star general who complained about the
Army's problems in recruiting and keeping soldiers. The visit
convinced Schumer of the need for increasing military pay, and he
voted for such legislation last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Schumer said, he might have dismissed the bill by
saying, ``Maybe we should be spending this on other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, whose family lives in the Park Slope section of
Brooklyn, said his frequent travels have not prevented him from
devoting Saturdays to his wife and two daughters, Alison, 9, and
Jessica, 14. He has made every one of Alison's Sunday basketball
games with the 78th Precinct Youth Council, and he still faxes home
solutions to his daughters' math homework problems almost nightly,
his wife, Iris Weinshall, said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weinshall, a deputy commissioner in the city's Department of
Citywide Administrative Services, said being a senator has also not
changed Schumer's taste for modestly priced blue and gray suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A salesman said to him, `Now that you're a senator, you should
buy a more expensive suit,' '' she recalled. ``Chuck said forget
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has spent much of his time in recent days fielding
questions about the potential Senate candidacy of Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who campaigned with him four times last year. Some of his
critics say they think Schumer harbors secret hopes that Mrs.
Clinton will not run, because she would outshine him in the Senate.
But Schumer scoffs at such talk and shows nothing but enthusiasm
about the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``We developed a closeness in the campaign, where she just
knocked my socks off,'' he said. ``In the middle of this whirlwind,
and for her, it was a whirlwind in every conceivable way, there was
this woman, calm, resolute, doing exactly what she set out to do.
Which, to my benefit, was to help elect me.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer says he is uncertain about his role in helping to build
the state Democratic Party. Some Democrats have asked him to take
the party's reins, as Alfonse D'Amato did with the Republican Party
18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer said he expects to fall somewhere between D'Amato,
who ran his party with an iron fist, and Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, who stayed aloof from the state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an area where I think you have to go slowly,'' he said.
``I said in the campaign, and I feel exactly that way now, I want
to help build the party. I don't want to run it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that D'Amato was admired in New York and Washington for
his skill in directing federal funds to the state, Schumer is
careful to tell his audiences that he will work hard at
``delivering'' for them. But he also notes that the senators he
admires the most, like Javits, were experts at both enacting major
legislation and bringing home money.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said his greatest frustration this year has been the
impeachment trial, which caused the Senate to postpone other work.
Boyishly enthusiastic, fond of pumping both fists to show approval,
he said he is thrilled to be finally getting down to legislating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The honeymoon hasn't worn out,'' he said. ``It will wear out.
And it should. I shouldn't be judged on winning the election, but
on what I can do.''

LAZY KINGS FALL TO STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For 20 minutes Sunday afternoon the Kings pressured the
Dallas Stars, desperately trying to produce the tying goal.
Unfortunately for the Kings, this sudden persistence followed 40
minutes of indifference and simply was too late.
</P>
<P>
   It had been too late, in fact, ever since Joe Nieuwendyk of the
Dallas Stars scored 31 seconds into the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first shift of the game, we got caught on a 4 on 1,''
coach Larry Robinson said disgustedly. ``That's not being ready.
That's being stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed Nieuwendyk's goal was a stunning goaltending
exhibition by Stephane Fiset, an overdue and futile display of
intensity by the Kings and the usual exasperation from Robinson
following a 1-0 loss before a sellout crowd of 16,928 at Reunion
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have guys playing at the end of their sticks, trying
not to get hit,'' said Robinson, who relied heavily on eight
forwards in the third period and benched Yanic Perreault for the
final 20 minutes. ``You can't have that.... It should have been
about 7-0.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were blanked for the eighth time, with Dallas goalie
Ed Belfour recording his 44th career shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Kings found themselves holding their breath
hoping winger Donald Audette had nothing more serious than a bruise
from a last-minute slash to the left foot by Dallas defenseman
Richard Matvichuk, who received a game misconduct. Glen Murray was
slashed on the leg in the closing minute, but he stayed in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minute, with Matvichuk and Mike Modano serving
penalties and Fiset off for an extra skater, the Kings briefly had
a three-man advantage but were unable to capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just sit back,'' Audette said. ``As long as we sit back,
we're not going to create chances.''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss, the Kings (23-33-5) fell to 2-2-1 on a six-game
trip that ends Wednesday against the Mighty Ducks at the Pond. More
significantly, they failed to gain ground in the playoff race,
remaining three points behind eighth-place San Jose. After 61
games, the Kings have as many losses as all of last year, four
coming to Dallas, all by one goal. The Stars (38-11-9) are 10-0-6
against the Kings in the last 16 meetings and are 8-1-1 in their
last 10 games, allowing just 17 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it would be a tough game,'' Robinson said, ``yet we
didn't give an effort until the third period.''
</P>
<P>
   It took less than a minute for the Kings to make the mistake
that would haunt them the rest of the day. When Kings defenseman
Sean O'Donnell and winger Sandy Moger were unable to control the
puck along the right boards, the Stars gained an outnumbered rush
and only Doug Bodger remained back defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' Pat Verbeek made no mistake with the puck, sending a
cross-ice feed to Nieuwendyk at the top of the right faceoff
circle, and Nieuwendyk rifled it past a helpless Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the day, Fiset was the only reason the Kings
stayed close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to do my job out there,'' he said after his
33-save effort. ``Right now, me and Jamie (Storr) have to stay
strong and do the job on the ice. That's going to be the only way
if we're going to make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were at their most dominant in the second period,
winning 14 of 17 faceoffs and outshooting the Kings 18-4. In the
third period the Kings outshot Dallas 7-6 but couldn't get anything
past Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to win a game with (18) shots,'' defenseman
Rob Blake said. ``What'd we have, 11 shots in the first two
periods? If we can't score one goal, what's the use?''
</P>

RESTAURATEURS WORRY `THE GIULIANI THING' WILL KEEP DOWN BAR BILLS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few days ago, Marc Sherry, co-owner of the Old
Homestead restaurant in downtown Manhattan, overheard a comment
that sent a chill down his spine. After perusing the menu, one
customer said to another, ``Maybe we shouldn't have that bottle of
wine due to that Giuliani thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry says he supports Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whose
administration has unsheathed a new weapon in the fight against
drunken driving, seizing the cars of those arrested. Sherry adds
that the mayor is a friend, and a frequent customer of the Old
Homestead, which has a longstanding reputation for its high-end
steaks, including Kobe beef from Japan that goes for $125 a plate.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the idea of eating one of his steaks without a
bottle of wine strikes him as incomprehensible. ``Why would
anybody,'' he asked, ``want to drive to a New York City steakhouse
if you can't have a bottle of wine? Think about it. You're buying a
$125 steak, and you're not going to have a glass of wine? Yeah,
you're going to have lemonade with a $125 steak.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir
kicked off the new crackdown on drunken driving, the city's
restaurateurs seem divided on the car-seizure policy and its
effects on their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Maioglio, the owner of Barbetta, an Italian restaurant in
the theater district, predicted a long-term benefit for restaurant
owners. ``The cost of our insurance to cover accidents after
drinking is very expensive,'' she said. Customers, she said, ``can
sue us because we served them too much to drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we tell them they're drunk and cannot have any more to
drink, they can sue us for insulting them,'' she said. ``The whole
thing is a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of the last remaining cities in the country
where people can get almost everywhere by mass transit or taxi, and
drunken driving _ their own, anyway _ is not a big worry.
</P>
<P>
   The places most likely to feel pinched are those in the city's
cultural centers, like Lincoln Center and the theater district,
where out-of-towners flock.
</P>
<P>
   Before a performance, many people want dinner and at most one
glass of wine: having spent at last $50 for a ticket, nobody wants
to nod off during the show. But afterward, they may want to stop
for a drink _ and that is when restaurant owners expect the new
drunken driving policy to hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People drinking all night _ that's no good,'' said Peter
Chimos, an owner of Frankie and Johnny's, a steak-and-martini place
in the heart of the theater district. ``But this is too extreme.
They will be afraid to drink anything. The mayor _ he does a good
job as mayor. But this is too far. We've got to have a little fun,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the new policy went into effect, the police say they have
made at least 34 drunken-driving arrests and seized at least 26
cars on which they expect to begin forfeiture proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hunt, the executive vice president of the New York City
chapter of the New York State Restaurant Association, said he did
not anticipate any decrease in customers or alcohol consumption.
``People are not going to not go out,'' he said. ``And they can't
go to a musical in New Jersey, unless it's a dinner theater.''

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The primary field here is filled every day with
New York Yankees stars, Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams and Paul
O'Neill and Roger Clemens. But Manager Joe Torre likes to slip away
at least once a day to Field No. 2, to spy on the organization's
top prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Johnson, a 20-year-old first baseman, slashes line drives,
as does shortstop Alfonso Soriano. Ryan Bradley fires his darting
sinker, and Luis DelosSantos slings fastballs with arms seemingly
as long as telephone poles.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, will not go so far
as to call any of these youngsters untouchable _ one or two
significant injuries to the pitching rotation and the Yankees could
suddenly be in pursuit of Philadelphia's Curt Schilling _ but the
value of young players has soared in recent years. With the average
major-league salary approaching $1.5 million, a team can save
itself millions of dollars if a young player contributes.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson is a viable option at first base, the Yankees could
pay him a total of $1 million to $2 million over his first three
seasons. Keeping Tino Martinez, on the other hand, might cost $6
million or $7 million a year once his contract expires after the
2000 season; over a three-year period, the Yankees might save $20
million if Johnson is good enough to step in for Martinez. Gone are
the days when top prospects were idly traded away.
</P>
<P>
   There are those in the Yankees' organization who believe that
Johnson will be ready to replace Martinez in two years. Johnson, a
nephew of the former infielder Larry Bowa, is seen as a modern-day
player with an old-fashioned work ethic: Tall and strong, a great
fielder with an extremely quick bat, he wears his baseball pants
high, just below the knee, and thrives on practice. ``I just love
the guy,'' said Lee Mazzilli, Johnson's manager at Class A Tampa
last season. ``He always wants to play, and he'll play hurt. I'd
say to him, `Hey, I'm giving you a day off,' and he would say,
`Why?'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a left-handed hitter, batted .317 with 17 home runs and
drove in 58 runs in 303 at-bats, and he is expected to start at
Class AA Norwich this year. ``He is the Man,'' Cashman said. ``He's
got everything, except for the speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson grew up in the San Francisco area, but he was always a
Phillies fan because of Bowa, his uncle, and he once served as a
batboy in spring training for Philadelphia. His favorite player was
Lenny Dykstra _ he loved Dykstra's gritty style _ but as a shy
teen-ager, Johnson never raised the nerve to speak to the
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   He is not so quiet with his bat. ``We've asked about him all the
time,'' a general manager of another team said in the off-season,
``but there's no way they're trading him. He's on a fast track to
the big leagues.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Soriano, 21, will probably beat him there. He played in Japan
before sitting out last year and earning the right to become a free
agent. Lin Garrett, the Yankees' director of scouting, watched him
work out last summer and reported that if Soriano were available in
the draft, he would be the first pick overall. The Yankees signed
him to a four-year deal at $630,000 a season, and Soriano then
dominated the Arizona fall league.
</P>
<P>
   A native of the Dominican Republic, he is 6 feet 1 inches and
slightly built, but wiry strong; the reliever Mike Buddie threw
batting practice to him in recent days and was surprised by how
hard the right-handed-hitting Soriano could drive the ball to
right-center field. Scouts who have seen him play say Soriano has
great hands defensively, can throw and run well, and will be ready
for the big leagues sometime in the 2000 season. He bats with his
stance slightly open and his hands held high, and he is a good
enough hitter to be moved to third base, assuming that Jeter
remains the Yankees' shortstop for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 23, pitched briefly for the Yankees last year, after
jumping from Class A to the big leagues in little more than a
month. A right-hander, he is big and thick, the way Clemens is,
with a crew cut, and throws a hard sinking fastball that bores in
on right-handed batters. He has a split-fingered fastball, as well,
but wants to develop a changeup this season. Bradley will probably
start the season as a starter for Class AAA Columbus, but the
Yankees believe he has a future as a short reliever, with his nasty
Goose Gossage-like aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has always been an idol to Bradley, and they both like
to intimidate. While pitching for Arizona State, Bradley once
beaned Troy Glaus, then the third baseman for UCLA and now with the
Anaheim Angels. Bradley subsequently drilled Glaus in the ribs and
cursed the UCLA bench, drawing eventual retaliation from the
Bruins. Bradley will live with the reputation of a headhunter.
``That's not necessarily a bad thing,'' he said, referring to his
style as ``effectively wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre repeatedly mentions DelosSantos, 21, as someone he likes
to watch. ``He's just a baby,'' Torre said. After the Yankees
refused to include him in the trade for Chuck Knoblauch last year,
DelosSantos struggled in Class AA before being sent back to Class
A. The right-hander will open this year in Class A.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all said and done,'' Cashman said, ``I really think
he's going to be something.''

CONTINENTS APART, WILLIAMS SISTERS MAKE HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SAL A. ZANCA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Venus and Serena Williams became prodigies and then
top-25 players together, traveling and playing as part of a family
campaign that kept its distance from the tennis establishment. But
the sisters had to travel almost 5,000 miles apart to make history.
</P>
<P>
   Serena, 17, ranked 24th in the world, took her first WTA Tour
singles title Sunday, winning the Gaz de France tournament over
Amelie Mauresmo of France, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (7-4). About five hours
later, Venus, 18, ranked No. 5, repeated as the winner of the IGA
Superthrift Classic in Oklahoma City, beating Amanda Coetzer 6-4,
6-0.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that sisters had won tournaments in the
same week on the WTA Tour. Two sisters played in finals on the same
day in April 1991, but Manuela Maleeva lost in Spain and Magdalena
Maleeva lost in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams' title was her fourth professional singles title.
But Serena, who will move up to No. 21 in the ranking, could boast
that she was three months younger than Venus was in winning her
first singles title, taking it at 17 years 5 months. Serena needed
one hour 57 minutes to defeat Mauresmo, another up-and-coming
teen-ager, while Venus disposed of Coetzer in 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serena said she tried unsuccessfully to talk to her sister
before their matches on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't able to talk to her yet, but I did talk to my dad,
who told me some things,'' said Serena, who won mixed doubles
titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year. ``I'll see Venus
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma City, Venus said, ``I found out that she won before
I came out to play the match, so I really felt that it was my duty
to come out here and win.''
</P>
<P>
   During the week, the sisters traded e-mail messages to stay in
touch. In the past, they have not needed the Internet or
long-distance telephone calls to communicate; they could just call
across the locker room. They have won three doubles titles playing
together on the WTA Tour. But now they are trying different
schedules, with their father, Richard, following one and their
mother, Oracene, following the other.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gaz de France final, Serena Williams and Mauresmo slugged
it out, combining hits with nearly as many misses. At the end, it
took a tie breaker to separate them in a match that may have shown
the future of women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't pretty _ especially in the error-filled third set,
when Williams wasted a 4-1 lead and could not serve out the match
at 5-4, and Mauresmo double-faulted at important times _ but the
strength and all-round attacking games of both players showed that
sticking strictly to the baseline may finally be a thing of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was playing in her first tour final, embraced her
mother at the end of the match before accepting the trophy and
making a short acceptance speech in French to the crowd of nearly
5,000, which from the start of the match was rooting for the
19-year-old Mauresmo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Williams was able to block it out. ``It didn't bother me,''
she said. ``I was just trying to think about what I had to do to
win.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sixth-seeded Mauresmo had become the French favorite after
making it to the final of the Australian Open last month against
Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis won that final, but lost to Mauresmo in the quarterfinals
here on Friday in a bitter rematch. Both players tried to play down
the controversy from the Australian Open, where Hingis called
Mauresmo ``half a man'' after Mauresmo publicly acknowledged her
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's match there was no bitterness, just hard _ and
harder _ tennis. More than a few times a winner drilled deep into
the corner brought gasps from the crowd, but they were not for
Mauresmo's feared backhand. Instead, it was Williams' two-handed
backhand that drew an audible response.
</P>
<P>
   After playing against her older and bigger sister nearly all her
life, Williams was not awed by the 18th-ranked Mauresmo, who is 4
inches shorter and 27 pounds lighter than the 6-foot-1-inch,
169-pound Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really didn't hit that hard to me,'' Serena Williams, who
was not seeded, said of Mauresmo. ``Maybe because I am so used to
power. She hit a nice ball, a deep ball with a lot of spin. But I
really didn't feel too much power out there. Maybe because I was
feeling so strong.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a week, Mauresmo was built up by the French public
and news media alike. She had not played since the Australian Open,
and had vacationed in New Caledonia. She might have come back
refreshed, but five matches in five days wore on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was a bit nervous, playing here at home,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of times Williams sent Mauresmo stretching, and in the
third set Mauresmo stopped trying for some returns.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won the first set by taking the final four games, but
Mauresmo won the second set and battled back from 1-4 in the third
to force the tie breaker. Still, it was Williams who dominated at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like being down, 5-6,'' Williams said. ``I really
felt better when I was ahead. I just wanted to stay ahead, and I
decided if I want to win, if I wanted to be the best, I had better
be able to close out the match.''
</P>
<P>
   She did, going ahead by 2-0 in the tie breaker with her 12th ace
of the match. Although Mauresmo came back to even the tie breaker
at 3-3, an approach and forehand volley gave Williams the lead for
good. Leading by 5-3, Williams hit another ace to set up several
match points.
</P>
<P>
   The final point came on a Williams return that clipped the net
and went over, throwing Mauresmo out of position. Mauresmo's shot
went wide and Williams had the victory, which she celebrated by
throwing her racket after a moment of disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams has said that he expects Serena to become a
better player than her older and, so far, more accomplished sister;
on Sunday, she made the gap narrower.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a start for me,'' Serena said. ``It's always good to
get a smaller tournament under your belt so that by the time you
get to the Slams, you have a lot of experience.''

DESERT HERO CRASHES PARTY IN SAN RAFAEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Prime Timber and Honest Lady got together
Sunday at Santa Anita in the San Rafael Stakes, billed as the
season's first meeting of male and female Kentucky Derby
contenders. Then another man came between them.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Desert Hero went around them, after threatening to
climb over them. Blocked near the rail in midstretch, the colt and
jockey Corey Nakatani had to veer toward the grandstand to find a
clear path in the final yards of the 1-mile race for 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   And when 10-1 shot Desert Hero sprinted to the wire a neck in
front of a rusty Prime Timber, with tired Honest Lady less than a
length farther back in fifth, the Derby campaign had a strong new
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if he finished within three lengths of the winner,
he'd have a chance of being a Derby horse, because he's bred to go
(1\ miles),'' said Wally Dollase, who trains the son of 1993 Derby
winner Sea Hero for Saudi Arabian Prince Ahmed bin Salman.
``Obviously, if he'd gotten through (the traffic), he'd have won by
three or four lengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Desert Hero paid $22.80. He was clocked in 1:36.45, not fast for
the San Rafael, a prep for the April 3 Santa Anita Derby, the
western steppingstone to the May 1 Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   But if the victory wasn't brilliant on paper, the ability of the
smallish bay colt with the blond tail to escape trouble in the
stretch was dazzling to the eye. Especially since this was only his
second start, following a two-length maiden win at 6{ furlongs on
Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber and Gary Stevens rushed from seventh to contention
on the outside on the far turn. The colt led in the final strides,
and might have felt the effects of a 2{-month layoff since a
second-place finish in the Hollywood Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   Honest Lady and Kent Desormeaux led at the top of the stretch as
the daughter of Seattle Slew bid for her third straight win, but
she soon flattened out, backing up into Desert Hero. ``I might have
rushed her a bit into the first turn,'' Desormeaux conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Capsized finished third, Love That Red fourth in the nine-horse
race.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Silver Charm was assigned a race-high 124 pounds, Free
House 123, Puerto Madero 122 for Saturday's Santa Anita Handicap.
Puerto Madero carried 120, Silver Charm 126 when they finished
first and third in the Jan. 30 Donn Handicap in Florida. Other Big
'Cap weights: Event of the Year 119, Malek 118, Dr Fong 117, Sidon
114. . . . Jose Santos received the George Woolf Award in a
between-races ceremony. . . . After two carryovers, the pick-six
paid $408,670. . . . Banshee Breeze, the Eclipse Award winner as
last year's top 3-year-old filly, won the $200,000 Rampart Handicap
by 5{ lengths at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Fla.

A PREACHER'S FAITHFUL BACK BOTH SINNER AND FELON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The minister who had preached to Hillary
Clinton, who had been courted by politicians and corporate leaders
eager to tap his influence in black communities nationwide, now
awaits his sentencing for convictions on racketeering and grand
theft charges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as a bailiff pressed the Rev. Henry J. Lyons'
ink-stained fingertips on a white card, supporters inside and
outside the Florida courthouse prayed, cried, sang and swore
support for the man they saw as a persecuted prophet.
</P>
<P>
   It did not seem to matter that prosecutors had built a mountain
of evidence against him, proving that Lyons, president of the
National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., had even stolen money,
about $250,000, donated to rebuild burned black churches.
</P>
<P>
   It did not seem to matter that prosecutors had proved, with a
paper trail of his own signatures, that he had sold out the good
name of what is perhaps the largest black religious organization in
the United States, that he had made $4 million from peddling that
influence and then used that money to live in a style that included
luxury cars, waterfront property and expensive jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Even as prosecutors presented their most incriminating evidence,
his home church here seemed united behind him, the convention did
not formally call for his resignation, and religious leaders, from
as close as Tampa Bay and as far as Gary, Ind., filled the
courthouse pews in support.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did what God called him to do,'' said the Rev. Manuel
Sykes, 42, a St. Petersburg pastor and a friend and close supporter
of Lyons'. To Sykes and many others, Lyons, 57, is not a criminal
but a strong leader, a stirring preacher and a good businessman who
should not be ashamed of living well.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong support, Lyons' actions have not been without
consequence. Religious experts say his conviction will damage the
credibility of the convention, and calls for his resignation as
president are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   For Lyons, who was convicted on Saturday on one count of
racketeering and two of grand theft, the verdicts may finally take
from him the power that mere accusations and indictments could not.
</P>
<P>
   As a community leader, he calmed rioters in St. Petersburg after
a black man was shot to death by the police. As the leader of a
black religious organization that claims a membership of 8.5
million (prosecutors called this figure grossly inflated), he had
President Clinton's ear, was courted by members of Congress and was
paid huge sums by corporations for entree into black communities so
that they could sell burial plots and life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   He had affairs, which were forgiven. He lived lavishly, which
was accepted. He was ultimately accused of crimes, which were
mostly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a good preacher will hide a multitude of sins,'' said
Robert Franklin, president of the Inter-Denominational Theological
Center in Atlanta, the largest black seminary in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are showing mercy,'' Franklin said, ``without a sense
of accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons faces a prison sentence of eight and a half years, and
this spring he will stand trial on federal charges of money
laundering, tax evasion, extortion, bank and mail fraud, conspiracy
and other crimes. An aide who was his co-defendant in the state's
trial, Bernice Edwards, was acquitted of the only charge against
her, racketeering, but she faces similar federal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Lyons remained steadfast throughout the trial. And
when it was all over and the verdict was in, they prayed again for
God to set things right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're wanting your answer, Lord,'' said the pastor's wife,
Deborah Lyons, who inadvertently set in motion the investigation
into Lyons' business dealings when she set fire to a $700,000
waterfront home after finding that her husband had bought it with
Ms. Edwards. She is on probation for setting the fire but now says
she never really believed her husband was cheating on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your servant,'' Mrs. Lyons prayed outside the
courtroom after the verdict. ``Bless him, Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been detractors, and the conviction of Lyons will,
religious experts say, further erode his support both in the
convention and in his own Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church. One
high-ranking member of the convention, as well as some other
religious leaders, is already calling for him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   But his having hung on for so long _ in 1997 he survived a fight
on the convention floor to oust him as president and wound up with
a vote of confidence _ is proof of the power the man had not only
in his own church and community but in the 100-year-old convention.
</P>
<P>
   The length of his fight and the outcome, religious experts said,
will hurt the credibility of the convention, which has given its
presidents such autonomy that they have been able to run the
denomination's business _ including millions of dollars in
membership money _ from a briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   But it may also lead to changes, to checks and balances,
religious leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The real losers, in the legacy of Henry J. Lyons, are the people
who put their faith in him, said experts on black churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``These well-intentioned people are attempting to bring closure
to a very painful episode in their lives by circling the wagons and
presenting a strong defense to the outside world,'' Franklin said.
``It's important to know these people had shared good times
together and trusted their leader as a visionary and as an
effective builder. This is a gesture of remembering the good
days.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they tried to live in that past, Franklin said, they
ignored their responsibilities to their faith.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The parishioners who should have held Lyons accountable have
failed,'' Franklin said. ``It's very difficult for me to understand
this, because it really is an abdication of their adult moral
responsibilities. I'm disappointed that people were not able to
separate two very important issues: the state of Lyons' soul, and
his capacity to lead the congregation and the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian mercy should extend to the first case,'' he said,
``not the second.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michael Long, also a minister in St. Petersburg and a
loyal follower of Lyons, said that critics of the minister acted
from ``jealousy,'' and that preachers were not expected to live in
poverty as proof of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters wanting to speak with members of Lyons' congregation
have been chased from the church, and on Sunday morning church
members kept watch in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   But around the country, a push for Lyons' resignation as
president of the convention seems to be growing among black
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no tolerance for a convicted felon to continue as a
spiritual leader of the churches,'' said the Rev. Franklyn
Richardson of Mount Vernon, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church
in Harlem, in New York City, is also calling for Lyons to step
down, saying his actions have rendered the convention ineffective
and damaged its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even black Christians with no connection to the scandal were sad
and angry about how Lyons' actions reflected on black churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't claim to be a religious leader'' and betray the
congregation, said Johnnie Whittaker, 30, a Miami bondsman. Black
people, he said, ``need to hold their head up high.''

<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; USC has not won at Arizona since 1985, but the Trojans
will probably need an upset at McKale Center on Thursday for any
chance of making the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road is tough, but we've been in some road games,'' USC
coach Henry Bibby said. ``I'm happy going into the Arizona and
Arizona State games. Both of those teams are beatable. But we can't
have any lulls in our game there. We have to play consistent on
both ends of the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The daunting scenario for the Trojans (14-11, 6-10) is that even
if they somehow buck the odds and defeat the seventh-ranked
Wildcats, they probably also have to beat Arizona State in Tempe on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't beat Arizona and then not beat Arizona State,'' USC
center Brian Scalabrine said. ``That won't really help us.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Improved defense: USC's defense continues to improve. The
Trojans have held opposing teams to 43 percent shooting or less in
the past seven games and given up 68 points or less in six of
those.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we understand now that Bibby has a lot of concepts,''
Scalabrine said. ``Now guys are starting to understand where and
when to play defense, when to play man-to-man and when to play
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Better intensity: USC is now 4-3 in the second half of Pac-10
play, not exactly impressive but far better than the Trojans' 2-7
record in the first round of conference games. What's the
difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more experienced and focused on what we have to do,''
freshman forward Sam Clancy said. ``In the beginning, I feel we
were going through the motions.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Subtle stat: USC sophomore center Greg Lakey has quietly put
together an impressive streak. Lakey has made 17 straight free
throws and is shooting 87 percent for the season, well above last
season's average of 53 percent.

DRAFT IS A SNAP FOR DYNAMIC TRIO OF QUARTERBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three college quarterbacks have created a gulf
between themselves and the rest at their position. This trio stands
alone in the type of smart spirals they toss, whether their passes
are on short or long routes, on in or out patterns, on the deep
post or on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   With a flick of the wrist, even off-balance and on their back
foot, they can zing a pass more than 50 yards downfield. Their
footwork is light and their releases are sharp. They are mobile,
accurate passers who do not scramble seeking to run but run looking
to throw. They look like leaders. Winners.
</P>
<P>
   A dynamic trio: Tim Couch of Kentucky, Donovan McNabb of
Syracuse and Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida. One, two, three.
They could go that way in the NFL draft on April 17.
</P>
<P>
   That is the current buzz among draftniks, that for the first
time since the 1971 NFL draft, quarterbacks could command the top
three spots. In 1971 it was Jim Plunkett to the New England
Patriots, Dan Pastorini to the Houston Oilers and Archie Manning to
the New Orleans Saints. One, two, three.
</P>
<P>
   This time it could be Couch to Cleveland, McNabb to Philadelphia
and Culpepper to Cincinnati. One, two, three.
</P>
<P>
   The talent after this superb trio wanes, but there might,
indeed, be a few more gems. Akili Smith from Oregon, Cade McNown
from UCLA, Ted White from Howard, Shaun King from Tulane, Brock
Huard from Washington, Michael Bishop from Kansas State and Brian
Kuklick from Wake Forest hope to surprise.
</P>
<P>
   At least two from this group of seven realistically hope to
crack the first round. Remember, in the storied quarterback class
of 1983, which featured six first-rounders, Dan Marino was the
sixth quarterback chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, quarterbacks landed in the top spots: Peyton
Manning to Indianapolis and Ryan Leaf to San Diego. One, two in the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   This season, three could be the charm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Couch appears a lock in Cleveland. He is 6 feet 5 inches, 225
pounds. He has the entire package _ size, arm, release _ and most
important to Cleveland, Couch took an undermanned Kentucky team and
lifted it to long lost heights. Here is a talented player who,
under pressure, delivered. Scouts love that.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb and Culpepper are close, almost flip-flop players at No.
2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate to be the person and the team making the second
decision,'' one NFL general manager said. ``With McNabb and
Culpepper, one of these guys is probably going to be very good and
the other is going to be great. Which one is which?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe McNabb is the great one.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking can go that Culpepper has played in a pro offense
at Central Florida and has already shown plenty of his potential.
He is a daunting 6 feet 4 inches, 250 pounds. Huge yet mobile with
wondrous feet and arm.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, however, played in a system at Syracuse that did not
always feature pure pro-style passing and, thus, his upscale is
seen as greater. Just how far can he go? He has it all _ big arm,
accurate passing, mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Culpepper is the great one.
</P>
<P>
   Some scouts believe Culpepper is the favorite over McNabb
because his experience at quarterback has been more prolike.
McNabb, they say, may never catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Couch and Culpepper did not perform in passing and running
workouts at the NFL scouting combine held recently in Indianapolis.
But McNabb did.
</P>
<P>
   He was easily the star quarterback. He left many observers
agape, similar to the way he did in his Senior Bowl performance.
McNabb is 6 feet 2 inches, 225 pounds. He is not quite as big as
Couch and Culpepper, but he is faster. McNabb earned respect for
his willingness to participate fully at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   All three will hold private workouts for NFL teams beginning
next week. Among the best of the rest are Smith, who has a
cannonlike arm, and McNown, whom scouts call magical because
although he is only 6 feet he plays and produces in a much bigger
way.
</P>
<P>
   This draft, however, starts with Couch. And McNabb and Culpepper
could quickly follow. Three for the money. Three for the show.

AUDETTE INJURED IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DALLAS _ Compounding the Kings' 1-0 loss Sunday afternoon was a
painful sight they've seen far too often this season: a key player
writhing on the ice in agony.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings are hoping right wing Donald Audette's bruised
left foot _ courtesy of a last-minute slash by Dallas Stars
defenseman Richard Matvichuk _ will not cause him to miss any
games. Audette had to be helped to the dressing room and after the
game his foot was heavily wrapped in ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He slashed me once,'' said Audette, who underwent X-rays that
were negative. ``I slashed him back and that's when he two-handed
me. He's just a (expletive) loser. I'll get him back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just treat the symptoms and see how he is,'' trainer
Peter Demers said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Much ado about Fleury: Did the balance of power shift from
Dallas to Colorado on Sunday when the Avalanche acquired star right
wing Theo Fleury from Calgary?
</P>
<P>
   Stars general manager Bob Gainey didn't sound too worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't really involved in the Fleury conversations in any
depth,'' he said. ``It may not be very popular, but it's quite
possible this is our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said, ``I'm sure everybody will be
focused in on Colorado now. It will be a good challenge for
everybody, including us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are expected to make a pitch for Fleury when he
becomes an unrestricted free agent on July 1, assuming he hasn't
already signed with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stars dominance: How long has it been since the Kings beat
the Stars? Barry Melrose was the Kings' coach the last time it
happened, back in the 1995 lockout season. Since then, including
Sunday's loss, the Kings are 0-10-6 against Dallas.

THE DANGEROUS NETS HAVE FIZZLED INTO DUDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Just three weeks ago, the New Jersey
Nets were being touted as one of the best teams in the National
Basketball Association. Fueled by young talent and an uptempo
offense, they were hailed as a potential conference champion, the
new hoop darlings of the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   But disaster has struck in the form of a 2-10 record, rendering
the Nets the league's most disappointing team by far and leading
people throughout the organization to wonder what has gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries, particularly a sprained right ankle that has kept
point guard Sam Cassell out for most of the season, have certainly
been a factor. But as they prepare for Monday night's rematch with
the Boston Celtics at the Fleet Center, there seems to be more to
it than that. After all, Miami, Cleveland and the New York Knicks,
all of whom beat the Nets without key starters, have stayed afloat
despite injuries.
</P>
<P>
   While Coach John Calipari and his players talk about it being
early, the Nets might be out of the playoff picture already. In
this shortened 50-game season, their 2-10 record is comparable with
a 3-16 start in the standard 82-game season.
</P>
<P>
   Besides injuries, four factors seem to be at the heart of the
Nets' exercise in underachievement: Calipari's sudden inability to
get the best out of his players; the Nets' lack of a sophisticated
halfcourt offense; the loss of Sherman Douglas to free agency, and
expectations that were too high.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Calipari can have staying power in the NBA has been an
issue since he joined the Nets in 1996. His constant barking on the
sideline and collegiate motivational tactics have grated on his
professional players, and that might be a problem this season.
Chris Gatling has asked to be traded, and Scott Burrell was visibly
upset by Calipari's decision to send him to the scorer's table last
Tuesday against the Knicks. Calipari did that to motivate another
player on the floor, not to send Burrell into the game as a
substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible sign that Calipari might not be getting through
to his players is the significant statistical decline of everyone
on the team except for Keith Van Horn. Four of the Nets' top nine
players are shooting below 40 percent from the floor, and the team
is ranked 28th in the league in scoring (84.7) and field-goal
percentage (.389). Even Calipari admitted that the drop in player
production implicates him, though he insisted that he has not lost
his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at how do I get guys to play better, which has
never been an issue for me in my coaching career,'' Calipari said.
``Guys have had career years every year they've played for me.
Individual players are not playing up to their level, and that's
bothered me. But there has been no breakdown of the players. That's
a cop-out. It all comes down to we need to win a couple of games.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing players love about Calipari is his affinity for
fast-break basketball. The speedy, shoot-it-when-you're-open game
plan is every player's dream, but because the Nets have been unable
to run with consistency, the offensive package has become
nightmarish.
</P>
<P>
   Because they have been outrebounded in nine games, the Nets have
been forced to play slower, which has exposed Calipari's minimalist
approach to the halfcourt game. He relies heavily on isolations,
which at times makes his club look like five strangers playing in a
schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're terrible at the halfcourt game,'' Jayson Williams said.
``We've got to run and gun. We're undermanned and undersized.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending his offense, Calipari noted that it worked last
year. But that is because the unorthodox Cassell thrives in an
offense that is based on improvisation. That is not the case with
Cassell's backup, Eric Murdock, or for Kittles and Kendall Gill,
who have also played point guard this year. Not one is as creative
as Cassell as a playmaker, which results in the need for a more
disciplined halfcourt attack. But Calipari has refused to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense is very simplistic,'' said Murdock, who played for
Coach Pat Riley in Miami last season. ``We don't run a lot of sets.
There is a lot of freedom out there, and at times it does look
scrambled. Sometimes it's easy to guard because a lot of times the
spacing and the timing of the plays are not the best.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantages have been glaring in the clutch, as the Nets
have surrendered fourth-quarter leads in five of their last six
losses. Calipari said that his late-game strategy is to isolate his
best players _ Van Horn, Kittles or Cassell _ in one-on-one
situations, and let them create. But that system has become
terribly predictable, especially with Cassell on the sideline and
Kittles struggling offensively. Down the stretch, it is a safe bet
that the Nets will go to Van Horn on the wing and ask him to juke
or blow by his man for a basket.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to run, the Nets' small lineup has become a drawback, and
after Saturday's loss to Boston, Calipari spoke of the possibility
of playing Jim McIlvaine, Williams and Van Horn on the frontline.
He has been apprehensive about using McIlvaine and Williams
together because neither player is an offensive threat, and Van
Horn would have a more difficult time taking small forwards off the
dribble. But at this point, what is there to lose?
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing lineups is an alternative,'' Calipari said. ``I just
don't know if we're at that panic button yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' management, coaches and players have said that the
absence of Douglas, last season's backup point guard, has been
especially glaring. Douglas, who signed with the Los Angeles
Clippers as a free agent, helped the Nets win numerous games and
offered a more traditional alternative to the erratic Cassell.
Douglas, a pure point guard, gave the team direction in the
halfcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't call him `the General' for nothing,'' Gill said of
Douglas. ``It's nothing against Eric Murdock, but everybody liked
playing with Sherm. When he came in the game, everybody got lifted.
I can't tell you how much he meant to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, who averaged 16.8 points and nine assists in 11 starts,
also pushed Cassell to play harder, better and sometimes while
injured. Privately, people within the organization have questioned
whether Cassell, out of fear of losing his starting job, would have
returned by now from his ankle injury if Douglas were still on the
team, and if, out of a desire to renegotiate the final three years
of his five-year, $15 million contract, he was now extending his
recuperation time to prove his value to the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their opinion,'' said Cassell, who has a torn ligament
in his ankle. ``I love this game and I want to play. I wouldn't
quit on my teammates like that. That's not in my character.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets tried to retain Douglas, offering him a three-year,
$5.8 million contract that was turned down by his agent, Eric
Fleisher. A day later, Fleisher called back to accept the offer,
but Calipari, wanting to fill out his roster as soon as possible,
had already pressed the club into signing Murdock.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, all the preseason praise the Nets received raised the
stakes tremendously, making their slow start seem all the more
calamitous. If the expectations had been more realistic, Calipari
and his players might not look like such failures. The Nets
believed the hype. Williams predicted a ridiculous 35 victories _ a
figure that would compare with 57 in an 82-game season _ and most
of his teammates overlooked the Knicks as obstacles to an Eastern
Conference championship. Perhaps their grand impression of
themselves led them to lose the edge they had as a team playing for
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only made the playoffs by one game last year,'' Gill said.
``We're a good team, but people were thinking we were going to win
the NBA championship this year. Just because we played the Chicago
Bulls tough in the first round of the playoffs, everybody thought
we had arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, everybody thought wrong.

SPORTS COLUMN: MAGGERT CHIPS IN FOR THE RANKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ It won't endure in golf history like Gene
Sarazen's double-eagle at the 1935 Masters or Tom Watson's chip-in
at the 1982 U.S. Open, but Jeff Maggert's winning chip-in on the
38th hole Sunday at least made the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship memorable for more than its $1 million jackpot. Even
Andrew Magee thought so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ending was pretty classic,'' said Magee, the $500,000
runner-up. ``I even enjoyed it a little bit, being the weirdo I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the return to the PGA Tour of an important
match-play tournament in the first of this year's three World Golf
Championships had been more monotonous than marvelous. The big
names kept falling off the marquee until Maggert engraved his name
on it forever with a 20-foot chip with a sand wedge from the rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited five-and-a-half years for that,'' Maggert said,
alluding to his one and only previous victory on the PGA Tour at
the 1993 Walt Disney World/Oldsmobile Classic. ``I needed a win for
me, myself and I.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the world golf ranking that created the pairings here
for the world's top 64 players. But format mostly upstaged form.
The lesser-ranked golfer won 37 of the 63 matches, nearly 60
percent. Magee, far down at No. 50, had defeated Darren Clarke (No.
15), Thomas Bjorn (No. 47), Bill Glasson (No. 34), Shigeki Maruyama
(No. 42) and John Huston (No. 27) to get to the final.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert (No. 24) had eliminated Tiger Woods (No. 1) in the
quarterfinals and Nick Price (No. 9) in the second round. Glasson
had stunned David Duval (No. 2) in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my 24 ranking was a pretty fair spot,'' Maggert
said. ``Some guys probably thought I was ranked too high, but I've
played some pretty good golf through the years.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the lesser-ranked golfers at La Costa Resort and
Spa proved the popular theory: over 18 holes of match play on any
given day there isn't that much difference between any of the
world's top 64 ranked golfers _ unlike the top 64 tennis players or
the top 64 college basketball teams in the national tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But the upside-down results also put the world golf ranking
under the microscope as never before.
</P>
<P>
   With nine victories in his last 32 tournaments, Duval would seem
to have earned being No. 1, but he's still No. 2 because the
ranking involves a complex point system. It's based on where the
world's golfers finish in a tournament on the five major tours and
that particular tournament's strength of field over a two-year
period. Duval is also concerned with the system, but not selfishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, some good may come out of the controversy because
they may come up with a better system,'' he said early in the week.
``It's more important who's No. 64 or No. 65 than it is who's No. 1
or No. 2. You don't want to leave out players who are deserving.''
</P>
<P>
   For the deserving, it's now more important. The world's top 50
ranked golfers are exempt in the Masters and the British Open, the
top 20 in the U.S. Open, the top 50 in the World Golf
Championships' American Express Championship at Valderrama, Spain,
Nov. 4-7, and the top 64 here again in the Andersen Consulting
Match Play next Feb. 23-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a performance-based criteria, not a point system
that nobody understands,'' said Paul Azinger, who ousted Ernie Els
in the first round before losing to Loren Roberts. ``I think the
guys ought to have a 4-footer or 5-footer to choke off to either
get in or just miss this tournament, and it's not that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McCormack, who founded the International Management Group,
created the ranking more than a decade ago. One of his IMG
employees, Tony Greer, issues the ranking weekly. McCormack remains
the chairman of the ranking board, which includes leaders from the
American, European, Japanese, southern African and Australasian
tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have eight or nine tweaks,'' said Tim Finchem, the PGA Tour
commissioner, ``that we are intensely scrutinizing.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Golf Digest magazine asked Dean Knuth, once a
U.S. Golf Association official and a career mathematician, to
suggest changes in the world ranking that appear in the April
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Among Knuth's solutions: decreasing the importance, month by
month, of past events except for the four majors; increasing the
majors' point value; smoothing out the strength of field over the
last five years; eliminating the worst 10 percent of a player's
finishes; using a more equitable difference in points; cutting in
half the points in Japan and Australasia as well as in off-season
special events; and strengthening the points for European events to
aid European pros.
</P>
<P>
   Using Knuth's formula, Mark O'Meara would have supplanted Woods
as No. 1 late last year, and Duval now would be No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The prime example of Knuth's formula is Jumbo Ozaki, the
Japanese pro who has not finished in the top 20 in any major since
the 1989 U.S. Open. Instead of being No. 13 as Ozaki is in the
ranking, he would be No. 43.
</P>
<P>
   But in this match-play event that Jeff Maggert won with a
classic chip-in, more often than not the ranking did not translate
to victories.

 &HT;    Alou, Expos: Back to the future
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Felipe Alou had at least 97 reasons to do it.
Any sane man would have had the motivation to leave the game's most
troubled franchise last winter when Los Angeles called with an
offer to manage the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Alou's Montreal Expos lost 97 times a year ago, the franchise's
worst season in 22 years, and scored the fewest runs in the
National League (644) while leading the majors in errors (155).
</P>
<P>
   The path out the door in Montreal this decade has been worn,
with Pedro Martinez, Larry Walker, John Wetteland and Moises Alou
leading an annual parade of talent out of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A sensible man, Felipe Alou should have gone, too. Yet he found
himself standing before his seventh Expos team this week, welcoming
it to another spring camp. He has found two reasons to offset the
other 97: a new three-year contract and a sense of history, taking
him back to 1993 when the Expos' farm system delivered him a
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent is there,'' Alou said. ``They're not as mature as
'93, but you can see the movement upward. If you could give a club
like this an every-day left fielder, a set-up guy and another
starter _ you see I mention three players only. That's it. That's
all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos expect to recover from their 1998 bruising with the
long-term notion that they can contend seriously in 2000. The
payroll will be a paltry $20million this year, but that is
nearlydouble from a season ago. General manager Jim Beattie, vice
president Bill Stoneman and super scout Fred Ferreira all signed
long-term deals last winter, solidifying the front office. And to
stanch the talent runoff, outfielder Rondell White, catcher Chris
Widger and closer Ugueth Urbina all agreed to multi-year contracts.
</P>
<P>
   All of that, however, would not have been enough to keep Alou if
not for a final factor. Vladimir Guerrero, his 23-year-old right
fielder, is the sort of player to construct a team around, and the
Expos tied him to a five-year $27 million contract for that exact
reason. In just his second full season, Guerrero hit .324 last year
with 38 homers and 109 RBIs and displayed what many baseball people
think is the best arm in the majors. If this franchise has hope,
Guerrero will lug it to the plate every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is he can do whatever he wants to
do,'' Beattie said. ``The guy has a chance to win any (hitting)
title he really sets his mind to.''
</P>
<P>
   While Andruw Jones is still plumbing his potential in Atlanta,
Alou already has compared Guerrero to a young Roberto Clemente.
Houston outfielder Moises Alou, Felipe's son, went a bit further
this month by suggesting that Guerrero could be the best Latin-born
player of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm human,'' Guerrero said through interpreter/infielder Jose
Vidro. ``God is the one in charge of me. If (Moises) said those
words, I'm very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero and Jones will spend their careers in eternal
comparison. While Jones established a defensive standard in 1998
with his first Gold Glove season, Guerrero's superior power numbers
_ .546 career slugging percentage compared with Jones' .472 _
signaled his arrival as a polished slugger. Furthermore, Guerrero
only has to be told things once.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both talented kids,'' Beattie said. ``I know Andruw
has had a few run-ins with discipline. We don't have any of those
here. Actually, you have to tone Vladimir down a little bit. His
enthusiasm has him playing out of control sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero leveled his eyes when questioned about how he will
improve in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to work the same as I did last year,'' he said.
``You've got to wait and see.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 UCSF IS ON A MISSION  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Today, Mission Bay is 303 acres of rusting rail yards and dusty
warehouses on San Francisco's southeast flank.
</P>
<P>
   But city business, political and academic leaders are betting
that early next century, Mission Bay will be a world center for
biomedical research _ and the magnet that attracts some 20,000
academic, biotech and drug industry jobs to one of San Francisco's
underdeveloped corners.
</P>
<P>
   The next, most important chapter in the Mission Bay saga will
occur March 18, when the University of California Board of Regents
is expected to approve funding for a $222 million molecular
research complex, the first of 20 buildings that eventually will
house 9,000 scientists, graduate students and staff at what will be
called the University of California at San Francisco's Mission Bay
Campus.
</P>
<P>
   UCSF's research campus will be surrounded by a commercial ring
of land zoned for 5 million square feet of research, office and
manufacturing space. It will be rented out to commercial tenants by
Mission Bay's owner, the Catellus Development Corp. The proximity
between university and commercial tenants is modeled after Stanford
University and its adjoining Stanford Industrial Park, which formed
the nucleus of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we briefed (Intel Corp. Chairman) Andy Grove on the
project, he said, `You're creating a Gene Valley,''' said J.
Michael Bishop, chancellor of UCSF, which will be Mission Bay's
intellectual anchor tenant.
</P>
<P>
   UCSF is the key ingredient in plans to make Mission Bay a
biotech mecca. During the past quarter century, researchers at the
current UCSF Parnassus Heights campus made many of the
breakthroughs that gave birth to the biotech industry _ starting
with the secret of how to cut and paste DNA to create blueprints
for novel organisms.
</P>
<P>
   But UCSF has long had a problem. Hemmed in by residential
neighbors and unable to expand, the university has made world-class
researchers work in labs so cramped that some of its brightest
minds got fed up and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question there's been some damage to the institution,''
said Cynthia Robbins-Roth, a maven among biotech analysts. ``If
junior faculty don't get lab space, they can't do enough research
to win tenure, and if they don't get tenure, where's the next crop
of medical researchers to come from?''
</P>
<P>
   Expansion in Mission Bay is supposed to address UCSF's growing
pains. As the first concrete step, the regents will be asked to
approve UCSF's proposal to build a 434,000 square foot molecular
research complex on the site. When completed in 2002, it will house
1,000 scientists, graduate students and technicians _ about 8
percent of UCSF's current overall research capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have the groundbreaking in October,'' said Bruce
Spaulding, the UCSF vice chancellor who spent more than 12 years
doing the bureaucratic spadework for the university's expansion.
</P>
<P>
   That groundbreaking would end UCSF's long, frustrating efforts
to expand, first at the Parnassus Heights campus and later in
Laurel Heights, only to be thwarted in both instances by
neighborhood opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Although the UCSF research campus _ which eventually will cover
43 acres, or 13 square city blocks _ represents a large chunk of
Mission Bay, it's just one ingredient of the overall development.
</P>
<P>
   Catellus, Mission Bay's owner, also has won city approval to
erect 6,000 residential units and a retail-entertainment complex in
the northern part of the 303-acre tract, adjacent to the
forthcoming Pac Bell baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission Bay is the largest development project in the history
of the city, and it may be the largest project of its kind in the
United States,'' said David Prowler, acting director of Mayor
Willie Brown's Office of Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the mix of uses, from research to commercial
to residential and open space, you can see we're planning one of
the grand new neighborhoods of the 21st century,'' said Catellus
CEO Nelson Rising.
</P>
<P>
   But city, business and university leaders agree that it is the
project's biotech core _ the UCSF research campus and the
surrounding commercial zone _ that provided the economic momentum
to make the vast project practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCSF was the catalyst that made everything else fall into
place,'' Prowler said.
</P>
<P>
   With the long-planned expansion approaching reality, UCSF
leaders now must manage the institutional shock of transplanting
some scientists to Mission Bay without causing envy or alienation
among the larger group of researchers who remain at the Parnassus
Heights campus.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Keith Yamamoto, one of UCSF's top research scientists
and chair of the academic committee managing the move, explained
the paradox. ``All of us recognize one of the great gleaming
strengths of this place is that we were all jammed together,''
Yamamoto said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, UCSF turned its problem _ researchers working cheek
to jowl _ into a strength, forging a spirit of collaboration among
UCSF scientists that went far beyond the scientific norm.
</P>
<P>
   Yamamoto said UCSF will take many steps to upgrade labs at the
Parnassus site, as well as to encourage cross-fertilization between
the old and new research groups.
</P>
<P>
   Final responsibility for expanding UCSF without killing its
scientific culture falls to Chancellor  &LR; Bishop, who is somewhat
inoculated against academic back-biting by his scientific stature.
The chancellor shared a 1989 Nobel Prize with his UCSF colleague
Harold Varmus for their work on how cancer develops.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Failure is not an option,'' Bishop says simply. ``We've
reached the point where we can't catch the latest waves in
biomedical research because we have no elbow room.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop also rejects any suggestion that the university risks
compromising its intellectual independence by placing its new
research campus inside a ring of for-profit biotech ventures that
will draw on UCSF brainpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be as open as we are now; there are no expectations on
us,'' he said, adding that state and federal research guidelines
encourage commercial spin-offs of scientific ideas. ``I think we're
obliged to take our discoveries into the real world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Far from shying away from cozy relations with the business
leaders who were so instrumental in bringing UCSF to Mission Bay,
Bishop says he's excited that the university's expansion, long seen
as a contentious issue, may finally be perceived as a larger good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity to provide the intellectual gravitas
for a project that contributes to the entire community,'' Bishop
said.
</P>
<P>
   UCSF will hold a community meeting to show off the proposed
design of its first Mission Bay campus building tonight at 7 p.m.
at the ILWU Hall at Second and King streets next to the ballpark
construction site in San Francisco.

 WELLS ANIMATES ATM ADS  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Animated advertisements are coming to an automated teller machine
near you.
</P>
<P>
   Starting today, 340 Wells Fargo ATMs in the Bay Area will
display three promotional messages during each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The first ad, for ski-lift tickets sold through the machine,
runs before a bank card is inserted. It shows a snowboarder and a
skier swooshing across the screen. The second, for online
bookseller Amazon.com., will be shown while the transaction is
being processed. The third, which will rotate among several Bay
Area nonprofits, will be displayed as the receipt and card are
being spit out.
</P>
<P>
   A final pitch will appear on the back of the ATM receipt in the
form of a coupon for a 10 percent discount at Amazon.com. The
coupons are redeemable only by people who open a Web bank account
with Wells.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco company, which is known as a marketing
innovator, is the only bank using animated ATM ads. It also is the
only financial institution that leases screen space to third-party
advertisers, industry watchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells has been a pioneer in ATM technology. In 1994, it began
selling postage stamps through its machines, and in 1996, it added
the ski-lift tickets being promoted in the new ads.
</P>
<P>
   It operates the largest online bank, with 700,000 customers, and
also has been an innovator as a retailer, sharing some of its
marbled lobbies with dry cleaners and Starbucks coffee shops.
</P>
<P>
   These initiatives have contributed to superior financial
performance, said Joe Morford, an analyst with First Security Van
Kasper.
</P>
<P>
   Wells has undertaken an extensive and pricey upgrade of its
machines to enable them to show the moving ads. Each ATM has been
outfitted with a Pentium processor and tied into a network so that
ads can be sent out from a central location.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional ATM technology, any change to onscreen messages
must be done at each machine, one by one. ``This is such a
breakthrough in ATM management and also provides terrific
opportunities for advertisers,'' said Barry McCarthy, a bank vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Wells says the ads won't slow transactions because they're shown
during existing delays.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy declined to disclose the cost of the upgrade or how
much Wells is charging advertisers. Amazon did not return a
telephone call. (The nonprofits &UR;  &LR; get their spot, which is not
animated, for free.)
</P>
<P>
   The ATM ads can be changed as often as daily, and different ads
can be sent to different machines depending on where the ATMs are
located, said McCarthy. For example, a minivan ad could shown at
ATMs in Pleasanton but not on Market Street in San Francisco, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy contends that customers will pay more attention to ATM
screens than to most other advertising media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research indicates that virtually 100 percent of customers
will have recognition of the ad on the screen,'' said McCarthy.
``Even if it's not every second, they are aware of what's happening
because they are waiting for cash, which is a motivator for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Miller, a principal with Miller/Huber Relationship
Marketing in San Francisco, was dubious about the 100 percent claim
but agreed that recognition is likely to be high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a limited medium that I think will be successful,''
Miller said. ``As consumers continue to get bombarded by
advertising messages everywhere, it's as viable a place as any.''
</P>
<P>
   ATMs have a couple of advantages as an ad medium. One is that,
with programs such as the Amazon coupon, it is easy for advertisers
to measure consumer response, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   And one day, Wells may be able to target ad messages to people
based on the demographic and financial information the bank
maintains in its customer databases, said Miller. Of course, the
bank would need to ask permission before sharing any data or else
risk the ire of its customers, he added.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said Wells has no plans to share customer information
or send personally targeted messages. The technology does not
currently exist, for one thing, and the bank also is sensitive to
customers' security concerns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet connectivity is another potential use of the machines
though that technology still is far down the road, McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Today marks the launch of the Amazon ads; the ski ads premiered
last week. If the program is successful, Wells hopes to expand it
beyond the Bay Area to more of its 6,100 ATMs nationwide. AT&AMP;T will
take Amazon's spot in the lineup in April.

TWO ALLIANCES AIM TO CREATE PC ALTERNATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two separate industry alliances to be announced Monday share a
similar target: creating alternatives to the personal computer _
and to Microsoft Corp.'s operating systems _ for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   In one announcement, IBM, Motorola, Sun Microsystems, Lucent and
10 other companies have agreed to create a new set of standards
based on Sun's Java programming language to interconnect a next
generation of smart devices ranging from computers and cell phones
to washing machines and dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate deal, the regional telephone company U S West and
Network Computer Inc., a spinoff from the database software giant
Oracle Systems, plan to announce a schedule for trials of a new
service to be named AT-TV which will integrate the telephone, the
television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the new service will compete with both Microsoft's
WebTV and the At-Home cable modem service. Although the timing of
At-TV's availability has not been announced, U S West executives
said that trials would begin later this year and that commercial
service would begin in the 14 states the company serves before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is the first U.S. success for NCI, which has made
progress in the interactive set-top box business in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``NCI has been trying for a long time to find a domestic deal,''
said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a research firm
based in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said that the U S West trials would be carefully
watched because the new service offered an interesting twist in the
long-held goal of merging the telephone and the television into a
single, interactive device.
</P>
<P>
   U S West executives said that the new system would employ Caller
ID technology to display the name of a caller on the television
screen and give the viewer the option of accepting the call on a
speaker-phone built in to the NCI set-top box. The set-top box
would also store an electronic phone book and would enable a
television viewer to make phone calls without picking up a
telephone handset.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to leave your couch, said Jeffrey Kagan, a
telecommunications industry analyst. ``This is the long-awaited
blending of different technologies, and it should be a natural fit
for Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   U S West executives said they would release pricing information
at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   The new Java alliance is a technology partnership to be called
the Open Service Gateway Specification. In addition to IBM, Sun,
Motorola and Lucent, participants include Alcatel, Cable &AMP;
Wireless, Enron Communications, Ericsson, Network Computer Inc.,
Nortel Networks, Oracle Corp., Philips Electronics, Sybase Corp.
and Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
   The standard is in part an effort to pull together the
proliferating consumer electronics networking standards, which
currently consist of an alphabet soup of code names and acronyms
like Bluetooth, CAL, CEBus, HAVi, HomePNA, HomePnP, HomeRF, Jini
and VESA.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives said standards like Open Service Gateway
Specification are needed because existing telephone and power
networks in the home are being transformed into data networks to
link increasingly intelligent appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see a shift of focus toward a broader range of
intelligent devices, some of which we won't think of as computers
at all,'' said Mark Bregman, general manager of IBM's pervasive
computing division.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted a generation of home appliances like a washing
machine that would come with an LCD panel and a Web browser. Such
appliances would in the future be able to communicate with the
Internet and with other gadgets in the home, possibly over the
home's electrical wiring.
</P>
<P>
   While no one expects consumers to surf the Web while they wash
their clothes, such systems would enable manufacturers to directly
diagnose and update appliances via the Internet, he said. However,
he also acknowledged that such powerful capabilities would also
raise new security challenges.

HOUSTON COMETS GUARD GOES HOME AFTER SUCCESSFUL SURGERY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRIAN McTAGGART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Kim Perrot walked gingerly into a room full of
reporters whom she greeted with a familiar smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see you guys made it back,'' she said. ``I know you weren't
expecting me to be back, but I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who has seen the Comets 5-5 point guard play
basketball would have been foolish to believe Perrot would let a
battle with brain and lung cancer keep her off her feet, much less
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, dressed in a black and yellow warm-up suit and a Comets
WNBA championship cap, left the University of Texas M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center on Sunday just four days after doctors removed a
golf-ball-sized tumor from her brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank God for getting me through this,'' Perrot
said. ``Secondly, I want to thank my family and people around the
world who supported me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, 32, announced Feb. 22 she was suffering from alveolar
adenocarcinoma, a cancer that starts in the lungs but spread to her
brain. Wednesday's craniotomy was to remove the largest tumor from
her brain, which was causing headaches, dizziness and other
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Raymond Sawaya, chairman of the department of neurosurgery,
said the tumor was close to the part of the brain that controls
functions on the right side of Perrot's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raised the bar to some extent, and the concern doing the
surgery was we might be affecting that,'' he said. ``It was a
delicate surgery because of the location of the tumor. But I was
very pleased with how it turned out. One of my greatest fears
because of who she is and her professional accomplishments is that
we wouldn't want her to lose any strength in her right hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ritsuko Komaki, a radiation oncologist who will oversee
Perrot's treatments, said Perrot's excellent health improves her
chances of beating the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not expect any problems going into radiation therapy,''
she said. ``I would like to take care of whatever is left over,
which are very small spots. I'm confident we can get rid of the
small spots in her brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the first, and perhaps most difficult step, is behind
her, Perrot's path to recovery will be long. She will begin 2 1/2
weeks of radiation treatments in about a week to remove several
smaller tumors on her brain. She will then undergo six months of
chemotherapy treatments to remove multiple lesions on her lungs,
which is where the cancer originated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first part of the journey was very successful,'' Perrot
said. ``I'm on my way to the second step, and it's going to be a
struggle. But I feel strong and ready to take on the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot appeared in good spirits as she left the Houston hospital
with several family members, including her mother. Perrot opened
and closed her right fist to show reporters she had lost no
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot will receive one radiation treatment a day, five days a
week for 2 1/2 weeks. Komaki said the treatments will be done on an
outpatient basis and will take ``only a couple of minutes'' and
will not make her sick. During this time, Perrot will take steroids
to reduce the swelling in her brain.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot said that although her recovery is the primary issue with
her, she wants to resume her basketball career at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've done all my life,'' she said. ``The fact
that all that can be taken away is kind of difficult. But I have
faith in God and the best doctors in the world and work for a great
organization. I know that I'm going to be back on the court one
day.''

</P>
<P>
   Get ready to get unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of companies are developing products that will give
mobility to the wired masses, allowing consumers to perform
everyday tasks such as surfing the Web and sending e-mail from
handheld devices with a wireless connection.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers soon will be able to trade a stock through a handheld
computer, access their company's intranet from a cell phone and
order a pizza from their personal display assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of wireless data has been around for years, but the
race to supply customers with anytime-anywhere Internet access
seems to have taken off in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as 3Com Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems
recently have announced products or partnerships focused on
wireless Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, 3Com's Palm Computing division will roll out
the Palm VII, a personal display assistant with a built-in wireless
connection for Web surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel Communications and Netscape &LR;   &LR; Communications Corp. have
teamed up to provide Web browsing via Nextel's cell phones. And
Netscape's rival, Microsoft, recently announced two new ventures to
provide wireless data to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco also is making its first foray into the wireless world,
announcing a $1 billion, five-year-deal with Motorola to provide
Internet access via cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers say the race to provide customers with
wireless Internet access is under way because of the popularity of
the Web and the abundance of cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 million people worldwide use cell phones, and that
number is expected to grow to 1 billion by 2005. On the corporate
front, the Gartner Group predicts that there will be 54 million
mobile workers in the United States by 2003. Most of them probably
will want access to the Internet, their e-mail and their company's
internal network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, what people become comfortable with in the wired
world, they start to demand in the wireless world as well,'' said
Albert Lin, an analyst with The Abernathy Group who follows
wireless companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, like Metricom, which makes a wireless modem
called Ricochet, spotted this trend early and already are offering
products for portable computers and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go into a business today, almost everybody has a cell
phone,'' said John Wernke, Metricom's vice president of marketing
and sales. ``It's become prolific. The same is going to be true for
wireless data.''
</P>
<P>
   Metricom has 27,000 subscribers in three cities, including San
Francisco, who get unlimited Internet access for $30 a month.
Wernke said Metricom plans to be in at least 50 cities by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Ricochet and other wireless products take off
remains to be seen. That's because the same mobility that gives
wireless access its appeal also has an unfortunate drawback: slow
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the products on the market and some of those being
planned have slow connection speeds. Industry watchers say that
could dampen the appeal of wireless products.
</P>
<P>
   Ricochet offers a speed of 20 kilobits per second, which is
slower than what most dial-up modems deliver. The company does plan
to increase the speed of its product in July, Wernke said.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential stumbling block for wireless data is the bulk
and difficulty of some of the planned products. Qualcomm's PDQ
phone, which marries a PalmPilot with a cell phone, is bigger and
heavier than both devices on their own. And those who have tested
it say it's complicated to master.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wireless devices have to be easy to use and have
demonstrated functionality,'' said Roberta Wiggins, wireless data
analyst with the Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins pointed to products like 3Com's Palm VII _ which will
allow users to surf the Web, track stocks and send e-mail from the
handheld organizer _ as potential successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palm has been popular as an organizer, and if the wireless
communications capability is integrated and easy to use, I think it
will be pretty natural evolution for the Palm users,'' Wiggins
said.
</P>
<P>
   A new crop of ``smart phones,'' or next-generation cell phones,
now being developed are expected to give consumers easy wireless
Internet access though they still are three to five years away.
</P>
<P>
   And for tasks such as simply sending e-mail, many of the
Internet cell phones being planned probably will suffice, Wiggins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are Nextel's cell phone with Web access and the
technology being developed by companies like Wireless Knowledge, a
joint venture between Microsoft and San Diego's Qualcomm Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless Knowledge's products eventually will allow people to
get their personal and corporate e-mail from various devices,
including cell phones and two-way pagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No.1 thing people want to take mobile is their e-mail,''
said Tom Clarkson, vice president of marketing for Wireless
Knowledge. ``Our technology will enable them to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But some are more excited about the wackier, more far-out things
that wireless Internet access can provide.
</P>
<P>
   Using a cell phone, consumers eventually could download money
from the Internet onto a smart card. Other people could have their
hearts wirelessly monitored by doctors to prevent cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Jetsons-like applications,'' said Don
Listwin, executive vice president at Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cole, who tracks the wireless industry for Renaissance
Worldwide, said he expects the next generation of cell phones to
drive the wireless data market.
</P>
<P>
   ``These phones will have broad business and consumer appeal
because they marry powerful voice, video and data applications,''
Cole said. ``That's the holy grail of wireless, and as people see
the costs of equipment and devices drop significantly, the wireless
data market is going to take off.''

 NET FILES _ SF CHRON   PointCast Seeks Net Redemption 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
In the land where stock quadruples in a day, creating instant
billionaires, is there room for an Internet phoenix?
</P>
<P>
   The powers that be at PointCast hope so. The onetime hot-shot
firm is undergoing a radical reincarnation to reverse its fortunes,
according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunnyvale company exploded on the scene in 1996 with free
software that delivered news and information from the Internet
directly to computer users.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  But many consumers and corporations complained that their Net
connections were too slow to handle the onslaught of data, and
PointCast lost subscribers. Its membership dipped to 1.3 million
this year, from 1.5 million, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  But in a few weeks, the ``push'' pioneer is expected to announce
that it is teaming up with several Baby Bells (Pacific Bell and
BellSouth are the most commonly rumored partners) to deliver news
to consumers over high-speed Internet connections, sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Isn't that the same business that PointCast
flopped at? PointCast hopes that this will be a whole new ballgame.
By going into business with the telcos, the reasoning goes,
PointCast will sidestep the slow connectivity problems that
bedeviled its own service.
</P>
<P>
   The telcos, which so far haven't capitalized on the Internet,
want to fuel the Web's next growth spurt by providing faster
connections.
</P>
<P>
   But the phone companies will face fierce competition from
players like AtHome, which uses cable TV lines to provide Internet
access up to 100 times faster than traditional dial-up connections.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AOL and other Internet service providers also want to
get into the ``broadband'' game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who have Internet access at home want faster
service. This is where most of the industry's growth will come over
the next few years,'' AOL chief executive Steve Case said in an
interview this month.
</P>
<P>
   And PointCast hopes to cash in on that growth. Its potential
match with the Baby Bells seems a natural: PointCast CEO David
Dorman is a former executive at Pacific Bell, SBC Communications
and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   He and other PointCast officials declined  &LR;   &LR; to comment on the
company's imminent plans.
</P>
<P>
   If the new scheme catches on, PointCast will make another stab
at an initial public offering, probably this year. It ditched an
IPO last year after apparently failing to spark investor interest.
</P>
<P>
   But is that soon enough? The company is in danger of becoming a
footnote in Internet history, the most egregious example of online
hype deflated by market realities.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, it was so confident _ some claim delusional _
about its long-term financial prospects, it spurned a $400 million
takeover offer from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   PointCast can only hope that it can rise from the ashes. If not,
it could end up becoming the answer to a question in Trivial
Pursuit about failed Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MAKING SEVERAL LISTS &QL; 
The explosion of e-mail and bulletin boards has made juggling
online mailing lists for specific topics and friends confusing.
Until now.
</P>
<P>
   OneList.com ( &LR; www.onelist.com &LR; ) of Palo Alto has devised a
mailing list system that lets users create and manage e-mail lists
or subscribe to a spectrum of current lists for disparate topics
such as jokes, medical support, culture and games. And it's quick,
easy and free.
</P>
<P>
   So far, plenty of people have taken to the software. In one
year, Onelist.com has gained 2 million users and processes 10
million e-mail messages daily. By the end of the year, the company
expects to handle 3 billion messages a month.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MONSTER NUMBERS &QL; 
Speaking of scary growth, consider Monster.com ( &LR; www.monster.com &LR; ),
the largest online recruitment agency in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Maynard, Mass., company _ which received kudos for its stark
black-and-white Super Bowl ads depicting pessimistic young
jobseekers _ is used in six countries (United States, Canada, the
United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands and New Zealand) and is
about to add three more (Belgium, France and Germany). Some 35,000
companies post 180,000 openings on the site, which also lists 1
million resumes. Its stock has nearly doubled, to $57.38, over the
past several months.
</P>
<P>
   And evidently, it scored some touchdowns of its own after the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Company founder Jeff Taylor said the number of job searches on
the site the day following the big game jumped to 2.2 million _ up
from an average of about 173,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IMPEACHMENT! THE MOVIE &QL; 
The virtual polls open tomorrow at Theglobe.com
( &LR; www.theglobe.com &LR; ), the Web community that is asking its 9.3
million members to cast a fictitious movie titled ``Impeachment!
The Movie,'' about you-know-what. The publicity stunt is part of
the company's Oscar coverage this month.
</P>
<P>
   Before the voting starts, the Net Files has some casting
suggestions: a younger Delta Burke as Monica Lewinsky, Jack Lemmon
as Ken Starr, ``Felicity'' star Keri Russell as Chelsea Clinton,
Mike Myers in drag as Linda Tripp (although John Goodman's classic
portrayal of Tripp on ``Saturday Night Live'' would be hard to
top), Billy Bob Thornton as James Carville, and Robert Guillaume as
Vernon Jordan.

HUSKIES REBOUND AT EXPENSE OF ORANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ The Connecticut Huskies waited for the last
hours of February to reassert themselves as contenders in the
coming National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, and the
result was a perfect 10. In the 10 minutes that opened the second
half, the Huskies shot 10 of 10.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stretch in which Khalid El-Amin bore down the Carrier
Dome court with his teammates swarming like they were termites in
an abandoned barn, gobbling up 15 breakaway points. It was a
stretch in which Richard Hamilton dropped in bombs as if a magnet
attracted them to the bottom of the net. Sunday, the Huskies
recaptured the verve, precision and chest-bumping swagger that had
made them the nation's top-ranked team for 10 consecutive weeks.
They looked as if they played for a team that felt it deserved to
win another Big East title.
</P>
<P>
   When that 10-minute burst finally ended with a missed shot, the
Huskies had turned a halftime deficit of 2 points into a 15-point
lead. Their 24-7 run powered a 70-58 thumping of No. 24 Syracuse _
the team that had knocked them from the No. 1 spot by handing them
an embarrassing 59-42 loss on the first day of February.
</P>
<P>
   That loss sent the Huskies stumbling through a month of sluggish
play that tumbled them to No. 4 in the national ranking and
probably sent them across the country as the No. 1-seeded team in
the West Regional in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But after the game here, the Huskies made a statement that was
backed by their 25-2 regular-season record, including 16-2 in the
Big East and 9-0 on the road. They made a statement with their
fifth outright Big East title in six years, a statement about who
has the best team heading into this week's conference tournament at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard it all year,'' said Hamilton, who finished the
game with 26 points. ``First it was St. John's. Then last week it
was Miami. The new Beasts of the East? We're still the team to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   They are because they recovered magnificently from a first half
in which they shot 31 percent, coughed up the ball five times and
looked as listless as they had in their past four games: a loss to
Miami and closer-than-they-should-have-been victories over Seton
Hall, Rutgers and Providence.
</P>
<P>
   But those 10 minutes of perfection powered a 69 percent shooting
percentage in the second half for the Huskies as they harassed the
Orangemen on defense, then raced down the court and dunked on them
on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they didn't get back very well on defense, so we
wanted to push them,'' said El-Amin, who scored 21 points. ``Push
them.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped push Syracuse into having to play deep into the Big
East tournament. The Orangemen (19-10, 10-8) will be seeded No. 4
when they open the tournament against Boston College on Wednesday.
Syracuse _ along with fifth-seeded Villanova (20-9, 10-8), which
will play West Virginia on Wednesday _ needs to make a case that
the conference deserves a fourth and fifth NCAA bid behind the
Huskies, Miami and St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the fourth-place team in the Big East doesn't get in,
there's something very wrong,'' Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orangemen could have nailed down a tournament bid by
duplicating a first half that threatened to blow out the Huskies in
front of a noisy capacity crowd of 30,367.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen scored the game's first 9 points, built a 10-point
lead and employed a smothering 2-3 zone that had Connecticut Coach
Jim Calhoun shouting at his players to make better decisions. The
Orangemen also had the Huskies outmanned: Jake Voskuhl,
Connecticut's 6-foot-11-inch center, was a late scratch because of
a sprained left foot. A stress fracture in that foot had kept him
out of the teams' first meeting. Albert Mouring, Connecticut's
sixth man, was also unavailable Sunday because of a sprained right
knee.
</P>
<P>
   They were hardly missed during the Huskies' helter-skelter
second-half start. Connecticut's defensive pressure forced Syracuse
into shooting 25 percent, and the Huskies outmuscled the Orangemen
by 37-27 on the backboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get back on defense,'' Boeheim said, beginning a
litany of his team's shortcomings in the second half. ``They
pounded us on the boards. We didn't get any movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, meanwhile, rediscovered their sense of ball
movement and, well, fun. Calhoun pointed to his team's 19 assists,
which ranged from Kevin Freeman bombs to a streaking Rashamel Jones
to the niftier drives and dishes that El-Amin executed under the
basket. Freeman, who pulled down 13 rebounds, smiled as he recalled
the perfect 10 minutes of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were relaxed, and when we started forcing turnovers, we
grew confident,'' he said. ``Then the ball starts zipping around
the court. We shared it, and when you do that, we're back to
playing like we did in December.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said that he looks at the Huskies' season as two
chapters. The 19-0 start spoiled his team, which was then tested by
its 6-2 finish. The trick now, Calhoun said, is to take the best of
both parts of the season first to Madison Square Garden, and then
to the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've been in a shooting slump these last few
weeks,'' Calhoun said, acknowledging that he has joined in the
public dissection of what has been wrong with the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun added: ``We've been in a passing slump. We haven't moved
the ball. But we've responded with character. It's admirable,
really. We've had a pretty decent season.'' &QL;

 _ SF CHRON   Scios CEO Says Plant Closure, Layoffs Needed to Save Company 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR; In this new weekly column, biotech reporter Tom Abate will take &LR; 
 &LR; you behind the scenes of the Bay Area's biotechnology industry, &LR; 
 &LR; looking at the companies, people and issues that are &LR; 
 &LR; transforming how we treat disease. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Richard Brewer, chief executive of Scios Inc., is expected to
walk into work this morning and lay off a third of Scios' 270
employees, close its drug manufacturing plant and sell its
three-building campus in Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot continue business as usual,'' Brewer said. ``There
hasn't been a reality check on this company for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Hired five months ago as part of a shareholder-instigated
shakeup of the board and management, Brewer said the cuts are only
part of his prescription to transform Scios from a nonperformer _
the stock, worth $25 in 1991, trades at under $10 today _ into a
Wall Street favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first drug is close to approval, we've got cash, and we're
close to $400 million in market capitalization,'' Brewer said. ``We
have a chance to move up past $500 million (in market cap) and then
to a billion,'' the threshold at which institutional investors
become interested in companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest variable in Scios' future is outside Brewer's
control. Last month, Scios cleared the second-to-last regulatory
hurdle toward approval of its first drug, Natrecor. Designed to
relieve shortness of breath and other life-threatening symptoms
associated with congestive heart failure, Natrecor would be aimed
at a $250 million market.
</P>
<P>
   But before Scios and its marketing partner, pharmaceutical giant
Bayer AG, can tout Natrecor, they need final approval from the Food
and Drug Administration. Though Brewer is confident that Natrecor
will pass FDA muster, the agency still might decide that Natrecor
needs more safety tests.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, meanwhile, faces trials of his own. Three times since
1993, disgruntled Scios shareholders have floated resolutions to
sell, dissolve or otherwise shake up the firm. The most recent
revolt in 1997 eventually resulted in the ouster of former CEO
Richard Casey. A fourth initiative, this one suggesting the sale of
the company, will be on the proxy statement when Scios holds is
annual shareholder meeting this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's reorganization could boost the stock and silence the
critics. But today, the former Genentech executive must explain the
severance packages to 90 fired workers while persuading the 180
survivors to move into a smaller building in Sunnyvale where Scios
already has a research lab.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its ills, Scios has more than $90 million in cash and
could raise another $20 million by selling the three Mountain View
buildings. Brewer said he'll use that money to buy promising drugs
from smaller, cash-starved biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to get our assets working harder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INDUSTRIAL ANNIVERSARY &QL; 
It was 25 years ago that two Bay Area professors showed the world
how to snip strands of DNA from one microbe and paste the genetic
material into another organism. This discovery of recombinant DNA
technology paved the way for the biotech revolution.
</P>
<P>
   On March 13, the University of California at Berkeley will hold
a daylong series of events to celebrate these seminal experiments
by former University of California at San Francisco biochemist Herb
Boyer and Stanford University geneticist Stanley Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Bay Area residents can learn more about the
science of gene-splicing at a three-hour course taught by Desmond
Mascarenhas, an instructor at the UC Berkeley Extension and
director of research at Celtrix Pharmaceuticals in Santa Clara.
There is a $20 registration fee.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, a panel of scientific luminaries, including
three Nobel laureates, will discuss the ethical, legal and
commercial ramifications of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Headlining the afternoon panel, which is free and open to the
public, will be Harvard University's James Watson, who earned his
Nobel for the co-discovery of DNA. Fellow prize-winners J. Michael
Bishop of UCSF and Paul Berg of Stanford will be joined by seven
other Bay Area leaders in the commercial, scientific and
sociological realms of biotech.
</P>
<P>
   This is such a stunning lineup that the afternoon session surely
will fill up. UC will provide overflow seating and a video feed to
accommodate those who can't get seats in Wheeler Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   You can reserve a seat online at  &LR; www.berkeley.edu/unex &LR; 
 &LR; /biotech.  &LR; Or call the UC Berkeley Extension, (510) 642-4111, in

 Firms Jockeying to Be First In MP3 Music Revolution  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; The MP3 phenomenon has shifted from college dorms to boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The past two weeks has brought a flurry of announcements from
the likes of major companies such as Sony Corp., IBM and Texas
Instruments, each promoting its own new advancements in controlling
online music distribution and halting the spread of illegal MP3
formatted songs.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies, which just a year ago paid no attention to the
MP3 songs being distributed largely by college students and
tech-savvy music fans, now are scrambling to be first in line when
the digital music revolution starts to change the way consumers buy
music.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is software used to squeeze the size of audio files, so they
can be more easily stored on a computer hard disk and transmitted
on the Internet. In the past year, its popularity has soared with
half a million songs _ both legal and pirated _ distributed on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's trying to lay their cards on the table and jockey
for position,'' said Rick Fleischman, senior marketing director for
Liquid Audio, a Redwood City online music company. ``This is now
the prime time ... to come out and show your stuff and get known.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday in Los Angeles, more than 275 people representing
about 100 companies like Sony, Microsoft and Liquid Audio attended
the first official meeting of the Secure Digital Music Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Spearheaded by the Recording Industry Association of America,
the SDMI's mission is to come up with common technical standards
that will allow consumers to buy and play digital music no matter
what device they use.
</P>
<P>
   The group is seeking methods to stop music piracy that it says
was spawned by MP3's popularity. However, the SDMI also will help
shape how the recording industry sells copyright-protected digital
music in the long term, as well affect the distribution of other
digital products like audio books and software.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ambition of the initiative is the biggest in my
experience,'' said newly named SDMI Executive Director Leonardo
Chiariglione, head of Telecom Italia's research center.
Chiariglione is renowned for his work in the early 1990s as chair
of the original MPEG group that established audio and video
compression standards that became the basis for the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies began promoting their own technologies last
week in advance of the SDMI meeting. Sony announced a microchip for
music players and recorders to prevent piracy and software to
encode music.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio said it will team with chipmaker Texas Instruments
to develop a device that plays copyright-protected digital music in
portable devices like the Rio PMP300, Diamond Multimedia System's
handheld MP3 music player.
</P>
<P>
   And San Jose software-maker InterTrust Technologies Corp. said
it is working on security software with Fraunhofer IIS, a German
firm that originally developed the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   Chiariglione said the SDMI won't choose one technology over
another, which could segment the market into ``a series of niche
markets that will defeat their own interests.''
</P>
<P>
   An SDMI working group will start meeting this week to nail down
security standards for portable devices like the Rio by June 30.
Meanwhile, another group will try to hammer out ``more
encompassing'' standards'' by March 31, 2000.

COMMENTARY: ONLY COMPETITORS WILL END THE MICROSOFT RULE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been at least a dozen trials of the century in the
past 100 years, many of them soon forgotten. But the Microsoft
trial now nearing an end deserves that label for the light it sheds
on where the real power lies as the 20th century ends.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the world's most powerful government attacking the
world's most valuable company. Yet there seems to be a consensus
that the government cannot win. Or, to be more precise, that it
really cannot do anything to ultimately defeat Microsoft, whether
or not it wins in court.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stock price is up 125 percent since the fall of
1997, when the Justice Department probe became public. The company
is now valued at $379 billion, or 16 percent more than the much
larger General Electric, which ranks No. 2 in valuation. Investors
believe Microsoft will continue to prosper for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the great trials of this century, this one is unique in
one important respect: with both sides having completed their cases
_ although rebuttal witnesses are to be heard in April _ we still
have no firm idea of what the government wants to do about
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In the first great antitrust trial of the century, Theodore
Roosevelt's attack on J.P. Morgan's Northern Securities Co., which
controlled both major railroads in the Northwest, the remedy of
making the railroads compete again was obvious. In criminal cases
ranging from the Lindbergh kidnapping to O.J. Simpson, the
government's goal was clear.
</P>
<P>
   But _ assuming for the moment that Microsoft is guilty of
violating antitrust laws _ what is to be done?
</P>
<P>
   That has not yet been made clear, and none of the alternatives
seem especially attractive. Breaking up the company into several
companies that all produce operating systems would lead to
compatibility problems. Breaking it up into functional companies,
with one making such applications as word processing and another
responsible for operating systems, would still leave a functional
monopoly in operating systems. It would be a challenge to put teeth
into a requirement that Microsoft be nicer to its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   That is the calculus that has enabled Microsoft's stock price to
keep rising even when the case has appeared to be going badly for
it. Microsoft is deemed unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   There is one dissenter from that consensus. Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman and chief executive, argues that one of these
days his company is likely to get it wrong, ending its dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, you say. Of course he says that. What would you expect
from an antitrust defendant?
</P>
<P>
   But Gates is probably right. Remember the decline of IBM, itself
an antitrust defendant a quarter-century ago. Dominant companies
react slowly to change and are reluctant to move away from the
technology that made them rich. Companies with no stake in the old
order are more likely to create the new one.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is evidence that Gates is being honest about his
beliefs. It can be seen in the company's repurchases of its stock.
Microsoft needs to buy back a lot of stock to offset shares that
are issued as employees cash in stock options. But in recent years
it has sometimes slowed or even halted its purchases because the
stock price looked high. For now, with the stock rising ever
higher, that caution seems foolish. But it was _ and is _ real.
Microsoft's latest financial statement shows another pullback in
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   There have been dominant companies in important industries
before, but exact parallels to Microsoft are hard to find. It has
made millionaires out of thousands of its employees through stock
options, and in the process distorted the Seattle-area housing
market. Workers at Boeing, the other major employer in the region,
might not be as angry if they did not see how rich the other guys
were getting.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the courts decide, Microsoft's dominance is likely to
continue. Perhaps its competitive strategies will seem less
piranha-like. Certainly executives will use more discretion when
writing internal e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Someday Microsoft's stock price will stop soaring and even fall
for a few years. There will be griping by newer employees who
resent the wealth of old-timers and demand to be paid more in cash
and less in options that no longer are sure things. Microsoft will
find itself outfoxed by some competitor. Its monopoly will end, but
not because of what the courts decide.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military ruler
who campaigned as being the only man capable of holding together
this vast and fractious country, on Sunday appeared to have won an
overwhelming victory in the first presidential election here in 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   His challenger, Olu Falae, a former finance minister,
immediately disputed the fairness of the vote, held on Saturday
after years of promises by military dictators to move Nigeria, the
most populous country in Africa, toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Sunday night, however, whether Falae would
formally contest the results, particularly since they showed him
trailing by almost 7 million votes, with the margin widening in
Obasanjo's favor as more returns came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said if General Obasanjo won a free and fair election I
would congratulate him but clearly this is not a free and fair
election,'' Falae told journalists before leaving for the capital,
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
   A victory for Obasanjo would cap a tumultuous period in the
history of Nigeria, ruled until last June by a callous dictatorship
that had turned the country, the world's sixth-largest oil producer
and the biggest military power in West Africa, into an
international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be the culmination of an extraordinary personal
journey for Obasanjo, who was released from prison just eight
months ago after serving three years for criticizing the military
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, an anxious nation waited for officials to formally
declare the winner of the election that many hoped would fulfill
the promise of a nation whose seemingly boundless potential has
been squandered by years of misrule.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo had yet to make any public statement, apparently
waiting for election authorities to give him the official nod on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before that announcement, reaction to the results was muted in a
nation that has often seen its democratic aspirations thwarted.
</P>
<P>
   International election monitors, led by former President Jimmy
Carter, said they had witnessed fraud by both sides and other
irregularities, but probably not enough to have swayed the outcome,
which was substantially in Obasanjo's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Official results on Sunday night showed that the retired general
had garnered 62 percent of the votes, compared to 38 percent for
his opponent, from 33 out of 36 states, plus the federal capital.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials are scheduled to announce final results on
Monday when they will also formally declare the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who led a team of American election monitors, praised
the current military government's commitment to the transition to
civilian rule and the conduct of officials at the Independent
National Election Commission, which oversaw the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute said in
a report on the elections that there was ``no evidence indicating
that electoral abuses would have affected the overall outcome of
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been a pattern of nationwide fraud or
irregularities,'' Carter said in an interview. But he said that
monitors had observed fraud and irregularities in a number of
states, including ballot-boxes that were stuffed, vote tallies that
were inflated and results that were manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   Clement Nwankwo, chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group, an
umbrella organization of Nigerian organizations that dispatched
thousands of observers on Saturday, said that Obasanjo would have
to win over the public, because the irregularities had been serious
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winner must immediately embark on popular measures to deal
with the severe economic problems of this country and build popular
support for himself,'' Nwankwo said.
</P>
<P>
   If Falae contests the results, he will have to appeal his case
to a tribunal, which can decide to hold elections again in certain
areas or throughout the country. The new president is scheduled to
take over on May 29.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most significant for Obasanjo might be the effect of a challenge
by Falae on people in the south. According to the results released
Sunday night, he performed according to expectations by winning
most of the north. But Falae won the southwest, which is dominated
by the Yoruba, one of the three main ethnic groups in Nigeria,
along with the Ibo in the southeast and the Hausa-Fulani in the
north.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are Yoruba. But because of Obasanjo's close ties to the
North, many of his fellow Yoruba distrust him and consider him a
candidate imposed by the northern-dominated military.
</P>
<P>
   The Yoruba have been angry especially since one of their own,
Moshood K.O. Abiola, a billionaire businessman, had his apparent
victory in the 1993 presidential elections annulled by a northern
general. That led to five years of brutal dictatorship under
Abacha, which ended only with his sudden death last June. After
Abiola also died unexpectedly a month later, Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, the current president, announced a timetable for
elections and handover to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Falae was the candidate of the Alliance for Democracy, which is
essentially a Yoruba party with little reach outside the southwest.
The All People's Party, which is strongest in the north, joined
forces with the Alliance for Democracy and presented Falae as their
common candidate.
</P>
<P>
   During a weeklong campaign period, Falae attacked Obasanjo as a
soldier in civilian disguise and described an Obasanjo presidency
as a continuation of military rule. The theme resonated among many
Nigerians weary of the military, which has ruled Nigeria for all
but 10 years since independence from Britain in 1960. But Falae was
unable to spread his message because of poor organization and the
shakiness of the alliance that backed him.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Obasanjo tried to use his military past to his
advantage by arguing that he was the only one close enough to
military officers to prevent them from snatching back power, as
they have done in the past. He would serve as a bridge, his
campaign argued, to a civilian administration.
</P>
<P>
   His party, the People's Democratic Party, enjoyed the most money
and the backing of the retired military elite. The party dominated
in elections since December for local and statewide government
seats, as well as the national assembly.

EDITORIAL: NIGERIA'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 1:
</P>
<P>
   Olusegun Obasanjo, a former general, will be the next president
of Nigeria, according to preliminary election results. His
selection reflects the complexities of power in Nigeria today. When
the country's current leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, took over
last June, he promised a transition to civilian rule after 15 years
of disaster under general after general. Abubakar has kept his
promise. But the transition is incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Military officers, who largely bankrolled Obasanjo's candidacy,
will continue to loom over his government. Obasanjo will have to
break with them to have any success in improving life in Africa's
most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar took power after the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, one of
the most corrupt and certainly the most despotic of Nigeria's
recent military rulers. Their thievery and mismanagement turned
Nigeria, one of the world's richest nations during the oil boom of
the 1970s, into one of the world's poorest. Abacha snuffed out
political life in this once-vibrant country, jailing many of his
rivals, including Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   In his nine months in power, Abubakar reversed much of the
political crackdown. Most political prisoners are now free.
Newspapers publish openly. This election was the first in many
years in which the government did not dictate the number of
parties, although Obasanjo's opponent has complained about fraud in
Saturday's voting.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar's early promises to bring corrupt or brutal officers to
justice have melted away. Some political opponents jailed on
trumped up charges are still in jail. Abacha's decrees muzzling the
press are still on the books, and lately some journalists who write
sensitive stories have been harassed and their publications
confiscated. Police have killed protesters, with the worst
repression in the Delta, the country's poorest region despite being
the source of its oil wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Many Nigerians hope that Obasanjo's government will end the
military's political role, but this is unlikely. Obasanjo, who was
president from 1976 to 1979, is the only military ruler to leave
office voluntarily. Yet he is still close to the armed forces.
Military men finance his party, and one of its biggest supporters
is Ibrahim Babangida, among Nigeria's less savory former military
rulers. That money allowed Obasanjo to build a political machine
that won a majority in both houses of parliament in elections
earlier in February.
</P>
<P>
   Desperately needed economic reforms and anti-corruption measures
will anger officers, the main beneficiaries of the present morass.
Reversing the poverty and environmental destruction of the Delta is
another urgent task that may be hindered by Obasanjo's links to the
armed forces, which are hated there. Those ties may also prevent
him from calming ethnic tensions. He is a Yoruba from Nigeria's
southwest, but many Yoruba distrust him, viewing him as closer to
the northern army officials who have traditionally run Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   To have any success in tackling these daunting problems,
Obasanjo must make his government not the last stage in a military
transition, but the first stage of full civilian rule.

AT&AMP;T SUBSTITUTES FRED WILLARD FOR TALKING HOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the typically staid AT&AMP;T Corp. began a new unit called the
Lucky Dog Phone Co. last October with a barrage of offbeat
television advertisements featuring talking dogs, it seemed an
inspired idea.
</P>
<P>
   But the advertisements, which featured real dogs with dubbed-in
celebrity voices and were created by Young &AMP; Rubicam New York, may
have been perceived as over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Dog was the first new brand created by AT&AMP;T in its
113-year history to avoid mentioning AT&AMP;T itself. And the company
and some telecommunications analysts say that as a business, the
Lucky Dog 10-10-345 ``dial-around'' discount long-distance
operation is on track.
</P>
<P>
   But as an advertising campaign, the talking dogs' short run is
over. The advertisements featuring the dogs ended in December and
in the last few weeks AT&AMP;T has been introducing their replacement:
Fred Willard, the comedic actor, who is featured in Lucky Dog's
new, more conventional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As with the previous ads, the target audience is a more
price-conscious part of the market than would be attracted by the
AT&AMP;T brand. And the cornerstone of the Lucky Dog concept remains
the same: The consumer is not supposed to know that Lucky Dog is
part of AT&AMP;T. (The No. 2 MCI Worldcom Inc. offers its own
hide-the-brand discount services, the 10-10-321 and 10-10-220
services sold under the Telecom USA name.)
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T says it meant all along to eventually clamp the muzzle on
the anthropomorphic dogs. But some advertising and marketing
experts say the concept was too wacky from the start. Jack Trout,
president of Trout &AMP; Partners, a marketing strategy firm in
Greenwich, Conn., said the talking dogs may have been too unusual
to convey a sense of legitimacy about the Lucky Dog operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog was a dog of an idea,'' he said. ``There are a lot of
guys out there screaming numbers, and there is a question of who is
legitimate. The AT&AMP;T program probably looked less legitimate with
the dogs than anybody. They just got too cute. Now they're trying
to make this thing seem a little more real.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes A. Roth, senior executive director of Landor Associates, a
brand consulting firm that is a unit of Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc., is
another who thinks the previous campaign may have gone astray.
``Sometimes cuteness gets in the way of message,'' he said. ``In
advertising this kind of service you have one big job: to sell-in
memory of the numbers. And people don't remember numbers that
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``My guess is that they went out and discovered that
Lucky Dog got a lot of attention and it set it apart, but if you
remember Lucky Dog and don't remember how you access Lucky Dog, I
guess you didn't do all that good of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not, of course, how Howard E. McNally, Lucky Dog's
president, quite sees it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial campaign did exactly what we wanted it to do,'' he
said. ``It gave us a lot of bark and a little bit of bite. It got
us presence. We then needed to focus on a call to action: `Pick up
the phone, dial 10-10-345.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he added, ``we're trying to make sure they remember the
number, and we're having a lot of fun with Fred Willard.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Lippert, the advertising critic for the trade
magazine Adweek, is not impressed. She said Lucky Dog was not
distinguishing itself with Willard, since so many other phone
promotions already use comedians and comedic actors. MCI Worldcom,
for example, uses or has used Dennis Miller, George Carlin and
Christopher Lloyd in television advertisements, and AT&AMP;T is
currently employing Paul Reiser to promote the AT&AMP;T brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very weak centrist move,'' Ms. Lippert said.
``Obviously they were trying to be small and edgy. Then if that
didn't work, they try to go to the other extreme.'' Her conclusion?
``As long as there are phone companies there will be jobs for aging
comedians.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful or dreadful the Lucky Dog advertising
campaign may turn out to be, there are some analysts who think AT&AMP;T
would win either way.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Adamik, a communications analyst for the Yankee Group, a
technology consulting firm in Boston, said that Lucky Dog had
become one of the dial-around market leaders. But because the new
services are still used mainly by companies like MCI to take
business away from AT&AMP;T, he said, AT&AMP;T would benefit even if the
entire segment disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wreck the category, it's still to their advantage,''
he said. Adamik quickly added that he did not believe wreckage was
AT&AMP;T's goal. Still, ``if they can in some way contribute to the
demise of the industry, they win, because they still have the
lion's share of the market.''

EDITORIAL: GETTING ALONG IN CONGRESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 1:
</P>
<P>
   Congress has long had a famously unhealthy tendency toward
coziness. Senators and representatives assail each other in public,
but voters wonder whether they then retire to their racquetball
courts, watering holes and dinner parties to make mutually
beneficial deals, especially when it comes to rules on ethics and
gifts. But today the clubby old atmosphere of Congress is looked on
with something approaching nostalgia. The public seems more worried
these days by its culture of partisanship, pettiness, revenge and
the resulting paralysis. Some lawmakers have begun talking like
apostles for a new 12-step program to restore healing and civility.
</P>
<P>
   You would think politicians would not need lessons in listening
to each other. But after a year of hectoring over President
Clinton's personal conduct, they are not a bad idea. This month
House members plan a return to Hershey, Pa., where they held a
retreat two years ago. This time they have invited John Hume, the
Catholic leader who won a Nobel prize for helping to bury ancient
ethnic hatreds in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In similar fashion, the Senate seems to look back on its closed
session in the Clinton impeachment trial as a kind of epiphany, or
at least a group therapy session. Senators get misty-eyed about
discovering their own humanity and want to keep the spirit alive,
though the impeachment votes were overwhelmingly partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few suggestions for the Congressional sandbox.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Republicans have to recognize that their extreme
dislike of Clinton need not preclude legislative agreements.
Thinking clearly about strategy might help. Last week, the new
House speaker, Dennis Hastert, and other Republican leaders
complained that Clinton might carry out a sneaky plan to offer
policies that Republicans would reject, and then use the
confrontation as a campaign issue. Really, what will that White
House think of next? It seems only the other day that the GOP was
accusing Clinton of the opposite: adopting Republican policies like
the balanced budget and welfare reform and embracing them as his
own. This is not distrust. It is confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, meanwhile, have their minds on more down-to-earth
concerns. They want Hastert to at least tell them what bills will
be taken up the following week. They also want committee
assignments that reflects their gains in the last two elections,
noting that the lopsided majorities of Republicans on committees
have not changed since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans note that they are treating the Democratic minority
no worse than they were treated when they were the minority. That
is why it was sensible for Richard Gephardt, the Democratic leader,
to promise that if he becomes speaker after the next election,
which is not a bad bet, he will do no less than what he is asking
Republicans to do now.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to restore comity to the Congress is to let the
majority of Americans have their views count, and to have
majorities of lawmakers in Congress be able to pass legislation
even if hard-line party ideologues oppose it. There are probably
solid majorities in the House and Senate for campaign finance
reform, raising the minimum wage and a patient's bill of rights
that includes the right to sue health maintenance organizations. A
bipartisan consensus has emerged on limited tax cuts and more money
for education and defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic leaders must realize that if the
popular will is bottled up for the sake of narrow partisan
advantage, no amount of happy talk will raise Congress' esteem.
Results are what count. &QL;

PATENTS ISSUED : MAGNETIC VIDEOTAPE THAT RECORDS BOTH ANALOG AND
DIGITAL SIGNALS ; SUNSCREEN FOR CLOTHES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Pa., N.J. , Ohio)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When confronted with the advent of the digital, high-definition
television age, many people immediately want to know whether they
will still be able to watch their collections of videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of videocassette recorders know the answer has to
be yes, since consumers would rebel at the idea of a digital
technology that makes their home videos, children's Disney movies
and personal copies of ``Titanic'' obsolete. Even though new
generations of VCRs will have to be equipped to play both analog
and digital tapes, many people will keep using their existing
players for years.
</P>
<P>
   Since digital recordings may provide sharper pictures, movie
studios and video rental companies will want to be able to offer
them to their customers. But they will have to continue to stock
analog recordings for those who have not rushed out to buy new
digital-ready VCRs. For video sales and rental businesses having to
stock both analog and digital copies of videotapes will create cost
and space problems.
</P>
<P>
   To eliminate this problem, Christopher Strolle of Glenside, Pa.,
and Jung Wan Ko, from Lawrenceville, N.J., have patented a magnetic
tape that can record both analog and digital signals. Their patent
belongs to the Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional videotapes rely on recording heads that trace a
slanted track that is micrometers wide onto magnetic tape. The
heads leave unused or ``guard'' space in between those tracks. The
tracks are traced at specific angles to prevent ``mis-tracking,''
or the distortions that can result when a signal is picked up from
an adjacent track during playback.
</P>
<P>
   The invention exploits the fact that extra signals can be
recorded on this unused portion of the tape. The conventional VHS
tracks are straddled by tracks used for recording and reproducing a
high-definition signal, though the inventors say the space could
also be used for a wide screen or other television signal. The
track containing the standard VHS signal is traced at specific
intervals, widths and angles. The track containing the
high-definition signal is half the width of the VHS track so that
two tracks of the high-definition signal can fit between each of
the VHS tracks.
</P>
<P>
   This format ``allows one tape to record both a high-definition
television signal and a standard VHS signal'' and ``provides a way
to avoid the problem of having to carry a dual inventory of tapes
in a tape sales or rental business.''
</P>
<P>
   Strolle and Ko received patent 5,870,522.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreen for Clothes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreens protect skin from the ravages of direct sun, but what
about clothing? Procter &AMP; Gamble &UR;  &LR; believes that fabric _ or at
least the colors in fabrics _ could use protection against the sun,
too. The company owns a patent issued to John Cort Severns for a
compound that can be added to a conventional clothing dryer to make
clothes resistant to sun fading.
</P>
<P>
   The patent covers a mix of antioxidants, sunscreens and fabric
conditioners that are resistant to light and do not stain. Similar
antioxidants already are used in detergents to stabilize bleach,
and to prevent yellowing in detergents and softeners.
</P>
<P>
   Severns favors a dryer sheet over a rinse to deliver the
compound to clothing, because he says research has shown that
sheets can do the job with half to a quarter as much compound as
required in a rinse.
</P>
<P>
   The sheet would be tossed in the dryer with wet clothes; heat
from the drying cycle melts the compounds and releases the
antioxidants and sunscreens onto the clothes. Severns' patent said
the compound would ``reduce the fading of fabrics from sunlight.''
</P>
<P>
   He received patent 5,869,443.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

UNINSPIRED KNICKS FALL TO PISTONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ During Detroit Pistons games, the
technicians in the rafters of the Palace like to shine a spotlight
on the energetic creatures who are acting the craziest in the
stands. And everyone in the place looks at the attention-getting
guys jumping up and down, and everyone responds with an emotional
roar.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks would like to borrow that spotlight. They
would like to shine it on their starters and locate Charles Oakley.
They would like to shine it on their bench and discover John
Starks. They are desperate to find anyone _ any trace of a lift,
any speck of energy _ to pull them out of an unsightly funk that
has left them drained of all emotion when they take their act on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no Oakley, and there is no Starks. Once again, the
Knicks showed up as stone-faced and detached as subway passengers
Sunday, barely reacting when the Pistons pushed them and jostled
them toward franchise lows. Apparently, pride could not motivate a
Knicks team that lost, 89-68, even though Grant Hill scored just
four points.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's total did not matter. The Knicks were not a threat, not
when their final total was seven points short of the franchise low,
not when their 27-point second half was one point short of the team
low for a half.
</P>
<P>
   With this ghastly accumulation, the Knicks (8-5) lost their
second game in a row and suffered their third road defeat by double
digits this season. Somehow, they forget to pack their personality
when they leave home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pride ourselves on being a hard-nosed, tough, blue-collar
team,'' said Larry Johnson, who scored 12 points playing on a sore
left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just haven't seen it. You have to have emotion and guys
picking each other up. Oakley didn't show a lot of emotion. But if
you played with him, you could see all the hard work that he came
with every night, taking charges, diving on the floor. You say:
`Man, that guy is playing his heart out. We got to play with him.'
It's hard. Someone has to step up and we need to feed off him. You
need a guy like that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one took on that responsibility Sunday. A halfhearted effort
in perimeter defense allowed the 35-year-old Joe Dumars, who scored
21 points, to lose Charlie Ward and Allan Houston and bounce free
for four 3-pointers. A weary shooting effort resulted in the Knicks
hitting just 36 percent of their shots.
</P>
<P>
   A failure to respond to the Pistons' intensity turned a
five-point game early in the third quarter into a 27-point Detroit
lead eight minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Not one Knick responded during Detroit's blistering 26-4 run.
Houston looked drained, still battling the demons he has found at
the Palace in the three years since he spurned the Pistons as a
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   After making just 4 of 12 shots for 13 points Sunday, Houston is
a miserable 11 for 44 as a Knick in Detroit. Patrick Ewing was of
no help, either. Inexplicably, Eric Montross, a vagabond with
limited skills, raced around a flat Ewing for loose balls and
disrupted his shot.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ewing, who shot 3 for 7 and was held to an abysmal six
points, his lowest total since Dec. 18, 1996: ``I got kind of
winded at the beginning of the game, and I was trying to wait to
catch my second wind.''
</P>
<P>
   It never came for him, for anyone. As the Pistons broke the game
open in the third quarter, coach Jeff Van Gundy, who the previous
night had been given liquids intravenously in a local hospital
because of a stomach virus, turned three shades of green. This game
was not the elixir he was counting on for a team beginning a
three-games-in-three-nights stretch. The brutality of this season
has just begun for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season is slipping quickly,'' Van Gundy said. ``It can
change very quickly in this league. You're going well and then,
suddenly, you have a bad streak.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Right now, there is no one to break the spell. The team
president, Ernie Grunfeld, thought Dennis Scott could fill that
need. He was supposed to be the new Starks, the new emotional lift
off the bench. But Scott has struggled to find a rhythm, and has
made just 5 of 24 shots from 3-point range. Perhaps it was not so
coincidental that Scott played just five minutes Sunday and was
pulled after missing his only shot of the day _ from 3-point range
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I was surprised,'' said Scott, when asked
about how few minutes he played. ``I'm just staying patient.''
</P>
<P>
   But these are not patient times. The Knicks face an impatient
schedule that is just kicking in to its fire-drill pace. They need
to find a burst of energy, and fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put a halt to this,'' Houston said. ``We just need
to get some energy and emotion out there.''
</P>
<P>
   They need someone to take the place of Oakley and Starks under
the spotlight. &QL;

DEVILS PREVAIL AS COYOTES CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PENALTY KILLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Devils found themselves
two men short for 68 seconds early in the final period Sunday
afternoon at Continental Arena. To make matters worse, Scott
Stevens, their captain and cornerstone of the penalty-killing unit,
was sitting in the penalty box, next to Krzysztof Oliwa.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were in serious trouble, but they escaped from that
situation and went on to a 4-1 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes,
thanks in large part to brilliant penalty killing by defensemen
Scott Niedermayer, Ken Daneyko and Kevin Dean while down two
skaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was real big,'' Daneyko said of Phoenix's lost
opportunity. ``The key was that we played good positioning. We had
success with three defensemen in that situation because Nieder
pursued the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer played the point man in the triangular scheme that
killed the two-man disadvantage. His speed, skill and vision
allowed him to be effective, but he gave credit to his teammates,
especially goalie Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur made 26 saves and improved his record this season to
27-17-8. Two of his biggest saves came during that two-man
disadvantage, which began 39 seconds into the final period when
Stevens joined Oliwa in the penalty box. Both were in for roughing.
The Devils were leading, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That five-on-three was huge because if we allow one, it's a
new game,'' Brodeur said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I think our special teams made the difference,''
said Brodeur, who was beaten only by Bob Corkum's shot from the
left circle at 1 minute 47 seconds of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's loss was the seventh in the last eight games for the
Coyotes (30-20-10). They have produced nine goals in that stretch,
while allowing 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a strong game, but we're not scoring any goals,''
said coach Jim Schoenfeld, whose team was shut out by the Rangers,
3-0, on Friday. ``It's hard on our goaltender because every mistake
he makes is magnified.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Khabibulin has allowed soft goals, but he is the best
goaltender the Coyotes have and they play him as often as they can.
Khabibulin has lost six of his last seven starts, bringing his
season record to 24-15-6.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Pederson, Petr Sykora, Jason Arnott and Brian Rolston
scored New Jersey's goals, in that order, helping the Devils
improve their home record to 14-12-6 and their overall record to
33-20-8.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Devils are one of the league's leading teams thanks to their
special teams and occasionally brilliant goaltending.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they scored four goals Sunday, coach Robbie Ftorek
of the Devils said his team played better in the 3-3 tie Thursday
at Boston, its previous game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a good job killing penalties, obviously,'' Ftorek said,
``but I think we played better in Boston. We had better speed in
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolston was one of the happier Devils. His goal was his 19th of
the season and set a career high over his five seasons in the
league, all with the Devils. He is one of Ftorek's favorites and he
sees plenty of ice time with the special teams besides his regular
shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the way I've been playing,'' Rolston said.
``I'm getting more confident killing penalties and I'm getting my
share of goals. I never looked at the numbers at the start of the
season, but I'm happy to pass 18. That was my high. I just want to
play consistent hockey and continue to improve.'' &QL;

SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION HOPING BIG-MONEY GIFTS ARE BECOMING A TREND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Mass., N.Y. Pa.)  (rk) 
 By   MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ Schools of education have long struggled as the
fund-raising also-rans on university campuses, since even the most
successful teacher is likely to have far less to give back to alma
mater than, say, a grateful mogul or surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   So there was as much astonishment as gratitude last week when
the University of Connecticut announced the largest gift in its
history _ $23 million, with all but $2 million of it bound for the
School of Education.
</P>
<P>
   It is the biggest donation ever made directly to a school of
education, according The Chronicle of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   The donor, Raymond Neag of Reading, Pa., is a businessman who
was a political science major in the class of 1956 but has a niece
who is a professor at the School of Education. It is just such
hidden connections that education schools have to troll for when
seeking donors.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni alone will not do it: a survey released in May by the
National Education Association found that the average salary for
the nation's teachers in 1997 was $38,611.
</P>
<P>
   Development officials say that only divinity schools raise less
money than schools of education. And they say the fund-raising
hurdles have only become higher in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation's troubled classrooms have become a hot political
issue, the fancy theories born in education schools have been
blamed as part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Neag's contribution followed two other huge pledges to schools
of education in recent months: $20 million to the University of
Southern California, in September, and $10 million to Boston
College, on Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   As at UConn, the gift to the School of Education at Boston
College was the largest gift in the institution's history, making
the once-humble trainers of teachers look like the new fashion in
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These donations may be presaging a new era,'' said Susan H.
Fuhrman, the dean of the Graduate School of Education at the
University of Pennsylvania. ``These donors are making the statement
that improving education ranks up there with eradicating a dreaded
disease and that education schools are an important player, which
has not been a universally recognized fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph S. Brosnan, the vice president for development and
external affairs at Columbia University Teachers College, added,
``We don't have the obvious wealthy donors that schools of law and
business and medicine have, but there is a sense among some
philanthropists that this is education's turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston College gift was from Peter S. Lynch of Fidelity
Investments. In announcing the donation along with his wife,
Carolyn, he said, ``While our colleges and universities are the
envy of the world, the schools in many of our inner cities are in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   If three big gifts do not quite constitute a trend, deans of
several leading schools are scrambling to make them the start of
one. After Barbara and Roger Rossier announced their $20 million
gift to the University of Southern California School of Education
last fall, Dean Guilbert C. Hentschke used his new Rossier School
of Education letterhead to send a note of encouragement to 800
other of his fellow education deans and department heads. He
enclosed a fat packet of clippings and newscast excerpts describing
the Rossiers' gift, and he offered his wish that ``their act of
faith inspires others.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Harvard's education school announced that as part of
a universitywide capital campaign, it had raised its share _ $60
million _ a year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Kessner, a professor of history at the City
University of New York Graduate School who has studied the history
of philanthropy, said that the cluster of recent gifts bodes well
for other education schools. ``Not only does it legitimize their
request, but it encourages donors who see there are others who buy
the idea,'' he said.

TO HOLYFIELD, KO BOAST IS OK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geez, a few victories over an overrated Mike Tyson, and Evander
Holyfield thinks he's the all-time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The fact he predicted he'd knock out Lennox Lewis in the third
round when the two meet March 13 in New York isn't entirely
outrageous, although it's a bit out of character for a fighter not
known for blusterous comments.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said a third-round KO over such a formidable opponent
would be a testament to the impact God has on his life,
particularly because he's not a one-punch knockout artist.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, Holyfield's principal motivation is his religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something people have to see,'' said Holyfield, referring
to that third-round KO. ``. . . For people to see the changes God
is having on my life, I have to do new things, things I don't
commonly do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't commonly knock out someone in the third round. That's
uncommon for a little man like myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't sound overly boastful, does it?
</P>
<P>
   Even when he repeatedly guaranteed he'd get it done in three _
``I'm not predicting, I'm !ital!telling you . . . '' _ it didn't
sound as if he were bragging. It simply sounded as if he knew
something the rest of us didn't.
</P>
<P>
   And these weren't just words that accidentally spilled out of
his mouth. One, he said it repeatedly. And, two, he understands the
ramifications of his bold statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put myself out on a limb, I guess,'' he said with a
little laugh.
</P>
<P>
   However, Holyfield didn't stop there. Later, he was asked about
his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tyson and a dominating victory over Michael Moorer, he
was destined to be remembered as a solid but not great heavyweight.
Now, in some eyes, his standing has changed. One boxing magazine
had him ranked No. 3 all-time behind Muhammad Ali and Joe Louis, a
bit of a stretch when champions like Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey,
Rocky Marciano and a young Larry Holmes are considered.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield also took exception to the rankings _ but for other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at things stat-wise, I think it's a lot easier to
see all the things fighters before me have accomplished,''
Holyfield said. ``I think I've been able to accomplish more,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . I know it's a matter of opinion, anybody can be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Holyfield is one of the best fighters of !ital!his
time. But of all time? Probably not. To mention him with Ali and
Louis seems ludicrous. He'll be remembered more for his
unparalleled fighter's heart than his fine but not exceptional
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, we might have to re-evaluate if he gets that
third-round knockout.
</P>
<P>
   __ Next champion: David Reid, the only American to win a gold
medal at the 1996 Olympics, probably will become the third Olympian
from the Atlanta games to win a world title when he challenges
tough but limited WBA super welterweight champ Laurent Boudouani on
Saturday in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins, he'll claim a belt in fewer fights than Floyd
Mayweather and Fernando Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, who has been bothered by a droopy eye, has fought only 11
times.
</P>
<P>
   Mayweather and Vargas already proved that talent often is more
important than experience. Reid expects to reinforce that concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to fight for a world title between 12 or 15
fights,'' Reid said. ``The key is how well you do against the
opponents you do fight. (The promotional firm) America Presents
believes I'm now fit for the title.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Dan Goossen, head of America Presents: ``You see it in
other sports, especially basketball with players like Kobe Bryant.
. . . A special athlete can go right from high school to the pros
and be considered a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``David has that type of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Comparison: Coincidentally, Oscar De La Hoya, America's only
gold medalist in 1992, also fought for his first title in his 12th
fight. He beat Jimmi Bredhal for the marginal WBO junior
lightweight belt in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of records, Reid has faced better opposition than De La
Hoya. Reid's opponents were 310-45-5 (72 percent knockouts), De La
Hoya's 198-54-18 (47 percent KOs), according to stats compiled by
America Presents.
</P>
<P>
   __ Big step Lance Whitaker, the unbeaten heavyweight from
Northridge, will face his biggest test when he fights big-punching
Lou Savarese on the undercard of the Reid-Boudouani fight.
</P>
<P>
   If Whitaker wins, he'll be in position to fight for a world
title.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big if, however. Whitaker looked so-so in his knockout
of Alex Stewart, his last bout, and Savarese has solid skills and
experience.
</P>
<P>
   __ First defense: Moments after a telephone conference call with
IBF junior middleweight champ Fernando Vargas began, former
titleholder Raul Marquez got on the line and tried to bait the
Oxnard resident into a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life at the top: Everyone is going to seek a crack at
the new champion.
</P>
<P>
   First up is someone named Howard Clark of England on the
undercard of the Holyfield-Lewis fight.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas promises no letdown after his emotional victory over Yory
Boy Campas to win the title in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm training even harder now,'' he said. ``. . . Now, I want
to show the world I'm the best junior middleweight in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas said he wants to fight for another title before the end
of the year. However, don't expect it to be against Reid. A matchup
between two unbeaten world champions from the same Olympic team is
about as compelling as it gets, but the time isn't right. It could
be a few years before it happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fernando against Reid could be the biggest fight in boxing,''
said Dino Duva, Vargas' promoter. ``We want to do it at its peak,
though. We want to make sure the timing is right.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Vargas in L.A.: Duva said he's promised that Vargas' next
defense will be in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   The opponent and site have yet to be determined. Duva mentioned
the Olympic Auditorium and the Pond as possible venues and said the
quality of opponent will depend on what sort of television deal he
can strike.
</P>
<P>
   __ Busy guy: John Jackson, the vice president of Forum Boxing,
will join John Robinson's staff with the UNLV football team as an
assistant head coach and offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a football man long before he got involved in boxing,
will retain his position at the Forum.

GOVERNOR FIRES POLICE CHIEF OVER COMMENTS ON RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman ousted Col. Carl Williams as
superintendent of the State Police on Sunday after a published
report quoted him as saying that it was naive to think race was not
an issue in drug crimes and that cocaine and marijuana traffickers
were most likely members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have valued Colonel Williams' service, and his career record
is an honorable one,'' the governor said in a late afternoon
statement in Trenton. ``However, his comments today are
inconsistent with our efforts to enhance public confidence in the
State Police. I have therefore asked for his immediate
resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Her decision came the same day that The Star-Ledger of Newark
published a lengthy report quoting Williams in a wide-ranging
interview as linking minority groups with drug trafficking and
making other comments that seemed to fuel a racial controversy
around the State Police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago, the president of the United States went to
Mexico to talk to the president of Mexico about drugs,'' Williams
was quoted as saying. ``He didn't go to Ireland. He didn't go to
England. Today, with this drug problem, the drug problem is cocaine
or marijuana. It is most likely a minority group that's involved
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Black state legislators, religious leaders, civil rights
advocates and others who had sought Williams' removal hailed the
resignation as a step in the right direction, but said much would
depend on the selection of a successor and on establishing what
they called new directions within the 2,700-member State Police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman named Lt. Col. Michael Fedorko, the second-in-command,
as acting superintendent, pending what she called an expedited
search for a successor that will include ``consideration of both
civilian and uniform candidates.'' There has never been a civilian
commander of the State Police.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 58, who rose through the ranks in a 35-year State
Police career, did not comment publicly on his dismissal. He had
been under fire for weeks over charges that state troopers had
unfairly targeted black drivers on state highways, a practice known
as racial profiling, and that he had refused to acknowledge a long
history of racist procedures by his force.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism and calls for Williams' resignation,
Whitman, who had appointed him superintendent in 1994, had
continued to defend him publicly, and political observers in
Trenton said she had been prepared to stand by him, despite
misgivings by members of her administration about what some saw as
his tendency toward insensitive outspokenness.
</P>
<P>
   She abruptly reversed course on Sunday after The Star-Ledger's
report. Williams, in a three-hour interview with the newspaper that
took place late last week, was quoted as saying that racial
profiling would not be condoned and that troopers must stop
motorists only ``on the basis of a traffic violation.'' He added:
``As far as racial profiling is concerned, that is absolutely not
right. It never has been condoned in the State Police, and it never
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that certain crimes were associated with
certain racial and ethnic groups. ``If you are looking at the
methamphetamine market, that seems to be controlled by the
motorcycle gangs, which are basically white,'' he said. ``If you
are looking at heroin and stuff like that, your involvement there
is more or less Jamaican.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also paraphrased Williams as saying that it would
be naive to think race was not an issue in drug trafficking, and
that drug violations were not the only crimes associated with
ethnic groups. Organized crime once was dominated by Italians, he
was quoted as saying, and he also said organized crime now tends to
be dominated by Russians and Eastern Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   While contending that he had never known a State Police officer
who used profiles based on skin color or nationality, Williams was
quoted as saying that he had taken steps to counter such profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to the article was swift and angry. A coalition of
black state legislators, ministers and civil rights advocates
gathered at the East Orange offices of Assemblyman Leroy Jones,
D-Essex County, and denounced Williams, calling for his resignation
hours before it was announced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``His views are dastardly, his thoughts are ill and sickened,
and he's unfit to hold such a critical, important office,'' Jones
said. ``He's a racist of the worst kind, because he doesn't even
know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Jones welcomed the resignation, calling it a ``measured
victory because there is still so much to do to get rid of the
institutional racism that permeates the State Police.'' Another
legislator, Assemblyman William Payne, a Democrat who represents
Newark and Hillside, called Williams ``the tip of the iceberg of
the apparent racist administration of the State Police.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said the Black and Latino Caucus of the state Legislature
would conduct hearings ``into all aspects of the State Police to
uncover other areas of racism, in addition to profiling, that need
to be corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive director of the Black
Ministers Council of New Jersey, representing 600 churches around
the state, also hailed the resignation, but warned, ``We are still
deeply troubled by the pervasive perception among the State Police
as it relates to minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has often been praised for his devotion to an agency he
joined in 1963. Rising through the ranks, he cruised the highways
as a trooper for years, then worked in the criminal-investigation,
organized-crime, intelligence, internal-affairs and narcotics
units. He was appointed superintendent by Whitman early in 1994.

CSUN COACH TO DECIDE PLAYERS' FATE TODAY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge men's basketball coach Bobby
Braswell will meet with suspended players Greg Minor and Rico
Harris today to determine the players' fate for the Big Sky
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Minor, a junior guard, and Harris, a junior forward, were
suspended prior to the Matadors' trip to Weber State and Sacramento
State for what Braswell termed ``conduct detrimental to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors went 1-1 on the trip and finished 9-7 in the Big
Sky Conference, 17-11 overall. They open the conference tournament
Thursday against Montana State.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell suspended five players last year. Minor, CSUN's top
3-point shooter, and Harris, the team's top rebounder, were the
first suspensions this season.

CLARK'S LAST-SECOND SHOT RIMS OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Everything was there for Pepperdine's
Rasheeda Clark. The open look at the basket. The chance for
redemption. The glory of a West Coast Conference women's basketball
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The ball bounced off the rim. Nothing had changed. Pepperdine
came up a little bit short in its bid for a WCC Tournament title.
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's, not Pepperdine, is going to its first NCAA
Tournament after beating the Waves 72-69 on Sunday in front of
1,811 at Toso Pavilion. The Waves (21-8) had their winning streak
snapped at eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaels (26-6) had barely finished cutting down the net,
though, when Pepperdine head coach Mark Trakh talked about a
possible at-large berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play the waiting game and the lobbying game,'' Trakh said.
``We're going to crank out a lot of letters to the people on the
(selection) committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's field is announced Sunday. For Clark, a sophomore
All-WCC guard, it isn't soon enough. Her miss in the final seconds
here was a replay of the Waves' 60-58 loss to St. Mary's at home on
Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to make it is to shoot it,'' said Clark, who
scored 14 of her 16 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine trailed 70-69 with 20 seconds left when the Waves got
the ball on a turnover. Clark drove the lane at the 10-second mark
and her eight-foot jumper was off. Pepperdine scrambled for the
rebound, but the ball went out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Berg made two free throws for the Gaels with one second
left to provide the final score.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine trailed 70-60 with 2{ minutes left when Clark made a
layup that started the Waves on a nine-point run which ended on
Clark's 3-pointer with 1:29 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've played (the Gaels), it's been a game of
runs,'' Trakh said. ``I think if we played them again it might go
down to the last shot.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look like it would be close in the game's first 5{
minutes, when Pepperdine blew out to a 15-3 lead. St. Mary's, which
placed four players on the all-tournament team (Clark made it from
Pepperdine) didn't panic and took advantage when the Waves went
nearly eight minutes without a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament MVP Tracy Morris (19 points) made a 3-pointer with
5:25 left in the first half that gave the Gaels a 27-25 lead.
Pepperdine never led again, though it tied the game twice in the
second half in the midst of a 16-4 run.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves will resume practice later this week after a few days
off. If the NCAA doesn't come calling, then an NIT bid will
probably be offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NIT is another game,'' Clark said. ``I think that's what
everybody wants, another game.''
</P>
<P>
   And another shot.

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   On the Friday before Valentine's Day, Ricardo Aguero walked into
the Madison Avenue Bookshop and picked up ``Here Is My Heart,'' a
book of poetry, as a gift for his wife, Lynn Hackstaff.
</P>
<P>
   When she joined him for a late lunch, she, too, handed him a
gift, nicely wrapped, obviously a book. A researcher at a surgical
clinic, she had gone to the bookstore between patients that day and
bought the same volume for him.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who met in an online chat room, had been married for
only five months and both were surprised, and pleased, that they
knew each other's tastes so well. Should they return one of the
books? If so, which one? The result: The twin volumes are cozily
nudging each other on the bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Recently I took a bus to Manhattan that dropped me and my cane
off on an upstairs platform at the Port Authority terminal, so I
sent my granddaughter ahead to see if the escalator was working.
</P>
<P>
   While I waited, a gentleman paused beside me and the following
exchange occurred.
</P>
<P>
   He: ``See, I use a cane, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``Well, they help get us where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   He, leaning forward confidentially: ``I'm 90 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Me, triumphantly: ``I'm 91{ years old.''
</P>
<P>
   He lightly planted a kiss on my cheek and departed.
</P>
<P>
   I was giggling when my granddaughter returned. Of course she
wanted to know why. I described the episode and her response was
``He's got some nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, she's not even 30, and she's a feminist to boot.

yogurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Two well-dressed businessmen were striding purposefully up
Eighth Avenue in Chelsea when they came upon a large flock of
pigeons feasting on bread crumbs that someone had scattered on the
corner. Sean O'Malley, who was nearby, heard one of them say to the
other, ``Oh, excuse me a second!'' The man then made his way into
the midst of the pigeons, bent low, hands on knees, and asked,
``Any messages?''

spotted a yellow spring suit. Shortly afterward, she made her first
visit to the shop, which happened to be a favorite of her mother's

polyester. The saleswoman, noticing Mrs. Blakely's disappointment,
quickly added, ``Our ladies don't like to wrinkle.''

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I have recently been reminiscing about Second Avenue when I
lived there as a child in the 1930s. We lived behind our jewelry
store on Second, between 78th and 79th streets. A theater was on
the corner of 79th, sometimes playing talkies and sometimes silent
films. Jimmy, the manager, would let us in free. Sometimes we would
swipe sweet peas from a store down the street and then run for our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Avenue El roared and clattered overhead. We could
converse only between trains. The sun that peeked through the
tracks and railway ties danced wildly on the cobblestones below
whenever a train passed by.
</P>
<P>
   When I looked all the way down Second Avenue to where everything
seemed to converge, I believed that was the edge of the world, and
if I could only stand on top of a ladder on one of the rooftops, I
could touch the sky.

   A very elderly woman was walking ahead of Helene Bell in the
cosmetics department at Bloomingdale's. A saleswoman carrying a
tray of ``free gift with purchase'' products approached the woman
and asked if there was anything she would like to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lovely offer, but I don't need anything at the
moment,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   The saleswoman replied: ``That's no problem. Our products have a
shelf life of two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman smiled at her. ``The difficulty is, I'm not sure of my
shelf life,'' she said.

   David B. Angerman, like everyone else, has heard New York
described as Fun City. Still, when he saw the sign at the 86th
Street subway station, he was pleased to know that residents
uninterested in participating in the fun had been taken into
consideration. The sign read:
</P>
<P>
   No Fun
</P>
<P>

   It was a typical Saturday morning at a Bronx neighborhood
supermarket. Ed Gruber was waiting his turn and observing Irving,
the counterman, who was seemingly frenetic but totally in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else?'' Irving asked an indecisive shopper. ``I don't
know,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a special on smoked sturgeon,'' he announced. There was
a long pause. ``Is it fresh?'' she asked. ``As fresh as a smoked
sturgeon can be, lady.'' he replied. She finally made up her mind:
``All right, give me six slices.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving was waiting for that. ``We ain't got no more,'' he said.

UNIVERSITY TO BE HOME FOR ANTI-APARTHEID GROUP'S ARCHIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js)

   STORRS, Conn. _ The archives of the African National Congress,
which were buried in backyards and otherwise hidden in three dozen
countries during the party's underground struggle against
apartheid, will be collected and opened to the public here and in
South Africa under an agreement to be signed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Connecticut will help catalog 5,000 boxes of
previously secret letters and other documents in South Africa.
Copies will then be deposited at the campus in Storrs, 30 miles
east of Hartford. The Connecticut collection will also include
videotapes of rallies and some original artifacts: beaded mats used
to send coded messages of resistance, and decades' worth of
buttons, stickers and posters that were used to build support
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC, led by Nelson Mandela, now the president of South
Africa, was an officially banned organization for 30 years but won
control of the government in 1994 in the country's first free
elections. ``There was a time when documents meant death or
imprisonment or torture,'' Narissa Ramdhani, the head of archives
for the ANC, said in a telephone interview from Cape Town. ``The
history of South Africa needs to be rewritten, but until now, we've
never had the materials to rewrite it. This has been a lost
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Most tantalizing for scholars, the party has agreed to open
records about such touchy subjects as accusations of human rights
violations within its own ranks. ``We've been denied access to this
history for so long that it would be hypocritical of us to close
off part of it now,'' Ms. Ramdhani said. ``It is not our intention
to portray the party only in a positive way. But we believe people
will see this was a liberation struggle fought under difficult
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which will make the University of Connecticut the
only official ANC repository outside South Africa, is to be signed
at the Parliament building in Cape Town in a ceremony with
government officials and a delegation from the university. The
collection will be housed at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center,
which specializes in human rights materials and is named for the
father of Sen. Christopher J. Dodd. The elder Dodd, who also served
as senator from Connecticut, was a senior prosecutor at the
Nuremberg War Crimes Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ramdhani said a dozen universities in the United States and
Europe had vied for the collection. She said the University of
Connecticut was chosen because the Dodd Center is ``a unique human
rights repository.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ramdhani also has a personal connection, having studied at
the University of Connecticut for three years beginning in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries and other documents cover everything from mining
strikes to the ANC's diplomatic maneuvering abroad to its smuggling
of machine guns into the country. As part of the project, scholars
at the University of Connecticut will collect oral histories from
200 ANC leaders and members, beginning with Mandela.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Amii Omara-Otunnu, an associate professor of history who will
head the archives project in Connecticut, said scholars were eager
to evaluate the motives of those abroad who helped the ANC, and to
better understand such practices as the execution of suspected
informers within the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be in a position to see whether these actions were the
policy of the ANC hierarchy, or whether these were extremist
members,'' Dr. Omara-Otunnu said.
</P>
<P>
   The material is to be cataloged in Johannesburg, a project that
is expected to take about eight years, then preserved at the
University of Fort Hare, Mandela's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   The first ANC documents should arrive in Storrs this summer.
Some of the archive is already available through the ANC's World
Wide Web site, including all 11,000 words of Mandela's famous
defense from the dock in Pretoria Supreme Court in 1964, in which
he declared, ``I am prepared to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Also available is ``What Women Demand,'' a 1955 manifesto
calling for street lights, public swimming pools and the right to
home ownership ``for all people of all races.''

EVEN PERPS MAY PREFER WALK OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Let us, for one disorienting moment, imagine a world
without ``perp walks.'' Suppose detectives had just cracked a
notorious case, but the press were no longer able to photograph the
alleged perpetrator walking along in the custody of the police.
</P>
<P>
   To give the public a glimpse of him, newspapers and television
stations would start buying old snapshots and home videos from
disgruntled relatives and neighbors. The evening news might show a
videotape of an accused serial rapist giving a drunken toast at a
wedding, or a father happily playing in the park with the children
he is accused of bludgeoning to death with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Would this be a better world? It might please Allen G. Schwartz,
the federal judge in Manhattan who ruled last week that a suspect's
constitutional rights had been violated by a perp walk. But the
perps themselves would probably resent having the masses see their
private snapshots and videos, especially since the pictures would
be a public relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   When you're an accused serial rapist or hammer-murderer, you do
not want to be seen laughing it up. You want to project the
sobriety captured in artists' renderings of the very first perp
walk, the armed angel escorting Adam and Eve out of Eden. Even if
you, unlike the original sinners, are innocent, you must
acknowledge that something has gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Your changing social status necessitates a rite of passage,
which anthropologists define as having three stages. The perp walk
is the first stage, called separation, in which you're stripped of
your old status. That leaves you outside the social structure in
what is called the betwixt-and-between stage. The final phase,
reintegration, comes after the verdict, when you're assigned a
fixed status as either a convict or a law-abiding citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ritual like the perp walk eases social anxieties about
someone whose status is unclear,'' said David Kertzer, an
anthropologist at Brown University and the author of the book
``Ritual, Politics and Power'' (1988, Yale University Press). He
said the walk symbolically reconciles people's contradictory
feelings about the perp: while they think he's probably guilty
(since most defendants are eventually convicted) and hope the crime
has been solved, they also believe that he should be presumed
innocent and treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Displaying the person in handcuffs,'' Kertzer said, ``is a
ritual degradation that publicly signals his change in status from
an ordinary citizen, like ripping the stripes off the shoulders of
a military officer. The police presence during the walk reinforces
our desire for moral boundaries to be enforced. But we're also
afraid of police power run amok, so we expect the police to act
decorously, and it's reassuring to see the perp's rights being
protected by other social institutions, like the courthouse where
he's being taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, perp walks in New York are generally far from
decorous. The press corps often looks more like a mob at a
lynching, which is the wrong rite of passage for the situation. The
poor perp typically emerges from a police station into a gantlet of
flash bulbs and hides his face as he stumbles down the steps,
whereupon a police officer grabs his head and shoves him down into
a car.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no reason it couldn't be done properly. Instead of
haphazardly staging perp walks on cramped stairways and sidewalks,
the police could build a special structure, maybe something like
the classic bridge in Venice connecting the Doge's Palace with the
prison, the Ponte dei Sospiri, or Bridge of Sighs, named after the
convicts' sounds during that rite of passage.
</P>
<P>
   If New York had a grand Ponte dei Perps, with assigned places
for the press and room for a stately parade, perps could walk in
dignity. They could heed Edward W. Hayes, whose standard advice to
perps was repeated in Tom Wolfe's ``The Bonfire of the Vanities''
by Tommy Killian, the lawyer modeled on Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said you should never hang your head,'' Hayes
said. ``The more guilty a client is, the more I tell him to hold
his head up. And the few that are innocent, I tell them not to
worry about being forever scarred by the perp walk, because when
they're acquitted they'll get publicity then, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the idea of eliminating perp walks appalls Hayes.
``Without that reward, detectives would lose their motivation,'' he
said. ``Trial lawyers like me would stop going to tailors. A lot of
my clients would be upset, too. What's the point of taking up a
life of crime if you can't star in a perp walk?''

COMING OFF BENCH MIGHT SUIT RODMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Kurt Rambis' rotation is starting to take
shape and it includes a bench role for a seven-time rebounding
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman has entered the last two games _ to thunderous
cheers _ just after the seven-minute mark in the first quarter. And
the Lakers' new coach said that might become the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what he brings off the bench,'' Rambis said. ``I think
it's important for teams to have spark coming off the bench. He
brings that spark to the crowd and an excitement that only the Worm
can bring to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis and Rodman discussed the matter Saturday and Rodman said
he was OK with the role. It seems to suit him. Rodman has 21
rebounds in two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Rambis) knows his players have to go out there and split
time and have to be unselfish to win games,'' Rodman said. ``You
have to bite your tongue and your pride and just go out there and
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis, continuing with the starting five he inherited, is going
with Travis Knight at power forward, and he is moving former
starter Robert Horry back to his natural position of small forward,
behind Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rambis on Rodman: Whatever: On Saturday, Rodman reported to
practice a half-hour late, and Rambis said he might issue a fine.
On Sunday, Rambis' ire was directed at reporters for continuing to
ask about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys are making an unbelievably big deal out of something
that I don't find to be a big deal,'' he said. ``It's just
something we knew we were going to have to deal with. We have made
accommodations for several ballplayers on this team to make them
feel at home and comfortable. What's important is what they're
doing out on the basketball court for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not gonna flip out every time something like that
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Barkley's pain: Charles Barkley, back in action two weeks
after knee surgery, said he came close to hanging it up entirely
this offseason, and might have if not for a talk with buddy Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very close to quitting before I had my talk with
Michael,'' Barkley said, citing ``the horrible attitude the team
had. And I was in pain all year (from a hernia), which didn't help.
. . . Michael challenged me to rededicate myself, give it one more
shot, so I can leave on my own terms, not mad or bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley nearly retired when, during the lockout, he realized,
``I didn't miss playing. I swear to God. I really enjoyed taking my
daughter to school and playing golf every day. It wasn't like I was
sitting at home, saying I miss the season. I didn't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Elden Campbell stayed home with the flu and did
not travel with the team to Phoenix.

MAGGERT'S MILLION DOLLAR CHIP WINS HIM AN ELUSIVE CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif &UR; . &LR; _ It ended the way a million-dollar match
should end, not with a blunder, but with a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   After Jeff Maggert sank his dramatic 20-foot chip shot to win
the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship Sunday, he took a
joyful leap in the air, celebrating the most significant victory of
his career. Maggert prevailed over Andrew Magee on the second hole
of sudden death, concluding a terrific 38-hole championship match
at La Costa Resort and Spa.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert and Magee were not expected to be around Sunday when the
world's 64 top-ranked players opened play on Wednesday. But the
finalists provided an entertaining match that offered terrific golf
and hole-by-hole suspense.
</P>
<P>
   After both players missed makable putts on the back nine that
could have ended the match sooner, Maggert captured the $1 million
first-place check and the championship with his chip shot at La
Costa's par-3, 180-yard 11th hole.
</P>
<P>
   After Magee's 30-foot putt for birdie stopped four feet short of
the hole, Maggert made the biggest shot of his life from the left
rough adjacent to the green. He delicately sent the ball onto the
green with his sand wedge, then exulted as the ball hit the hole,
took a small bounce skyward and nestled into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert was not motivated solely by the money. With 13
second-place finishes during the last eight years, and without a
victory on the PGA Tour since 1993, he needed to prove himself as a
closer. And with this victory, he accomplished that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That chip was something that I really needed all day long,''
said Maggert, who won for the first time since the 1993 Walt Disney
World-Oldsmobile Classic. ``Thank God it came on the last hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be a lot of doubters, but I have been
around this game for a long time, and I have been waiting five and
a half years to get back in the winner's circle. It took me a
little longer than I would like. But I really feel like I'm in the
prime of my game.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Maggert's winning chip shot was necessary because both players
let earlier chances to end the match slip away. After Maggert made
a birdie putt at No. 13 to even the match through 31 holes, neither
player birdied again until Maggert's final stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Magee missed a 20-footer for birdie at No. 16 that would have
put him 1-up with two holes to play. And the high drama continued
at No. 17, with many in the sizable gallery walking from hole to
hole with the players while others waited in the grandstands
surrounding the 17th and 18th greens.
</P>
<P>
   Both players reached the green at the par-5 17th in three shots.
Maggert putted first, barely missing a 20-footer for par. That left
Magee with a 12-footer for birdie that would have put him 1-up
going to No. 18. But Magee's ball rolled less than an inch past the
left edge of the cup, keeping the match even.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I made that putt,'' said Magee, who settled for the
$500,000 second-place prize money. ``I knew I needed to make a
birdie somewhere to untie this deal, and I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert had a chance to end the match at No. 18, but his 15-foot
putt for birdie slid past the hole, as the crowd moaned, while
Maggert stared at the ball and the cup in disbelief. But two holes
later Maggert ended the match at No. 11, after hitting an 8-iron
for his tee shot that landed near the green in the left rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the kind of chip where I could make it,'' Maggert said.
``It was uphill, had a little left-to-right break. The last thing I
wanted to do was run it four or five feet by, but I hit it a little
bit too hard. Even when I saw it hit the hole, I thought it was
going to pop out. And it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   There were many shifts in momentum throughout the match, which
started with 18 holes in the morning, followed by 18 more holes and
then the two extra holes in the afternoon. Magee was 3-up through
eight holes in the morning, and he started the afternoon play still
leading, 2-up. But as he did throughout the tournament, Maggert
remained steady and confident, despite struggling with putts from 5
to 10 feet, and he slowly whittled away at his early deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a nine-hole tournament I might have won, but I had
27 more to play,'' Magee said. Asked if he thought about the prize
money, Magee laughed and said: ``I thought about the money all day.
I knew what was at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maggert walked away with the top prize, moving to the top of
the tour's money list this year. And the victory will elevate
Maggert's recognition factor with the public. His peers have long
recognized Maggert as a solid player, but with six victories this
week, including the defeats of top-seeded Tiger Woods, and Nick
Price and Bernhard Langer, Maggert rose to the occasion and won the
first event of the new World Golf Championships series.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert came close to winning the U.S. Open Championship in
1997, before faltering on the back nine and finishing fourth.
Perhaps with this victory, the 35-year-old Maggert will become even
more confident during a tournament's crucial moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew inside that I had what it took to win tournaments,''
Maggert said. ``Guys that can play well when they are nervous are
guys that win tournaments. You can't be afraid of it. Everyone
chokes in golf. That is just a fact of life. I have choked before.
Sometimes I don't choke. But being nervous is part of the game. I
was nervous, but I was confident.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday , having refused to let another tournament slip away,
Maggert was a winner. ``It was a long week, probably the biggest
win of my career,'' he said. ``You've got the top 64 guys playing
and match play is a very difficult format. The biggest thing is, I
can just be myself now. If I finish second now, it's OK Now I can
go out and have fun.''

SURPRISE VICTORY CREATES SURPRISE DERBY CONTENDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Desert Hero, a son of the 1993 Kentucky Derby
winner Sea Hero, making only his second lifetime start, won
Sunday's $200,000 San Rafael Stakes at Santa Anita by a neck in an
upset that surprised even his trainer, Wallace Dollase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect that,'' said Dollase, who trains the horse
for the Thoroughbred Corp. of Prince Ahmed bin Salman of Saudi
Arabia. ``We figured if he was within three lengths, we had a shot
at a Derby horse. He's a fast, intelligent horse who's bred to go
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Desert Hero _ who paid $22.80 for $2 to win, covered the mile in
1:36 2/5 and won for the second straight time _ became the latest
contender for the May 1 Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   But no winner of the San Rafael has ever won the Derby, which is
somewhat reassuring news for the also-rans, particularly the Bob
Baffert-trained Prime Timber. Baffert's colt raced outside most of
the way and took the lead from the favored Honest Lady in the
stretch but could not hold off Desert Hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm discouraged that we didn't win,'' said Gary Stevens, Prime
Timber's jockey. ``He doesn't want to run past horses. He's running
at about half-speed through the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who has a barn full of Derby contenders led by the
early favorite Exploit and the filly Silverbulletday, called the
race ``a good, hard work'' for Prime Timber. Honest Lady, who had
an exceptionally fast half-mile workout Friday for the Hall of Fame
trainer Bobby Frankel, led at the top of the stretch but finished
fifth, less than a length behind the winner. Capsized closed fast
for third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have rushed her a little bit into the first turn, and
she got aggressive on me around the first bend,'' said Kent
Desormeaux, Honest Lady's jockey. ``She'd never been around two
turns, so I would say this filly more or less went to school
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Desert Hero, ridden by Dollase's son-in-law, Corey Nakatani,
would have won easily with a cleaner trip. Nakatani saved ground
along the rail down the back side but was blocked behind a wall of
horses as the field turned into the stretch. At the eighth pole,
Nakatani had to take up sharply behind Honest Lady, and then swung
the winner three wide in the late stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a big horse, but because of his versatility he was
able to go around those horses and still kick in,'' said Dollase,
who had given the $575,000 yearling purchase three months off to
heal a toe infection before he romped in a maiden race here on Feb.
7.
</P>
<P>
   Dollase, Nakatani and The Thoroughbred Corp. combined to win
this race a year ago with Orville N Wilbur's.
</P>
<P>
   Dollase had been thinking of shipping Desert Hero to the
Arkansas Derby in April, but said he now will point to the April 3
Santa Anita Derby, the final West Coast prep for the Kentucky
Derby.

`8MM' SNUFFS ITS RIVALS AT THE BOX OFFICE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Murder-mystery ``8mm'' showed plenty of life at
the nation's multiplexes as it dominated offerings with an
estimated $14.3 million at 2,373 theaters during the Friday-Sunday
period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony release, starring Nicolas Cage as a private eye
descending into the sordid world of snuff films, took in more than
the combined total of the next highest grossers _ Paramount's
fourth weekend of ``Payback'' with $6.9 million at 2,852 theaters
and Disney's opening of romantic drama ``The Other Sister'' with
$6.7 million at 1,343 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said ``8mm,'' with a reported $40 million budget,
performed in line with expectations and credited the studio for
effectively marketing a movie with edgy subject matter and limited
appeal beyond male customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony is pretty good at making movies for target audiences,''
said film analyst Arthur Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
agreed, saying, `` `8mm' is not a movie that women and the date
crowd attended.'' He predicted it will finish second next weekend
following Sony's teen drama ``Cruel Intentions'' and finish its
domestic run at about $46 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sony spokesman Ed Russell said ``8mm'' played equally well
throughout the country and acknowledged that the studio decided to
take a fairly straightforward approach to publicizing the movie.
``We would have done a disservice for people to go into theaters
not knowing what the film was about,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the slate posted generally respectable numbers and
overall business totaled about $75 million to finish down 3 percent
from the same weekend a year ago, when ``Titanic'' was in its 11th
week of release on its way to $600 million overall. Year-to-date
totals are down 12 percent; top grossers during 1999 so far are
``Patch Adams'' with $84 million and ``Payback'' with $66.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly no major slump and there's enough different
product to keep attracting customers,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney executive Chuck Viane said the studio was pleased with
the opening for ``The Other Sister,'' with Juliette Lewis as a
mentally challenged teen-ager, and will add about 400 theaters
Friday to take advantage of strong word-of-mouth among moviegoers.
Bucksbaum said female customers had supported ``The Other Sister''
strongly and predicted it could top $30 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' third weekend of ``Message in a Bottle'' finished
a close fourth with $6.4 million at 2,545 theaters to go past $41
million overall, followed by Disney's third weekend of ``My
Favorite Martian'' with $5.2 million at 2,349 sites and Universal's
second weekend of ``October Sky'' with $4.8 million at 1,700
locations.

REFORMERS APPEAR TO GAIN IN IRANIAN VOTING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN _ Dealing a blow to Iran's powerful and puritanical
hierarchy, millions of Iranians cast their votes for a movement
that calls for sweeping change toward a more open and pluralistic
society.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns Sunday night from the first local elections since
the Islamic Revolution two decades ago were counted inside a mosque
converted into election headquarters _ a symbolic setting for a
nation struggling to place democracy within the walls of state
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the votes were counted, the conservatives moved to
fight back, arresting Mahsan Kadivar, one of the most popular
reform candidates for Tehran's city council, on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The election represents a battle for the soul of Iran. The
rising popularity of new reformers, led by President Mohammed
Khatami, threatens the entrenched conservatives such as spiritual
leader Ayatollah Khamenei, constitutionally Khatami's superior.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have counted 40 percent of the votes but said results
would not be completed for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers crowed over their early showing, which indicates
pro-Khatami candidates leading in all 15 council seats in Tehran.
Results from at least 20 cities showed women candidates as
front-runners _ nearly all of them supporters of Khatami, who has
encouraged women to play a bigger role in political life.
</P>
<P>
   ``These elections show that the process of reform is now
irreversible. There is still a long way to go, but it can't be
turned back,'' said Ibrahim Yazdi, leader of the Freedom Movement
Party, who has been arrested several times for his reformist views.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid Jalaepour, editor of the independent Neshat newspaper,
said: ``In some ways, this election was more important than the
presidential election'' that brought Khatami to power in 1997 with
70 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not just for the ruling elite to get elected, but a
chance for new faces to emerge and for people to become invested in
the process,'' Jalaepour added.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the arrest of Kadivar was ``clearly politically
timed'' and an important sign that the conservatives recognized
that ``the ground is moving beneath their feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Early tallies from the Friday vote indicated that Kadivar was
among the highest vote-getters in the crucial Tehran council race.
The candidate learned of his showing from inside a jail cell.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials went to his home Saturday and reportedly
charged the cleric with undermining the religious authority of
Khamenei by speaking out against the decree that grants ``The
Leader'' overriding executive powers.
</P>
<P>
   As a leading thinker on democracy and Islam, Kadivar coined the
phrase ``theo-aristocracy'' to refer to the clerical hierarchy that
controls the military, key ministries, and huge sectors of the
economy. ``What we have is a theo-aristocracy, and what we need is
a theo-democracy,'' he said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most powerful symbol of the way in which Iran is
trying to forge a new democracy within the context of an Islamic
Republic was the election headquarters itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the Interior Ministry, a hulking bureaucratic office tower,
an old auditorium was converted into a mosque at the beginning of
the Islamic Revolution. Prayer rugs normally lie about the large,
open room. Government employees use the space for daily prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the space was filled with telephone banks for officials
to record the vote. A large electronic tallying board lit up as the
districts reported. An Iranian TV crew prepared a live shot.
</P>
<P>
   But because it is a mosque, none of the men working in the
US-style election center were wearing shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the room, Ahmad Shojaii busily scribbled results on forms
in a dizzying election that saw some 300,000 candidates vying for
200,000 seats on councils in towns, villages, and cities. There
were 4,000 candidates for the 15 seats in the Tehran council alone.
An estimated 25 million out of Iran's 30 million eligible voters
went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   For Shojaii and the other election workers the tallying was
daunting. Shojaii, 41, one of the young bearded student radicals
who took to the streets to topple the US-backed shah in 1979, still
has the beard, although now it has a touch of gray. He looked up
from the piles of election forms and frantically ringing phones and
said, ``Revolution is a lot more exciting than democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In an election spread out across Iran's vast desert plains and
fertile mountain valleys, government officials predicted that the
reformists would easily win two-thirds of the local council seats.
If this holds true, it will provide Khatami with much-needed
support for his effort to broaden culture socially and
economically. But the vote was also a reminder that voters who
elected him are growing impatient with the slow pace of change.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Parliament member Ahmed Nori, whose brother was the
failed challenger to Khatami in 1979, looked tired and defeated
after checking on the early returns.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the early results, saying that the candidates in
the rural areas such as his province near the Caspian Sea are
solidly behind Khamenei and the traditional conservatives who back
him. ``These are people who care about improving the efficiency of
government. They are thinking about sewer systems and bus lines,
not big ideas like democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Iranians were finding out in the last few days, democracy can
be messy. After tens of thousands of candidates nationwide had
plastered campaign posters and leaflets on every building, bus
stop, storefront, and light station they could find, the streets
were a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Armies of Tehran municipal workers fanned out across the capital
trying to scrape the posters off the walls and sweep up streets
littered with campaign refuse. The glue on the posters has made
them nearly impossible to strip away.
</P>
<P>
   One municipal worker, Navid Asghari, was trying to remove a line
of more than 50 consecutive posters of a female candidate in the
traditional black head covering. Ahead of them on the same wall
along a main street in downtown Tehran were hundreds more candidate
posters that would have to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' Asghari said, ``this is what you call democracy.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This should be the perfect time to be a woman in
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The days of women toiling as a mostly unwelcome presence in the
country's medical schools are long over: Women now account for
roughly 45 percent of all medical students, up from about 25
percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   And once they graduate, they are in high demand: Many patients,
especially women, now request female doctors because, among other
reasons, they are perceived as spending more time with patients.
Further, women's health issues _ breast and ovarian cancer most
prominently _ are front and center in medical research and
political agendas, fostering star-studded fund-raisers, road races
and the like in every major city in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these gains, the top tiers of medicine have remained
inaccessible to many women, largely, experts say, because they are
unwilling or unable to find a balance between the years of study
those specialties require and a life outside of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the picture is bad,'' said Dr. Wendy Chavkin,
editor of the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association.
``Women comprise very few dean and tenured faculty positions, and
there are a lack of them in surgical specialties.'' The main
reason, Dr. Chavkin, said, is that in medicine ``there are still
issues about career pathways that are the least bit off-track, like
taking time off for child rearing.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than giving up their medical careers for their
families, as so many of their predecessors felt forced to do, or
forgoing motherhood altogether, more women doctors today are
finding ways to practice medicine part-time _ as some women in law,
journalism, finance and other demanding fields have been doing for
years.
</P>
<P>
   They are forming practices with other women, or working as
employees for practices run by managed-care companies that give
them a chance for an office life that is closer to 9 to 5,
willingly sacrificing higher salaries for a flexibility that until
recently was virtually unheard of in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study, the Commonwealth Fund, a large private
philanthropic organization in New York, found that 25 percent of
female doctors who were surveyed said that they worked fewer than
40 hours a week, compared with 12 percent of male doctors. And 17
percent of female doctors said they worked 30 hours a week or
fewer, compared with only 8 percent of males.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, the trend of women working fewer hours is
borne out most dramatically among younger doctors. Overall, female
doctors work 9 percent fewer hours than male doctors. But among
female doctors under 45, the number jumps to 15 percent, said
Edward Salsberg, director of the Center for Health Workforce
Studies at the State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergence of managed care has introduced the idea that you
can be an employee,'' said Dr. Erica Frank, an assistant professor
at the Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta, and the principal
investigator of the Women Physicians' Health Study, the largest
national study of female doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can mean more flexible hours and fewer of them, and the
ability to think about medicine as a profession that doesn't
require complete consumption,'' Dr. Frank said. ``And clearly women
are leading the way. The pay is lower. But this might be acceptable
to some people to have more life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rayze Simonson works as an obstetrician in a six-person
practice on the Upper West Side. The practice is run by St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, which takes care of
administrative tasks like billings. That relieves the doctors, five
of whom are women with children, of some of the time-consuming
hassles of running a medical office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was that in a larger group you could balance more
your life and career,'' Dr. Simonson said. ``We are only on call
every sixth night and every sixth weekend, which in ob-gyn is huge
flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while this kind of work has become a welcome option for some
doctors looking for more balanced lives, experts say that is has
created a ``pink-collar'' level of medicine _ in which more women
are concentrated in the lowest-paying, least prestigious
specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the number of women practicing medicine has more
than tripled in the last 20 years, female doctors still earn
roughly two-thirds of their male counterparts' salaries, largely
because they work fewer hours a week and because there are far
fewer of them in the most prestigious and highest-paid specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34,882 female residents in the country in 1997, one-tenth
of 1 percent were in the surgical subspecialties. Or, looked at
another way, of all residents studying surgical specialties, only
17.2 percent of them were women.
</P>
<P>
   And while the average male doctor in private practice in the
United States makes $273,690 a year, his female counterpart makes
$155,590 on average, according to Medical Economics, a trade
journal. Further, 50 percent of female doctors surveyed by the
Commonwealth Fund reported incomes of $100,000 or less, compared
with 22 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   While health experts, including many women, said there was still
sexism in medicine, particularly in the top echelons of academia,
they cited the difficulty of combining a demanding profession with
a family life as the biggest hindrance most female doctors faced in
rising higher in their fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of male doctors still have housewives at home,''
said Dr. Simonson, who has four children, one of them a newborn.
``They can stay at work until 10 p.m., and when they get home,
their kids are bathed, and there is food in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't have the luxury of staying at work late,'' she
added.

</P>
<P>
   While women in other high-intensity fields face similar
challenges, medicine presents conflicts for women that appear more
intractable, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   There are years of study and grueling hospital training
programs, followed by demanding schedules and unpredictable
patients. And unlike, say, investment banking, there are constant
critical advances in medicine: stay out of the field for two years
to raise children, and one would miss out on entire bodies of
research and treatment developments vital to patients' health.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many women are attracted to pediatrics and primary
care ``simply because there is not as much training,'' said Dr.
Holly Andersen, a 36-year-old cardiologist in Manhattan, especially
since most of that training coincides with a woman's prime
child-bearing years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do men care about this?'' she said. ``They can always
marry 25-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gail Bauchman got her first taste of compromise in medical
school in the 1980s. Although her dream had been to specialize in
obstetrics, she felt that she would have a hard time managing a
family life while tending to patients in labor on weekends and in
the middle of the night. So she chose family medicine instead, and
built a bustling private practice on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   At 36, she decided to try to get pregnant. ``I realized it was
now or never,'' she said. But after giving birth to twins, Avital
and Natalia, in August 1997, compromises turned to disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to return to her full-time practice, but found life
unmanageable. So she looked for a part-time position. ``Most
practices said, `You work full-time or you don't work here,''' Dr.
Bauchman said.
</P>
<P>
   Her solution was to take a part-time job at the Mount Sinai
Adolescent Health Center, for a fraction of her earnings as a
private practice doctor. She said the situation works for her, but
was hardly what she had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this problem with finding the middle ground,'' Dr.
Bauchman said. ``I shouldn't be struggling to find part-time work.
And if these practices close their doors to part-timers, they don't
have the benefit of having a female doctor, and therefore you lose
patients, because patients say that they want that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even while they are earning less on average, female physicians
are more in demand than ever, experts say, particularly in
specialties that cater to female patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alison Estabrook, a prominent breast surgeon and associate
director of the breast center at St. Luke's, remembers sitting
around her family's kitchen table just a decade ago, listening to
her mother's friend say that she would never let a female surgeon
touch her.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a female breast surgeon can ``basically write her own
ticket,'' Dr. Estabrook said. ``As more women patients are seeking
power in their own care they are attracted to strong women
doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Estabrook concedes that part of the market value of female
surgeons is based on supply and demand, because far fewer women
than men are willing to devote their lives to surgery. ``Surgery
creates tremendous conflicts,'' said Dr. Estabrook, 47, who is
married to another doctor. She deliberately chose not have
children, she says, because she could not imagine where she could
trim her professional day.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital administrators say that the demand for female doctors
is not limited to specialties that serve women. ``The minute we put
a female physician in a practice,'' said Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt,
chairman of medicine at New York Presbyterian Hospital, ``the
appointment book becomes fully booked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not only women who appreciate these physicians,'' Dr.
Weisfeldt added. ``I think it deals with professional attitudes.''
He said that studies have shown women tend to spend more time with
patients and to focus on them as people rather than on the
procedures they need.
</P>
<P>
   Some women find that when they become mothers, they need to
scale back or forgo jobs with prestigious academic medical centers,
and instead choose work in large practices, often ones that serve a
high HMO base.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Genevieve Lambert worked for eight years at the
Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, mostly in the Pediatric HIV unit.
After giving birth to each of her two children, she cut back one
work day. As she awaits her third, she has bagged her career at the
hospital altogether to loosen her schedule and has joined a private
practice on Long Island where she works two and a half days a week
and is paid per-diem.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least half of my female friends from medical school are
working part-time now,'' said Dr. Lambert, 41. The women, she said,
are generally not doing this willingly, but because society as a
whole still makes child-rearing primarily a mother's
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine is fairly egalitarian in that a woman who chooses to
rise to the top of medicine can do so now,'' she said. ``The issues
of how to bring women to parity with men in the workplace is
finding ways to relieve women as primary care givers to children.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andersen, who was chief medical resident at Cornell in
1994-95 and is now one of only a handful of female cardiologists in
Manhattan, said that she is beginning to appreciate the conflicts
she will face if she chooses to have a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a woman in medicine there are not that many paradigms we
can look to and say `This is how they did it this is the way I can
do it too,' '' said Dr. Andersen. ``You have to work on it
yourself.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, an
uncompromising conservative who heads a national group called the
Traditional Values Coalition, has built his career on denouncing
homosexuals. But Sheldon may back a prospect for the Republican
presidential nomination whose oratory on the subject has been
decidedly tame: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pragmatic,'' said Sheldon, who has never been known as
pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   April Boling, an accountant who is active in California's
Republican Party, said the issue most important to her is support
for abortion rights, but that she too favored Bush, even though he
is against abortion. ``I'm not as uncomfortable with his politics
as some of the others,'' she said. ``And his father used to be pro
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon and Ms. Boling, both of whom attended the California
Republican Party's winter convention that closed here Sunday,
represent opposite, often antagonistic, wings of their party.
</P>
<P>
   But their support of Bush underscores an extraordinary turn in
Republican politics: an early, and colossal, outpouring of
Republicans of all stripes who have set aside their ideological
convictions to support a governor who has yet to formally announce
his intentions _ and who is untested and largely unknown on the
national stage.
</P>
<P>
   From Capitol Hill to state legislatures, Republicans around the
country have declared their support for Bush in what has become an
almost daily drumbeat of endorsements that has been encouraged _
but not always choreographed _ by the governors' advisers. On
Friday, for example, more than half of the nation's 31 Republican
governors professed their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, George Bush, did not enjoy such vast support at
this point when he ran for president in 1988 _ and as vice
president, he was the heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   But here at the state party convention, there were several
telling demonstrations of Bush's immense popularity. While seven
presidential contenders traveled to California to make their case
to hundreds of partisans, Bush kept to his past practice and stayed
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in dozens of random interviews, rank-and-file
delegates, political professionals and state legislators said they
intended to back Bush. Though many said they had never even heard
him speak in person, they spoke as if Bush's nomination was
inevitable. Twenty-six state legislators in California have signed
a petition urging Bush to run.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy has left Bush's rivals stunned, envious and, in some
cases, deeply dispirited and feeling shut out of the competition a
year before the actual voting begins. Already, it has transformed
the presidential nomination battle into a contest not of who is the
best candidate but who would be the best second choice.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle found himself being quizzed on
national television this morning about what he had to offer that
Bush did not. And privately, advisers to some candidates said their
best hope was that Bush would succumb to an as-yet-unknown scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee has been trudging
through Iowa and New Hampshire seeking the nomination for years but
has only been endorsed by two governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking about all the governors who came up to me
after the nomination last time and said, `If we had supported you,
we might have won the election,''' Alexander lamented in an
interview. He contrasted his years of experience with Bush, whom he
described as ``off to a promising beginning,'' adding that ``the
last fresh face the party nominated was Dwight D. Eisenhower.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate who is also running for the
second time, likened the commotion to the case of Colin Powell, who
ultimately decided not to seek the Republican nomination in 1996.
``Part of it is being able to project on to somebody anything you
want,'' he said in an interview. ``You saw it with the Powell
phenomenon. You saw it back in '72 with Muskie before he hit the
campaign trail. So I think you can watch it with wry amusement.''
</P>
<P>
   Short-lived or not, many Republican politicians here and around
the country said they had never seen such early rallying, and that
it was all the more stunning because Bush was not an heir apparent
like a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in interviews why they were so enthusiastic, most
Republicans cited pragmatic concerns, namely polls showing that
Bush, overwhelmingly, is the early favorite for the nomination and
could beat Vice President Al Gore in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   These supporters say they are so starved to regain the White
House that they concede that they do know too many details of
Bush's stewardship _ and do not particularly care. Ms. Boling, for
instance, said she did not know the extent of Bush's opposition to
abortion, but was confident that ``at least he has not taken a
position that's so offensive that it's unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives and moderates alike seem to have convinced
themselves that Bush shares their views. Bruce Thompson, a
three-term California assemblyman who describes himself as one of
the most conservative legislators in the state, said, ``Listen,
this is the next Ronald Reagan _ there's no question in my mind.
The main thing is the guy can win. We're a party out there just
floating around.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has never met Bush, and never heard him speak _ except
on television. Yet that did not stop him from establishing a group
that printed and distributed thousands of ``Bush 2000'' placards
and lapel stickers at the convention here. He spent all weekend at
a booth where he showed delegates the Bush web site he created, and
a homemade videotape of assorted Bush television appearances.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Thompson and four other legislators staged a rally
at a pizza parlor in Sacramento to express their devotion. Rather
than attend a lunch featuring Forbes, about 200 delegates wandered
to the pizza party, where participants chanted, ``Bush 2K! Bush 2K!
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only game in town,'' Allan Hoffenblum, a longtime
Republican analyst based in Los Angeles, said as he scanned the
crowd at the pizza rally. ``We're so desperate for a candidate who
gets more than 38 percent of the vote statewide.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other contender who was popular at this gathering, and
at similar Republican events around country, was Elizabeth Dole,
who, like Bush, was a no show.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Alcox, who sells T-shirts and buttons at Republican
events around the country, said his homemade Bush and Dole
paraphernalia are by far the best sellers. ``Bush and Dole are
always neck-and-neck everywhere I go,'' said Alcox. ``The rest? You
can forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whom she would support for president, Cheryl Brandwood, a
53-year-old delegate here, said with certainty, ``George Bush and
Elizabeth Dole will be the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Schroeder, the outgoing chairman of the California
Republican Party, warned that there are dangers in people pinning
all their hopes on one candidate. He noted that Bush may have
difficulty meeting the now astronomical expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way too early to say the race is in the hands of one
person unless he makes a mistake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides frustration among the other candidates, the ardor for
Bush, who was elected two a second term last year by a huge margin,
has caused bruised feelings. Alexander was taken aback when Gov.
John M. Engler of Michigan recently said that Bush would make a
more appealing candidate because ``you've got a governor of the
'70s versus the governor of the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows better than that,'' said Alexander who was governor
of Tennessee from 1979 to 1987. ``I can remember very well when an
attractive young state senator named John Engler in 1983 came to
Nashville and spent 30 minutes with me asking what it would take to
make a good governor.''

   CRACK-LEGACY-II (Alburquerque, N.M.) _ Special Weapons and
Tactics squads, once used exclusively for the rare urban terrorist
incident or shootout, have transformed themselves through the crack
years into everyday parts of city life. In big urban areas,
paramilitary units now do everything from routine street patrols to
nightly house raids. Even small towns have formed paramilitary
police units. The Cape Cod town of Harwich, Mass., for example,
population 11,000, has trained a 10-man SWAT team. Encouraged by
federal grants, surplus equipment handed out by the military, and
seizure laws that allow police departments to keep much of what
their special units take in raids, the special units have grown
dramatically, even in the face of plummeting crime figures. (Second

pushed out last week and had to tune in from a friend's place and
watch his fill-in smile and thank him for his five years of

``So long,'' get a panel of four Pulitzer Prize winners talking
about the nature of punditry, the argument culture and the ``TV

NEDVED SCORES HAT TRICK AS RANGERS TRIP UP FLYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Rangers were in need of a stand-in,
someone capable of being great until the Great One's neck mends.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers coach John Muckler turned to Petr Nedved on Friday,
imploring the slumping center to raise his game, to keep the team's
hopes alive through what figures to be the season's toughest
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved answered with three goals and one assist Sunday as the
Rangers defeated the reeling Philadelphia Flyers, 6-5, in an
afternoon thriller at Madison Square Garden. Adam Graves scored
twice and Mike Richter made 21 saves as the Rangers won their
second straight and improved their record over the past five games
to 4-1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of carrying the Rangers (25-28-7) had become too much
for Wayne Gretzky, their leading scorer this season with 57 points.
He will be out for at least two weeks with a bulging disk in his
neck.
</P>
<P>
   That weight now rests on Nedved's slender shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Nedved do, in his biggest challenge since joining
the Rangers last November? He responded against the big, bad Flyers
with a convincing effort, his best of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just Nedved, Graves and Richter. Defensemen Brian
Leetch and Ulf Samuelsson and rookie forward Manny Malhotra were
superb as well.
</P>
<P>
   The match might have been the Rangers' most riveting performance
on Broadway this season. For a welcome change, there was never a
dull moment. Especially not with Nedved playing the lead role.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took a 5-2 lead in the second period, then were in
danger of blowing the game late in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers who were getting the bulk of the scoring chances,
tied the score at 5-5 and came close to scoring the go-ahead goal a
few times. The crowd was getting antsy.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Nedved took command, the way Gretzky has done so
many times.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied and the clock showing less than eight
minutes remaining, Nedved streaked down the left side boards after
the puck. Eric Desjardins swiped at the lanky center with his
stick, and he appeared to catch Nedved's skate, sending Nedved
tumbling to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers' coach complained afterward that Nedved took a dive.
But no matter, the Rangers, who had scored three goals with the man
advantage, were given the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved did not allow the opportunity to pass. The Rangers set up
shop in the Flyers' zone, and seconds later, Nedved snapped a
one-timer past goalie John Vanbiesbrouck at 13 minutes 32 seconds
for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously going to have more responsibilities,'' Nedved
said of his talk with Muckler before Friday's victory over the
Phoenix Coyotes. ``And I'm going to have to step up and be the
go-to guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Desjardins's tripping penalty, Flyers coach Roger Neilson
said: ``Well, the last one was a real dive by Nedved, which I don't
blame him for at all. He won the game with it. But you hate to lose
a game on calls like that, especially in the third period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' victory moved them past idle Montreal and into 10th
place in the East, three points behind Boston and Florida for the
conference's eighth and final playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Flyers from second place to fourth. The
Flyers are 2-7-2 in their last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved not only carried the Rangers' offense but was also
assigned to mark the Flyers' best player, Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros scored a goal and assisted on John LeClair's goal, but
considering that Lindros and LeClair are the scoring leaders in the
NHL, it wasn't a shabby defensive showing for Nedved and his
linemates, Graves and John MacLean.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers led the Flyers by 5-3 entering the third period, but
Philadelphia scored twice to tie the game. The first goal was
notched by LeClair at 1:21, the second by Mikael Renberg at 8:41.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing with more energy than we have been,'' said
Samuelsson, who assisted on Nedved's first goal. ``We realize that
our backs are against the wall and there's no time to waste.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers matched the Flyers' energy in the opening 20 minutes
and escaped the period tied at 2-2. Lindros and Keith Jones scored
for Philadelphia, and Graves and Nedved scored for the Rangers.
Graves' goal came on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long day for Vanbiesbrouck, who faced 26 shots. He
didn't look good on either of the Rangers' first-period goals.
</P>
<P>
   On Graves' first goal, Vanbiesbrouck skated out of his crease to
clear the puck, but his pass hit Graves on the hip and the puck
rolled into the net at 8:16. Nedved scored his first goal on a
wrist shot that sailed over Vanbiesbrouck's glove.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, Scott Fraser scored his first goal of the
season to stretch the Rangers' lead to 3-2 at 3:57. Nedved's second
goal of the game gave the Rangers a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more players than just Petr stepped up,'' Muckler
said. ``That was a real exciting hockey game. That was tough
hockey. We stood up to the challenge.'' &QL;

   (NYT17) NEW YORK -- Feb. 28, 1999 -- PODHORETZ-CONNECTIONS, 2-28
-- Norman Podhoretz, who edited Commentary magazine for 35 years.
Podhoretz's writings from the late 1950s embodied opposing trends
in themselves. His first book of literary criticism, ``Doings and
Undoings,'' contains traces of radicalism as well as conservatism.
In his new memoir, ``Ex-Friends'' (Free Press), so hotly contested
is he as a political and intellectual figure that simply the
declaration of friendship or ex-friendship with him has tended to
be viewed in some circles as a declaration of war. (Jack

paradigms we can look to and say 'This is how they did it this is

for her family. Bauchman, who built a bustling private practice in
New York, decided to take a part-time job at the Mount Sinai
Adolescent Health Center, for a fraction of her earnings as a
private practice doctor. The situation works for her, but was
hardly what she had hoped for. ``There is this problem with finding
the middle ground,'' says Dr. Bauchman. (Nancy Siesel/New York

the former Philadelphia Phillies infielder Larry Bowa, is able to
replace Tino Martinez, the Yankees current first baseman, the
Yankees could pay him a total of $1 million to $2 million over his

might cost $6 million or $7 million a year once his contract
expires after the 2000 season. (Barton Silverman/New York Times

cocaine was starting to appear all over the United States. With a
population of 57,000, Meriden does not fit the image of an urban
crime nightmare, but still maintains the paramilitary unit, which
now has 29 members who are used nearly full time. In Meriden, as in

attacking small crimes as a way to send a larger message about who
is in control. (Keith Meyers/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT17) NEW YORK -- Feb. 28, 1999 -- PODHORETZ-CONNECTIONS, 2-28
-- Norman Podhoretz, who edited Commentary magazine for 35 years.
Podhoretz's writings from the late 1950s embodied opposing trends
in themselves. His first book of literary criticism, ``Doings and
Undoings,'' contains traces of radicalism as well as conservatism.
In his new memoir, ``Ex-Friends'' (Free Press), so hotly contested
is he as a political and intellectual figure that simply the
declaration of friendship or ex-friendship with him has tended to
be viewed in some circles as a declaration of war. (Jack

New York, decided to take a part-time job at the Mount Sinai
Adolescent Health Center, for a fraction of her earnings as a

hardly what she had hoped for. ``There is this problem with finding

Yankees could pay him a total of $1 million to $2 million over his

crime nightmare, but still maintains the paramilitary unit, which
now has 29 members who are used nearly full time. In Meriden, as in

2-27 -- Joseph D'Angeli in his basement compound which contains a
dozen fruit bats from Egypt and Indonesia, with wingspans of up to
five feet. For D'Angeli, bats are not so much his pets as his
passion. All his neighbors know about the unusual creatures in his
basement, as do hordes of schoolchildren to whom he gives lectures
and audiences at the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City.

   (NYT17) NEW YORK -- Feb. 28, 1999 -- PODHORETZ-CONNECTIONS, 2-28
-- Norman Podhoretz, who edited Commentary magazine for 35 years.
Podhoretz's writings from the late 1950s embodied opposing trends
in themselves. His first book of literary criticism, ``Doings and
Undoings,'' contains traces of radicalism as well as conservatism.
In his new memoir, ``Ex-Friends'' (Free Press), so hotly contested
is he as a political and intellectual figure that simply the
declaration of friendship or ex-friendship with him has tended to
be viewed in some circles as a declaration of war. (Jack

   (NYT16) NEW YORK -- Fe. 28, 1999 -- WOMEN-DOCTORS-2, 2-28 -- Dr.
Holly Andersen, 36, one of only a handful of female cardiologists
in Manhattan, examining a patient in her office. Dr. Andersen says
she realizes the conflicts she will have if she decides to have a
family. ``Being a woman in medicine there are not that many
paradigms we can look to and say 'This is how they did it this is
the way I can do it too,''' says Dr. Andersen. ``You have to work
on it yourself.'' (Nancy Siesel/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT15) NEW YORK -- Fe. 28, 1999 -- WOMEN-DOCTORS-1, 2-28 -- Dr.
Gail Bauchman with her 19-month-old twin daughters, Avital,
sitting, and Natalia, found she had to cut her work hours to care
for her family. Bauchman, who built a bustling private practice in
New York, decided to take a part-time job at the Mount Sinai
Adolescent Health Center, for a fraction of her earnings as a
private practice doctor. The situation works for her, but was
hardly what she had hoped for. ``There is this problem with finding
the middle ground,'' says Dr. Bauchman. (Nancy Siesel/New York

2-28 -- Nick Johnson, a 20-year-old first baseman, is one of the
New York Yankees top prospects this year. If Johnson, a nephew of
the former Philadelphia Phillies infielder Larry Bowa, is able to
replace Tino Martinez, the Yankees current first baseman, the
Yankees could pay him a total of $1 million to $2 million over his
first three seasons. Keeping Tino Martinez, on the other hand,
might cost $6 million or $7 million a year once his contract
expires after the 2000 season. (Barton Silverman/New York Times

Nigerians waited their turn to vote at a polling station in the
Idi-Araba community, which is comprised mostly of muslims from the
north. Most Nigerians in the area are supporters of presidential
candidate General Olusegun Obasanjo, who was released just eight
months ago after serving three years in prison for criticizing the
military rule. Obasanjo on Sunday appeared to have won an
overwhelming victory in the first presidential election in the
country in 16 years. (Ozier Muhammad/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT12) MERIDEN, Conn. -- Feb. 28, 1999 -- CRACK-LEGACY-II-3,
2-28 -- Meriden, Conn., formed a SWAT team in 1986, when crack
cocaine was starting to appear all over the United States. With a
population of 57,000, Meriden does not fit the image of an urban
crime nightmare, but still maintains the paramilitary unit, which
now has 29 members who are used nearly full time. In Meriden, as in
other cities, the SWAT teams arrest people for minor offenses,
attacking small crimes as a way to send a larger message about who
is in control. (Keith Meyers/New York Times Photo)

Dog Pound where drug dealing is concentrated, detain a man for
driving a car with a broken taillight. Special Weapons and Tactics
squads, once used exclusively for the rare urban terrorist incident
or shootout have transformed themselves through the crack years in
the United States, and now do everything from routine street

the state, mans a George W. Bush campaign booth at the California

Wilbert Rideau, 57, watching other inmates on farm detail at the
Louisiana State Penitentiary, has entered the 38th year of a life
sentence for one of the most vicious murders ever committed in
Louisiana. As a journalist and editor, Rideau has been honored with
some of the profession's most coveted prizes. Now having branched

   (NYT7) RAVA-RUSKAYA, Ukraine -- Feb. 28, 1999 -- UKRAINE-POLAND,
2-28 -- A road leading from the Polish border into Ukraine is one
of the main arteries of the ``shuttle trade'' in goods from Poland,
many smuggled illegally. Goods are cheaper in Poland and can be
resold to Ukrainians at a huge profit. They are especially cheap if
nobody pays the sky-high duties that the Ukrainian government has
imposed on many goods to protect domestic competitors. (James

   (NYT6) WASHINGTON -- Feb. 28, 1999 -- TV-BODE-MEDIA, 2-28 -- Ken
Bode, 59, dean of the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern
University in Evanston, Ill. Bode was recently forced out of his
public television job as host of ``Washington Week in Review,''
after clashing with a new boss who thought the show's quiet
discussions needed a little more edge and attitude. ``I don't make
Tom Friedman come on and say what he thinks about Clinton's
morals!'' says Bode of the New York Times columnist. ``If he talks
about the Asian economy, and it's too dull, OK.'' (Stephen

2-28 -- John Shagoury, Dragon Systems' president, and Janet Baker,
a co-founder and chief, also standing, watching use of
speech-recognition software. Dragon says it is poised to exploit
the trend toward smaller, lighter computerized devices. A laptop
equipped with voice-recognition software doesn't need a large,
comfortable keyboard. And if the speech technology is good enough,
it doesn't need a keyboard at all. (Ed Quinn/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT4) TAMPA, Fla. -- Feb. 28, 1999 -- BBA-YANKS-RIVERA, 2-28 --
The New York Yankees' Mariano Rivera, one of the most dominant
relief pitchers in the American League. Rivera's fastball --
typically in the range of 93 to 96 mph -- used to be as straight as
a city street; now it possesses more turns and bends than a
mountain highway. ``It all depends on how you grip the baseball,''
says Rivera. (Barton Silverman/New York Times Photo)

After enrolling in managed care, Milagros Lebron visits Dr. James
Sayegh in his Yonkers, N.Y., office. For a variety of reasons --
fears of consumer backlash, legislative intervention or large jury

SUNS SHUT DOWN WARRIORS IN FOURTH QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Amid all the plays in a scouting report scribbled on a
message board in the Suns clubhouse, one word was added in large,
red letters _ and underlined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Suns lack it, they're a very ordinary NBA team, as they
were while the Golden State Warriors embarrassed them for most of
three quarters Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When they have it, the Suns can look as they did in a dominating
fourth quarter that propelled them past the Warriors, 102-89, at
America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, I thought it was two completely different games by
the same team,'' said Suns Coach Danny Ainge, meaning his
schizophrenic bunch. ``It's been our trend. It's a little bit
frustrating, and it's going to be harmful when we start playing
better teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by reserve forwards Clifford Robinson and Danny Manning, the
Suns bailed themselves out with a fourth-quarter defensive
performance for the record books:
</P>
<P>
   They limited the Warriors to two field goals in 21 attempts
during the fourth quarter, the last coming with 3.5 seconds to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The six Golden State points equaled the fewest points scored
during a fourth quarter in the history of the NBA. Detroit scored
six points in a fourth quarter against Orlando in December of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was Golden State's all-time low, and it set a
Phoenix franchise record for fewest points allowed in any quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even realize they had only six points,'' said
Robinson, who scored 20 points _ eight in the fourth quarter _
blocked three shots and grabbed seven rebounds. ``We were just out
there enjoying the fact we were stopping them, having fun playing
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning wound up with seven points and six rebounds, but he was
a fourth-quarter catalyst, along with point guard Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors are a difficult matchup for the Suns, as they
demonstrated two nights earlier in Oakland, when they outrebounded
the Suns by 11 and won, 94-90.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's game was following a similar pattern. The young,
bigger Warriors were shooting over 50 percent late in the third
quarter and were again dominating the boards. When the Warriors did
miss, they often got the basket anyway after an offensive rebound.
They had a 15-6 advantage in second-chance points going to the
fourth, and both of those field goals in the final quarter came as
the result of offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that's the strength of their team,'' Ainge said.
``They're bigger, stronger and quicker. I think the skill of our
big players is better. But when we match their youthful energy and
enthusiasm, we're a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen until late in the third quarter. The Warriors
scored just one basket in the final four minutes of the third
quarter, thus getting only eight points over a span of 16 minutes
during which the Suns went from 13 points behind to a runaway
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did something that was uncharacteristic of this team the
last seven or eight games,'' said Warriors veteran forward Terry
Cummings. ``We lost our composure. Some of the calls, some of the
plays, didn't go our way. We took a lot of shots that were totally
out of the context of what we normally do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of get everybody wandering away form it. I've seen it
before. You can see it coming. You have to slow the game down to
almost a crawl and execute your offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Suns limited the Warriors to one shot and got their
running game going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot energy,'' Ainge said. ``I've been in the NBA a long
time, and there's no way on earth a team could play like we did for
48 minutes. That was gear five in the fourth quarter. But we at
least have to be in gear four or three. We're going from gear one
to gear five.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have a nasty habit of falling far behind before they
drop it into overdrive. Sunday's game was the seventh in their last
eight in which they've faced a double-digit deficit. They've
comeback to win four times after trailing by 14 or more.
</P>
<P>
   They did it again, yielding 53 percent first-half shooting to
the Warriors and falling behind by as much as 15 in the third
quarter, playing what Ainge called ``atrocious'' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if our (fourth-quarter) defense was tremendous,
or if it was so bad the rest of the game that it looked
tremendous,'' said forward Tom Gugliotta, who scored 12 of his 20
points in the first quarter. ``We gave them one shot, and it was a
shot (where) we had a hand in their face. We rebounded the ball,
and it kind of ignited our break, allowed us to get into transition
for easy baskets.''

D-BACKS PITCHER KILLED  
 KEN ROBINSON DIES IN ROLLOVER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TUCSON _ One life ended. Others shattered. And in between, a
baseball organization trying to sift through the pieces of its
first _ and what it hopes will be its last _ human tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Robinson, 29, a minor-league pitcher for the Diamondbacks
who was here on a rehabilitation assignment, was killed early
Sunday morning in a one-vehicle rollover on the city's northwest
side.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Diamondbacks
minor-league pitcher John Rosengren, who also was here on
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tucson police Officer Mike Brown, &UR; Rosengren, 26,
was booked into the Pima County Jail on one count of second degree
murder after he ``displayed signs and symptoms of impairment'' from
the use of alcohol. A blood sample was obtained from Rosengren; the
results will not be available for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren made his initial appearance in Tucson City Court via
video Sunday afternoon. In addition to his attorney, Tommy Jones,
the Diamondbacks director of minor-league operations was at court.
Bond was set at $75,000 and was expected to be posted late Sunday
night or early today. Rosengren's parents were flying to Arizona
from their home in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   If released, Rosengren would be prohibited by the court from
leaving Pima County and from getting behind the wheel of a vehicle.
His next court appearance will be March 10 at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Officials from the Pima County Attorney's Office could not be
reached for comment about the second degree murder charge. Bill
FitzGerald, a spokesman with the Maricopa County Attorney's Office,
said manslaughter was the typical charge in such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, 90 percent of the charges filed are for
manslaughter,'' FitzGerald said. ``We would have to look at the
aggravating circumstances, though, to determine that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson leaves behind a wife, Lorrie, and a 1-year-old son,
Chase. The family lives in Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone Sunday, Diamondbacks managing general
partner Jerry Colangelo said the team was trying to put all the
pieces together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're devastated by the fact that the accident even took place
and that the young man lost his life,'' Colangelo said. ``It's a
big blow to lose someone in your organization, and more important
to his wife and child.''
</P>
<P>
   Roland Hemond, the Diamondbacks senior vice president of
baseball operations, spoke with Lorrie Robinson on behalf of the
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts and prayers go out to the family,'' Hemond said.
``This is not an easy time for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter notified the players before their Sunday
morning workout at Tucson Electric Park. Some had already heard
bits and pieces of the news, but Showalter said, ``I wanted them to
hear the truth from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care that it's a baseball team. This is just a tragedy
every way you look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said that the players would be contributing to a fund
set up for Robinson's family and that the organization would do
likewise.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brown, Rosengren and Robinson were heading south on
Silverbell Road shortly after 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle left the east side of Silverbell near Goret Road.
Upon returning to the road, Rosengren apparently lost control, and
the vehicle rolled. Police officers responded at 1:36 a.m.,
paramedics four minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had severe head trauma, Brown said, and he was
pronounced dead at the scene. He added that neither Robinson nor
Rosengren was wearing a seat belt. Rosengren was not seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was somber in the Diamondbacks' clubhouse during the
break between workouts for veteran players and those for the
younger prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The player perhaps most affected was pitcher Aaron Small, a
teammate of Robinson's with the Toronto Blue Jays' Triple-A
Syracuse affiliate in 1994 and briefly in 1995, and in the winter
instructional league.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just went about his business. He was a hard worker,'' Small
said. ``This is a wake-up call that reminds us that there are more
important things out there than baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Small and many of his teammates had just completed a weekly
chapel meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about life and how fragile it is. We said a prayer
for the family,'' Small said. ``I was just joking with him the
other day from across the field. You're never promised tomorrow. It
tells you that in the Good Book.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was claimed off waivers from Toronto on Feb. 17, 1998,
on the advice of Diamondbacks pitching coach Mark Connor, who had
coached both Robinson and Small in the Toronto organization.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after coming to Arizona, Robinson was placed on the
40-man roster, but he never pitched in a game after injuring his
shoulder. He came to Tucson for rehabilitation after surgery and
pitched in one game (two innings) for the Arizona Rookie League
team.
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren, a left-hander, pitched for the Detroit Tigers'
Triple-A Toledo affiliate in 1997, then he was released. He signed
with Arizona as a minor-league free agent and was then released
after injuring his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He signed again with Arizona in October after having surgery,
and he joined Robinson in Tucson a few days before the accident.
Minor-league pitchers and catchers not on rehabilitation are due to
report here March 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both those guys were here working hard about four or five
hours every day,'' said Mike Lopriore, the organization's
rehabilitation coordinator and supervisor of minor-league trainers.
``It's a sad, sad thing. I remember Kenny from last summer. He
wanted to get back to the major leagues. He wanted to be
successful. He was a real bulldog.''

GORE SAYS U.S. WILL BE READY FOR Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore on Sunday predicted the
government will deal successfully with any Year 2000 computer
glitches before the new milennium, and that the United States won't
allow problems with Soviet and Chinese missile computers to
endanger American security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. government is going to be ready for Y2K and we hope
to have a full-up test of our readiness early this year,'' Gore
said here.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview, Gore also indicated the Clinton
administration will work to keep a rescue tug stationed at Neah Bay
at the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca on Washington state's
northwesternmost tip.
</P>
<P>
   He said the White House soon will appoint a special envoy in a
renewed effort to resolve the long-running U.S.-Canada salmon
dispute _ a key component in saving and restoring Northwest salmon
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has the inside track on the 2000 Democratic
presidential nomination, also campaigned for the White House's
proposed budget Sunday, saying it includes $156 million in mass
transit grants for Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, international observers have voiced concern
about what would happen to mainframe computers of the Russian and
Chinese missile systems. The threatened Y2K glitch is the
computers' inability to differentiate between the years 1900 and
2000. If not fixed, computers could malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has dealt extensively with the republics of the former
Soviet Union on nuclear weapons issues, said, ``We feel, and the
Defense Department feels, that problem is not going to be a
problem. Of course, it can't be a problem. We won't allow it to be
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that it is going to be solved, but we're going
to be doubly, triply and quadrupally confident that it's going to
be solved before September of this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The contining saga of the grounded, broken hulk of the cargo
ship New Carissa off Coos Bay, Ore., has focused renewed attention
on marine safety in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Oil-laden tankers
pass unescorted through the outer 70 miles of the strait.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., has succeeded in having a rescue tug
stationed at at Neah Bay for 60 days as an experiment in rapid
response to potential marine accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is intended as a trial, I don't know of any reason to
expect it will not be successful,'' said Gore. ``We will evaluate
the results of this trial and we will move forward. Especially
after what happened down in Coos Bay, everyone has freshly in mind
the need for extra precautions with some of these tankers.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Canada have argued for more than five
years over terms for renewing the Pacific Salmon Treaty. The two
countries have been unable to agree on how many salmon their
fishermen will be allowed to catch in the north Pacific. The salmon
spawn in rivers of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a conservation initiative by the Canadian
government allowed increased numbers of coho and chinook salmon to
escape into rivers of northern Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   But an agreement on conservation-based management of the catch
at sea is seen as vital if efforts to preserve and restore salmon
spawning streams are to have any long-term success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're deeply involved in it: We're making
progress,'' Gore said of the lengthy impasse with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a window of opportunity in which to bring together
the four states involved, along with British Columbia and the
government of Canada,'' he added. ``We are now accelerating the
progress and intend to name a special representative from the White
House to personally oversee the negotiating progress.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not say when the envoy would be named.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in Seattle for a meeting on the Clinton
administration's ``Livability Agenda,'' a program to help local
governments cope with urban growth.
</P>
<P>
   In its budget for the fiscal year 2000, the administration has
proposed spending more than $8 billion for public transit and
transportation planning.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was campaigning for the budget Sunday, saying it will
include $156 million worth of mass transit grants for Washington
state _ money that would be spent along lines determined by local
government.
</P>
<P>
   A ``listening session'' with Puget Sound governmental leaders
and citizens turned into an effusive exchange of praise between
Gore and his hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What your initiative is, is exactly what this region is
about,'' said Snohomish County Executive Bob Drewel, who is
struggling with the conflicting issues of growth and open space in
a county whose population has soared to more than a half-million
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Gore stressed local control as a key aspect of the Clinton
administration's initiatives on transportation and open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm proposing is not that the federal government do
this,'' he argued. ``The federal government shouldn't be a beauty
commissar. The federal government is here to help you with local
initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its proposed budget, has has asked Congress
to approve creation of so-called Better American Bonds, $9.5
billion worth of interest-free, locally approved bonds designed to
save open space, improve water quality and create parks.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was upbeat on another front.
</P>
<P>
   At age 50, Al Gore is about to become a grandfather. His eldest
daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff and her husband, Drew Schiff, are
expecting their first child in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm loving it. I'm very excited, really looking forward to
it,'' he said.

AMATO ATONES FOR OPENER WITH TOP FUEL VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHANDLER, Ariz. - No more bad dreams and restless nights.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Amato on Sunday exorcised the demons of three weeks ago,
when in a stunning display of mediocrity, he failed to qualify for
the National Hot Rod Association season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Amato erased the nightmare with four wonderfully timed runs in
the Checker Schuck's Kragen Nationals at Firebird International
Raceway Park, capturing the Top Fuel title over runner-up Kenny
Bernstein with a 4.565-second pass at 320.66 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``After (the season opener at Pomona, Calif.), the morale was
real low,'' said Amato, the only driver to win five Top Fuel
championships. ``We were pulling our hair out. Then, you start
thinking it's going to be a terrible year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some changes; changed everything. Now we're back in
the hunt. This proves hard work pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   What John Force proved in the Funny Car finals was that he could
overcome both the flu and Cruz Pedregon. Saving his best for last,
Force set track records for elapsed time (4.843 seconds) and speed
(317.87 mph) in besting Pedregon (5.095 seconds), who smoked the
tires at half track and was forced off the throttle.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Johnson (6.970, 197.97) also had a date with a trophy,
beating Jeg Coughlin in the Pro Stock final.
</P>
<P>
   But no driver had more to smile about than Amato, who has failed
to qualify only twice in 15 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made runs of 4.60 (seconds) or better four times,'' Amato
said. ``I'm tickled pink. I knew (Bernstein) would be tough. I was
waiting for him to put a number down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein did his best to oblige Amato, unleashing a respectable
4.649-second pass.
</P>
<P>
   On some days, it might have been enough. But not this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got outdistanced,'' said Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   NHRA officials announced a record four-day crowd of 81,700, most
of whom attended the final day and watched Tony Schumacher upstage
the three champions.
</P>
<P>
   In a first-round win over David Grubnic, Schumacher recorded the
fastest pass in NHRA history, crossing the quarter-mile finish line
at a mesmerizing speed of 330.23, nearly 4 mph faster than what
record-holder Gary Scelzi (326.44) ran five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But to become an official record, Schumacher needed to post a
subsequent pass within one percent of it, meaning he needed to
reach 326.93 mph. He didn't, but it still was a ride for for the
ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome,'' said Schumacher, who did set a track elapsed time
record during the run with a 4.540-second blast. ``I was stuck to
my seat like Velcro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 1,000 feet, I knew I was on a (good) run. But when I
didn't hear anything on my (headset), I thought it was just a
routine run.''
</P>
<P>
   Routine?
</P>
<P>
   Hah.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason for the radio silence was a wire became
disconnected after Schumacher deployed the parachutes needed to
stop his 6,000-horsepower machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw all the (television) cameras coming at me, I knew
something must have happened,'' Schumacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Something did. Something good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid to say how fast these things will go,'' Schumacher
said.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of the Top Fuel also produced a pair of upsets
that sent some unexpected losers home early.
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi (4.677 seconds), the two-time defending NHRA driving
champion, was knocked out by Doug Herbert, who unloaded career
bests of 4.600 seconds at 318.39 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dixon, the No. 3 seed and a former winner at Firebird, was
slow off the starting line and was beaten by 19-year-old Australian
rookie Andrew Cowin.
</P>
<P>
   Cowin lost to Doug Herbert, who lost to Bernstein, who lost to
Amato.
</P>
<P>
   And Amato lost to no one. &QL;

SECOND TO NONE   
 WITH $500,000, MAGEE FEELS LIKE WINNER  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. - Paradise Valley sounds like a golf course in
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Up there, the layout is perfect, the weather divine. No rain.
Bright sunshine. The one time broken clouds appeared, and club
members complained, the improvements committee had them repaired
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise Valley has no rough. No traps. No trouble. Hit a
wayward drive and a cute little squirrel picks up the ball and
deposits it the center of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Magee will tell you no such golf course exists on Earth,
not in Paradise Valley, Ariz., where he lives, or in this San Diego
suburb, home of the La Costa Resort &AMP; Spa.
</P>
<P>
   But Magee wants you to know that even though he didn't win the
$1 million first prize at the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship _ a 38-hole war of nerves _ the experience was close
to heavenly.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being ranked No. 50 in a field of the world's top 64
players and advancing to the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as surprised as you guys I'm here,'' Magee said before his
duel with Jeff Maggert.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine losing and being handed a cashier's check for $500,000.
Magee has followed the sun on the PGA Tour for 15 years. He never
earned that kind of money in one tournament, even when he won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard pill to swallow,'' Magee deadpanned, when asked
about finishing second. Looking at him in earnest, the gaggle of TV
types held up their microphones, not knowing if Magee might
suddenly, in delayed-reaction grief, grab one of the mikes and
begin pounding his head with it, flogging himself as punishment for
failing to put his opponent away, and Andrew had his chances.
</P>
<P>
   Magee's smile returned. ``I'll be OK,'' he assured.
</P>
<P>
   Magee is a serious golfer. But he is one in a rare breed of
professional athletes who doesn't take himself too seriously. He
knows what the golfing world wished for, hoped for _ and he wasn't
it. Nor was Maggert, a fine player but one labeled by the media as
being so bland of personality that he has been declared legally
dead in four states.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked whether this format worked, Magee smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work for you,'' he replied cheerfully. Meaning Tiger
Woods and David Duval didn't meet in the final, both having been
eliminated. ``But it worked for ``me.''''
</P>
<P>
   Magee was like a low-seeded school in the NCAA basketball
tournament that quietly works its way through its bracket. He won
his first match (Darren Clarke), then his second (Thomas Bjorn).
Next he beat Bill Glasson, then Shigeki Maruyama, then John Huston.
Close matches.
</P>
<P>
   Few expected Magee to be in the final, but golf is nothing if
not unpredictable. Last year Magee nicked his left finger with a
chainsaw while cutting a tree limb. ``There are better ways to
weaken the grip on your left hand, don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   A week later he finished third at the Bob Hope Classic.
</P>
<P>
   All week Magee downplayed the mounting pressure. Drained? ``Not
at all, Magee said. ``I mean, this is a spa.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible for most people to fathom what it must feel
like playing a double round of golf for $1 million. Those of us
Magee's age (36) or older see the amount in print and think of that
old TV series ``The Millionaire.'' Each week Michael Anthony would
present a perfect stranger of modest means a cashier's check in
that dizzying amount, courtesy of an anonymous benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   One million dollars. Asked whether he ever allowed himself to
think about the money during Sunday's match Magee said, ``I thought
about the money all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Who in his right mind wouldn't?
</P>
<P>
   Magee twice built a three-hole advantage. But he never could put
away his opponent. On the 38th hole _ the second hole of a
sudden-death playoff _ Maggert chipped from off the green and
watched the ball catch the right corner of the hole and disappear
into the cup. As the instant millionaire danced across the green
and hugged his caddie Magee thought, as he would say later,
``Them's the breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed? Sure. Does his wife need to hide the razor blades?
Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   The ``loser'' will tell you that even if you figure in

COYOTES CONTINUE TO SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ After being pounded at home by Anaheim
and Philadelphia by a combined 9-2 margin, the Coyotes convinced
themselves that they needed to go on the road, spend a lot of time
together and find themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be good for us to get away for a while,'' Keith
Tkachuk predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's been almost two weeks now, and they're as lost as
they've ever been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be good to get home now,'' Tkachuk grumbled
after the Coyotes were drilled yet again, this time by a 4-1 count
Sunday afternoon by the New Jersey Devils at jampacked Continental
Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It was the seventh loss in eight games for the Coyotes
(30-20-10), who fell to 1-5 on their seven-game trip with one more
stop in Boston on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, then they come home to greet the two-time defending Stanley
Cup champion Detroit Red Wings on Friday. And surging Anaheim is
only seven points back in the race for the No. 4 Western Conference
playoff seed.
</P>
<P>
   So what the heck is the problem?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the Coyotes have scored just nine goals in the
last eight games and only seven in the first six games of this
trip. It hasn't been for a lack of effort, however. They've
recorded 161 shots since they left town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We generated some good opportunities in the second period
today, but opportunities get you squat,'' Coach Jim Schoenfeld
said. ``You have to score. If the other team only gets three
chances and they score on all three, that's all that matters. All
that matters is the results, and we're just not getting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is scoring. Not the role players. Not the rookies. Not
the top dogs. Jeremy Roenick has just three goals in his past 28
games, none in his last eight. Tkachuk has just four in his past 19
and two in his last 11. Rick Tocchet has four in his last 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the puck on the stick of the right player at the right
time, they're in good position,'' Schoenfeld said, ``but we're
either fanning on the shot, we're missing the net, we're burying it
into the goalie or the goalie's making a big save.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur, one of the NHL's best, stoned them lots of times
on his way to a 26-save performance. His All-Star counterpart,
Nikolai Khabibulin, faced 25 shots and might be slipping a tad.
</P>
<P>
   Things started well, though. On Phoenix's third shift of the
game, Bob Corkum picked up a loose puck in the neutral zone, and on
the Coyotes' first rush into Devils territory, he fired a shot that
rung off the far post and found the net.
</P>
<P>
   But New Jersey picked up the pace right away.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Pederson tied it with a long slap shot that Khabibulin
probably should have stopped, and with four minutes left in the
opening period, the Devils took the lead for good on a power-play
goal by Petr Sykora, his 21st.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' power play, ranked second to last in the league?
Don't ask. For the record, they went 0 for 6 on Sunday. After six
games on this trip, they have connected just twice in their past 22
man-advantage situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power play's killing us,'' Tkachuk said. ``That's the
biggest problem, the power play. We just can't seem to get it
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick said he's confident the Coyotes can bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going though a hard stretch, and it's something we have
to battle to get out of,'' he said. ``Hopefully, it makes us a
better team after we do get out of this. I know it did last year
when we were struggling, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Devils Coach Robbie Ftorek doesn't think the Coyotes are playing
like dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey listen, that's a good team we beat over there,'' he said.
``Every team goes through slumps and some trying times. They'll be
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld can only hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't give into it,'' he said. ``We're in a hole, and
the deeper the hole gets, the harder it is to get out of it. You
don't just spring out of it. You've got to scratch and claw and
climb your way out of it.'' &QL;

EVERYTHING'S COMING UP ROSES FOR RAF TER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - At 26, Australian Patrick Rafter seems to
have just about everything going his way.
</P>
<P>
   He was the fourth-ranked pro tennis player in the world at the
end of 1998, No. 2 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   He has won two U.S. Opens in a row and in January, teamed with
Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden to win the doubles title at the Australian
Open. He's 17-4 in U.S. Open matches and the first Australian to
win a title in that tournament since John Newcombe in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He has won more than $7 million since he turned pro in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter will be seeded second, behind Pete Sampras, when the
Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic, an ATP Tour satellite, opens
today at the Scottsdale Princess Resort. In the first round, Rafter
will play an unseeded Alex O'Brien, a former player for Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more that makes Rafter special.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he's a heartthrob for female fans, voted one of
the sexiest men by ``People'' magazine in 1997. He's tall, handsome
and soft-spoken. He also is from a large, close family. And he
likes little children _ in fact, he contributes money to their
well-being. He's adored in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   What else could this guy want?
</P>
<P>
   Well, for one thing, to play as much golf as possible while he's
in Scottsdale. For another, to beat Sampras, Andre Agassi or
whoever else stands in his way of a title.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this tournament is a tuneup for far more profitable
competition on the tour at Indian Wells, Calif., and Key Biscayne,
Fla. But that doesn't mean he doesn't like it here.
</P>
<P>
   ``These courts are fantastic,'' Rafter said Friday. ``I had a
good hit today and yesterday. It's good to be back on a surface
that I feel comfortable on. We don't have courts like this Down
Under.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most endearing things about Rafter is his modesty.
Perhaps that comes from growing up in a big family with modest
means. There were nine children, six of them boys, and his parents
donated substantial amounts of their income to help others.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't start out too well in tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 17, I was not very good,'' Rafter said. ``I was No.
10 in Australia and hadn't developed. It took me four years on the
tour to find out what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   His brother Geoff, an acupuncturist and masseur, invested
everything he had _ $14,000 _ to pay for his brother's trips to the
closest ATP satellite tournaments in Asia, according to ``Tennis
Magazine.'' He also became Patrick's coach.
</P>
<P>
   His brother taught him mental discipline, but Rafter eventually
believed he needed more technical coaching and dropped his brother
as coach.
</P>
<P>
   But his career is still a family affair. Geoff has become his
merchandising director; his oldest brother, Steve, is his manager
and agent; brother Peter is his business assistant; and
sister &UR; Louise handles his substantial charity work. After his wins
in the U.S. Open, he donated $600,000, the majority of his purses,
to children's programs at a hospital in Brisbane, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter isn't intimidated by Sampras, but he has a lot of respect
for his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what the pressure is like for No. 1,'' he said.
``He's been there six years in a row. It tells you about the talent
of this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Rafter is touring with his brother, who now divides his
time between Bermuda and British Columbia when he's not playing.
Peter was on the road with Patrick for 16 weeks last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat likes his family traveling with him,'' Peter said. ``He
can be himself.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 Agassi will play unseeded Fernando Meligeni at 6:30 p.m.
Tuesday, followed by a match between Sampras and unseeded Ramon
Delgado.

TELEMACO HEADED FOR THE BULLPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _  &UR; Amaury Telemaco isn't going to lie. His goal is to be
a starter in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, willing to face the truth, and where the
Diamondbacks are concerned, that means a job in the bullpen in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old right-hander was picked up by the Diamondbacks
in May after he was waived by the Chicago Cubs. He was in the
Arizona bullpen, then joined the rotation and started 18 games. He
finished with a 6-9 record for the Diamondbacks, 7-10 overall.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of three free agents _ left-hander  &UR; Randy Johnson
and right-handers  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre and  &UR; Armando Reynoso _ has
pushed Telemaco back into a role as a long reliever and perhaps an
occasional closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I want to be a starter, and I'll never give up on that,''
said Telemaco, a native of the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want to pitch in the major leagues. If they want me to
be a starter, I'll be there. If they want me to be a middle
reliever, I'll be there. If they want me to be a closer, I'll be
there. Just give me the ball. I'm ready for anything and will
prepare in any way I can.'' &QL; 
Young arms in spotlight &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the chance that  &UR; John Patterson,  &UR; Nick Bierbrodt and
 &UR; Brad Penny have been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   The three young phenoms are scheduled to pitch two innings
apiece today in the team's first intrasquad game of the spring. It
will begin at approximately 10:15 a.m. at Tucson Electric Park. A
second intrasquad game will be played at 1 p.m. Tuesday at the
minor-league complex across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a big experience for them to reach back on,''
Diamondbacks Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed Penny, who was the organization's minor-league
pitcher of the year in 1998 with a 14-5 record at Class A High
Desert, hopes to face as many of the veterans as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to see what we can do,'' he said. ``Why not? We don't
have anything to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   He probably won't get his wish. Showalter said he likely will
play most of the veterans on Tuesday. &QL; 
Ball strikes back &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder  &UR; Luis Gonzalez wasn't smiling Sunday after hitting a
ball off a portion of the metal batting cage and having it strike
him in the mouth, loosening the veneer from a front tooth.
</P>
<P>
   He went to a dentist as a precautionary measure. &QL;
