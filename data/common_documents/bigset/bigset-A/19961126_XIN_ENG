<HEADLINE> Chechnya Death Toll of Russian Interior Troops Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 986 Russian Interior
Troops were killed and 4,642 wounded in the two-year Chechen war,
a Russian general said today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with senior officers of his troops,
Colonel-General Anatoly Shkirko, Commander of the Russian Interior
Troops, said that 35 servicemen were missing and 19 were still
being held captive by the Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1997 would be a difficult year for the interior
troops because of the "tense situation in the region bordering on
Chechnya, and the contradictory and explosive situation in the
Chechen republic."
</P>
<P>
The interior troops, together with Russian Defense Ministry
troops, entered Chechnya in December 1994. Some thousands of
Russian servicemen have been killed since the beginning of the war.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Chechen separatist Prime Minister Aslan
Maskhadov, on November 23, all Russian troops should be pulled out
from Chechnya by the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
On November 23, Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree
ordering the 101st brigade, of the Russian Interior Troops
remaining in Chechnya, to withdraw ahead of the Chechen elections
scheduled for January 27.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin Meet on Belarus, Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin today discussed the
referendum results in Belarus and the Chechen settlement, at a
meeting in the Barvikha sanatorium, outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The presidential press service said the two discussed the
political situation in Belarus in detail during the 90-minute talk.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin briefed Yeltsin on Russia's mediation efforts last
weekend in Minsk, capital of Belarus, and the compromise accord
reached by conflicting Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko
and his parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko and the opposition-dominated parliament have been
involved in a confrontation over constitutional amendments
designed to expand the presidential powers. They were proposed by
Lukashenko and voted for in a nationwide referendum on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the referendum, more than 70.5 percent of registered voters
supported the amendments, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency,
which cited Lydia Yermoshina, acting head of the Central Election.
</P>
<P>
However, Lukashenko pledged today that he would seek
cooperation with the parliament instead of dissolving it. But he
said that there would be some personnel replacements in the
government.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin underlined
Russia's role in mediating between Lukashenko and his
parliament. They said it helped ease social tension in Belarus
ahead of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Their discussion on the development of the Chechen settlement
outlined tactics for further action for the settlement, the press
service said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin and Chechen separatist Prime Minister Aslan
Maskhadov signed an agreement on bilateral relations between
Moscow and Chechnya on November 23.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also gave Chernomyrdin "some instructions" ahead of the
premier's visit to France and his working visit to Poland.

<HEADLINE> Greek Ships' Pilots on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Greek ships' pilots went on
strike today to press their demand for an additional pay allowance
based on length of service to be paid out of the seamen's pension
fund.
</P>
<P>
Due to the strike, a large number of vessels remained at anchor
outside the country's main port of Piraeus, others have changed
course and destination, while those already in port are unable to
leave.
</P>
<P>
Merchant Marine Minister Stavros Soumakis said last week that
the behavior of the pilots was of particular concern to him since
they were "out of touch with reality".
</P>
<P>
Soumakis noted that pilots' salaries are already very high. He
said that they were "privileged employees who overstress demands
of lesser importance".
</P>
<P>
He added that the ministry was examining the possibility of
privatizing the pilot service which he described as a "private
relationship safeguarded by the state without any benefit for the
state".

MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia is ready to build
inter-regional cooperation with other European countries, Russian
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said today.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was addressing an international conference on
economic cooperation in Europe. He said regional cooperation
should rest on a provisional agreement between Russia and the
European Union which would, particularly, provide free trade
between Russia and other European countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, named "Economic Forum of European Regions for
Cooperation, Security and Stable Development," opened here
today. Attending are delegations from Russia and member states of
the Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Regional development is one of the key elements in Russia's
policies," Chernomyrdin said. Subsidies were no longer a tenable
tool in economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said his government's important task was to frame
conditions common for all.
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who chairs the organizing committee
of the conference, said that Russia needed foreign investments.

<HEADLINE> Two Truckers Injured as Road Blockades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Two truckers were wounded this
afternoon in a clash with a farmer driving a tractor who tried to
force his way through a blockade set up by truckers on a road in
Colleville, near Fecamp in northern France.
</P>
<P>
The farmer, who wanted to enter a sugar refinery whose access
was blocked by several trucks, knocked down two striking truckers
with his tractor, seriously wounding one of them, said the Agence
France Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Uninterrupted negotiations between the truckers and the
employers, which lasted 14 hours from Sunday evening, broke down
this morning, and a new round of negotiations would resume this
evening.
</P>
<P>
The truckers, who have been blocking roads across France by
setting up about 100 blockades since November 18, are demanding
higher pay, shorter work week and earlier retirement age.
</P>
<P>
They extended blockades to the roads of Alpes-de-Haute-Province
in southeast France for the first time today, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Bernard Pons will meet with the leader of
the union Force Ouvriere Marc Blondel this evening on the present
conflict between the truckers and their employers.
</P>
<P>
Pons appointed a government mediator Saturday between the
conflicting sides of the labor disputes, and have agreed to help
the truckers have their demand for retirement at 55 met.
</P>
<P>
The truckers are now weighing on two options to harden the
protest: to extend the blockade to Paris or extend the protest to
passenger coaches.
</P>
<P>
The movement by truckers was widely supported by the French
people, with 74 percent of French men and French women expressing
their sympathy with the truckers in a poll made by the IPSOS.
</P>
<P>
The unions, the Socialist Party and Communist Party have also
expressed solidarity with the truckers.
</P>
<P>
A German trucker was wounded by a stone thrown at his truck
window Sunday night on a road in Givry, near Chalon-sur-Saone in
eastern France, as he was trying to penetrate a blockade, AFP
quoted police as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the northern department of Normandy, truckers set up new
blockades today on the roads leading to the city of Caen by
surrounding the city with 540 trucks.
</P>
<P>
Truckers also blocked the roads around a goods distributing
center of the Sogaris company in Rungis, department of
Val-de-Marne southeast of Paris, only allowing two truckloads of
medical goods to leave the center, said AFP.

<HEADLINE> US Forecasters See Continuing Economic Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Many U.S. forecasters hold
the rosy view that the current economic expansion will continue
into the 21st century but some economists are doubtful about it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Association of Business Economists said today
that the consensus of 44 professional forecasters surveyed earlier
this month showed that growth would average 2.5 percent over the
next five years, about the same modest annual rate since the last
recession ended in March 1991.
</P>
<P>
If the forecasters are correct, the current business cycle
would be the longest surpassing the previous 106-month record
between February 1961 and December 1969.
</P>
<P>
For the immediate future, they predict that the U.S. economy
will grow by 2.3 percent this year and next year, an outlook
unchanged from the association's last survey in September.
</P>
<P>
The forecasters also expect 2.1 percent growth during the
current quarter, little changed from the government's initial
estimate of 2.2 percent for the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
But they are slightly more optimistic about inflation. The
latest consensus calls for a 2.9 percent rate in 1997, down from 3
percent in the September survey and unchanged from this year.
</P>
<P>
Workers also will continue to enjoy a low unemployment rate
with moderate job growth, the forecasters predict. The consensus
calls for jobless rates of 5.4 percent this year and 5.5 percent
in 1997, with a 2 percent gain in nonfarm payrolls this year and
1.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The forecast for continued moderate growth should be music to
Federal Reserve policy-makers, who have been able to avoid risking
an economic downturn with higher interest rates designed to
prevent an outbreak of inflation.
</P>
<P>
But some U.S. economists are holding a different view on the
economy, saying that the post-election optimism has a shaky
foundation, The New York Times reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply suspicious of the seemingly smug attitude that we
have tamed the once-ominous business cycle," said Stephen S.
Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that a recession "is obviously going to happen in
the next few years".

<HEADLINE> Malaria Prevention Campaign Launched in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
spend 1.3 million U.S. Dollars on insecticides this season to
control the malaria-causing parasite,Zimbabwean Health and Child
Welfare Secretary Paulinas Sikosana said today.
</P>
<P>
Sikosana made the statements at a meeting at which the 1996/97
malaria prevention and control campaign was launched.
</P>
<P>
He told the participants that an additional 600,000 U.S.
Dollars would be spent on anti-malarial drugs. The money was not
enough to eliminate the disease and it is up to the provincial
medical officers to mobilise additional resources to support the
programme in their areas, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 people are estimated to have died from malaria
this year, with most of the deaths occurring between January and
May.
</P>
<P>
Sikosana said health officials should educate the community on
how malaria is contracted and how it can be prevented.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organisation resident representative Levon
Arevshatian said more than 90 percent of all malaria cases in the
world were in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Arevshatian said 1.5 to 2.7 million people died from the
disease each year, especially among children below five years.

<HEADLINE> Red Locust Swarm in South Africa Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A red locust swarm
numbering in millions was largely destroyed by chemicals sprayed
from aircraft in the Pretoria area over the weekend, South
Africa's Department of Agriculture said today.
</P>
<P>
The Department's Deputy-director of Resource Conservation,
Thys Heyns, said that most of the insects had been destroyed.
"The birds can have the few who remain."
</P>
<P>
The swarm, hatched in Mozambique, from where it travelled
through Malawi, Namibia, Botswana before coming into South
Africa, caused damage to gardens in suburbs north of Pretoria
last week, and a vegetable garden run by Portuguese in the area
was nearly destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Heyns said last Friday that he had never in his 11-year
ivolvement in locust control seen a swarm so large, and it is the
first time since the 1940s red locusts were found in these parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
A smaller swarm was noted in the Kwazulu/Natal sugar cane
fields in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Low Pay Hits UK Middle-aged Male Workers: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Middle-aged men form an
increasing proportion of Britain's low-paid workers who were
mostly married women and young people in the 1960s, according to a
research published today.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by three researchers from the University
of Bath, reveals that while women are still twice as likely as men
to receive poverty wages, there has been a dramatic shift since
the 1960s when low-paid female workers outnumbered low-paid males
by six to one.
</P>
<P>
The number of men between the ages of 25 and 49 who are low
paid has quadrupled in the last 30 years, with 400,000 working for
under 3.87 pounds (6.5 US dollars) an hour, half the median of all
wages, the study points out.
</P>
<P>
Professor Steve Webb, one of the authors of the report, said:
"Middle-aged men are starting to discover what women have known
all along, that having a job is no guarantee of having a decent
income."
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that 4.6 million people, 22 percent of the
workforce, earned less than 3.87 pounds an hour last year, of
which 3.2 million were women and 1.4 million men.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s only 15 percent of low-paid men were over the age
of 25. Now one third of all low-paid men are over the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
The authors say that the spread of low pay to former
breadwinners has increased the impact of low wages on family
finances. The number of working households in poverty has risen
from three percent in the late 1960s to around 12 percent today.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's Draft Law Encourages Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has completed a
draft law to encourage foreign investment within the framework of
reforming the oil-dependent economy, Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister
and Finance Minister Nasser Al-Rodhan said today.
</P>
<P>
He said the draft law which was already introduced to the
Council of Ministers would soon be referred to the National
Assembly for approval.
</P>
<P>
The new law, he said, was only part of the economic reform since
the 1993-94 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The law covers mainly privatization efforts, envisaging that
the privatization process so far characterized by selling
government shares to the private sector would be involving many
other activities.
</P>
<P>
But he did not explain in detail in regard to the regulations
of the new bill.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's economy is still an oil-dependent one with the oil
revenues providing more than 80 percent of the state annual
income.
</P>
<P>
It started the privatization reform in 1992 and has raised
1.7 billion U.S. dollars from the drive following the latest
public auction of public shares.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuwait has now only attracted about 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars in the form of off-set program up to now, according
to unofficial figures.
</P>
<P>
The major investors are from the United States, Britain, Japan and
France.

<HEADLINE> Americans to Spend More on Christmas Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The average American
household will spend 450 U.S. dollars on gifts this Christmas, up
from about 430 U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase will lift U.S. retail sales to more than 45
billion U.S. dollars, representing a 5.5 percent increase over
holiday sales last year, according to a survey report released
today by the Conference Board, a noted New York based research
group.
</P>
<P>
"The anticipated rise in holiday spending is consistent with
recent economic trends, marked by strong consumer confidence
levels, moderate inflationary pressures and continuing wage
gains," said Lynn Franco, Associate Director of the Consumer
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The survey of the group found that slightly more than 30
percent of homes intend to spend 500 U.S. dollars or more for
Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
The more a family earns, the more it will spend. For
households with its annual income standing at more than 50,000
U.S. dollars, their average spending may reach 665 U.S. dollars,
while for those with income under 15,000 U.S. dollars, their
planned spending will be only 248 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Calls On Arafat To Push Forward Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today called on Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to push forward the peace process instead of causing
its deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu issued the call at a press conference held after
talks with visiting Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
He repeated that the gap between Israelis and the Palestinians
on the Hebron redeployment was not big and that an agreement
could be easily reached if the Palestinian side wanted to do so.
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that the Palestinian Authority (PA) understands
that the right way to go is to go to peace. We, for a month, have
been standing still," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Arafat to "get on with the business of
peace. "What is required is the Palestinians' decision to
complete the negotiations. They can be completed, and we can move
toward peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he made a phone call Sunday to Arafat
after Palestinian drivers deliberately blocked a road leading to
the Netzarim Jewish settlement in south of Gaza, creating a
tension between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai renewed his attacks on the PA for delaying the
signing of the Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, accompanied by senior army officers, toured Hebron
early today where he held a meeting with Jewish settler leaders.
</P>
<P>
Hebron Jewish settlers urged Mordechai to prevent the opening
of a vegetable market near the settlement in order avoid
violence against the settlers.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian residents in Hebron have been demanding the
opening of the market, which have been closed since the February
1994 Massacre in which a radical Jew gunned down 29 Palestinian
prayers in a nearby Mosque.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks on Hebron redeployment remain
stalled so far mainly over Israel's demand for security
changes to the signed agreement, under excuse of protecting
the safety of 450 Jews living among 120,000 Palestinians in
Hebron.

<HEADLINE> Britain Voices Concern over Stranded UK Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
expressed grave concern over the plight of hundreds of British
truck drivers, who had been stranded by a week-long French lorry
driver strike.
</P>
<P>
British Secretary of State for Transport George Young has
written a letter to his French counterpart Bernard Pons over the
weekend, calling for an immediate end to the strike.
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of British hauliers remain stranded in various parts
of France. I naturally hope this action can be brought to an end
as soon as possible," Young Said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the relevant French authorities will take all
necessary step to ensure the well-being of British drivers,
particularly if the weather, or the mood of the French strikers,
worsens.."
</P>
<P>
He noted that some British drivers had been stranded for almost
a week and there would be claims for compensation for damage to
perishable cargoes and for loss of earnings.
</P>
<P>
"This dispute is causing particularly severe problems for small
operators, some of whom may be unable to sustain the losses they
are incurring," he added.

<HEADLINE> US Existing Home Sales Drop for 5th Straight Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing homes in
U.S. dropped by 1.5 percent in October, the fifth consecutive
monthly decline.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Association of Realtors (NAR) said today that
sales of previously owned single-family homes declined to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.97 million units last month,
compared to a 4.03 million rate in September.
</P>
<P>
Sales of existing homes have been steadily declining since last
May after sales hit record highs earlier in the year. The sales
had stayed above a rate of 4 million mark until September.
</P>
<P>
By region, sales dropped by 5.8 percent in the South, the
sharpest decline in the country. They also fell by 1 percent in
the Midwest. Sales were up by 10.3 percent in the Northeast and by
3.5 percent in the West.
</P>
<P>
U.S. housing industry has been cooling down in recent months as
the U.S. economy is slowing its pace of expansion, although the
rates of mortgages are lowering.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year, fixed rate mortgage averaged 7.85 percent in
October, comparing with 8.32 percent in last June and 8.23 percent
in September.
</P>
<P>
But Russell K. Booth, president of the National Association of
Realtors, predicted today that sales of existing homes will stay
at healthy levels through 1997, giving a boost to the overall
economy.
</P>
<P>
NAR is forecasting that sales in this year will hit a record
4.09 million units and then decrease by 6.1 percent to 3.84
million units next year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Assured of No Ukraine-Iran Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel today got assurance
from Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma that his country was
not involved in any military projects with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, who arrived here Sunday on a three-day state visit,
made the promise during his talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ukraine did not have any military cooperation
with Iran, the arch rival of Israel in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel is worried about the reports of the cooperation between
Iran and former Soviet Union states in developing mass
destruction weapons which would threaten the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed ways to improve trade ties
between the two countries. About 50 leading businessmen are
accompanying Kuchma on his business-oriented visit.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Kuchma today signed several agreements of
cooperation in the fields of customs, oil, environment and
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Later, Kuchma made a speech in Israel's Knesset (Parliament),
during which he compared the renewed statehood of Israel to the
independence gained by Ukraine in 1991 after the collapse of the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, whose country sheltered the Jews suffering prosecution
during the Nazi German invasion in the World War II, pledged to
create more favorable conditions for the Jews still living
there. About 300,000 Jews have immigrated to live in Israel
today.

<HEADLINE> Russian Security Chief Outlines Ties with Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian national security chief
Ivan Rybkin said today that Russia and Chechnya will have almost
the same relations by 2001 as federal center has with other
regions of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Rybkin said the Russian and
Chechen sides have agreed on power sharing to the effect that some
issues would be solved by Moscow, some others by Grozny, and the
rest would be dealt with jointly.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the withdrawal of two Russian brigades from
Chechnya, he said the pullout would be completed before Chechen
presidential elections scheduled for January 27.
</P>
<P>
According to him, about 20,000 Russian servicemen will be
withdrawn, but railway troops, units of the Russian Emergencies
Ministry and teams of field enfineers will remain in Chechnya to
help restore the economy destroyed in almost two years of war.
</P>
<P>
The planned withdrawal was comprehensively discussed at a
Russian Defense Council meeting last week, he said, adding that
Defense Minister Igor Rodionov, understanding the difficult
condition in which the army was in Chechnya, backed the idea.
However, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov was of a different
opinion, Rybkin said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the statements by some lawmakers that the two
ministers had not been aware of the withdrawal plan, noting that
they had received information about it.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin told reporters that internal affairs bodies will be set
up in Chechnya on the basis of Russian-Chechen joint military
offices. Initially, these bodies will be staffed by Chechen and
Russian policemen, he said, adding that Kulikov and Chechen police
chief Kazbek Makhashev had agreed on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent statements on the so-called "black holes"
in the customs system through which weapons are allegedly flowing
into Chechnya, Rybkin said there would be none of them soon. A
special customs committee will function in Chechnya from December
1, he said.

<HEADLINE> France Supports Sri Lanka's Peace Effort toward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today expressed his support to the efforts being made by his Sri
Lankan counterpart Chandrika Kumaratunga in seeking a political
settlement to the 24-year war with the Tamil Tiger guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Kumaratunga today, Chirac said that
France was closely watching the development in Sri Lanka, because
the island nation was the "entry gate" to India and Pakistan for
French business.
</P>
<P>
Heavy security was arranged by the French government for
Kumaratunga's three-day visit, her first since she took office in
November 1994, as there is a big Tamil community living in France.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also expressed his admiration for the perseverance of
the Sri Lankan president in solving the "difficult interior
conflict" in her country.
</P>
<P>
At least 50,000 people have been killed in the civil war in Sri
Lanka since the Tamil Tiger guerrillas revolted against the
government in 1972 in the east of the island.
</P>
<P>
A group of donor countries agreed on November 18 in Paris to
provide 860 million U.S. dollars of aid to Sri Lanka in 1997,
while calling on Colombo to accelerate the peace process with the
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga also raised the issue of the strong presence of the
Tamil Tiger supporters in France, during a meeting with French
Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre today.
</P>
<P>
Two leaders of the the Tamil Tigers group were assassinated in
late October in Paris. The separatist group held the Sri Lankan
government responsible for the assassination.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan Defense Ministry denied the accusation, saying
that the killing resulted from an infighting among the separatists
over financial disputes.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government has launched an extensive diplomatic
offensive to prevent the Tamil Tigers from raising fund for its
fight for independence in some 40 countries.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Sends Letter to President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- It was officially confirmed
today that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash representing the
self-claimed republic in northern Cyprus has sent a letter to
President Glafcos Clerides concerning the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides told his daily press
briefing that the letter, the third of the kind, was sent last
week.
</P>
<P>
However, Cassoulides declined to give the content of the letter.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Turkish Cypriot leader has proposed a dialog
through letters with the government, since as he argues, Clerides
refuses to meet him.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides noted that Clerides has not yet decided whether he
will reply or not. Clerides has replied the previous two letters
by Denktash.
</P>
<P>
There has been no direct talks between the leaders of the Greek
and Turkish communities since the informal talks took place in
October, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has announced its position that direct
talks can take place only after common ground is reached between
the Greek and Turkish sides on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following
an Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Lauds Jiang-Clinton Talks in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today described the talks between
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Manila as "constructive and encouraging."
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held in the Philippine International
Convention Center, Qian said that China and the United States
agreed to realize the exchange of visits at the head of state
level in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
On China's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Qian
said the United States expressed its desire to speed up the
negotiations on China's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He said that China welcomes the U.S. move to adopt a flexible
attitude to china's membership to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the two countries agreed to remain in contact on a
number of important issues such as global security, regional
issues and nuclear non-proliferation, saying that China and the
United States have common interests.
</P>
<P>
"We also have differences. However we can solve these
differences through negotiations and consultations," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the U.S. proposal that China and the U.S.
should conclude an agreement on detargetting nuclear weapons
against each other, Qian said, "We agreed to this proposal, but we
wanted to add one thing, that is non-first use of nuclear
weapons."
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Japanese ties, Qian said whether or not the Japanese
government will adopt a correct attitude towards its past
aggression against China is very important to the political
foundation of the Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Qian said Hashimoto had
promised to correctly review its history of aggression and
introspect its past.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Qian said that Prime Minister Hashimoto
told President Jiang Zemin that the question of Taiwan is for the
people across the Taiwan Straits to settle through peaceful
consultation.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side, according to Qian, will strictly adhere to
the Sino-Japanese Joint Communique and the Japanese government
will not develop official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We are attaching importance to the statement of the Japanese
government. We hope the statement will be implemented at the early
date so that the Sino-Japanese relations will develop in the right
direction," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the new membership of Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC), Qian said that APEC has ended its three-year
moratorium on the acceptance of new members. He said China
expressed its support to the admission of Russia, Vietnam and
Peru as new members of APEC.

<HEADLINE> EU Reaches Telecoms Equipment Deal with South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union(EU) and
South Korea have reached a deal to open their telecommunications
equipment markets to eacher other's suppliers, the European
Commission said here today.
</P>
<P>
"European companies will be treated as fairly as their Korean
counterparts when bidding for contracts to supply telecoms
equipment to the network by Korea Telecom," the EC said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached over the weekend by the EC
and the South Korean government, South Korean suppliers will be
treated equally when bidding for contracts in Europe's 22 billion
US dollars annual market.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said that the EU would withdraw the dispute in
the World Trade Organization which it launched against South Korea
last May, if EU ministers give the deal a green light.
</P>
<P>
The deal covers contracts in South Korea's US$ six billion
telecoms equipment market awarded by both government-owned Korea
Telecom and by newly licensed private operators, the EC said.
</P>
<P>
Korea Telecom, the main Korean telephone operator, accounts for
some 80 percent of the South Korean telecoms network market.
</P>
<P>
"Today's breakthrough, which follows over two years of intense
negotiations, applies mainly to switching and transmission
equipment and cables," the EC said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea pledged to end legislation and practices that
discriminate against EU products, while the EU agreed that it
would waive a provision in its "utilities directive" that gives
preference to EU telecoms products.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, suppliers will have the right to challenge
contract awards in national courts and the two sides agreed to use
a binding dispute settlement mechanism to settle disagreements
over implementation of the accord.
</P>
<P>
The EC said the deal should make it easier to conclude the
Information Technology Agreement, which aims to eliminate tariffs
on a wide range of computer and telecommunications equipment.

LAUNDA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Brazilian President
Henrique Cardoso today called on the Angolan leaders and people
to make unremitting efforts for peace and democracy of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet hosted by Angolan President Eduardo Dos
Santos, the Brazilian president expressed his confidence that the
Angolan leaders can make compromises in the interest of peace and
national conciliation. Insistence on armed conflict and keeping
of the "no war, no peace" situation will bring no hope for
Angola, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian president, who arrived here yesterday to begin a
two-day state visit to Angola, had signed with Angolan government
an agreement on economoc,science and technical cooperation, and
another agreement which provides that Brazil will offer Angola
0.2 million U.S. Dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso also went to the central Angolan province of Bie to
see the Brazilian peace keeping forces there. Brazil has sent
1000 troops to Angola, the biggest contribution to the U.N.peace
keeping force in Angola.
</P>
<P>
After conclusion of his visit here, the Brazilian president
will go to South Africa.

BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- European Union(EU) foreign
ministers today urged next month's Singapore ministerial
conference of the World Trade Organization(WTO) to push for more
ambitious targets.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after today's meeting in Brussels, the EU
ministers called for "strenuous efforts" from all WTO parties to
tackle the EU' major topics of interest.
</P>
<P>
"The EU Council is of the opinion that more ambitious results

</P>
<P>
The Ministers reconfirmed its scheduled special session to be
held on the spot at Singapore to coordinate positions among
members of the 15-country bloc.
</P>
<P>
According to EC sources, while ministers today appeared broadly
united on tactics, Greece and Portugal sought "clearer language"
on textiles trade issues while Sweden sought tougher provisions
for world trade rules on investment and environment.
</P>
<P>
The Ministers agreed last month to use Singapore to try to
finalize agreements on trade and the environment, to push for
international product standards, to protect intellectual property
rights and to define globally accepted public procurement
practices.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the EU foreign ministers also welcomed the
efforts made by EC Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan in his most
recent talks with China leaders in order to promote China's
accession to the WTO.

<HEADLINE> US Phone Giant AT&AMP;T Steps Up Attack on BT Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. telephone giant AT&AMP;T
is to intensify its attacks on the proposed take over of his
domestic main rival MCI Communications Corporation by British
Telecommunications Plc (BT).
</P>
<P>
Merrill Tutton, head of AT&AMP;T's British operations, is expected
to tell a London conference later today that the British phone
market is regulated and in danger of being carved up by BT and
Cable &AMP; Wireless into a new duopoly.
</P>
<P>
BT, the British Telecommunications giant, earlier this month
announced its merger with MCI, the second U.S. telecommunications
corporation to create the world's second largest
telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
The attack is likely to put further pressure on British
telecommunications industry regulator Don Cruickshank as he
discusses approving the BT-MCI link-up with his U.S. counterparts
of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), according to local
press reports.
</P>
<P>
The FCC has made it clear that it will only give BT the
go-ahead to increase its stake in MCI from 20 percent to 100
percent if it can prove the British phone market is as liberal as
the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T has earlier complained that its British customers can only
use its service after first dialing a special code to gain access
to the network.
</P>
<P>
The "indirect access" principle also means customers have two
bills, one from the long-distance company and one from BT for use
of the local infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Report: Sunken Submarine Leaks Radiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Highly radioactive
plutonium leaked into the Atlantic from nuclear warheads aboard a
Soviet submarine that sank in the ocean in 1986, an Associated
Press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The AP report, quoting San Francisco Examiner, said that it was
the first case in which weapons-grade plutonium leaked from a
submarine into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
Both governments of the then Soviet Union and the United States
gave assurances at the time that there was no radioactive
contamination.
</P>
<P>
The submarine K-219, carrying 32 nuclear warheads, was one of
three Soviet and two U.S. nuclear-armed subs that sank during the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said liquid fuel of one of the sub's missiles
apparently ignited, causing damage that left the submarine
drifting on the surface for two days while the crew tried to make
repairs.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the sinking submarine's missile warheads,
which may contain 200 pounds of plutonium-239, broke apart as the
vessel went down about 600 miles east of Bermuda.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Recovers from Financial Crisis: IDB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Latin America is recovering
from 1995 economic setback precipitated by the financial crisis in
Mexico and a recession in Argentina, according to an estimate from
the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) here today.
</P>
<P>
The IDB's Chief Economist Office predicted a 3 percent growth
rate for the region in 1996, an upswing that reflects the economic
recovery, as compared with only a 0.7 percent growth in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that inflation continues to fall and estimated
the 1996 median inflation rate for the region at 11 percent
compared with 13 percent in 1995. The only country in which
inflation rose substantially was Venezuela. However, inflation is
slowing to 3.5 percent a month in Venezuela in the second half of
this year as compared with 10 percent in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The latest macro-economic estimates were released in conjunction
with the publication of the IDB's annual report, entitled
"Economic and Social Progress in Latin America". The 430-page
report analyzes the 1995 slowdown and concludes that Latin
America's reform process is sustainable but still vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 a greater number of countries are entering the phase of
stress, but there are very strong signs that they will be able to
manage it, the report said. In fact, although growth may look
shaky in a number of countries, macro fundamentals are improving
and access to external credit has been preserved.
</P>
<P>
Inflation during this year fell significantly in Brazil, Costa
Rica, Haiti, Mexico, Suriname and Uruguay, while Colombia and
Ecuador experienced slight increase.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal performance in the region also improved, with the
average fiscal deficit falling from about 2.5 percent of GDP in
1995 to an estimated 1.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Capital flows to the region in 1996 were about 48 billion U.S.
dollars, approximately the same as last year. But private flows
increased substantially in 1996 compared with 1995, when Latin
America received substantial official flows in support of the
adjustment program in Mexico and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The IDB said unlike the 1980s, when most Latin American
countries went through common cycles of recession and mild
recovery, currently Latin American economies are behaving in a
very heterogeneous way as far as growth and macro stability is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
The IDB report recommends that Latin American countries should
"protect the reforms already implemented and push forward those
elements of the reform agenda that remain incomplete."
</P>
<P>
"By acting to minimize the vulnerabilities that develop during
the boom, policy-makers can reduce the likelihood of a disruptive
crisis requiring correction," the report stressed.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania To Facilitate Voluntary Repatriation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin
Mkapa said today Tanzania will take advanage of the prevailing
conditions in the central African region to facilitate voluntary
repatriation of all Rwandan refugees currently camped in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the statements at a meeting with Patrick Mazimhaka,
a special enovy sent by Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the State House, Mkapa told
the envoy that the massive return of Rwandan refugees, who had
been living in Zaire, should be an obvious incentive for those in
Tanzania to do the same.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, said that in recognition of th
magnitude of logistical and transportation problems in handling
returning refugees in such great numbers, the Tanzanian
government calls upon the international community to come up with
the necessary emergeny assistance to help the Rwandan government
in resettling the returnees.
</P>
<P>
Mazimhaka, who is also Minister for Rehabilitation, welcomed
President Mkapa's desire to have all Rwandan refugees repatriated
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said the Rwandan government is ready to receive all the
refugees from Tanzania.

Mazimhaka handed a special message to resident Mkapa from

<HEADLINE> World Cotton Production Can Match Consumption: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- World cotton production is
estimated at 18.7 million tons in 1996/97 and 19.6 million tons
next season, which can match the consumption, according to a
report from the International Cotton Advisory Committee here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based Committee said world cotton consumption is
estimated at levels similar to production, 18.9 million tons for
1996/97 and 19.5 million tons next season.
</P>
<P>
With world cotton production and consumption maintaining an
approximate balance, changes in stocks are likely to be small, and
movements in prices are likely to be modest relative to historical
experience, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
However, world cotton consumption is forecast to rise to more
than 20 million tons over the next five seasons, resulting in
upward pressure on cotton prices.
</P>
<P>
The International Cotton Advisory Committee is an association
of 40 governments of cotton producing and consuming countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Duke Power to Buy PanEnergy for $7.7 Bln in Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Duke Power Co.
will buy the natural gas distributor PanEnergy Corp. for 7.7
billion U.S. dollars in stock, according to reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest merger of an electric company with a gas
pipeline operator in the current U.S. energy industrial wave of
consolidation and restructuring. The combined company will be
named as Duke Energy and have a combined market value of about 23
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The consolidation trend is stimulated at least partly by easing
government regulations, as electric and natural gas companies
combine to offer one-stop energy shopping for businesses and
residential customers.
</P>
<P>
Charlotte-based Duke serves 1.8 million customers in North
Carolina and South Carolina while Houston-based PanEnergy operates
some 37,000 miles of pipeline in the Midwest and Northeast and is
the third largest gas marketer in the country.
</P>
<P>
The deal depends on approval by PanEnergy and Duke Power
shareholders as well as state and federal regulatory approval. The
companies hope the deal can be completed within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Enron Corp. of Houston, the nation's largest natural-gas
company, is acquiring Portland General Corp., Oregon's largest
electric utility. And Houston Industries, parent of Houston
Lighting &AMP; Power Co., recently agreed to buy NorAm Energy Corp.,
the parent of Entex.

<HEADLINE> Moi Launches Revitalized IGAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today launched a revitalized Inter-governmental Authority in
Development (IGAD) at the on-going summit of heads of state and
government held in Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
"We resolved to revitalize the IGAD and expand cooperation in
all areas covering trade, communications, security, economic,
social and humanitarian endeavors," Moi, who is also the current
IGAD Chairman, was quoted by the Kenyan News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The revitalized IGAD is aimed at bringing peace, stability and
economic development to the East African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in southern Sudan, the president
appealed to all the parties to the conflict "to reach a
compromise and abide by it."
</P>
<P>
He urged the IGAD member states to forge a common front and
exert their influence to break this prolonged war in southern
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader also expressed great concern over the
unending war in Somalia and urged IGAD member countries to take
urgent measures to enable the country to find a solution of the
internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the agreement of a ceasefire and dialogue
reached recently in Nairobi "should form the basis for a
negotiated settlement" of the unending war.
</P>
<P>
On the crisis in eastern Zaire, the president stated that
every effort should be made to assist the resettlement of
refugees and guarantee their normal life.
</P>
<P>
He expressed welcome to the establishment of a trust fund to
set up a minimal neutral African force that will be acceptable to
both Zairean and Rwandese governments.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Urges Closer APEC Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper,
the People's Daily, today published an editorial, calling for closer
economic cooperation among members of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC), which ended its fourth informal leadership
meeting in the Philippines Monday.
</P>
<P>
The editorial hailed the Subic Declaration announced at the end
of the leadership meeting as well as the Manila Action Plan and a
document guiding economic and technological cooperation approved
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
These documents, it said, will play an active role in the
development of economic cooperation in the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The editorial described trade and investment liberalization and
economic and technological cooperation as two major pillars
of APEC.
</P>
<P>
Since the second APEC informal leadership meeting in 1994 in
Bogor, Indonesia, the process of trade and investment
liberalization has gradually stepped on the right track and has
gained some progress, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, economic and technical cooperation has
been lagging behind as no due importance has been attached to it.
</P>
<P>
If such a situation is not changed, it will impede the
sustainable economic development in the Asia-Pacific region, said
the editorial.
</P>
<P>
It added that poor economic and technological cooperation will
seriously restrict the liberalization of trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Only by strengthening economic and technological cooperation,
could more opportunities for development be created for developing
APEC members, market be expanded and the gap in economic
development between the developing and the developed be narrowed,
said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it said, the adoption of effective measures to speed
up economic and technological cooperation meets the call of the
developing members and also benefits the economic development of
the developed ones.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also said the meeting reached consensus on the
principles and ways for promoting economic and technological
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin pointed out at the meeting that
the principles and ways for APEC economic and technological
cooperation should meet the requirements of the times and conform
to the reality of the region.
</P>
<P>
Different from development assistance in its traditional
sense, APEC economic and technological cooperation is a kind of
two-way cooperation based on equality, mutual benefit and mutual
complementality, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region calls for
diversity, flexibility and openness, the editorial said. It also
calls for the upholding of the principles of mutual respect,
equality and mutual benefit, consensus through consultations and
self-determination and voluntariness, it added.
</P>
<P>
And it is mainly because APEC created and adopted such a mode
of cooperation that it has made steady progress since its
founding, said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
It said that since the founding of APEC, China has been playing
an active and constructive role in the forum and spared no efforts
to promote regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
APEC economic cooperation is an unprecedented endeavor and
China is willing to explore new conceptions and approaches in
strengthening such cooperation together with other APEC members,
concluded the editorial.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says It Is Prepared to Implement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 25 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi senior official
announced this evening that Iraq is fully prepared to implement
the oil-for-food deal it signed in May with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported that the Iraqi
acceptance of the U.N. conditions has been included in a letter
handed over by Iraqi U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon to Chinmaya
Gharekhan, senior advisor of the U.N. Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Baghdad is allowed to sell 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months on a renewable
base to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its
people who have been suffering under U.N. sanctions imposed on
Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
INA said that the only step needed now for the implementation
of the deal is for the U.N. Sanctions Committee to approve the
oil-pricing mechanism. The committee is to meet today in New York
to discuss the pricing mechanism, it added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has faced difficulty in a quick implementation of the
oil-for-food deal which was stalled by U.N. in early September
following Baghdad's help for one of the two Kurdish factions
against the other. The military intervention prompted U.S.
missile attacks against Iraqi military targets in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the agreement, Iraq has repeatedly accused
the United States of impeding a quick implementation of the deal.
</P>
<P>
Iraq must have a clear verification from the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming that it no longer has weapons of
mass destruction before the sanctions are to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
However, UNSCOM deputy chairman Charles Dueful said here today
after his three-day visit to Iraq that some "very grave" problems
remain in Iraq's weapons areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq still refuses to permit the missile engines
to leave the country for analysis. The issue will be discussed
with Iraqi side by UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus who is to visit
Baghdad early next month.

<P>
Nigeria in return will sell its super concentrate iron ore to
Egypt.

</P>
<P>
According to experts here, the overall Tsarist-era debts for

up to now, are estimated, at the present-day rate, at
approximately 160,000 million francs (about 30 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexander Kasyanov

problem can be resolved in the near future to remove the last
obstacle to Russia's accession to the Paris Club.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the Russian government, turnover
between Russia and France for the first nine months of this year
amounted to 2.1 billion dollars, or 12 percent up from the same
period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Now, Russia intends to considerably expand purchases of French
goods including, particularly, machinery and technical equipment,
using the French loans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moscow believes that all necessary preconditions
exit for stepping up Russian exports to France, including both
fuel and energy resources and constructive materials, house-hold
refrigerators, non-ferrous and precious metals and products made
of them, and some kinds of foodstuffs.

<HEADLINE> China to Be One of Largest Insurance Markets in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China is opening up its
insurance market to foreign players, but it is doing so in a
"gradual and planned manner," said an organizer of a seminar here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seminar entitled "China... The Insurance
Potential,", Roger Taylor, executive deputy chairman of
Royal/Sunalliance Insurance Plc, said, "The Chinese authorities
want to give their own market the opportunity to improve their
expertise so that they can compete effectively with foreign
entrants."
</P>
<P>
Referring to ther prospect of the Chinese insurance market,
Taylor said that China had the potential to become one of the
world's largest insurance markets and was making rapid progress in
this direction.
</P>
<P>
The astonishing economic achievement China had got since the
late 1970s, with its l.2 billion people meant China enjoyed a huge
share in the world insurance market, he added.
</P>
<P>
With the opening door policy and the rapid economic growth,
Taylor believed more and more private and collectively owned
enterprises would be formed in China and they would play an
increasingly active role in China's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government would change and reform the national
housing, health and employment systems, with less and less people
relying on "The Iron Rice Bowls" as before, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, insurance is still a relatively new concept in China.
Taylor said, "Most Chinese still think that to talk of the
possibility of accident or death before traveling is bad luck and
will think even less of buying an insurance policy to insure them
against possible death."
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, China is a country covering 9.6 million square
kilometers and almost all types of climates, Taylor said. "It is
subject to all kinds of hazards and catastrophes."
</P>
<P>
However, Taylor concluded: China is potentially a huge market
of adventure, ambition and success, but these opportunities only
belong to those who dare to face challenges and to defy
difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Global Unemployment Crisis Continues: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1 billion people around
the world, approximately 30 percent of the entire global work
force, are unemployed or under-employed in industrialized and
developing countries, according to a report published by the
International Labor Office (ILO) here today.
</P>
<P>
Double digit unemployment exists in most regions of the world,
said the ILO, the United Nations agency with international
responsibilities of work and employment issues.
</P>
<P>
The ILO report attributed the deteriorating employment
conditions to lower growth rates in industrialized countries and
the failure of most developing economies to recover fully from the
economic crisis of the early 1980s, slow adjustment of wages to
declining labor productivity, and the increasing casualization of
millions of workers in informal sector activities.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the priority requirement for reversing the
prolonged deterioration in employment conditions is the
restoration of high and sustained rates of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The experience of dynamic Asian economies shows that sound
domestic policies, expanding global trade and investment flows
provide rich opportunities for higher rates of economic growth and
job creation," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The report called for economic reforms in order to achieve
macroeconomic stability and begin generating an environment
conducive to high savings and investment and the efficient
allocation of resources.

WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry said today that American troops for humanitarian
relief efforts stand ready to help airlift supplies to refugees in
Central Africa, once decision is made on mounting an international
relief operation.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking before holding talks with Canadian Minister of
National Defense Douglas Young at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. aircraft support teams are in place in Mombasa,
Kenya, and Entebbe, Uganda, to build up an "air bridge" of
supplies for relief operation, should one go forward.
</P>
<P>
But Young told reporters "no definitive decision" has been made
on whether military action will take place in the region.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Central Africa is "very complicated" and "not
easily addressed," Young said. "We're looking at a number of
options," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council had authorized a Canadian-led
multinational force of up to 12,000 troops. But after hundreds of
thousands of Rwandan refugees left Zaire, questions arose whether
such a mission was needed.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of more than two dozen nations conferred over
the weekend in Stuttgart, Germany, to consider several options for
the relief mission. and a proposal to send security forces to
protect humanitarian aid deliveries was one of the options.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rwandan officials have rejected the entering of a
multinational military force into the country.

<HEADLINE> Congressional Leaders, Governors Discuss Legislative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott outlined a lengthy agenda for legislations priorities
to Republican governors in a traditional post-election session in
Grand Rapids, Michigan, today.
</P>
<P>
Lott acknowledged Republicans' need to compromise with
President Bill Clinton to enact their priorities, according to an
Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
One early 1997 goal is to pass the balanced budget amendment.
"If everyone stays to their word, we have the votes... in the
House and the Senate," Senator Larry Craig, a Republican from
Idaho, said today.
</P>
<P>
He said the prediction depended on newly elected Democrats
keeping campaign promises to support the measure, and he implored
Republican governors to help generate pressure on any wavering
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
One early area of disagreement appears to be tax cuts.
Republican governors who have made cutting taxes the centerpiece
of their state agendas are urging Congress to press ahead boldly
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
But the congressional leaders said tax cuts enacted in 1997
would be far more modest than those advocated by Republicans in
1995 and 1996. Lott said Republicans wanted a broader reduction in
capital gains taxes than Clinton preferred, but otherwise outlined
a targeted approach to tax reduction not far from Clinton's
campaign proposals.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich told the governors, "We need this
partnership to get things done."
</P>
<P>
Several governors said it was critical heading into the 1998
election cycle -- which features 36 governors races as well as
another fight for control of Congress -- that the Republicans boost
its image on issues critical to working families and test
Clinton's promises to balance the budget and cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
A major Republican congressional priority is a new attempt to
pass the balanced budget amendment, which fell short last year in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The governors had a list of their own for the congressional
leaders, headed by a request for swift passage of legislation
streamlining the 100-plus federal job-training programs. The House
and Senate passed competing versions last year but failed to
reconcile their differences.
</P>
<P>
The governors also were renewing their call for broad control
of the Medicaid program. Republicans tried in 1995 to turn the
program into block grants to states, but it was a major sticking
point in the Republican budgets that Clinton vetoed on grounds
they would hurt the poor and elderly.
</P>
<P>
After Republicans captured Congress in the 1994 elections, the
new leadership met with governors and promised to swiftly shift
powers over scores of federal programs from Washington to the
states. But many fell victim either to internal Republicans
squabbles or, in the case of Medicaid, the budget war with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The governors urged Gingrich and Lott today to adopt
incremental Medicaid reforms if there was not enough support for
more sweeping changes.

<HEADLINE> Travelling Cheap, Comfortable in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The coming century will witness
the growth of retired and disabled tourists and a boom in shorter
inexpensive exotic trips to hospitable lands, while conventional
sun-sea-sand vacations are fading out of chic.
</P>
<P>
It seems that 21st century tourists will not be easy to
please, as tourism experts from eight countries met in the
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh last month to
deliberate where and how tourists will travel in the next decade,
according to the latest issue of the English-language weekly
Al-Ahram.
</P>
<P>
Professionals from the United States, Germany, Britain,
France, Italy, Hungary, Brazil and Egypt took part in the
conference to discuss the future of international tourism. Their
primary goals were to analyze tourist psychology and determine
the holidays in demand.
</P>
<P>
Tourist countries, including Egypt, recognize that they will
have to adapt to new concepts of promotion, hospitality and
environmental control in order to continue competing in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
"Travelling is becoming a lifestyle, a necessity rather than
just a way to spend a holiday or leisure time," said Sai Mousa,
former president of the Egyptian Tourism Authority.
</P>
<P>
The nature of travelling has changed. The sun-sea-sand
vacation, which charmed tourists in the 70s and 80s, will be no
longer attractive, due to "increasing awareness of the danger of
overexposure to the sun," he said.
</P>
<P>
Marketing and promotion also have to face up to challenges in
the age of computer terminals and the Internet, as people will
soon be able to make their own reservations on the Internet from
their home.
</P>
<P>
Tourism experts also anticipated that tourists will travel
more frequently but on shorter visits, and tend to spend less.
</P>
<P>
During a three-day tour to Egypt, the main historical sites in
Cairo, Luxor and Aswan will be enough for a tourist since he
might take a second, third and perhaps fourth trip during the
year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, visiting the main attractions of a destination,
doing a bit of shopping and flying back home will be a most
likely way to spend weekends abroad.
</P>
<P>
For holiday-makers that "have done it already," a nice beach,
a bazaar and good food will not be good enough. They look for new
destinations and more exotic holidays, plus better services at
lower prices.
</P>
<P>
The specialists at the conference also pointed out that in the
21st century, enhanced quality of service and marketable natural
environment will become important tourism factors.
</P>
<P>
The coming decade will also witness the rise of two relatively
new tourist groups, disabled and retired travellers. Therefore,
the development of facilities for them at the international
levels will be essential.

<HEADLINE> French Overseas Trade Scores Big Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- France's overseas trade scored a
10 billion franc (about two billion U.S. dollars) surplus in
September, following a record high of 13.3 billion francs (2.66
billion U.S. dollars) in August, French Customs said today.
</P>
<P>

francs (456 million dollars) in August.
</P>
<P>
France had an overall 86.76 billion franc (13.35 billion
dollars) trade surplus for the first nine months of this year,
against 72.32 billion francs (12.46 billion dollars) in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Its imports increased from 112.2 billion francs (22.4 billion
dollars) in August to 114.4 billion francs (22.9 billion dollars)
in September, while exports dropped slightly from 125.6 billion
francs (25.12 billion dollars) to 124.5 billion francs (24.9
billion dollars) in the period.
</P>
<P>
France's trade deficit with Japan stood at 1.68 billion francs
(336 million dollars) in September, against 1.51 billion francs
(302 million dollars) in August.
</P>
<P>
Its trade surplus with the United States stood at 1.09 billion
francs (218 million dollars) in September, against 2.18 billion

<HEADLINE> Ceremony Held to Mark First Anniversary of 11th Panchen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Tibetan Buddhist Yonghe
Lamasery in Beijing has held a religious ceremony to mark the
first anniversary of the 11th Panchen Lama's enthronement.
</P>
<P>
On November 22, to the accompaniment of bells, drums and horns,
and recitations of Buddhist scripture, the 11th Panchen Lama
toured the lamasery, which had been elaborately decorated and was
fragrant with incense.
</P>
<P>
He sat on a seat which had been used by the 10th Panchen Lama,
and was worshiped by Tibetan Buddhists from the lamasery and
elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama blessed the Buddhist believers present by
touching them on the head.
</P>
<P>
The Yonghe Lamasery, or the Temple of Harmony and Peace, was
once a royal temple. Built in 1694, it now serves as an important
link between the central government and the Tibetan Buddhist sect.
</P>
<P>
Jamyang Tubdain, abbot of the lamasery, said that the Buddhists
at the lamasery will strictly follow the disciplines of Tibetan
Buddhism under the direction of the 11th Panchen Lama, and pray
for state prosperity, national unity, and world peace.
</P>
<P>
On November 29 last year, the 11th Panchen Lama was selected
from three candidates by drawing lots from a gold urn. He was
later approved by the State Council, and was enthroned on December
8, 1995.

<HEADLINE> Belgium-Registered Ship Auctioned in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A Belgium-registered ship
--M/V Norbel Bulk-- has been sold by auction in Shanghai for 2.6
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 27,000-dwt ship, built in 1973, belongs to Norbel Shipping
Inc of Belgium. It was sent to Shanghai Shipyard for overhaul in
November of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The heavy repair was finished in February this year, but the
ship owner would not pay the fees for the repair work, and attempted
to take away the ship by changing its name.
</P>
<P>
When it found out about the ploy, Shanghai Shipyard brought a
suit against the ship owner in the Shanghai Marine Court, and
applied for the ship to be detained. Shanghai Marine Court issued
a detention ruling against the Belgian ship on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The ship owner sent a telegraph on June 3 to inform the captain
about his decision to stop any duties for the ship or crew from
the day the ship was placed under custody, forcing the ship into a
difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Shipyard had to spend 500,000 yuan to pay wages to the
crew members. As the ship owner did not provide any economic
guarantee, and the expenditure of the ship built day by day,
Shanghai Marine Court decided on an auction of the vessel in
accordance with the plaintiff's application.
</P>
<P>
Three enterprises took part in the auction, and after more than
a dozen competitions, Huali Shipping Company of Nantong City
bought the ship at a price of 2.6 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the money will be used to meet fees,
including those for the lawsuit, overhaul and crew members'
salaries. The remaining sum will be returned to the ship
owner.

<HEADLINE> France Wary Over Russia's Promise to Pay Tsarist Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- France is taking a wary approach
over Russia's promise to pay the tsarist debts borrowed from 1882
to 1917, though the principle for settling the debts with Moscow
seems to have been agreed on.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) reported today that the debts,
borrowed in the form of 400,000 bonds bought by the French people
to finance mainly the construction of railways in Russia, was
renounced by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is on a 24-hour
visit here today, said on Monday in Moscow that Russia would pay
the debts.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Bourse today suspended the quotation of the Russian
bonds after rumors of a "positive settlement" to the debts. The
bonds were worth 493.59 francs (100 U.S. dollars) per bond in
their only transactions, last Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Association Francaise des Porteurs d'Emprunts
Russes said the bonds were worth 160 billion francs (32 billion
U.S. dollars), or 38,000 francs per bond, when taking into account
the interest.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted officials of the Ministry of Finance and the Foreign
Ministry as saying that negotiations with Russia over the debt
payment had just begun, and Paris did not expect all 400,000 bonds
be fully refunded.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe
are expected to hold talks today with Chernomyrdin on the debt
issue.
</P>
<P>
Over recent years, Russia has paid all its tsarist debts except
those owed to France and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Russia has attempted to settle the issue with France on several
occasions, including during the signing of the Franco-Russian
Cooperation Treaty in 1992 and during its application for
membership of the Strasbourg-based Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Moscow successfully issued its first international
obligatory bonds since 1917. But the new bonds were not allowed to
enter France because of the unsettled debts.

<HEADLINE> Powers Not to Concentrate in President: Pak Supreme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Supreme Court
will take care that powers should not be concentrated in the hands
of the president, said Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah here today.
</P>
<P>
He made this observation during the hearing of the reference
filed by President Farooq Leghari regarding the appointment of
judges.
</P>
<P>
The chief justice said, while interpreting the constitution,
"We will take care that the federal character of the constitution
is not destroyed and powers should not be concentrated in the
hands of the president."
</P>
<P>
The president filed the reference on September 20, asking the
court if a president is bound to the advice of a prime minister in
appointing judges.
</P>
<P>
The four-judge court heard the counsel of the deposed prime
minister Benazir Bhutto, Senator Iqbal Haider, on presidential
reference on the third consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
Sajjad observed that the eighth amendment, which gives a
president the power to dissolve a national assembly and dismiss a
government, could not be considered as "illegitimate" part of the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
He said the eighth amendment brought about some Islamic
provisions in the constitution, including the setting up of the
Federal Shariat (Religious) Court.
</P>
<P>
He said, "There are also some good points in it."
</P>
<P>
Iqbal Haider was of the view that the amendment was adopted
under intimidation during President General Zia-ul-Haq regime as
it was a condition for lifting the martial law.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the court should do away with the effects of
the amendment which are ultra vires to the original constitution.
</P>
<P>
Four consecutive governments have been dismissed by presidents
since 1988 in Pakistan under the eighth amendment of the
constitution.

<HEADLINE> China Launches "100 Dredger Program" Against Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Aided by foreign investment
and technology, China will build about 100 dredgers within the
next five years to lower river beds and improve the country's
system of flood control.
</P>
<P>
Experts have pointed out that while China has invested heavily
in dam construction, repeated flooding in recent years indicates
that the river bed and the flood water levels have been rising at
a much higher pace, making the dam projects inadequate.
</P>
<P>
For that, the "100 Dredger Program" was initiated by the China
Jianghe Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Power Development
Corporation under the Ministry of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
"Dredgers currently used in China's rivers and lakes are of the
level in the 1950s or 1960s," said Tai Yuanlin, manager of the
company's international cooperation department.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will import only key parts of the dredgers,
and have the whole units built at Sino-foreign joint ventures in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that China welcomes foreign governmental aid for the
project, and would like to see foreign dredger manufacturers with
advanced technology participate in the ambitious program.
</P>
<P>
The official said that his company has made extensive contacts
with dredger producers from Holland, Germany and the United
States, and has recommended appropriate Chinese dredger partners
to some of the foreign companies for cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Returns from APEC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto returned home today to face mounting domestic issues,
after attending an informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The trip, Hashimoto's first abroad since he launched his second
cabinet earlier this month, also included talks with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister now has to turn his attention to key
domestic policy issues which could be tough to deal with.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday the new Administrative Reform Council will begin
discussing how to reduce the 22 government ministries and agencies
to fulfill Hashimoto's pledge to streamline Japan's bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto aims to begin administrative reform by tackling the
question of divesting the Finance Ministry of some powers, but his
Liberal Democratic Party and its main political ally, the Social
Democratic Party, have differing views over the issue.
</P>
<P>
A more immediate concern for Hashimoto is an expanding scandal
involving Health and Welfare Ministry officials and a businessman
heading a welfare group.
</P>
<P>
The premier has acknowledged that he received seven million yen
(64,000 U.S dollars) in donations from political lobbying groups
linked to the Aya Welfare Group.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the money had been properly handled as political
donations and he did not see any problem.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and Health and Welfare
Minister Junichiro Koizumi have also received donations from
lobbying groups.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition New Frontier Party is likely to grill
Hashimoto and the cabinet ministers over the issue.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) announced today that it will observe the
World AIDS Day on November 29, 1996 at African Unity House here.
</P>
<P>
This year's theme -- "one world one hope" -- will characterize
the activities of the day which is the same as that of the 11th
International Conference on AIDS held in Vancouver, Canada in
July, this year, an OAU press release said.
</P>
<P>
This reflects the fact that HIV infection and AIDS are global
problems affecting all countries, the release said.
</P>
<P>
It added preventive measures are achieving good results in
some countries even in hard hit sub-Saharan Africa. This is due
to behavioral change, better management of sexually transmitted
diseases and the positive attitude and openness of some political
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Many people with AIDS have also played a major role in
HIV/AIDS prevention and control by educating and informing the
public, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the therapeutic advances in the management of
HIV/AIDS are still unaffordable in Africa, the release pointed
out, adding that "our hope is the discovery of an effective
vaccine that could be available to all."

<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen from 21 Croatian
companies and some 40 Chinese firms gathered in Beijing to attend
the "Sino-Croatian Talks on Economic, Trade and Technological
Cooperation" from November 25-26.
</P>
<P>
The event was jointly sponsored by the China Extensive Center
for Economic Information Development and the Croatian Embassy in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian visitors, led by the Minister of Economy of the
Republic of Croatia Davor Stern, discussed with the Chinese
businessmen on cooperation in the machinery, chemical, electronic,
agricultural, scientific and technological fields.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Croatian minister briefed the group on the
economic situation in his country, and invited Chinese businessmen
to cooperate with Croatian industries.
</P>
<P>
Croatia has vast potential for cooperation with China, and it
could also serve as a gateway for Chinese companies to enter
Mideast and East-European countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the trade volume between the two
countries stood at 71 million US dollars in 1995, and in the first
nine months this year alone, the figure had reached 64 million US
dollars, up 22 percent over the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In order to accelerate the economic development, Croatia has
adopted a market-oriented economic reform, and a series of
policies have been issued to encourage foreign investment, the
minister said, adding that the Croatian Investment Promotion
Agency has been established for the purpose.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Canadian Relations in Full Swing of Development: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
in his address to the annual meeting of the Canada-China Trade
Council here this afternoon that the development of relations
between China and Canada is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Li said that he had held talks with visiting Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, who attended today's meeting, in a "candid
and friendly atmosphere," and had reached extensive consensus on
further promoting bilateral cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
He said the council, since it was founded 18 years ago, has
contributed to the development of Sino-Canadian friendly
relations, especially to strengthened economic and trade
cooperation. "This we highly value," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the council's annual meeting in Shanghai is an
indication that Canadian businesses and industries greatly value
the development of Sino-Canadian relations.
</P>
<P>
Li outlined China's economic situation to the audience, saying
that in the next five to 15 years, China's annual economic growth
rate will remain between eight and nine percent.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the momentum of sustained, rapid and
healthy growth of the national economy will continue," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China is concentrating efforts on
infrastructural industries of agriculture, energy, transport and
telecommunications, and on pillar industries such as electronics
and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
China will develop cooperation with foreign partners in the
service sector step by step, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said China's investment environment continues to improve,
creating better conditions for equal-footing competition between
Chinese and foreign enterprises and rendering more opportunities
for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government attaches great importance to its
friendly and cooperative relations with Canada, and hoped the
current positive development trend will continue to be
productive.

<HEADLINE> British PM Orders Inquiry Into Budget Leak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major has ordered an inquiry into the leaking of secret government
budget documents to a tabloid newspaper, local media reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Major ordered the inquiry into the case after the Daily Mirror
said it received 36 top secret documents detailing Chancellor of
the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's budget.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street was forced to confirm that the 36 documents,
running to almost l00 pages, were genuine. They included changes
of income tax, capital gains tax, company tax, company car petrol,
profit-related pay, prescription charges and road tax.
</P>
<P>
Details of the annual budget are Britain's most closely-guarded
secret and the leak was the biggest and most explosive in
Britain's history, budget experts said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mirror said it returned the documents to the
government, because "publication of so much detail from the budget
before the chancellor's speech could have forced the stock market
to close and cause chaos in the international money markets."
</P>
<P>
Reports said 32 of the documents were from the Inland Revenue
tax authorities, two from customs and one from the office dealing
with Scottish affairs.
</P>
<P>
A huge police hunt for the leaker or leakers was underway.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Visit Historical Renewal of Ancient Ties: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin's state
visit to the Philippines, the first by a Chinese head of state, is
an occasion for a historic renewal of the ancient ties between the
Philippines and China, said Philippine President Fidel Ramos here
today.
</P>
<P>
He added that his visit to China, in April 1993, was an
important step in the renewal process.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine president made these remarks at a state banquet
given in honor of the visiting Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Chinese navigator Zheng He sailed down to the Philippines three
times in the 15th century while East King of Sulu of the
Philippines went up to visit China some 600 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, divers found a sunken ship off the Pandanan Island in
Palawan near the Philippines. The ship was found carrying close
to 5,000 pieces of various Chinese-and Indonesian-made goods.
</P>
<P>
"The Pandanan wreck, which dates back to about 1414, has been
described as one of the most important archaeological finds of
pre-colonial Philippine treasures," said Ramos at the banquet,
citing the finding as an important footnote in the history of
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said in his return speech that the
Chinese people still remember the spectacular visit by East King
of Sulu who was accompanied by about 300 people.
</P>
<P>
"The forging of diplomatic ties of our two countries in 1975
marked the beginning of a new era of bilateral relationship,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the shared interests of our two peoples that China
and the Philippines maintain a long-term, steady good
neighborliness and an all-round cooperation."
</P>
<P>
China needs a stable and peaceful surrounding to develop while
a developed China will only be conducive to the peace and
development of the entire world, the Chinese president noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang reassured that China is willing to join hands with
Southeast Asian nations, including the Philippines, to forge a
21st-century-oriented partnership based on good neighborliness and
trust.
</P>
<P>
"We should make our contribution to regional and international
peace, stability and prosperity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Broad Prospects for Canada-China Cooperation: Chretien </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Facts have proved that the
sound cooperative partnership between Canada and China has greatly
benefited both countries, visiting Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said here today at the annual meeting of the Canada-China
Trade Council.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister told the participants, including Chinese
Premier Li Peng, that in recognizing the development of bilateral
ties, Canada realizes that the improvement of mutual cooperation
requires sustained efforts from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Canada considers the reinforcement of its relations with China
as an important link in its efforts to expand its trade and its
role in the Asia-Pacific region, Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that Canada, despite its European tradition, is
paying increased attention to Asia, and is proud to be a country
in the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects that the APEC Informal Leadership Meeting,
to be held in Vancouver in November 1997, will push the nation's
"Asia-Pacific Year" activities to a new level, adding he is
looking forward to President Jiang Zemin's visit at that time.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Chretien noted, he and Premier Li Peng called on
the Canada-China Trade Council as well as the industrial and
business circles of both countries to strengthen their efforts to
increase the bilateral trade volume to 20 billion US dollars in
2000. He said he was pleased with the considerable achievements
already made in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Although bilateral cooperation has progressed remarkably, there
is still great potential to be tapped, the Prime Minister pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
The immediate task for Canada and China is to consistently make
full use of the enthusiasm of the people of both countries in
order to promote common prosperity, he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Meets Ministers Over Chechnya Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
met with his defense and interior ministers, Igor Rodionov and
Anatoly Kulikov, today to discuss the final pullout of Russian
troops from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
His spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said the meeting, held in
the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow, focused on issues of a
peace settlement in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The settlement included terms for the planned withdrawal of the
205th army brigade and 101st interior brigade, the last two
Russian military units remaining in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
Under a presidential decree signed by Yeltsin last weekend, the
two brigades should be pulled out by the beginning of next year,
when the Chechnya presidential elections are scheduled to start.
</P>
<P>
The move was condemned by some lawmakers and opposed by
Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov.
</P>
<P>
A great number of lawmakers in the State Duma, the lower house
of the Russian parliament, have blasted the presidential decree
withdrawing all Russian troops from the rebel republic, claiming
it will inevitably lead to Chechnya's cessation from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian national security chief Ivan Rybkin told reporters on
Monday that Kulikov had not agreed to the complete pullout of
Russian troops from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
But Rodionov, recognizing the poor conditions for Russian
servicemen in Chechnya, had backed the withdrawal decision, Rybkin
said.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers briefed Yeltsin during this morning's meeting
on progress in the financing of the armed forces and the interior
troops, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov also presented his report on measures to fight economic
crime, because the president paid special attention to the problem
of combating crime, he added.

<HEADLINE> Another 8,000 Iraqi Refugees Leave Iran for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Another 8,000 Iraqi Kurdish
refugees left Iran's Siran-Band refugee camp in Baneh, Kurdestan
province, for their home country, an official report said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a total of about 56,000 Iraqi refugees have
returned from Iran to Iraq. Some 19,000 Kurdish refugees still
remain in the Iranian camps.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Haj-Ali, head of the provincial office for foreign
nationals, said that the refugees left the camp due to cold
weather.
</P>
<P>
Everyday some 40,000 liters of fuel is distributed among the
Kurdish refugees in this camp, but it is insufficient, the
official was quoted by Iran's official news agency IRNA as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) has so far taken no measure to provide refugees with
shelters suitable for the winter cold.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government had asked the international community
for 10 million U.S. dollars assistance to Iraqi refugees pouring
into the border regions due to the Kurdish factional fighting in
northern Iraq two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Kurdish refugees fled to Iran in September after
forces of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) pulled out of
northern Iraq in the wake of a joint Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) and Iraqi government forces attack.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that it had received a total of 75,000 refugees
and they were sheltered in seven camps in three Iranian provinces
of West Azarbaijan, Kurdestan and Kermanshahan.

MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Rodionov held talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, Alexander
Kuzmuk, here this afternoon on military cooperation and army
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Viktor Baranets told
reporters that the two ministers would also exchange opinions on

However, diplomats here believe that Rodionov and Kuzmuk would

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Canadian Premiers Hold Talks in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng held
talks here today with visiting Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, who flew here from Manila, the Philippines, for a
working visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Chretien had a successful meeting with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin in Manila three days ago, and that
maintaining high-level contacts is important for advancing the
friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China is a developing country, which is
experiencing a positive momentum in its economic development.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to follow its reform and opening-up policy,
and to increase its cooperation with Canada in all fields, he
added, including mutually-beneficial cooperation in economy and
trade conducted on equal footing.
</P>
<P>
This conforms to the common interests of the two sides, Li
noted.
</P>
<P>
The third phase of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, jointly
constructed by the two countries, is the largest economic
cooperative project undertaken by China and Canada since they
forged diplomatic ties, Li said, adding that he hoped that the two
countries will make joint efforts to settle problems in their
negotiations, to ensure that the project will be of high quality.
</P>
<P>
While China is building its socialist market economy system,
the two countries have their own distinct advantages, so there is
a large room for Sino-Canadian cooperation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said that he was pleased to visit China for a second
time in two years, and that each time he comes to the country, he
can see great changes and progress that have taken place.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are currently experiencing sound bilateral
relations, the Canadian prime minister said, and it is our common
aspiration to strengthen cooperation and promote bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' trade volume goal of 20 billion Canadian
dollars by the end of the century may be reached ahead of time,
Chretien predicted.
</P>
<P>
"I place importance on jointly constructing a heavy water
nuclear reactor," he said. "We will abide by the contract and
timely handle any problems that may occur during work on the
project."
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two premiers attended the signing ceremony
of a commercial contract for Sino-Canadian Joint Construction of
the Qinshan Candu Nuclear Power Plant, and an opening ceremony for
the Sino-Canadian Zhonghong Life Insurance Company.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- An advance team of experts
from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) will fly to
Rwanda to provide emergency agricultural assistance for refugees
returning from Zaire, a FAO news release here said.
</P>
<P>
The six-member team, led by FAO Director-General Jacques
Diouf, will arrive in Rwanda this weekend to help coordinate
emergency farming assistance for the settlement of more than one
million refugees and displaced rural people hit by the current
crisis in central Africa, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
The great majority of returning refugees are farmers displaced
by the upheavals in Rwanda and Burundi that began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the government of Rwanda, additional FAO
technicians will be sent later to provide assistance to the
country to help rehabilitate its hard-pressed sector of
agriculture and livestock.
</P>
<P>
The FAO estimated that as of November 17, a total of nearly
five million U.S. Dollars in emergency agricultural aid is needed
for a total of more than 2.3 million people in the Great Lakes
region.

<HEADLINE> US, Jordan To Conclude Investment Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and Jordan have
nearly completed the drafting of a bilateral investment treaty,
U.S. Ambassador to Jordan Wesley Egan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are quite close to signing the agreement," said the
ambassador, quoted by today's edition of the English daily Jordan
Times. "We could (sign it) in a few months" perhaps even before
the end of the year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egan said negotiations on the accord were speeded up after
parallel but linked talks on protection for intellectual property
rights were separated.
</P>
<P>
He added the bilateral investment agreement would provide
U.S. and Jordanian investors operating in each other's
territories six basic protections.
</P>
<P>
The provisions of the proposed agreement include limits on
expropriation of investments and prompt and adequate compensation
for investors, and the right to transfer investment-related funds
into and outside the country. They also include limits on the
host government's rights to impose performance requirements on
investments, binding international arbitration, and the right of
the investor to engage senior personnel of the investor's own
choice regardless of nationality.
</P>
<P>
American banks and government funding agencies consider the
existence of such a bilateral agreement as a highly favorable
point while considering financing for U.S. firms investing in a
foreign country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador also reiterated that Washington was
committed to supporting Jordan's economic development and fully
backed the kingdom's entry to the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
He said his country had taken a series of measures to help
the kingdom's economy in overall development in the current
year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration granted 200 million dollars in export
credit guarantees and insurance through the Eximbank, and another
batch of 40 million dollars in commodity credits, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Washington also provided Jordan with 21 million dollars in
soft loans financing for grain purchases and 1.25 million
dollars to conduct studies on expanding and upgrading
communications facilities and management, according to the
U.S. envoy.
</P>
<P>
Egan said that the two countries concluded an "Open Skies"
agreement this year under which Jordanian aircraft are allowed
to fly in and out of the United States without any restrictions
on frequency or destination, adding that Jordan was the only
country to receive such U.S. treatment other than European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The last American gesture toward Jordan was granting the
kingdom the status of a non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) ally that give "priority consideration" for its requests
for advanced military technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
He held that Washington was the main force behind ensuring
negotiations between Jordan and the WTO as scheduled in late
October because it felt that it was "critically important" that
the talks began as planned.
</P>
<P>
"We fully support Jordan's accession to the WTO," said the
ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Meets with British Senior Army Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhu) -- Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of
China's Central Military Commission and minister of national
defense, met with Field Marshal Peter Inge, chief of the British
Defense Staff, in the Great Hall of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi said he hopes that China and Britain can use Inge's China
visit to increase relations between the armies of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chi extended a warm welcome to Field Marshal Inge on his first
trip to China, saying that he is the first most senior army
officer to visit China in the past years. This is a major event in
the annals of Sino-British relations and signifies progress in
relations between the two armies, Chi added.
</P>
<P>
China places great importance on Inge's visit, Chi said, noting
that the visit shows that the Sino-British relations and the
relations between the two armies are good in general trend of
development.
</P>
<P>
The visit is of practical significance, because China is to
resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in just over 200
days, and that China is confident of the transfer of the power,
Chi said.
</P>
<P>
China and Britain are influential powers in the world today,
and the establishment of long-term relations on the threshold of
the 21st century benefits both countries, as well as the peace and
development of the world, Chi stressed.
</P>
<P>
Inge said that his visit to China shows the importance the
British government attaches not only to the relations between the
two armies but also to the bilateral relations between the two
countries, and that he shares Chi's view that the two countries
should correctly handle British-Chinese relations from a long-term
point of view so as to make the relations "stronger and stronger."

Singapore businessmen to enter the Latin American market.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's consumer base of 94 million people and strong

for Singapore businessmen, he said.
</P>

a goal that Mexico and Singapore can work together to achieve in
the 21st century," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Salvage of Famous Sunken Warship Enters Second Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Salvagers of a famous warship
that sank in the Yangtze River nearly 60 years ago started today
to remove sand and mud from the wreckage before hoisting it from
the water.
</P>
<P>
The warship, named "Chungshan" after Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the
forerunner of China's democratic revolution, was sunk by Japanese
bombers in 1938 near Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
The salvage attempt, which started in November 12 and is
expected to end next February, commemorates the 130th anniversary
of Dr. Sun's birth.
</P>
<P>
The salvage team consists of eight ships. One of them, which is
75 meters long, 10.5 meters wide, and weighs 1,000 tons, was
attached to the warship with seven thick steel cables during the
first phase of salvage work.
</P>
<P>
"Our divers worked underwater 38 times, for a total of more
than 360 minutes," said Chen Huaxiang, vice director of the
salvage project.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou Chongfa, director of the cultural relics
department of Hubei Province, removal of mud and sand is of
critical importance to the ultimate success of the salvage.
</P>
<P>
"During the past 58 years, sand and mud deposited in the sunken
warship have reached over 800 cubic meters, which weigh an
estimated 1,000-plus tons, while the warship itself only weighs
780 tons," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The more sand and mud is removed, the easier the salvage work
will be," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that workers will use a high-pressure air pump, which
is currently being installed.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to remove all the sand and mud within a period of 30
days or so," he revealed.

<HEADLINE> US Companies to Explore Oil in China's Bohai Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- US companies Occidental
Petroleum Corp. and Texaco Inc. today signed an oil exploration
contract with China covering a 2340-square-kilometer area in
the western part of Bohai Bay.
</P>
<P>
This is the 122nd oil contract signed between foreign companies
and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, code-named ``09/18," the two American oil
companies will be solely responsible for all exploration risks
within the exploratory period. Each of the US companies has 50
percent interest in the contract, and Texaco Inc. will act as the
operator.
</P>
<P>
The two companies had previously spent one year on the
collection and research of the seismic data taken from the sea
area, at depths ranging from 10 to 20 meters.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and foreign geologists place high hopes on the
contracted area, said an CNOOC official.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, with constant progress made in the
research of the geology of Bohai Bay, and a group of new
discoveries through China's self-financed exploration, more and
more foreign companies are setting their sights on the area. At
present, 11 Sino-foreign contracts for oil exploration in the area
are being carried out.
</P>
<P>
Bohai Bay will see a new rush of cooperation in oil exploration
next year, the official predicted, adding that plans are underway
to sink more than 10 wildcat wells there.
</P>
<P>
Four oil and gas fields currently are operating in Bohai
Bay. They are expected to produce more than two million tons of
crude oil and 400 million cubic meters of natural gas, the
official revealed.
</P>
<P>
He said that another seven fields will be developed in the bay
next year, and that by the end of this century, crude oil
production in the bay will increase considerably.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Announces Draft Budget for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has unveiled a 1916
million-dinar (about 2682.4 million dollars) draft budget for
fiscal 1997 with a 3.9 percent deficit, which meets the target
set by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget, which was approved by the cabinet Saturday
and will be sent to the Parliament for endorsement by the
end of this year, shows an 11.1 percent increase over the
budget for fiscal 1996, today's English daily Jordan Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Minister of Finance Marwan Awad was quoted by the
newspaper as saying that "it is an austerity budget in line with
our economic restructuring program and we aim to achieve the goal
of 2.5 percent budget deficit by the year 1998."
</P>
<P>
In specific budget terms, the deficit is 56 million dinars
(about 78.4 million dollars), but the actual deficit - when an
expected foreign assistance of 169 million dinars (236.6 million
dollars) are excluded from the budget - is 225 million dinars
(about 315 million dollars), or 3.9 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The deficit for fiscal 1996 stood at 237 million dinars
(about 331.8 million dollars), or 4.6 percent of the GDP, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 draft budget envisages total revenues of 1,860
million dinars (about 2604 million dollars) with an increase of
6 percent over 1996, while the total expenditures are estimated
at 1,916 dinars with an increase of 8.2 percent compared
with the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
"We have managed to bring down the deficit from 24 percent of
the gross domestic product (GDP) (in 1989) to 3.9 percent in
1997," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced that the government planned no
cuts in direct compensation, which was introduced last
August to offset the price hikes of the bread after lifting
the bread subsidies, while no new tax or fees or increase in
existing levies is planned for 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was not planning any wage increase for
the civil servants and that the budget allocates funds for a
"social security safety net" that involves improved medical and
social services as well as national health insurance for
all.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Calls APEC Meeting A Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard today claimed the just-ended fourth informal
leadership meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum was a success.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters tonight upon his arrival in Canberra from
the Philippines, he said, "It was a good meeting from Australia's
point of view, because the process of trade liberalization --
which will, if implemented by everybody, generate thousands of
jobs for Australians and the region on general."
</P>
<P>
Howard said he had cleared up misunderstandings with China at
the forum. "There were some misunderstandings, but they in my view
have been substantially cleared away."
</P>
<P>
But Howard refused to comment when asked if he was concerned
about the racism debate in Australia, as Mahathir had told
reporters at APEC that his country was concerned about the racism
debate that was triggered by Independent MP Pauline Hanson during
the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Manila, Howard said he planned to step up
efforts to convince Australians the APEC free trade agenda was
worth the price in short-term job losses and dislocation.
</P>
<P>
APEC's target of free trade for developed economies by 2010,
and developing economies by 2020 meant more jobs, faster economic
growth and higher living standards for Australians.

goal-keeper Bonano put up real superb saves to keep the score
deadlocked.

ball within the penalty area and beat the desperate River Plate
goal-keeper with a right-foot thunder.

River Plate fought desperately, trying to get an equaliser.
But Juventus goal-keeper Angelo Peruzzi blocked the shots and kept

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China appreciates the
contribution of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (DRP) and its
chairman Pena Gomez to the friendship between China and Dominica
over the past few years, Hu Jintao, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party
(CPC) Central Committee, said here today.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Gomez at the Great Hall of the People, Hu
welcomed Gomez on his second visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the Chinese government has long been pursuing the
independent foreign policy of peace, which emphasizes establishing
solidarity and cooperation with developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to work together with the DRP and other friends
to further advance our bilateral economic and trade cooperation,
increase friendly contact and exchange between political parties
and non-governmental groups, deepen understanding, develop
friendship and create proper conditions for the normalization of
relations between China and Dominica on the basis of the five
principles of peaceful co-existence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gomez expressed his thanks for the meeting, and said that he
and the DRP cherish their friendship with China and its people.
</P>
<P>
He said that although Dominica currently has no diplomatic ties
with China, he believes that China is a great country which should
not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
"I am willing to make efforts for the further development of
friendly relations between Latin American countries and China," he
added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> French Truckers Continue Blockade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- French truckers continued this
morning to block roads and gas supply centers across the country,
and extended their protest to the island of Corsica.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) reported that marathon closed-door
negotiations between delegations from the unions and trucking
employers ended at 6:00 this morning, in a Ministry of Transport
building.
</P>
<P>
The mediator, Robert Cros, said that delegations showed a
"positive attitude" towards a government proposal which called for
an end to the blockade and reduction of weekly working time.
</P>
<P>
Cros said the negotiations had made "significant progress."
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Alain Lamassoure said the government was
"reasonably optimistic" this morning and expected "a very rapid
solution" to the conflict which also affected trucking in
neighboring European Union (EU) countries including Britain,
Germany, Benelux and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The EU appears powerless to intervene in the row since its
labor codes don't include clauses involving on-going disputes.
</P>
<P>
The French government is increasingly concerned that the
dispute could extend to other transport fields including trains
and planes, and Prime Minister Alain Juppe has urged the two sides
to take paths which "lead to something."
</P>
<P>
The union delegation refused to comment on the negotiations,
under instructions from union leaders.
</P>
<P>
AFP reported that the blockade remained practically unchanged
today on the roads of the departments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais,
while the last gas supply center in the department of
Ille-et-vilaine was blocked this morning.
</P>
<P>
Gas shortages were reported in several departments of France,
as many gas supply centers have been blocked by the striking
truckers.
</P>
<P>
About 30 trucks today also blocked a gas supply center in
Marana, south of Bastia in Corsica, which provides all gas for the
Upper Corsica department, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the unions have threatened to take new action if
the negotiations, which were to resume this afternoon after a
break, failed to produce anything soon.

MACAO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A legal agency offering service
related to China's inland areas was inaugurated here today to meet
the growing demands in handling legal cases involving both Macao
and the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The agency, as a pioneer of its kind in Macao, offers such
services as law consultations, handling of legal lawsuit involving
 economy, civil affairs, criminal affairs and administrative
procedures, among other legal affairs in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jian, general manager of the China Legal Service (Macao),
said that his agency aims to provide service to all residents and
legal persons in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"We will provide a wide-range legal service to all our clients
in Macao," he said. "We hope to contribute to the exchange and
cooperation in civil and economic affairs between Macao and the
inland areas."
</P>
<P>
Differences in law in the two sides often cause trouble in
handling legal cases involving both places. Many people have
complained that they are unaware of the law information of the
other side or can not find people to handle legal procedures for
them.
</P>
<P>
The agency is composed of six lawyers and notaries who have
rich experience in court. Xu himself was chief of division of
China's Ministry of Justice.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and his Philippine counterpart, Fidel Ramos, reached a consensus
at their meeting here today that the two countries should strive
for a 21st-century-oriented good neighborliness based on trust and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is paying a two-day state visit to this country,
suggested to Ramos that the two countries promote understanding
and trust through high-level visits and contacts.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's current visit is the first ever by a Chinese head of

1975.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, Jiang invited Ramos to visit China and
the Philippine president accepted the invitation.

Jiang cited as proof of improved bilateral relations the
exchange of visits by senior military officials of the two
countries and the establishment of consulates-general.

<P>
Ramos said he hoped that the Philippine and Chinese governments
and peoples will exert more efforts to boost economic cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also urged further development of
bilateral trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China and the Philippines should strengthen
cooperation in international and regional affairs while expanding
people-to-people exchanges to promote an all-round development of
bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> European Union Renews Sanctions Against Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, Bovember 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Monday renewed its sanctions on Nigeria, which it imposed on the
military regime after it convicted and hanged writer author
Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni leaders in November last year.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers said in a statement that although
there have been modest improvement in Nigeria, the general
situation does not warrant a reversal of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The EU sanctions, which will be extended for another six
months, include an arms embargo and a ban of entry by top
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The renewal of the sanctions is believed to be a major setback
to the Nigerian government, which is anxious to win the support
of the international community and get the sanctions removed.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to return to the Commonwealth of nations, from which
it was temporarily expelled last year, the government released
last week chief Gani Fawehinmi and two other human rights
activists during the visit of the Commonwealth ministerial action
group.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the air force on Monday, Nigerian head of state
Sani Abacha admitted that the sanctions had adversely affected the
operations of the Nigerian air force.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: World's Highest Rape Figure Recorded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- An official report
issued to the public by the police of South Africa said the
country has witnessed the highest rape figure in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, issued on Monday in Pretoria by
South African Police Service, reported rapes rose from 69 per
100,000 people in the first eight months of last year to more
than 73 in the some period this year.
</P>
<P>
Describing this finding as very worryig, Safety and Security
Minister Sydney Mufamadi told the press: "It warrants urgent
action by the police and the criminal justice system in general."
</P>
<P>
A recent study of 1000 women by the Human Sciences Research Council
also revealed the some situation.
</P>
<P>
At least half a million South African women are raped,
battered and killed every year and of those admitted to
hospitals, 46 percent are abused by their husbands, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the emotional and physical pain of abuse, 75
percent of women turn to tranquillisers or anti-depressants and
about 53 percent abuse alcohol and 54 attempt suicide, said the
study.
</P>
<P>
Sally Shackleton, of People Opposing Women Abuse (POWA),told
the "Sowetan" on Monday that 133,309 couples got married in 1994
in the country, and 29,878 divorce cases were recorded.
</P>
<P>
"Violence against women was cited in half of all divorce
actions," she said.
</P>
<P>
POWA found that 200 cases showed that 80 women were either
murdered by their husbands or had committed suicide after a
series of emotional and physical abuses.
</P>
<P>
The National Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the
Rehabilitation of Offenders (NICRO) have found out that only one
in 20 rapes is reported to the police daily.
</P>
<P>
NICRO reported that rapes in South Africa rose from 19,308 to
27,056 between 1988 and 1993. There was a increase of 40 percent
by the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the Network on Violence Against Women in
Johannesburg and Pretoria regions, a woman is raped every 83
seconds or killed every six days by her partner.
</P>
<P>
Several government and non-government organizations met on Monday
on the International Day of No Violence Against Women. They have
planned various activities to address the problem.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Smallist Zoo Amuses Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- While chaos and fighting
rock the Somali capital Mogadishu, it is so amazing to find out
that the city still enjoys a mini-zoo with many clients.
</P>
<P>
The smallest zoo in the world is now open to public in south
Mogadishu. This zoo contains only one lioness called Amina. Mr
Issa Arab Halane, 40, maintains the lioness, Amina, in a small
cage inside a small room in Hamar Weyn District of south
Mogadishu controlled by faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Mr Halane whom I met yesterday told me he had kept Amina, four
years old, for three years. He said he bought Amina and other
other lions one of which which he had regretfully lost in
Bardera, about 365 km southwest of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A third lion, a masculine one died a year earlier after it got
terribly sick, "I still regret that I had refused to sell it to a
foreigner during UNOSOM's presence with 30,000 U.S. Dollars
before its death," said Mr Halane.
</P>
<P>
Amina, a very happy and energetic lioness salutes Mr Halane by
stretching its arm to him as he comes close to her and then licks
his hand. Mr Halane says, "Salarmu Alaikum!" and sings to her in
the Somali language.
</P>
<P>
He trains Amina and she dances quite well with him. Mr Halane
feeds Amina with five to 10 kg of uncooked meat daily, in
addition to 10 litters of water.
</P>
<P>
A number of people go to see Amina every day and Mr Halane
charges his clients with 500 Somali Shillings each person. He
said he can make about 5000 shillings in the normal days, while
on Thursday and Friday (the weekends here in Somalia), he makes
as much as 20,000 shillings, which is hardly three US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mr Halane said this amount of money is not enough for the two
of them, but that his relatives and firends also offer him some
money to keep the animal alive.
</P>
<P>
He is ready to sell Amina to any interested Somali or
foreigner if the price is negotiable, he told me. He's afraid
Amina is becoming mature. "I am afraid she might get nervous and
bite every body, " said Mr Halane.
</P>
<P>
Mr Halane has trained several other animals before, including
dig-dig and bucks, but he said the lions are smart compared with
others.
</P>
<P>
There's been no single zoo in Somalia ever since the civil war
broke out in 1991. Nobody knows about the fate of the animals
that rushed out of the only zoo in Mogadishu near Afgoe along the
Ex-21 October Road.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Welcomes Investment in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar, which is rich in
agricultural land resources and relatively cheap agricultural
labor, welcomes local and foreign investors to put their money in
the sector.
</P>
<P>
Investment in agriculture can be made in the form of joint
ventures or 100 percent investment or on a profit-sharing basis,
according to the Foreign Investment Commission of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Rights to cultivate and utilize arable land and fallow and
waste land for agriculture and livestock breeding purposes are
being granted with land area and duration of use prescribed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Myanmar Ministry of Agriculture and
Irrigation, trade-agricultural commodities can be purchased both
from the state and private companies for export while agricultural
inputs, seeds, machinery and construction materials for dam and
weir construction can be imported.
</P>
<P>
Setting up of agriculture-based industries or upgrading of the
existing ones are also welcome.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been building more and more irrigation facilities
to effectively use its water resources for agriculture, industries
and urban and rural water supply.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 dam and reservoir projects have been completed
since 1988 when the State Law and Order Restoration Council took
over the state power in the country and 36 new irrigation
facilities with a capacity to irrigate 0.648 million hectares of
land are being built, of which 18 are scheduled to be completed by
next year.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector, which is the mainstay of the country's
economy, accounts for about 38 percent of the total GDP and about
40 percent of foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's rice output in the
1995-96 fiscal year was 19 million tons, of which 353,100 tons
were exported. The target for the 1996-97 fiscal year is a
production of 20 million tons, of which 1 million tons are to be
for export.
</P>
<P>
The country is striving for an annual growth rate of 5.4
percent for its agriculture in the next five years.

<P>
The modernization move was prompted by the November 12 midair
collision between a Saudi Airlines Boeing 747 and a Kazakh Il-76
near Delhi which killed all 349 people aboard. The accident was
the worst of its kind in India's aviation history.

PARIS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Five major trade unions of France transportation sectors
Monday called for support to the truckers who have been on a
week-long strike by blocking highways across the country. The
negotiations between the unions and employers resumed Monday
evening, as the government is more and more worried about the
extension of the protest to railways and airports.
</P>
<P>
-- A study by the Observatory of Decentralized Social Action, a
non-government organization, said that among the 25 million
working people in France, 5 million can be considered as being
excluded from the job market.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Monday was marked by a considerable increase of the number
of blockades on the roads in France, set up by striking
truckers. Meanwhile, difficult negotiations between truckers
and their employers resumed Monday evening, with the bosses
saying the workers' requests for higher pay, shorter work week
and earlier retirement was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
-- The Ebola epidemic disease has claimed its first victim in
South Africa, a 46-year-old nurse who was believed to be affected
with the deadly disease when taking care of a Gabonese doctor. The
latter, however, has recovered from his disease.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin today began a

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Parliament Approves Government's Bill to Join OECD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The National Assembly of South
Korea today approved a government bill for accession to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
paving the way for the country's official membership by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Of the 262 legislators participating in the ballot, 159 voted
for the move and 101 voted against it with two abstentions.
</P>
<P>
In the debate before the voting, nine lawmakers spoke for and
against the OECD admission.
</P>
<P>
The proponents said that the admission to the OECD will lead
South Korea to a second political and economic take-off and a
better life for the people.
</P>
<P>
However, the opponents argued that the opening of the financial
market after the admission will hurt the basis of South Korea's
economy and weaken industrial competitiveness due to the price
increases and the outflow of wealth.
</P>
<P>
Seoul signed an agreement on its accession to the OECD at the
end of last month after the OECD Council invited the country to
join the club of advanced countries on October 11.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will officially become the 29th OECD member when it
deposits an admission document with the OECD Secretariat in Paris
before December 25.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Ten percent of the income of
Xianyang, a city in Shaanxi Province, is coming from taxes paid by
non-government technology-intensive companies.
</P>
<P>
"Non-government technology-intensive companies have entered a
new development phase and are becoming a part of Shaanxi's
economic growth," Sun Haiying, director of the Provincial Science
and Technology Commission, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The number of non-government technology-intensive enterprises
has grown from 1,000 in 1991 to 6,477 at present. Their income has
grown from 544 million yuan to 7.1 billion yuan, with eight of
them reporting an annual income of 100 million yuan each. They
also employ 13 percent of the province's science workers.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, non-government technology-intensive
enterprises have produced 4,293 new products in the past few
years, 45 percent of which are hi-tech products.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, the enterprises reported more than 14
billion yuan in income and nearly 1.4 billion yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
The city's Haixing Science and Technology Industry Group, the

councillor and defense minister, will pay a ten-day official visit
to the United States in early December at the invitation of US
Defense Secretary William Perry.

</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Chi's forthcoming visit is a
reciprocal one to the China trip made by US Defense Secretary
Perry in October 1994.

<P>
It is an important visit to be made at a time when the
relations between China and the United States and between their
armies have improved to some extent, and its aim is to increase
mutual understanding and further improve the relations between the
two countries and their armies, added Cui.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, according to the spokesman, Chi Haotian is
expected to hold talks with Perry on issues of mutual concern, to

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Discovers World's Largest Titanium Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has recently
discovered titanium deposits which are larger than the confirmed
total reserves in the world, Yonhap News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The largest titanium deposit in the world was discovered in an
orthite bed in Hadong and Sanchong counties of South Korea's South
Kyongsang Province as a result of a precision survey and analysis
of minerals launched in 1986, Yonhap quoted a geological research
team from Chungnam National University as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kim Won-sa, one of the two professors who lead the team, said
that a 200-meter-deep drilling survey confirmed titanium reserves
of some 50 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The 70-meter-wide, 15-kilometer-long and 8-kilometer-deep
titanium deposit is estimated to have total reserves of two
billion tons, nearly three times the world's confirmed aggregate
titanium reserves of 760 million tons, Yonhap said.
</P>
<P>
The economic value of the newly found reserves of two billion
tons is estimated at 132.8 billion U.S. dollars based on the 1995
price of imported titanium ore.
</P>
<P>
"If we manage to commercialize the recently-discovered titanium
deposits and develop the necessary processing technology, South
Korea will be able not only to meet domestic demand, but also to
export," professor Kim said.
</P>
<P>
Titanium, which is much lighter than steel, but highly
heat-and-corrosion-resistant, is an indispensable material in
making alloys for supersonic aircraft, space shuttle vessels and
submarines.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton today reaffirmed his country's "enduring engagement in the
Asia Pacific region and the lasting and proud friendship with
Thailand."
</P>
<P>
Making a policy speech at Chulalongkorn University here, he
recalled the history of friendship and cooperation between the two
countries during the 164-year-history of U.S.-Thai relations, in
particular since World War II in the military, trade and in social
development.
</P>
<P>
He commended Thailand as being an economic powerhouse in
Southeast Asia and Thailand's achievements in various economic and
social fields.
</P>
<P>
He cited the many challenges and perils in the future which
face all countries in the world, such as the spread of HIV/AIDS,
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, global drug
trafficking and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries must now deepen their partnership for
the demands of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He promised that his administration will continue to work
together with Thailand in such fields as environment, control of
the AIDS epidemic, protection of women from becoming prostitutes,
crackdown on organized crime and on drug trafficking network.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries still have challenges to meet, still
have opportunities to seize, and still have much to learn from one
another.
</P>
<P>
He said all should work together to eradicate social evils so
that the young generation will not have to face the menace of the
perils.
</P>
<P>
He said that with 2 million jobs and 40 percent of the United
States' trade tied with the Asia-Pacific region, the United
States' commitment to the region today is stronger than ever, "for
in the 21st century, America's future cannot be secure if Asia's
future is in doubt."

<HEADLINE> Bumper Harvest Forces Producer to Ship Out Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Leading grain producer Jilin
Province has shipped two million tons of maize stocks to southern
China to make enough warehouses space for its bumper grain harvest
this year.
</P>
<P>
The northeast China province expects to reap a grain harvest
topping 23 billion kilograms this year, compared with 20 billion
kilograms last year.
</P>
<P>
The province expects to purchase new grain amounting to 15
billion kilograms from local farmers, far exceeding its present
warehouse capacity.
</P>
<P>
If the problem is not solved, it will be difficult for farmers
to sell all the grain they want to sell to the State, provincial
sources said.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the storage of the bumper harvest, the State
Council, the country's cabinet, made an emergency decision in
August for Jilin to ship out part of its grain stocks to 16
provinces and municipalities in southern China, which are major
grain consumers in the country.
</P>
<P>
The grain-shipping plan took only 70 days to complete, with
the last consignment of 18 million tons leaving Jilin yesterday,
paving the way for the coming grain purchase period in north China.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Ministry of Internal Trade told Xinhua that
part of the maize from Jilin will be stored as State grain
reserves, and part will be marketed according to local needs.
</P>
<P>
China has set up a grain reserve system at both
Central-governmental and local-governmental levels, in order to
meet the possible grain emergencies.

<HEADLINE> World's Biggest Multi-Purpose Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A system that can be used to
oversee public security, which is quite possibly the biggest of
its kind in the world, has been developed in Xi'an, capital of
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the system, which can handle 15,000 clients at
one time, is expected to modernize the nation's security work, and
will have great significance in a broad range of applications.
</P>
<P>
Similar systems being used in other countries frequently deal
with only about 4,000 clients.
</P>
<P>
Experts say when a user reports a problem over the network,
information is immediately made available at the control center
within 0.3 second, a method that can ultimately make things a
great deal easier for police.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the system's services are useful not
only for banks and museums, but also for various types of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The system operates within a supervision radius of 90
kilometers, but, according to experts, could be designed to cover
an entire province or even a larger area if necessary, by using
more advanced, but already available, technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met
today in Shanghai with Sergio Diez, president of the Chilean
Senate.
</P>
<P>
The premier expressed his gratitude for the hospitability he
received during his recent visit to Chile, and described the tour
as successful.
</P>
<P>
Both as developing countries enjoying respective economic
advantages, China and Chile are economically complementary and
face similar problems, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the co-operation between the two
countries in the development of mineral resources would witness
substantial progress through the joint efforts of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The premier pointed out that contact between the Chilean
parliament and the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC)
constitutes an important part of Sino-Chilean ties, hoping that
exchanges between the two organizations would promote the friendly
co-operation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Diez on China's political system and the
important role the NPC plays in the national political life of
China.
</P>
<P>
Diez said that Chile and China, both Pacific countries and
members of APEC, have maintained sound bilateral ties, and to
advance their political, economic and cultural exchanges, will
bring about benefits to both.
</P>
<P>
Chile emphasizes drawing on China's experiences, he said, and
just like China, Chile holds that no country has the authority to
interfere into the internal affairs of other countries. He said
that any country has the right to choose its own political system,
and that only by treating each other equally, can world countries
co-exist peacefully.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Liu Keshen, a teacher of
Japanese language at the Shanghai University of Traditional
Chinese Medicine, crammed a piece of bread into his mouth and
gulped some milk, looked at his watch, and walked faster, eating
breakfast the way he does almost every day - on the way to work.
</P>
<P>
Liu returned from Japan after finishing a Ph.D. and, in
addition to his teaching, works part-time as a translator for a
Japanese-funded company and as a guide for a tourist agency. To
keep track of all this, he has a daily schedule posted on the
living-room door: "I'm so busy I don't get to sleep before
midnight every day," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although not everybody is as overloaded as Liu, who needs a
schedule to arrange his life, still the residents of Shanghai,
China's largest city, seem to be busier than the city itself.
</P>
<P>
Some are busy attending night school to further their
education, some hold part-time jobs, some are looking for better
jobs, and some hang about the stock exchange looking for hot
tips. It is often quite difficult to find someone unless you make
an appointment first.
</P>

of other residents, who not only enjoy more opportunities than any
other city in China, but also face more challenges in the city's
development drive, and never have so profoundly understood the
meaning of the expression "Time is money".
</P>
<P>
There are more motorcycles on the city's streets and
express-mail has become a popular postal service. And people are

Fast food. Fast film developing. "Fast" has become a fashion

<HEADLINE> Medicinal Chamber of Commerce Set Up in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A medicinal Chamber of
Commerce has been set up in Shantou, one of China's Special
Economic Zones, in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Officials believe that the continuous establishment of five
chambers of commerce in different industries points to a merging
trend among the city's different professions.
</P>
<P>
An official pointed out that fiercer competition and improved
living standards of local people have pressed hundreds of drug
stores, as well as state-owned and private medicinal enterprises
in the city, to unite.
</P>
<P>
The official also attributed the establishment of the medicinal
Chamber of Commerce to the fact that the city's pharmaceutical
industry is eager to standardize the behavior of related
enterprises to strike a heavy blow to rampant counterfeiting and
low-quality medicines on the market.
</P>
<P>
He urged all members of the chamber of commerce to join hands
in promoting the healthy development of the city's pharmaceutical
industry, and prohibiting the production and sale of illicit
medicines.

<HEADLINE> China Completes Property Rights Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China has completed a
nationwide registration of property rights in party and government
administrative institutions, schools, and research institutes,
according to the State Administration of State Property (SASP).
</P>
<P>
The registration campaign shows that the 460,000 units have a
combined asset value of 1.05 trillion yuan (about 126.5 billion US
dollars), about 18 percent of the total amount of all state-owned
property.
</P>
<P>
The latest effort to register property rights is aimed at
curbing the loss of state assets and improving the distribution
and use of available assets, said Pan Yue, deputy director-general
of the SASP.
</P>
<P>
"For years, fund appropriations for national defense and
educational systems, research institutes, and party and government
departments have guaranteed their development and accumulated a
great deal of assets for the State," Pan said.
</P>
<P>
However, assets in these units are being lost due to various
reasons, such as random leasing, lending and disposal of assets,
Pan noted.
</P>
<P>
Official data shows that China's state-owned assets were valued
at 5.192 trillion yuan at the end of March last year.

<HEADLINE> Cradle of Bright Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- When He Youlin, the
headmaster of the Zhangshan Memorial Middle School, found out that
322 of his students who graduated this past summer had all been
accepted by colleges and universities, he thought it a fitting
memorial for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's 130th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The school was founded in memory of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in 1934 in
his home village of Cuiheng in Guangdong province. The characters
for the school's name were written by Dr. Sun's wife Soong Ching
Ling who was an honorary president of China.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yat-sen is known as the founder of China's democratic
revolution. He led the overthrow of China's last dynasty, the Qing
(1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
He Youlin said that teachers and students at the middle school
always remember Dr. Sun's behest, and his belief that working for
development and training people are the basis of a strong country.
</P>
<P>
This is the third year that all of the school, which is known
around the province for the high quality of its students, has had
all its graduates accepted by colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
"Zhongshan School was not born with this honor," He noted, and
went on to say that the students it recruits each year are not
necessarily the best, but that the key is how to train them to
be the best. They are encouraged to have varied interests, and
more than 50 clubs have been formed to give them extracurricular
training in science and technology, sports, the arts, and work.
</P>
<P>
The school holds science and technology, art, and sports
programs every year, while workshops on Chinese and foreign music,
and art, calligraphy, and photography exhibitions are held even
more frequently.
</P>
<P>
The school also emphasizes the shaping of virtue, and students
are taken to visit Dr. Sun's house and are provided with education
in patriotism.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the school formed a partnership with a school in a
poverty-stricken mountainous part of northern Guangdong, and
students began to save money to help poor students at the partner
school.
</P>
<P>
There are no janitors to do the clean-up at the school. Every
student is responsible for certain cleaning duties. School leaders
also arrange two periods of labor each week, when they work
together to teach a love of labor.
</P>
<P>
"We are very confident that Zhongshan School will be listed as
one of China's 1,000 model middle schools," He said, adding that
teachers and students are making an even greater effort to live up
to Dr. Sun Zhongshan's expectations.

is observed by Mercedes experts who directly resolve technical
questions on the spot.
</P>
<P>

Daimler-Benz, and is the world's leading auto maker. The youngest
member of this family is Mercedes-Benz Vietnam Ltd. Co. which was
officially put into operation in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Realising that Vietnam is a market capable to develop
automobile making industry, Mercedes-Benz Vietnam has unceasingly
carried out researches to expand its outlet. It also set up its
own technical and managerial training centre.

<HEADLINE> China Has World's Largest Number of Baby-Friendly Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China has certified 4,730
"baby-friendly" hospitals in a national drive to encourage
breast-feeding and provide better care for mothers and newly
born babies.
</P>
<P>
The number accounts for half of the total in the world since
the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's
Fund originated a baby-friendly action in 1992, according to
officials of China's Ministry of Public Health (MPH).
</P>
<P>
New baby-friendly hospitals have been set up not only in big
cities and leading hospitals, but also in China's vast rural areas
and lower-level hospitals, which are playing an increasingly
important role in improving health care for rural people,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Health experts regard mother's milk as the best food for
newborns because it can help a baby improve its immune system.
</P>
<P>
Although Chinese women have had a long tradition of breast-
feeding, breast-feeding rates dropped greatly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Many mothers wrongly believed that substitute food for mother's
milk, such as various kinds of milk powder available on the
market, was more nutritious than breast milk, said Feng Huimin
from the MPH Department of Maternal and Child Health.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has promised to raise the rate of
breast-feeding for newborns in its Program for Development of
Chinese Children in the 1990s, published in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The drive promoting the establishment of baby-friendly
hospitals, starting from 1992, has pushed the national
breast-feeding rate to 64 percent in 1994 from 30 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the drive will enable the country to achieve
a 2000-year goal for an 80 percent breast-feeding rate.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, training programs to organize
baby-friendly hospitals have been conducted by 420,000
gynecologists, obstetricians, pediatricians, nurses and midwives,
as well as 360,000 rural doctors.
</P>
<P>
China has created province-level and nation-level systems to
certify baby-friendly hospitals, which are asked to meet strict
standards, such as 24-hour mother-and-infant accommodation and
sterile conditions for women in labor.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Parliament Clears Deputy PM of Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish parliamentary
inquiry commission dominated by representatives of the ruling
coalition cleared Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Tansu Ciller of charges of mismanagement and corruption in the
first of the on-going controversial probes against her, the local
newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that commission members from the True Path
Party (DYP) and the senior coalition partner Welfare Party (RP)
outvoted the opposition representatives eight to seven to block
the way for Ciller's trial by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
In April, the parliament passed a RP motion to probe into
Ciller, who is also DYP Chairwoman, over alleged irregularities
in government contracts concerning the electricity distribution
company TEDAS, delivering a heavy blow to Turkey's first woman
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, the parliament backed a second motion by the
RP for another investigation against Ciller concerning corruption
allegations during the sale of state-owned shares in Turkey's
leading automobile plant TOFAS.
</P>
<P>
Facing a possible trial by the Supreme Court, Ciller pulled
out from an earlier coalition government partnership with the now
main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) after its leader Mesut
Yilmaz voted for the motion for an investigation against Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Ciller then reversed her hostility toward the Islamist RP and
set up a coalition with them, disregarding accusations that she
made the surprise U-turn so as to avoid the possible trial.
</P>
<P>
Two other commissions are investigating charges against her,
one about alleged corruption in the sale of state shares in the
TOFAS and the other concerning her equally controversial private
wealth.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Applied Materials, the
California-based world leading producer of wafer fabrication
systems and semiconductor service provider, is entering the
metrology and inspection equipment market through the acquisition
of two Israeli firms -- Opal Inc. and Orbot Instruments -- for
285 million dollars in cash, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post said that the transaction marks one of the

<HEADLINE> River Drifting in Guizhou Attracts Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Drifting through rapids in
valleys in southwest China's Guizhou Province has become the
latest attraction for white-knuckle tourists from both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Drifting is a natural sport developed from scientific
exploration. Growing numbers of people enjoy the sport because of
the excitement, and because they feel stimulated and fantastic as
they struggle with fast flowing river currents.
</P>
<P>
On the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau the province has rich natural
resources for tourism. The spectacular valleys and mighty waters
provide a challenge and opportunity for lovers of drifting, known
as a white knuckle activity because people have to hang 'for their
lives.'
</P>
<P>
Peng Kuaiquan, manager of the Guizhou International Sports
Tourism Agency, said the 12-km-long drift along the Maling River
is regarded as the most attractive tourism program developed by a
Sino-French exploration team years ago.
</P>
<P>
The program has so far received more than 10 exploration teams
from Japan, Germany and France, as well as thousands of tourists
worldwide, she said.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 domestic and foreign tourists have journeyed to
Guizhou this year to experience drifting along a number of rivers
in the deep valleys, she added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Calls for Earlier United Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today that he is happy to note
that the vision to create a united Southeast Asia or "ASEAN-10" is
progressing well.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is looking forward to setting up an "ASEAN-10" on the
30th anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) next year by admitting Myanmar along with the scheduled
entry of Cambodia and Laos, he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement in an interview with the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama today ahead of the first ASEAN
informal summit in Indonesia later this week.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now has seven members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- with Cambodia,
Laos and Myanmar all currently having observer status.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Cambodia and Laos are concerned, there is no
problem," Abdullah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The question now is Myanmar. We (ASEAN) have not decided (on
the timing of its entry)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is pushing for Myanmar's admission as an ASEAN member
by next year, but Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand are
reportedly not sharing Malaysia's enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian foreign minister said ASEAN leaders might
discuss Myanmar's application submitted last July to join ASEAN at
the one-day Jakarta informal summit on November 30, to be attended
also by leaders of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
"It would be up to them to decide when Myanmar should come
in," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah stressed that what was important was that Myanmar
should undergo a process of "getting to know" and "work" with
ASEAN. "This is a process that Myanmar has to go through. It is a
technical procedure," he added.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the earliest possible date for Myanmar's
entry would be July next year when Malaysia hosts the ASEAN
foreign ministers' meeting and the second ASEAN informal summit.
</P>
<P>
The informal summit was proposed at the 1995 ASEAN summit in
Thailand, at which leaders of the seven-member grouping reaffirmed
their commitment to expedite the enlargement of the ASEAN
membership to comprise all the 10 Southeast Asian countries by the
21st century.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Telephones Egyptian FM on Impasse of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat telephoned Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Monday night for a conversation on the impasse of
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In the phone conversation, Arafat also discussed with Moussa
how to implement the decisions made at the Cairo Arab summit in
June, which called for slowing down the normalization of ties
with Israel if there was no progress in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
After seven weeks of marathon talks on Israeli troop pullback
in the West Bank town of Hebron, Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators have failed to bridge their gap.
</P>
<P>
The central dispute remains in the Israel's demand for its
troops' free access into PA-controlled areas in Hebron after
the Israeli troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's lawyer
Yitzhak Molcho continued the Hebron talks with chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat in Jerusalem, but they still failed to make
any progress.
</P>
<P>
Both Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai have
repeatedly blamed Arafat for holding up the peace process by
deliberately delaying the signing of an agreement. Netanyahu
urged Arafat Monday to push forward the peace process to avoid
causing its deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli government is seeking legal support to
its demand for the security changes to the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
A legal opinion prepared for the Israeli negotiating team
claims that the Oslo agreement on Hebron pullback contains a
clause ensuring the Israeli troops' right to operate in the
Arab neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
The clause also says that Israel holds full security
responsibility in Hebron and the right to act to fulfill
such responsibility.
</P>
<P>
However, some Israeli officials conceded that, even such
clause existed in the signed agreement, they did not believe
it would resolve the problem as the Palestinian side rejects
such demand.

<P>
HAIKOU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A number of cities in the Beibu
Gulf area in south China that were designated as coastal cities
open to overseas investment more than a decade ago, have been
developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
These include Haikou and Sanya on Hainan Island, and Beihai and
Qinzhou in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which have
populations ranging from 150,000 to 500,000 people. The tropical
scenery, with coconut trees or banyans lining the streets, has
made them popular with tourists. Yalong Bay at Hainan's Sanya and
Silver Beach in Beihai have become national tourism and holiday
zones.
</P>
<P>
From January to September, Haikou, the provincial capital of
Hainan, had some 1.15 million tourists, an increase of 41.2
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The cities have also enjoyed rapid economic growth because of
their location and natural resources. In the past five years,
Sanya has had annual GDP growth rate of 26.3 percent, compared
with a national average of 12 percent. Dong Xing, which was
designated a city only last April, had some 320 million US dollars
in overseas investment in the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Ports are playing a major role in promoting economic expansion
in the area. By the end of October, Haikou port had handled 4.4
million tons of cargo for the year, 16.2 percent more than the
same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Becomes Leading Animal Husbandry Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Animal husbandry in Guizhou, a
highland province in southwest China, has entered a new stage of
development with 17 consecutive good years.
</P>
<P>
The success is due to the agricultural reforms, the
introduction of scientific methods, and encouragement of farmers
to raise more livestock, the province's acting governor Wu Yixia
said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 the province had 16 million pigs and 2.2
million head of sheep in stock, up 18 percent and 24 percent
respectively over 1990, statistics from the local government show.
</P>
<P>
Output of meat reached one million tons, with 58,000 tons of
eggs and 18,000 tons of milk produced in 1995. Output of animal
husbandry realized over 10 billion yuan, accounting for over 30
percent of the province's total agricultural output value.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of animal husbandry has been attributed
to the efficient use of 428,000 hectares of grassland.
</P>
<P>
The province is planning to build four bases for cattle raising
and 30 bases for sheep, with plans to send one million head of
cattle and five million sheep for slaughter each year in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the proportion of output of beef and mutton will
increase by eight percentage points, with cash income for farmers
increasing by 158 percent.

reputation as an intelligent island.
</P>
<P>
With the approaching of the WTO Ministerial Conference, which
runs from December 9 through 13, the National Computer Board (NCB)
has said that together with major information technology players
in Singapore, it will provide a host of services for the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to be attended by around three
thousand delegates and covered by about 1,500 journalists from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Information kiosks, electronic messaging, identification smart
cards and Internet access will be among the services made
available to delegates and the international media, the NCB said.
</P>
<P>
They will enjoy full information technology facilities, said
the NCB, which is a member of the conference facility and program
committee of the WTO ministerial conference organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
"This opportunity to set in place the infrastructure, equipment
and services for world-wide delegates to the WTO ministerial
conference will further enhance Singapore's reputation as an
intelligent island where IT is used pervasively," NCB chief
executive Stephen Yeo said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to a Straits Times report, the NCB, which has been
involved in planning the IT facilities for the past 15 months, had
combined its own in-house expertise with the resources of some of
the key players such as Digital Equipment, Microsoft, Compaq,
Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Lotus, Toshiba and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
A database has been custom-designed to register delegates and
the media. And it will be linked to and accessible by all key
government agencies as well as the Singapore Hotels Association.
</P>
<P>
The NCB said that all WTO delegates and journalists will be
given complimentary smart cards, courtesy of Gemplus Pte Ltd., as
identification for the conference.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the WTO Ministerial Conference homepage has been
on-line since August, serving as the official one-stop center for
information on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the week-long conference, any changes to the published
program, agenda and venue will be made known through this
homepage.
</P>
<P>
The NCB also said that an integrated computer network
comprising more than 300 computers will be in operation at the
conference venue.

<P>
In addition, personal computer users will have access to
on-line multilingual newsfeeds from Reuters Business Briefing,

<HEADLINE> Traders Besiege Bourse Building in Bangladeshi City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Curb traders besieged the
building of Bangladesh's Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) on Monday
afternoon in protest against the sudden fall in prices of shares
of most companies, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The curb market operators organized a rally and demonstrated in
front of the CSE building as the stock price plummeted on the
country's second largest bourse, pulling down the key index by
2.69 percent to 1,513.48 points.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that windowpanes of the CSE building and some 20
vehicles nearby were damaged by the agitated traders who alleged
that the mark-down in the share prices had been a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
The siege went on for six hours before police resorted to baton
charge to make way for the besieged CSE officials and brokers to
come out of the building.
</P>
<P>
The CSE officials dismissed the allegation and said a huge sale
pressure was the cause behind the unusual price fall.
</P>
<P>
Some stock observers said the traders found it difficult to
accept a bearish market after share prices had been rising for the
last several months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Dhaka Stock Exchange stumbled again on a
featureless trading Monday, failing to retain its gains of the
last two days.
</P>
<P>
The fall of the key index of this main bourse totaled 50.46
points to 3,317.67 while the market transaction and the gaining
issues also declined.

<HEADLINE> Government to Review Singapore's Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong said that the government would undertake a thorough
review of the country's economic competitiveness for the next five
to 10 years, the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Goh as saying that the internal study, to be
carried out next year, will draw up projections on Singapore's
future growth prospects and seek to sharpen its competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Goh was speaking at a press conference in Manila Monday after
attending the leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the review will examine, among other
things, whether the Singapore dollar is too strong and if rentals
at home are too high. Externally, it will study whether, and how,
other countries are catching up.
</P>
<P>
On the current slowdown of the economy, Goh said, "We are not
too concerned. It's cyclical and due to a slowdown in the global
electronics sector."
</P>
<P>
He said the economic fundamentals of Singapore were "very good"
and an upturn should happen sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
Goh noted that the slowdown could even be good for the
country's coming general election, because it would inject a sense
of caution among voters, which he said would be "very good."
</P>
<P>
"We have been having it good for too long. Some people may
think miracles happen all the time," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Astronauts Retrieve Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- American space shuttle
Columbia's crew retrieved a saucer-shaped satellite tonight while
avoiding colliding into a very near telescope.
</P>
<P>
Astronaut Tom Jones used a long robot arm to snag the saucer,
called Wake Shield Facility, while an ultraviolet telescope was in
orbit about 24 kilometers apart.
</P>
<P>
The two satellites were released by Columbia's astronauts last
week. The two-ton saucer was used to grow semiconductor film in
the ultra-clean vacuum of space; the 3.5-ton telescope is looking
at stars, galaxies and Moon atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Noticing the telescope was closing in slightly faster than
predicted on the saucer, flight managers had considered retrieving
the saucer one day earlier than planned, but decided Sunday that
its position in relation to the telescope would be well within the
rendezvous margins.
</P>
<P>
This morning, the two satellites were trailing Columbia 352
kilometers above Earth. The three crafts were evenly spaced, with
the saucer about 30 kilometers behind Columbia and the telescope
another 30 kilometers behind the saucer.
</P>
<P>
When the saucer got closer in the afternoon, shuttle commander
Ken Cockrell guided Columbia leapfrog backward to a point behind
the saucer and ahead of the telescope.
</P>
<P>
This was the first mission in which a shuttle flew in formation
with two satellites.
</P>
<P>
And the saucer has accomplished its mission of growing
semiconductor film.
</P>
<P>
Scientists grew seven wafers of film one atom by one atom --
the first time they accomplished all their objectives. The first
two flights of the Wake Shield, in 1994 and 1995, were marred by
satellite malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
According to NASA schedule, the telescope will be retrieved by
the astronauts on December 3.

<HEADLINE> Banharn, Clinton Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's caretaker Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-archa held talks with visiting U.S.
President Bill Clinton this morning for 30 minutes on bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
As the talks were conducted through interpreters, the two
leaders had only 15 minutes for small and official talks.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton arrived here last night on a 27-hour state
visit as guest of King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Clinton and Banharn briefly touched upon a
wide range of issues, including trade, investment, security and
cooperation in crackdown on transnational drug trafficking,
according to a Thai Foreign Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
However, they refrained from touching upon bilateral trade
friction, such as Thailand's shrimp exports to the U.S. and
textile quota reductions by the U.S., leaving these specific
issues to lower-level officials.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the talks from the Thai side were two
outgoing deputy prime ministers, Amnuay Virawan and Kasem S.
Kasemsri.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. side were Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy, and Winston Lord,
assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Clinton and Banharn witnessed the signing of a
bilateral agreement on avoidance of double taxation, which
resulted from on-and-off bilateral talks for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The historic agreement was signed by Amnuay, who is also
Thailand's Foreign Minister, and U.S. Ambassador to Thailand
William Itoh.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon at the U.S. embassy, Clinton is expected to have
an informal meeting with Thailand's new prime minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, who was officially appointed by a royal command last
night, only about 90 minutes before Clinton's arrival from APEC
(Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) leaders' meeting in Subic, the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit has yet to be sworn in to take the premiership.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is accompanied by his wife, Hillary, who
arrived on Sunday and visited two women centers in Chiang Rai and
Chiang Mai, before joining her husband last night at the Bangkok
Airport.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. presidential couple will depart shortly after midnight
today.

<HEADLINE> hke - Costa Rican President Calls For Funds to Halt Ozone Depletion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican President Jose
Maria Figueres urged countries attending the "Ozone Summit" here
today to provide funds to combat the depletion of the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
Figueres inaugurated the conference of the signatories of the
1995 Vienna Convention and 1987 Montreal Protocol that has brought
together environment ministers from more than 100 countries and
senior officials from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Figueres insisted on the need for reaching agreement on funding
and for meeting the goals set to prevent the depletion of the
ozone layer, a protective barrier which shields the earth from the
sun's dangerous ultraviolet rays.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that only through the financial and technological
resources generated by developed countries will developing
countries be able to implement the programs contained in these
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol are the two
basic instruments adopted by the international community to
monitor the state of the ozone layer and to adopt measures to
control the emission of the industrial gases and chemicals causing
its depletion, such as chlorofluorocarbons and metyl bromide.
</P>
<P>
Figueres praised the Vienna Convention for making "exemplary
progress" but the summit needed to determine the amount of money
required to replenish the fund to implement the resolutions over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
"I know that negotiations are not moving at the desired pace,"
he said, but emphasized it was "fundamental that money be
deposited in the fund every third year, in the proportion required
and at the right time."
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Dowdeswell, executive director of the United Nations
Environment Program, said that the fund was set up with 510
million U.S. dollars for the 1994-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
The wish now is to maintain or increase this sum, but no
agreement has been reached so far between developed countries and
the Group of 77 which includes most of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Costa Rica's Environment Minister Rene Castro is
optimistic that agreement will be reached on extra funding and
told Xinhua that it is a tradition that in this kind of meeting,
agreements are usually reached at the last minute.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Ozone Layer Inaugurated in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The conference on the ozone
layer began today in Costa Rica in which over 500 million dollars
of funds could be raised to promote new ozone layer-friendly
industrial processes.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Environment Minister Rene Castro stressed that the
destruction of ozone layer is a real challenge for humanity and
not just something "invented" by scientists.
</P>
<P>
"We aspire to a doubling of the number of voluntary
collaborators," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the fund offered by the developed countries, he
said, it was considered insufficient, adding, "The petition is
that funds for voluntary programs and for accelerating a reduction
in the use of chlorofluorocarbons should be increased
substantially."
</P>
<P>
Chlorofluorocarbon is a substance used widely in air
conditioners, refrigeration units, deodorants and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Castro also cited the optimistic view of an Austrian minister
-- president of the Protocol of Montreal -- that the distances
between offers and demands have been getting shorter and that the
sum originally pledged by the developed countries could increase.
</P>
<P>
Over the next two days, delegates from 164 countries will work
out ways to deploy the fund for combating the use of products
harmful to the ozone layer and to promote its substitutes.
</P>
<P>
They will also study the problems created by the illegal trade
of substances that destroy ozone.
</P>
<P>
According to the Protocol of Montreal signed in 1987 by 69
nations, the productions and consumptions of chlorofluorocarbons
will be reduced by 50 percent by 1999.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, some developed countries say that progress has
been made with the use of funds and it is time to fortify control
and monitoring over the illegal trafficking in substances
dangerous to the ozone layer.

WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Food and Drug
Administration Commissioner (FDA) David Kessler, who has played a
major role in urging efforts to regulate tobacco, announced today
that he would resign when a successor is named.
</P>
<P>
Kessler, appointed to the post by President George Bush in
1990, said in a statement that he appreciated the opportunity to
serve the public, but now believed "it is time to return to
private life."
</P>
<P>
The Tobacco Institute, the industry's lobbying arm, said "we
are declining to comment."
</P>
<P>
FDA officials said President Bill Clinton had asked Kessler to
stay on, but Kessler wanted to retire in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised Kessler's "tireless commitment" to public life
and said "his contributions to improve the health of our nation
are many and their effect will continue to be felt for generations
to come."

KATHMANDU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
announced a two-percent cut in the sales tax on the textile
industry in response to complaints by domestic manufacturers about
a 15-percent tax imposed in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The government has also waived the sales tax on the textile
finishing sector and introduced various tax-cutting measures for
some other manufacturing sectors, a spokesman for the Finance
Ministry said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Textile manufacturers complained that the 15-percent sales tax
system has weakened their competitiveness in the market. The
government then set up a task force to study alternative
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that more study would be done on the
country's tax rates under the government's long-term policy.

<HEADLINE> World Jewish Congress Meets for Unclaimed Jewish Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Committee of
the World Jewish Congress (WJC) today started a two-day meeting in
Oslo, Norway, to discuss the issue of unclaimed assets belonging
to the Holocaust victims of World War II, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Bankers Association announced last March that its
survey had turned up dormant accounts holding only 38.7 million
Swiss francs (about 31.95 million U.S. dollars) deposited by
foreign clients before the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
The association said its finding should serve to refute rumors
that hundreds of millions or even billions of francs belonging to
the Nazi victims are still held in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
"The rumors about huge assets hidden in Swiss banks belonging
to the Holocaust victims are totally unfounded," the association
said.
</P>
<P>
However, WJC described the association's statement as
unilateral and unacceptable, adding it has been preparing to take
legal action against Swiss banks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Swiss banks, the favored refuges for European Jews hiding
assets from the Nazi, came under pressure last year from world
Jewish groups, Swiss politicians and the media during the 50th
anniversary celebrations of the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
More than six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust and
there were few people left after the war to claim the bank
accounts or heirs with the iron-clad documentation the Swiss
require for payment.
</P>
<P>
Norway is one of the countries helping track down those
assets.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Exports Increase 30 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan exports increased
30 percent in the 10 months to October this year over the same
period in 1995, helping to push the country's foreign reserves to
a 20-year high, figures released today by the License Center for
Exports show.
</P>
<P>
Total exports rose to 591.9 million U.S. dollars beween January
and October 1996 from 455.2 million dollars for the same period
last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The most significant increase appeared in non-traditional
exports, which rose 64 percent to 319.3 million dollars from 195.2
million dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
While overall traditional exports only increased by 5 percent
to 272.6 million dollars from 260 million dollars, some
traditional exports such as cotton, gold, silver, coffee and sugar
rose remarkably, with a 367 percent increase for cotton and a 22
percent increase for gold and silver.
</P>
<P>
The current government led by President Violetta de Chamorro
has adopted measures to increase the country's traditional and
non-traditional exports to boost the country's foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry officials forecast Nicaraguan exports could
reach 700 million dollars for the whole of 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to Presidency Minister Julio Cardenas, the country's
foreign reserves will reach a 20-year high of 250 million dollars
when Chamorro's term expires on January 10, from 3.5 million
dollars in April 1990, when she took office.

<HEADLINE> ILO: Nearly 1 Billion People Unemployed or Under-employed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one billion people
around the world, about one third of its entire workforce, are
unemployed or under-employed in, says a report issued here today
by the International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
In the report, World Employment 1996/97, the ILO is not
optimistic about the global employment situation.
</P>
<P>
It says, in the world's wealthiest nations, members of the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, at least 34
million people are jobless, and in the European Union,
unemployment rose last year to an average of 11.3 percent, with
France, Germany, Italy and Sweden having significant increases.
</P>
<P>
However, the report says, unemployment rates have declined in
the United States and the United Kingdom, but income disparities
have tended to widen there because more workers have access only
to low-wage jobs.
</P>
<P>
The report calls for anti-inflation stabilizing mechanisms and
improved labor market policies in the industrialized economies.
</P>
<P>
As for the transitional economies of eastern and central
Europe, unemployment declined slightly but remained at
double-digit levels, the report says.
</P>
<P>
In Russia and some other countries of the former Soviet Union,
unemployment continued to increase.
</P>
<P>
The report says that six years into the transition towards a
market economy, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are
facing massive unemployment and widespread poverty. It believes
that the time has come to reexamine the pace at which reforms are
being carried out and to adopt socially and politically
sustainable strategies.
</P>
<P>
It points out that apart from Chile, Jordan and Mauritius, few
developing countries outside East and South East Asia have
experienced strong growth in productive employment over the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
In South Asia, the report says, employment barely increased
between 1975 and 1992 although India and Pakistan had "fairly
rapid growth of output" and "steady increases in productivity and
real wages."
</P>
<P>
In Latin America and the Caribbean, all countries except Chile
and Jamaica "experience stagnant or even negative growth in
manufacturing employment" between 1986 and 1993, says the ILO
report.
</P>
<P>
Real wages have declined everywhere below the levels prevailing
in the 1980s except in Panama, Colombia and Chile. "In terms of an
overall assessment," says the report, "it is only Chile that has
performed well" within the region.
</P>
<P>
The trend data required for a comparable analysis in Africa is
available only for Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
It says, "With the striking exception of Mauritius, growth in
manufacturing employment was either non-existent or very slight"
and "real wages either stagnated or declined" in all
above-mentioned African countries including Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that the performance in the rest of
sub-Saharan Africa is likely to have been even worse.
</P>
<P>
The end of the oil boom in the 1980s resulted in sharply
reduced rates of industrial growth and a deterioration of the
employment situation throughout North Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It says that of the countries in the region most recently
studied, "employment growth was strong only in Jordan."

<HEADLINE> OPEC Quota Unlikely to Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several members of the 11-strong Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries have exceeded their daily quotas set in 1993,
leading to overproduction of one million barrels per day (bpd) on
the overall ceiling of 25.03 million pbd.
</P>
<P>
But Rakedh Bin Salem Bin Rakadh, Petroleum and Mineral
Resources Minister of the United Arab Emirates and OPEC acting
chairman said that no changes are likely to be made at  the
winter ministerial conference in spite of demands by several
members to raise quotas.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, Kuwait and Saudia Arabia, the biggest oil exporter and
the country with the decisive say on the matter, are believed to
be the only three countries currently observing their quotas.
</P>
<P>
Although OPEC has been overproducing, the price of OPEC oil has
risen dramatically over the last few months, up from an average of
19.94 dollars a barrel in August to more than 23 dollars a barrel
in October, levels not seen since the 1990-1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
That's well above OPEC's 21 dollars a barrel target price set
three years ago and has brought windfall revenues for member
countries. Oil analysts estimate the higher prices have brought in
an extra 30 billion dollars in export revenues for the cartel's
members.
</P>
<P>
These strong prices, brought about by low oil stocks in
industrialized countries, shortfalls in supply by non-OPEC states
and rising demand for winter consumption, have led many cartel
members to call for a raising of the quota ceilings.
</P>
<P>
But oil experts say such a move could send prices falling,
which would be bad news for OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
In spite of speculation over the future of the daily quotas,
the price of a basket of OPEC seven crude oils remained steady
last week at 22.44 U.S. dollars a barrel, up 3 percent from 22.37
dollars the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that given the strong prices this year, the
total oil export revenue for the cartel's members this year will
reach 163 billion dollars, against 132 billion dollars in 1995,
and 120 billion dollars in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Lays Wreath at Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today laid a wreath at the monument to the Philippine national
hero, Jose Rizal, prior to starting his two-day state visit to the
country.
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit to the Philippines by a Chinese head of
state since the two countries established diplomatic relations in
1975.
</P>
<P>
Present at today's wreath-laying ceremony were Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Special Assistant
Zeng Qinghong, Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu
Yi and Special Assistant Wang Weicheng.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Defense Secretary Renato De Villa, who is
accompanying the Chinese president during his stay, also attended
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Rizal, hailed as a great Philippine patriot, was the forerunner
of the country's independence movement. He was shot and killed by
Spanish colonialists in 1896.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here last Saturday for the Fourth Informal
APEC Leadership Conference, the Chinese president said that his
state visit is aimed at consolidating and furthering the
good-neighborliness and mutually-beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"China attaches importance to developing an all-round
cooperation with the Philippines and sincerely hopes to be a
long-term good neighbor and friend of the Philippines and other
Southeast Asian nations," he said in a written statement released
upon his arrival at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.

<HEADLINE> EU States Urged to Fight Against Unemployment, Organized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) states
must carry concerted efforts to solve the issues of serious
unemployment, drug trafficking and organized crimes, leaders of
Ireland and Portugal said here today.
</P>
<P>
EU states have not done enough in curbing unemployment, the
most concerned issue of all EU states, said Portuguese Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres at a joint press conference with his
Irish counterpart John Bruton after a working meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
The states must also join efforts to fight against the
increasingly rampant drug traffickings, organized crimes,
particularly against the child sex trade, said Guterres.
</P>
<P>
He also said realization of a single European currency will be
a future goal of Europe, adding that his nation hopes that
Ireland, current EU president, would make more efforts to reach
that goal.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders remain at odds over how they should battle
unemployment in the region, where a jobless total of 18 million is
producing growing public insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Concerned that they may seem unresponsive to voters' worries,
most EU governments want a separate chapter on employment written
into the union's Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Bruton, president of European Council, is on a trip to EU
countries to prepare for a council conference slated to open in
Berlin in middle December this year.

<HEADLINE> UNIDO Board Asks Germany to Reconsider Its Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The 16th Board Session of the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) today
called on Germany to reconsider its intention of quitting the
organization.
</P>
<P>
In a press communique, UNIDO said it is difficult to understand
that while the organization was harvesting the results of reforms
it has made during the past few years, German Minister of
Development, Carl-Dieter Spranger, declared Germany would withdraw
from it.
</P>
<P>
With a highly developed industry, Germany is considered one of
the pillar countries of UNIDO, designed to help quicken the
industrialization process of developing countries and to
coordinate UN activities for industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the session, the Japanese representative stressed
that Germany should stay in the organization and continue to
contribute to UNIDO's reforms in the future.
</P>
<P>
Germany's decision to withdraw from UNIDO is in conflict with
its desire to play a more important role in the UN, the Japanese
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Chinese representative said Germany would not
only harm UNIDO, but also damage its own benefit by withdrawing
from the organization.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his worry in this respect, Austrian Federal
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said he would discuss the matter with
his German counterpart Helmut Kohl at a later time.
</P>
<P>
In the same manner, some Latin American and African countries
also expressed concern over Germany's decision.
</P>
<P>
With its headquarters in Vienna, UNIDO was established in
January, 1967, grouping 165 member countries until last December
when US withdrew on excuse of budget difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Its 53-seat board meets once every year.

<HEADLINE> Shantou Enrolls Civil Servants Through Examination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A scheme to appoint civil
servants by public examinations has proved a success in Shantou
city, one of the country's five Special Economic Zones, in south
China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The city began the practice of enrolling civil servants through
public examinations last year.
</P>
<P>
A city official commented, "So far the method has proved to be
effective and is worthy of being expanded."
</P>
<P>
The official said that local public security bureaus, tax
bureaus and other government organizations have selected 300
people from as many as 3,627 applicants by means of public
examinations.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the examination system creates a
golden opportunity for talented people and gets civil servants
enrolled through fair competition, regardless of their status or
where they live.
</P>
<P>
He said that when Shantou was given the right of local
legislation this March, the municipal government decided to
attract the best professionals from across the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 453 people from 27 provinces and cities across China
applied for posts.
</P>
<P>
"But only 13 people from eight provinces succeeded in the end,"
said the official.

<HEADLINE> International Reserves, Trade Deficit Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chile reported an increase in
its international reserves up to November 15 and a trade deficit
for the previous month, said the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Its reserves had reached 15.412 billion dollars up to November
15, an increase of 4 percent over the same period last year, said
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
In the first 2 weeks of November, its reserves increased by 220
million dollars, the result of a 214 million-dollar surplus in the
balance of payments and a positive adjustment in the exchange rate
of 6 million dollars, it added.
</P>
<P>
In October, its trade balance showed a deficit of 487 million
dollars, the result of 1.194 billion dolalrs of exports and 1.681
billion dollars of imports.
</P>
<P>
According to that institution, the trade deficit reached 824
million dollars during the first 10 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank explained that the high trade deficit reported
in October was due to an increase in imports and lower exports
caused by a drop in the prices of Chile's main products sold
overseas such as copper and pulp.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chile had a 1.385 billion-dollar trade
surplus.

<HEADLINE> Hi-Tech Export in Shanghai Aims at Western Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Hi-tech exports from Shanghai
are being aimed at developed countries instead of original target
markets, the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the number of contracts on
technique exports from the city have topped 800, involving a total
of 1.55 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Shanghai mainly exported traditional techniques,
including chemistry, textile industry, light industry and
medicine, as well as TV set production lines and aquatic breeding.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has put hi-tech programs onto its
export list, while pouring a great deal of capital and manpower to
support its technical development.
</P>
<P>
Scientific researchers in the city have made great efforts to
improve the quality of telecom equipment, which has earned profits
of more than 44 million US dollars in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
There were now more than 300 institutions responsible for
hi-tech export programs, among which are a group yielding more
than 10 million US dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Technique Exchange has input the programs
involving technique exports onto the Internet in both Chinese and
English, enabling overseas business people to gain access to
relevant information at any time.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has also strengthened its cooperation with foreign
scientific research departments. So far, 80 percent of the city's
research establishments have set up joint companies with overseas
businesses.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen City Officials Receive English Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- About 200 outstanding
employees from government institutions and enterprises in
Shenzhen, one of China's five special economic zones, recently
enrolled in a one-year course to study English.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the municipal government said the measure is aimed
at raising the quality of these workers in order to improve their
ability to communicate more effectively with the English-speaking
world.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that so many leading officials have
participated in English training, said Li Ronggen, vice-secretary
of the Shenzhen City Communist Party Committee.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has become one of the most economically successful
cities in China since it was made a special economic zone 16 years
ago. It has taken in more than 10 billion US dollars of foreign
investment, and its foreign trade has topped that of other Chinese
cities for three years.
</P>
<P>
According to a new development program, Shenzhen is striving to
become a modern international city in terms of its financial,
technological and market development in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
To carry out this ambitious plan, the education of officials
must be improved, government sources said.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted early this year showed that less than ten
percent of the city's medium and high-level officials understand
English and computer operation. In addition, most officials have
little knowledge of modern management methods.
</P>

"If one is not pioneering and thirsting for new knowledge, and
does not know laws, international conventions, computer operation
and English, he or she will be deaf, dumb and blind in
international economic circumstances," said Lu Ruifeng, who is in
charge of assessing the city's officials.
</P>
<P>
After studying English for one year, the officials will take
English tests, and some students will be sent abroad for further
study. In the future, a would-be official's English comprehension
level will be a criterion for appointment to office.

co-operation with eastern provinces, greatly booming the local

134 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Zhou noted that, the regional government has recently
promulgated regulations on the implementation of east-west
co-operation. The new rules encourage local ventures to expand

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Agree on Removal of Textile Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
European Union (EU) today formally approved a proposal to remove
quotas for a series of textile products.
</P>
<P>
Under the Uruguay Round of the talks of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, the predecessor of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), all members of the WTO agreed to phase out
quota protection on textiles and clothing products in 1995-2005,
in four different stages.
</P>
<P>
Today's agreement represents the EU's second stage of this
process, which involves the integration of 23 different categories
such as shawls and scarves, stockings and socks, women's suits,
industrial clothing, ski-suits and swimwear.
</P>
<P>
Of these categories 18 are presently covered by EU quotas on
imports from one or more countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC),
agreed under the Uruguay Round, once a product has been integrated
no quotas can be kept on it against exports from any WTO member,
nor can new quotas be introduced under the ATC's specific
safeguard clause.
</P>
<P>
He said that the second-stage list would be notified to the WTO
before the end of this year and would take effect as from 1
January 1998.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Closes down 502 Small Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Over 500 small enterprises,
which heavily pollute the environment, have been closed down in
east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The ventures are involved in paper-making, hide-processing,
refining, as well as asbestos production.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that 300 of the ventures were small paper
mills, which discharge over 100 million tons of waste water
annually.
</P>
<P>
He said that water pollution in the province had become a
pressing problem because few directors of those paper mills took
the problem seriously, and had little sense of their legal
obligations.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the Fujian provincial government
ordered the close-down of the heavily pollutive small enterprises
during a recent conference on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"To date, a dozen of inspection teams have been sent to tour in
the province, in a move to supervise the implementation of the
campaign, " said the official.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Blue-chip shares on Wall
Street extended November's rally today, boosting the Dow Jones
industrial average above 6,500 for the first time, as interest
rates fell in bond trading.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 76.03 points to
6,547.79, en route to its 12th record close in the last 14
sessions, bringing November's advance to 8.6 percent and the
year's gain to about 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-6 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with its volume totaling 475.25
million shares, down from 525.20 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures also set new highs.
</P>
<P>
The S&AMP;P 500 jumped 8.30, or 1.1 percent, to 757.03. The NYSE
composite index rose 4.20 to 398.86. Both measures, dominated by
blue-chip and other large companies, set new highs Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite rose 6.15 to 1,280.51, and the American
Stock Exchange's market value index fell 2.61 to 588.16.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of
existing homes fell 1.5 percent in October, the fifth consecutive
monthly decline. Another signal of mild economic readings will
help persuade the Federal Reserve not to slow the economy with an
increase in the central bank's key lending rates.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices rose, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
touched last week's eight-month low at 6.40 percent before
settling at about 6.42 percent, down from 6.44 percent late
Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Serbian Premier Mirko
Marjanovic said today that stable prices and a stable national
currency were the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's economic policy
priorities in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the government meeting with officials of the
Serbian Chamber of Commerce and Trade Union organization,
Marjanovic said that among the priorities were also higher
production and exports, structural changes and better living
standards.
</P>
<P>
These objectives had been worked out between the Yugoslav
Federal government and the governments of its constituent
republics of Serbia and Montenegro, and the National Bank of
Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav national currency of Dinar has been stable for the
past 12 months due to strong efforts of the government to curb
inflation and stabilize the currency.
</P>
<P>
According to a government statement issued at the session, the
domestic product is projected to rise by 13 percent in 1997,
exports by at least 37 percent, while public spending should be
reduced to 47.5 percent of the domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Budget and public spending in Serbia will account for 35.3
percent of the domestic product.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the Chamber of Commerce and Trade Union
officials expressed their support for the government plan and
agreed to take more measures to encourage fair competition on the
market, open the economy to the world and raise wages, the Tanjug
news agency reported.

SARAJEVO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of NATO-led
Implementation Force (IFOR) troops in Bosnia has dropped to 39,000
almost one month before its mandate expires, an IFOR spokesman
said today.
</P>
<P>
It will further go down to 30,000 troops by December 20, when
the peacekeeping force will be renamed SFOR (Stablization Force),
said the IFOR spokesman, Major Bratt Boudreau.
</P>
<P>
At its peak of deployment, the IFOR consisted of three
divisions with 60,000 troops from 34 nations.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the American-led multinational division has 13,500
soldiers, the French-led division 12,000 and the British-led
division 9,500.
</P>
<P>
The gradual reduction in the number of the peacekeeing troops
was proceeding in line with plans for NATO's new role in Bosnia
next year, Boudreau said.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR was envisaged as a one-year mission, but in order to
keep the Bosnia war from renewing, NATO has decided to prolong the
deployment of a reduced force in Bosnia until 1998.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Agrees With Conditions on "Oil-for-Food" Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has agreed with
all U.N. conditions for implementation of the "oil-for-food"
formula, a U.N. spokeswoman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Silvana Foa said that Iraq has sent a letter to
U.N. Under-Secretary-General Chinmaya Gharekhan, in which Iraq
expressed its satisfaction with the position Gharekhan has taken
about implementation of "oil-for-food" in accordance with
resolution 986 and with the Memorandum of Understanding reached by
Iraq and the U.N. Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq agrees with the views of the Secretariat and modalities
of implementation of resolution 986 and the MOU," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the pricing formula put forward by oil
overseers will be presented to the Iraqi sanctions committee today
and the U.N. secretary-general will submit an interim report to
the Security Council before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is optimistic about the
movement in the few weeks to come, she added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has imposed strict economic sanctions,
including an oil embargo, on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990. The six-year-long sanctions have resulted in
tremendous hardships for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted resolution 986 in April 1995,
allowing Iraq to export oil worth 2 billion dollars in six months
for import of food, medicine and other necessities. The U.N.
Secretariat and Iraq reached the Memorandum of Understanding on
implementation of resolution 986 on May 20 this year. The
implementation of the "oil-for-food" formula has been postponed
again and again due to additional conditions raised by the U.S.

<HEADLINE> US to Evacuate 5,000 Iraqi Kurds to Guam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
planning to evacuate about 5,000 Kurds from northern Iraq, the
State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Glyn Davies said these people are employees and
their families of relief and other Western non-governmental
agencies in northern Iraq and they will be flown to Guam in the
next few weeks in the second such airlift from the area.
</P>
<P>
Discussions are under way on the practicalities of the
evacuation with Turkey, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
In September about 2,000 former employees of U.S. governmental
agencies in northern Iraq were evacuated. They were flown from the
eastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir to Guam, a U.S. outpost in the
Pacific, where they were processed for asylum in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President: Israeli Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today warned against vicious circle of retaliatory acts
stemming from the Israeli practice of expanding settlement in the
occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
"Settlements are a timebomb planted in the heart of the
Palestinian areas," Mubarak told reporters following the
inauguration of the innovation works of the Central Military
Zone's Command, the oldest in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president said the continuation of the settlement policy
undermines efforts to resolve the Palestinian problem and creates
anxiety and instability.
</P>
<P>
Calling the Palestinian issue the core of the Mideast problem,
the president said it is necessary to enforce the agreements
signed by the Israeli government and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Egypt has recently stepped up its attacks at the Israeli
settlement expansion, warning of threat to relations with Israeli.
</P>
<P>
The Israel's announced commitment to the implementation of the
peace accords conflicts with the real situation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak described Israeli statements on the Jewish settlements
as "fearful" and gravely "harmful" to the Arab-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the peace negotiating process in the region as a
whole would be in jeopardy if these provocative policies push
peoples into extremes and resort to violent means.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has failed to do
anything of the sort since he visited Cairo in July and the problem
is getting more complicated by the expansion of Jewish
settlements, he deplored.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also renewed his warning that Israel's stand on the
West Bank town of Hebron has blocked the progress in
Israeli-Palestinian talks on redeployment from the town. And this
would also stoke up a vicious circle of retaliation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli negotiators have demanded the right of "hot pursuit" of
alleged militants in Palestine-controlled area, the closure of
Shuhada Street and better armament for the Israeli police in joint
patrols in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israel-PLO accords, Israel was to hand over 80
percent of the town to the PNA in March and the Jewish settlers
were to remain in five tiny enclaves of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has asked to renegotiate the terms of redeployment to
improve security arrangements for the settlers. Seven weeks of
negotiations have produced no agreement.

<HEADLINE> Protest Rallies by Opposition Coalition Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The opposition coalition
Zajedno (Together) in Serbia organized another large-scale rally
in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade today to protest against the
annulment of municipal elections which Zajedno had claimed
victory.
</P>
<P>
Around 200,000 Belgraders took to the street today, some of
whom threw stones and eggs to the building of the state-owned
newspaper Politika.
</P>
<P>
Zajedno claimed they had won the majority in some key cities in
the local elections on November 17, but the national election
committee reversed the results citing irregularities as reasons
and called for a third round of elections.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the coalition, which comprises the Serbian
Renewal Movement, the Democratic Party, and the Serbian Civic
Alliance, said they would boycott the third round of elections and
did not recognize the official court decisions.
</P>
<P>
The third-round elections for the Belgrade assembly deputies
will be held on Wednesday, November 27, in 232 out of 1,010
election precincts in 55 election polls in 14 Belgrade
municipalities.

New vote-counting boards will be set up in all election polls,
Chairman of the Belgrade Vote-counting Board, Radomir Lazarevic,
said today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, a number of rallies have been held in
Belgrade and many other major cities in Serbia, organized by the
Zajedno coalition to protest against the massive fraud of the
government in the local elections.
