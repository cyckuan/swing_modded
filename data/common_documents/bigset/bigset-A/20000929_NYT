   LOS ANGELES With teachers authorizing a strike and county
employees set to join transit employees and commercial actors on
picket lines, Los Angeles has gone from a historically anti-union
town to one known for the muscle of its labor movement, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a historic moment,'' Art Pulaski, executive
secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, said
Thursday. ``We see much more activism and we see much more
coordination and mutual support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers have gone so long with backwards motion in terms of
wages and cost of living,'' he added, so if striking is what it
takes to regain lost ground, ``then they're up for the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say a combination of factors are at work to make unions
here more militant than before: a booming economy that has yet to
trickle down to society's lowest rungs, bitter memories of cutbacks
during the most recent recession, politicians who court union votes
by granting them major concessions, and the public's lack of true
awareness about the issues and vast amounts of money at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have weak mayors, lots of power in city councils, lots of
various authorities that fragment ultimate responsibility and
power,'' said Ralph Rossum, director of the Rose Institute of State
and Local Government at Claremont McKenna College. ``Therefore,
unions look strong relative to the weakness of the governmental
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one set of individuals who, if they do stand up to
unions, either take the blame if the public is behind the unions or
take the credit if the public is opposed to what the unions are
trying to secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Public employee unions are especially powerful, he said, because
they are negotiating with politicians who need their votes, and
because they have the power of monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   In the private sector, for example, if workers at an auto
factory go on strike, the public can always buy cars elsewhere. But
if bus drivers or public teachers go on strike, alternatives are
harder to find.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Los Angeles unions spoke out like never before. The
8,500-member janitors union went on strike earlier this year,
winning major concessions in wages and working conditions.
Commercial actors have been on strike for several months over
issues relating to residuals for cable television and overseas
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus and rail operators
have been on strike for two weeks, causing increased traffic
congestion and reduced economic activity while leaving nearly half
a million daily riders scrambling for alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, MTA officials asked United Transportation Union
chairman James Williams to agree to a federal mediator, submit
detailed written demands and allow bus and rail drivers to return
to work while talks continue, UTU spokesman Goldy Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he would work on a formal comprehensive proposal
but would not agree to call in a federal mediator or send members
back to work while negotiations continue, Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Unions representing Los Angeles teachers and county employees
are set to strike in the near future, while Hollywood is already
bracing for an expected Writers Guild strike next year over issues
similar to the commercial actors.
</P>
<P>
   Ezunial Burts, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of
Commerce, said this year's labor unrest was long expected because
of the convergence of major contracts expiring in the same period,
even as the economy is booming.
</P>
<P>
   But the good economy, he said, doesn't necessarily mean all
employers are flush with cash. Local governments, he said, tend to
get revenues later than the federal government, while private
sector employers are increasingly seeking to reduce costs to stay
competitive in the world market.
</P>
<P>
   Having all the strikes occur at roughly the same time, he said,
hurts the city's image and makes businesses less willing to stay or
relocate here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the cumulative effect I worry about,'' Burts said. ``One
or two of these isn't so tough to handle in the short run. You
settle it and a year from now you don't remember it. But you keep
having these and pretty soon the reputation we worked so hard to
gain to promote the positive things in this economy ... it can wipe
that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Feuer, who helped negotiate a
police contract this summer, said management and union leaders need
to find a balance between bridging wage gaps and providing good
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential convergence of these labor actions would be
awful from the standpoint of the average resident of this city,''
Feuer said. ``I hope very much that the labor actions don't take
place and that reasonable people strike a middle ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossum said the unions are also vulnerable to a backlash, if
they appear to be too powerful and win too many concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the solution to a too-powerful public union?`` Rossum
asked rhetorically. ``Privatization. Vouchers. Privatize
transportation and trash, and even security matters and prison
guards. If they push too far, more people are going to say that the
only real solution is to introduce some competition.''

DAUGHTER OF ASU COACH WORKS AT UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Paige Snyder, a student employee in the UCLA
football office, is by all accounts a hard worker with a pleasant
personality. Everyone normally loves to have her around _ but not
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder happens to be the daughter of Arizona State coach Bruce
Snyder, whose team plays the Bruins at the Rose Bowl on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   So, each year when the Bruins play Arizona State, she's given
the week off. This year, with school just starting, she hadn't
begun to work anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, a junior, has worked in the football office the past two
years. She works mostly with recruits, playing host to players
during games and doing data entry. Another one of her duties is to
collate copies of the Bruins' scouting reports each week _ except
one, of course.
</P>
<P>
   She also isn't involved when UCLA and Arizona State are
recruiting the same player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona State week, it's a little odd, but she's a great
kid,'' said Lea Bean, a football administrative assistant and
Snyder's supervisor. ``We don't want to put her in an uncomfortable
situation. She says, `Yeah, I'm totally loyal to UCLA every week
but this one.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She has such a bubbly personality and is so much fun to work
with that it doesn't strain anything that she's the daughter of a
rival Pac-10 head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Add legacies: Snyder isn't the only member of the football
family with a famous father from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Ryan Nece is the son of former USC defensive back
Ronnie Lott, and fullback Chris Jackson is the son of former
Washington linebacker Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   __ Krohn out, Kealy in: Arizona State quarterback Jeff Krohn,
who missed Wednesday's practice with what was thought to be the
flu, has been diagnosed with mononucleosis and is out indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Kealy, the talented fifth-year senior who has been beset by
injuries and suspension, will make his first start of the season
for the Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dijon, s'il vous plait: It's not only a big weekend for the
football team, but also for the basketball team, whose coaches will
be entertaining Redondo High's 6-foot-7 guard Dijon Thompson on an
official recruiting visit.
</P>
<P>
   With Mayfair's Josh Childress turning the Bruins down, Thompson
is the wing player they've set their sights on.
</P>
<P>
   __ Good start for end Freshman Terrell Suggs has been a
sensation at defensive end for Arizona State with five sacks, a
forced fumble and a 48-yard interception returned for a touchdown.
Quietly doing the job at the other end has been another freshman,
redshirt Brian Montesanto of Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Montesanto, a 6-foot-6, 240-pound graduate of Royal, stepped
into a starting position when senior Quincy Yancy was suspended for
the season opener against San Diego State and hasn't given it up.
He's had four tackles and 1 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian is a real pleasant surprise,'' Arizona State coach Bruce
Snyder said. ``Talk about somebody who's gotten better every
practice and every game. It's not by much but over time it
accumulates. I think he's a much better player today than he was
three to four weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bell dinged: Cornerback Jason Bell, who practiced earlier in
the week, has been limited the last two days because of the
hamstring he tweaked against Oregon. Behind Bell is Joe Hunter, who
broke up a pass when he replaced Bell for a play against the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's injury would have the most impact in nickel and dime
coverages since the Bruins are also without strong safety Marques
Anderson (surgery), one of their best cover men. Audie Attar will
replace Anderson.

LESSONS COULD BE LEARNED HERE

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ I've always thought the criterion for a
sport being included in the Olympics was simple: If the Olympics
aren't the ultimate reward, the sport doesn't belong here.
</P>
<P>
   The impudence of people such as tennis gazillionaire Pete
Sampras, who waffles on competing at the Games because of the
inconvenience involved, galls me. It seems a stinging slap in the
face to all the athletes who gladly, gallantly endure lives of
spartan pleasures in the pursuit of a few seconds of Olympic glory.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Thursday the Williams sisters and Marion Jones both
spoke of being humbled by the Olympic experience and that's when it
hit me:
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a good thing to have millionaire sportsmen and
sportswomen mingling with lesser-known but no less accomplished
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the more professional athletes who compete in the Games
the better. Perhaps it's prudent to let John Rocker come on in
relief against Cuba, Ken Griffey Jr. swing for the fences against
Korea, Jalen Rose whine about every foul in a game against Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   I'm for anything that'll widen some notable athletes' frame of
references, which appear only large enough to hold a glossy
close-up of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If Venus and Serena Williams, who have three Grand Slam titles
between them, can be awed by Russian Greco-Roman wrestler Alexander
Karelin, why not Barry Bonds?
</P>
<P>
   Karelin had gone 13 years between defeats before falling to
American Rulon Gardner in the heavyweight gold-medal match. That no
doubt helped Venus Williams put her own 32-match winning streak in
persepective.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones, who has collected gold medals in the 100 and 200
meters here, can be humbled just being in the company of
weightlifter Cheryl Haworth and gymnast Elise Ray and judoka Sandra
Bacher, why not Allen Iverson?
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 24, is three gold medals away from becoming a global
icon. No female track star has collected five gold medals in a
single Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly no Olympic athlete, not the great Finn Paavo Nurmi
in the 1920s or the U.S. king Carl Lewis in the 1980s, had a
television network working so feverishly in the role of de facto
personal publicist. A win in the long jump today, followed closely
by victories in the 400 and 600 relays and Jones will be bigger
than Bill Gates (and nearly as rich).
</P>
<P>
   Being in the midst of so many talented athletes, Jones said, has
helped her put her historic quest in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is so much bigger than one person or one team,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was heartening to hear Jones say that.
</P>
<P>
   After all she has been put through this week, it was reassuring
to see Jones was able to joke Thursday about being introduced
before her 200-meter final as hailing from the Bahamas (chalk it up
to wishful thinking by the stadium announcer, who in the 100-meter
final had introduced three Bahamian sprinters in addition to
Jones).
</P>
<P>
   It was refreshing to see the easy banter back and forth between
Jones and the loquacious 200-meters silver medalist, Pauline
Davis-Thompson, who was over the moon after winning her first
individual Olympic medal in this, her fifth Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marion,'' she said in a lovely lilt, so full of herself but
without seeming at all full of it, ``We're going to give you one
hell of a run in the (sprint) relay.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Davis-Thompson, alluding to Jones' mother being from
Belize, added, ``I know that you have some Caribbean blood in you,
Marion, so you're almost like us,''
</P>
<P>
   Jones laughed so loud it drowned out all the background noise
that has been ringing in her ears the past few days. For a few
seconds, the rest of the world fell away.
</P>
<P>
   Of such moments are the transcendental experience of the
Olympics made. In the long run, it probably would be good if more
professional athletes could speak of it firsthand.

LONG LIFE INCREASINGLY COMMON IN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, REPORT 
 SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  The average life span of people in modern industrialized
countries has grown longer over the past century, and a University
of California at Berkeley researcher said the trend shows no sign
of slowing down.
<P>
   In a report to be published Friday in the journal Science,
demographer John R. Wilmoth and his colleagues suggest people may
one day routinely live to be 120 years old or more.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists have long held that biology places a rigid limit
on human aging at 120 years, but Wilmoth maintains that the Swedish
records call that very much into question.
</P>
<P>
   The king of Sweden in 1686 decreed that every priest in his
country keep meticulous records of births and deaths in every
parish, and by 1860 those parish records were being kept by the
kingdom's government in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Swedes did it right,'' Wilmoth said Thursday, ``and
because they've done it, Sweden has the best continuous records of
births, deaths and age trends in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1860s, the Swedish records show, the oldest age at
death for both men and women centered around 101 years _ with
women, on average, tending to live somewhat longer than men.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, the average maximum age at death in Sweden had
risen slowly to 105. By the 1990s, it had reached 108, according to
the analysis by Wilmoth and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Here in America, government reports have estimated that 37,000
``centenarians`` 100 years old or older were alive in 1990. That
the number has risen to 70,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not at all implausible, although it obviously can't go
on indefinitely,'' Wilmoth said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there must be some biological limit to how long people
can live, and although there's no scientific answer to that
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect that older people today could realistically
expect to reach more than 110 or 120 at most,'' Wilmoth said.
``That seems to be a realistic outer limit.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest human being whose age at death has been documented
was a French woman named Jeanne Calment of Arles. She knew Vincent
Van Gogh as a child, took fencing lessons at 85 and died in 1997
when she was 122.45 years old, according French records.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly are certainly living longer on average today _
primarily because better public health measures like immunizations,
sanitation and clean drinking water have enabled more of them to
survive in good health past childhood and better health care has
kept them healthier as they age, Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as people reach the seventies,'' he said, ``they're
already healthier than the elderly were in the past, and so their
life expectancy becomes longer.''
</P>
<P>
   That improvement in health of the aged has largely resulted from
more effective treatments for heart disease and stroke, from a
year-by-year decline in smoking, and from the development of new
drugs, Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   Today the average life expectancy among babies born in 24
industrial nations is more than 70 years, according to the World
Health Organization. But at the other extreme, life expectancy is
less than 40 years for children born in what is called the
developing world. Even worse, for sub-Saharan Africa where AIDS is
now the leading cause of death, life expectancy for new-borns is
less than 33 years, WHO figures show.

GALAXY TO PLAY VS. KANSAS CITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The weight of the MLS semifinal series will fall on the
shoulders of Galaxy strikers Luis Hernandez and Cobi Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Kansas City Wizards posted the stingiest
defensive numbers in league history, led by team USA's 1994 World
Cup starting goalkeeper, Tony Meola. He recorded 15 shutouts en
route to a record-setting 0.92 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards allowed only 29 goals in 32 regular-season games to
wrestle the Western Division title away from the Galaxy. However,
the Galaxy burned K.C. the last time these teams met at Arrowhead
Stadium, winning 5-1 behind the creativity of Jones, Hernandez and
midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos in August.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams man-mark either Jones or Hernandez, but Meola said
the Wizards will stick with their zone defense tonight in game one
of the best-of-three series at Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't man-to-manned anybody,'' said Meola. ``We play a
zone defense and are very into trying to cut out the source. If we
don't cut the source out, that's where you get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two (Jones and Hernandez) have been man-marked their
whole careers and know how to get open when man-marked. More often
than not, their attack comes from Cienfuegos. We have to limit him.
The more opportunities he provides, the worse off we'll be.''
</P>
<P>
   The back three of K.C.'s defense _ Peter Vermes, Nick Garcia and
Brandon Prideaux _ get most of the credit, but Meola said the
defensive chemistry starts in the midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we don't get enough credit is with Matt McKeon and Kerry
Zavagnin in the midfield,'' said Meola. ``For me, Kerry has had the
most consistent year on our team. These guys really break plays up
in the midfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Hernandez played their best game as a strike tandem in
last week's series clinching 5-2 victory over Tampa Bay in the
first round. Hernandez scored a goal and notched three assists.
Jones also had a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time to get to know a player,'' Jones said of his
relationship with Hernandez. ``We've missed playing together
because of some qualifiers. Now, we've had some time where we've
been in Los Angeles together. Little by little, everything is
starting to click. It's starting to work. I think we are starting
to complement each other well.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the shaky Mutiny defense the Galaxy burned in the
playoff opener, however. Jones realizes chances will not come
easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be difficult; this is the toughest team to break
down,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy is 1-1-2 against the Wizards, with each club winning
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Kansas City has a good defense and we have a good
offense, it will be an intriguing battle,'' Jones said. ``This is a
playoff matchup that everyone wants.''

NORTHRIDGE FOCUSES ON OWN LOSSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's not as if Cal State Northridge will be out of
contention for the Big Sky Conference title if it can't find a way
to beat Idaho State on Saturday at North Campus Stadium. Still, the
Matadors are approaching Saturday as if it's a do-or-die game.
</P>
<P>
   They have played well in spurts, but a sluggish offense,
turnovers and costly defensive mistakes have plagued them all
season. If they don't correct the problems _ and fast _ it could be
a long season.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors (1-2, 0-1) had a week to regroup after a bye and
are ready to erase the disappointment of a second-half collapse
against Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho State (2-1, 1-1) is coming off an emotional 41-39 win over
Sacramento State. However, CSUN coach Jeff Kearin said the focus
isn't on Idaho State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I must sound like a broken record, but we need to take
care of the ball,'' Kearin said. ``I've been preaching that and
we've yet to do that. It's not so much focusing on Idaho State as
it is us. We need to execute offensively, hang onto the ball and
play solid on defense. That's what we've been concentrating on.
That's what I've been talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that CSUN isn't concerned about Idaho State's
running game. Running back Nick Whitworth, who ran for 134 yards on
25 carries last week, was named a Big Sky player of the week.
Teammate DeRonn Finley, who had an 85-yard punt return for a
touchdown, also was honored.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that Idaho State has lost 10 consecutive road
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take a look at the program, I don't know if I'd say
it's mental,'' ISU coach Larry Lewis said. ``We've had a losing
streak in a lot of areas. We're just trying to string a number of
wins together, whether it's home or away. We want to take the
momentum from our wins at home and take it on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Amerson's status: Sophomore receiver Drew Amerson (right
knee) is probable for Saturday's game but it will be a game-time
decision. Amerson participated in drills full speed Thursday but
hasn't taken hits.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Harmon Forecast: CSUN 20, Idaho State 10.
</P>
<P>
   __ Penalty reduction: Kearin's focus on penalties has paid off.
Last year, CSUN was the most penalized team in the Big Sky. This
season, it's the !ital!least penalized team with 94 total yards in
three games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Keeping pace: CSUN punter Ethan Beck _ a preseason
All-American _ is having solid back-to-back seasons. He's ranked
fifth in Division I-AA punting with a 43.6 yards-per punt average.
</P>
<P>
   A Jacksonville Jaguars scout was at Thursday's practice looking
at him and liked what he saw. He was also impressed with
quarterback Marcus Brady.
</P>
<P>
   __ Felix quits: Senior receiver Ryan Felix _ a transfer from
Utah State _ has quit the team for personal reasons, according to
Kearin. Felix had no receptions this season.

   __ Just a joke: Former CSUN athletic director Paul Bubb played a
joke on Kearin.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb read on the Internet that CSUN is willing to fill UCLA's
open date for the 2002 season opener. He had a CSUN secretary tell
Kearin that UCLA athletic director Pete Dalis had left a telephone
message for him. Kearin, very skeptical, later found out Bubb was
behind the joke.

 FEWER UNINSURED IN U.S., CENSUS SHOWS  &HT;     By LOUIS FREEDBERG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time in a decade, the number of
people without health insurance declined significantly last year,
in part because employers in a tight labor market have been forced
to offer coverage to attract and retain workers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of uninsured remains extremely high _ 42.6
million in 1999 _ that figure represented a decline of 1.7 million
from 1998, according to a report released Thursday by the U.S.
Census Bureau. The number of uninsured children declined to 10
million, a decline of 1 million from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that our nation's strong economic growth has
made it possible for more businesses to offer health care benefits
to their workers,'' said Kate Sullivan, director of health care
policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the Census Bureau found that the number of people
covered by insurance offered by their employers jumped by 1.2
million between 1998 and 1999, by far the biggest increase in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The census figures were met with some relief by health
officials, who have been grappling with the conundrum that during
the biggest economic boom in U.S. history, the number of people
without health coverage continued to climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reason to be cautiously optimistic that that we may
have turned the corner,'' said Glen Rosselli, undersecretary of
California's Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, there were 33 million uninsured people. By 1998, that
number had risen to 44 million. One of the reasons for the increase
was that about 3 million people on Medicaid, the government health
program for the poor, dropped off the Medicaid rolls between 1994
and 1998, apparently as a result of welfare reforms at a state and
national level. The number of people on individual insurance plans
also dropped, mainly in response to rising premiums.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to be happening now is that the declines in
enrollments in Medicaid and private insurance programs have
steadied, while employers are offering more coverage. The federally
subsidized Child Health Insurance Program has also contributed to
the decline in uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   California accounts for by far the largest proportion of
uninsured in the nation. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the
number of uninsured people in California dropped from 7.4 million
in 1998 to 6.9 million in 1999. The number of uninsured children
declined from 1.9 to 1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   But many health experts said it is still worrisome that the
nation's booming economy has left millions of people stranded
without coverage, especially those in the lowest-paid jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that even with a good economy and employers competing
for workers, and increased government efforts to enroll children,
these have not been sufficient to make a real dent in the number of
uninsured,'' said Diane Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser
Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. ``We will need bigger and
broader interventions to make insurance affordable to millions of
Americans without coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Kaiser survey showed that the proportion of businesses
with less than 200 workers offering health coverage jumped from 54
percent in 1998 to 67 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, only 48 percent of businesses offer health
insurance, compared with 61 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers for the Service Employees International Union, which
has successfully organized some of the state's lowest-paid workers,
say employers are still reluctant to offer comprehensive health
coverage, and will only do so if they are forced to do so &LR;   &LR; by
strike action or other pressures. In the union's recent campaign to
organize janitors in Southern California, employers wanted to strip
workers of their existing health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has there been a sea change in employer's attitudes or desires
to provide comprehensive family health coverage to low-wage service
workers?'' asked Paul Kumar, political director of SEIU Local 250,
which represents 50,000 health workers in Northern California.
``The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there is concern about what will happen when the
current economic boom ends. ``All we need is a downturn in the
economy, and we could see the numbers skyrocket again,'' said
Kaiser's Rowland.

FDA APPROVES ABORTION PILL FOR SALE IN U.S.
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  In an election-year blow to abortion opponents, the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration Thursday granted long-sought marketing
approval for mifepristone _ the French abortion pill known as
RU-486.
<P>
   Available in France since 1989, the drug makes available a
method of abortion that can be conducted in the privacy of a
woman's home. It is expected to eventually replace up to one-third
of the 1.4 million surgical abortions performed each year in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who choose to have an early termination of their
pregnancy, this is a reasonable medical alternative,'' said FDA
Commissioner Jane Henney.
</P>
<P>
   The approval caps a 12-year effort by abortion rights advocates
to bring RU-486 to the United States following its approval in
France. That effort was hindered first by hostile Republican
administrations, then by difficulties in finding a willing
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Citing concerns about violence by anti-abortion extremists,
Henney took the unprecedented step of shielding the location of the
manufacturing plant, which is widely reported to be in China.
</P>
<P>
   The drug will be sold under the trade name Mifeprex by Danco
Laboratories LLC, a New York firm created by abortion rights
advocates for the sole purpose of bringing RU-486 to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Danco executives said Thursday that the abortion pills will be
ready for shipment to qualifying physicians within a month, but
abortion clinic operators do not expect Mifeprex to be widely
available until early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The imminent arrival of the drug in the United States has
invigorated abortion rights advocates, who had been eagerly
anticipating it since the early days of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``At long last, science trumps anti-abortion politics and
medical McCarthyism,'' said Eleanor Smeal of the Feminist Majority
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion foes quickly denounced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before has the FDA approved a drug intended to kill
people,'' said Oklahoma Republican Tom Coburn, a physician from
Muskogee and vice chairman of the powerful House Commerce Health
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Coming only six weeks before the presidential election, the FDA
decision may reignite passions over the contentious abortion issue.
Although Democrat Al Gore supports abortion rights and Republican
George W. Bush does not, the subject has not been high on either
candidate's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Bush declared that the FDA decision was ``wrong'' and
that he feared it would make abortions in the United States more
common. ``As president,'' he said, ``I will work to build a culture
that respects life.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Cirmo, spokeswoman for the Family Research Council, a
Washington D.C.-based group opposed to abortion, vowed to make the
FDA ruling an election issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who respect life should get out there and express their
views,'' she said. ``A new president coming in will not only be
able to put a new Supreme Court on the bench, but will appoint a
new FDA commissioner who will have an ability to impact this
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said there could be some grounds
to challenge the approval. ``It appears the president does not have
the authority to order drugs off the market, but as president, he
would want a careful review to make sure the FDA considered all the
risks and didn't do this as a result of political pressure from the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, supported the FDA move and denied that
the decision was timed for the election. ``Today's decision is not
about politics, but the health and safety of American women and a
woman's fundamental right to choose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA decision sets several strict limits on the distribution
of mifepristone. It can only be dispensed at doctor's offices and
clinics where physicians are trained to recognize tubal pregnancies
_ a dangerous condition for which RU-486 would not be prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is also requiring that physicians who dispense the
abortion pill also be able to provide a surgical abortion _ or be
able to refer a woman to such a provider _ in the 5 percent to 8
percent of cases where the pill does not work.
</P>
<P>
   Taken in a two-drug regimen by women up to seven weeks pregnant,
the abortion pill will induce a miscarriage that most women will
experience in the privacy of their home as a week or more of
heavier-than-usual menstrual bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; 3 Doctors' Visits
</P>
<P>
   Women who seek an abortion using the pills must visit their
doctor or clinic three times, instead of the single visit required
for a surgical abortion. On their first visit, they will get a
three-pill dosage of mifepristone. The drug blocks progesterone, a
hormone that is essential for maintaining a healthy pregnancy. Two
days later, they receive a second pill that induces uterine
contractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few hours, there are cramps and bleeding,'' said Dr.
Richard Fischer, associate medical director of Planned Parenthood
Golden Gate. ``There is typically heavy bleeding for an hour or
two, a bit heavier than a heavy period for most women. She may pass
some small blood clots.'' According to the FDA, bleeding and
spotting may continue for nine to sixteen days.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks, a third visit is required to confirm that the
abortion has been completed. In about 1-in-20 cases, tissue remains
in the uterus, and the patient must be referred to a doctor who can
complete the surgical abortion _ usually by vacuum aspiration of
the remaining tissue in the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said the embryo at seven weeks is so small that most
women would be unable to identify it. ``In surgical abortions at
this time, we see placental tissue and a gestational sac. We
virtually never see an embryo,'' he said. ``For most women, using
the pill is the same as having a miscarriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement with Danco and the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, the pill will be made available to clinics
at a price that will allow the clinics to charge no more than they
do for surgical abortions. At Planned Parenthood Golden Gate,
patients who have abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy are
charged $400, according to Dian Harrison, president and chief
executive of the Bay Area clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said it was unfortunate that it has taken so long for
the pill to be approved in the United States. ``Women in countries
around the world have used this safely for more than a decade,''
she said. ``Even though it has taken so long, we are pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Developed by researchers at French pharmaceutical manufacturer
Roussel Uclaf in 1980, the pill known as RU-486 was tested in both
the United States and France. The French Ministry of Health
approved the pill for marketing in 1988, but at the same time the
Bush administration barred its importation into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Roussel Uclaf in May 1994 donated marketing rights to the
Population Council, a New York based nonprofit that primarily
worked on family planning issues in underdeveloped nations, which
agreed to find a U.S. manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   During the subsequent six years, the Population Council was
criticized for taking too long to get the drug through the approval
process. Part of the difficulty, executives there concede, was
finding a manufacturer willing to withstand the wrath of
anti-abortion opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Danco's efforts to win approval to market mifepristone were
aided by a $10 million loan from the David and Lucile Packard
Foundation, the Los Altos philanthropy funded by the founder of
electronics pioneer Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting day for us. The whole foundation is
pleased that this pill is finally available in this country,'' said
Sarah Clark, director of population programs.

 FEDS CHARGE SOFTWARE EXECS IN $9 BILLION SCAM  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In one of the nation's biggest cases of
financial fraud, federal prosecutors in San Francisco Thursday
accused two former software executives of orchestrating a bogus
accounting scheme that cost investors $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The onetime executives of medical softwaremaker HBO &AMP; Co., which
merged last year with San Francisco's McKesson Corp., were charged
with falsifying company ledgers to boost HBOC's profits.
</P>
<P>
   When the alleged scheme was revealed just three months after the
merger, the combined firm's stock plunged nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials at the U.S. attorney's office and the
Securities and Exchange Commission told The Chronicle that separate
fraud investigations are focusing on other Bay Area firms,
including companies in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Indictments were unsealed Thursday charging Jay Gilbertson, 40,
and Albert Bergonzi, 50, with 17 counts of securities fraud,
conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud related to what investigators
termed ``cooking of books'' at HBOC.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson and Bergonzi were HBOC's co-presidents and co-chief
operating officers prior to the merger. Gilbertson also served as
the company's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is a poster child for the devastating effect of
financial fraud by corporate management,'' said U.S. Attorney
Robert Mueller. ``McKesson HBOC shareholders lost $9 billion in a
single day as a result of the defendants' actions.''
</P>
<P>
   McKesson HBOC is North America's leading distributor of
pharmaceuticals and health care products and a world leader in
medical information systems and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``These indictments represent one of the largest financial
crimes ever investigated by the FBI,'' said Bruce Gebhardt, who
oversees the FBI's San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   According to authorities, Gilbertson, Bergonzi and a third
suspect, Dominick DeRosa, conspired beginning in late 1997 to boost
HBOC's share price by fraudulently exaggerating the company's
financial results.
</P>
<P>
   DeRosa, who served as HBOC's vice president of enterprise sales,
has since settled with the SEC and agreed to pay more than $400,000
in restitution and fines. He is cooperating with investigators in
their case against the former co-presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Securities regulators said Gilbertson and Bergonzi coordinated
HBOC's efforts to manipulate accounting records by concealing and
back-dating various contracts and by altering ledgers to inflate
the company's net income.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew what they were doing was wrong,'' said Helane
Morrison, district administrator for the SEC's San Francisco
office. ``They succumbed to the pressures of the marketplace and
lined their own pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said that prior to the alleged accounting fraud being
revealed, Gilbertson sold off $7 million worth of HBOC shares and
Bergonzi unloaded $4 million worth of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were misled when HBOC and, later, McKesson HBOC
reported financial results based on the bogus accounting, the SEC
said.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged scheme finally came to light when company auditors
reported to McKesson HBOC's board of directors that something was
seriously wrong with the books.
</P>
<P>
   An outside accounting firm was brought in to investigate, and
McKesson HBOC announced on April 28, 1999, that it would be forced
to restate several years' worth of earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, the company's stock tumbled to $34.50 from a high
of almost $66 a share.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson HBOC has yet to recover. The company's stock closed
Thursday up 38 cents at $30.50.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kurtz, a spokesman for McKesson HBOC, declined to comment
on the indictments of Gilbertson and Bergonzi. ``These are not
people who work here anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson left HBOC prior to the merger, in November 1998,
Kurtz said. Bergonzi, who had served as head of information
technology for the merged company, was fired in June 1999, along
with three other former HBOC executives.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz said McKesson HBOC has cooperated ``fully and completely''
with federal investigators since the alleged fraud was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   While he was unable to say whether McKesson executives harbored
resentment over having purchased a company that was allegedly
cooking its books, Kurtz acknowledged that the alleged fraud
clearly boosted HBOC's approximately $12 billion purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We overpaid,'' he said. ``We certainly did.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, the U.S. attorney, said Gilbertson and Bergonzi face up
to 10 years in prison and a fine of $1 million if found guilty of
violating securities fraud laws.
</P>
<P>
   Each count of conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud carries a
maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When corporate managers engage in financial accounting fraud,
they must be held accountable,'' Mueller said. ``We cannot and will
not tolerate the deliberate cooking of books.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the investigation of McKesson HBOC is continuing
but declined to say whether additional indictments are expected.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the SEC filed charges against three former
executives of Sunnyvale softwaremaker Cylink Corp. alleging that
they, too, had fiddled with company ledgers to exaggerate financial
performance.
</P>
<P>
   A Chronicle investigation of Silicon Valley financial practices
earlier this year suggested that securities regulators have been
lax in uncovering fraud in the tech industry. However, the SEC's
Morrison said this was not an accurate characterization of her
agency's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking hard at financial fraud in Silicon Valley,'' she
said. ``Where we find it, we're going to prosecute it.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the SEC and U.S. attorney's office declined to
specify which Bay Area companies are now under scrutiny by federal
authorities for alleged fraud.
</P>
<P>
   They only confirmed that such investigations are under way.

BEAVERS NO LONGER EASY PREY FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Paul Hackett was an assistant coach at USC nearly
25 years ago. Could he have foreseen that in 2000, as the Trojans'
head coach, he would be so worried about playing perennial doormat
Oregon State?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I wouldn't have thought that,'' Hackett said Thursday as
his team concluded practice. ``I'd think (Oregon State) will be
down. But no, they're not. Football's changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody made the statement that when I was here before, we
had seven or eight wins in the summer, and then it was a matter of
winning three or four games. I think it's changed dramatically in
20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Keeping it loud: As promised, USC broke out the loudspeakers
for Thursday's practice, with something that was supposed to
resemble crowd noise blaring from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never experienced that before,'' tight end Alex Holmes said.
``It's not really sound. It's more like screeching. It
discombobulates you.''
</P>
<P>
   USC has never won a game for which it practiced with
loudspeakers in the past two years. Instead, the Trojans lost to
such teams as Oregon, Arizona, Notre Dame and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted them to be conscious about it,'' Hackett said.
``I don't want anybody to be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   __ And then there were two: Holmes, who attended
Harvard-Westlake, and wide receiver Keary Colbert are the only two
freshmen who will play this season, something even Holmes didn't
expect before the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' he said. ``We came in with what we thought was
one of the best recruiting classes in the country. We had
(offensive lineman) Joe McGuire, (strong safety) Matt Grootegoed.
It just didn't work out. But Keary and I are really excited.''
</P>
<P>
   As the result of injuries and illness, McGuire and Grootegoed
are redshirting. Quarterback Matt Cassel of Chatsworth will make
the trip, but only as a precautionary measure in case quarterbacks
Carson Palmer and Mike Van Raaphorst are injured. He is scheduled
to redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   __ Left off the trip: USC is limited to taking 60 players to
Corvallis, Ore. Among those not making the trip are offensive
linemen Phillip Eaves and Nate Steinbacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've had to do that,'' Hackett said.
``It's always hard for me, because so many people contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   When USC goes into its goal-line offense, redshirt freshman
Jacob Rogers will fill in for Faaesea Mailo at fullback. At one
time, Eaves and Steinbacher were candidates for that job.
</P>
<P>
   __ Running with the ball: Assistant coach Kennedy Pola said one
reason tailback Sultan McCullough has fumbled twice in the first
three games is McCullough is used to running track, in which he
doesn't have to hold a football.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been running track for so long, he's a form runner, and
now he has to run with a ball under his arm,'' Pola said. ``As many
carries as he has, he's going to have some (fumbles).''
</P>
<P>
   Pola, a former USC player, remembers watching Marcus Allen work
out on the school's track in an effort to avoid fumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran around the track with a football in his hand,'' Pola
said. ``It has to become a habit and it will for Sultan.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Two snappers? Hackett said he wasn't sure whether Zeke Moreno
or Norm Katnik would handle the snaps on punts. Moreno has been the
regular snapper, but Katnik replaced him last week so he could
rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as anything it's how much Zeke is playing,'' Hackett
said. ``It's not the snapping, it's the running down the field that
does it to you.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Weather update: The latest forecast for Corvallis called for
thunderstorms and a temperature of 71 degrees Saturday.

CALIFORNIA BILL ALLOWING DNA TESTING TO EXONERATE PRISONERS  SIGNED
INTO LAW
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ERIN HALLISSY and CHARLIE GOODYEAR 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hailed as the most important criminal justice legislation of the
year, a bill that will allow DNA testing to exonerate prisoners who
claim they were wrongly convicted was signed into law Thursday by
Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also approved DNA legislation that could help law
enforcement link more criminals to unsolved cases and set up a DNA
data bank for relatives of missing children. A bill that removes
the six-year statute of limitations in rape cases with DNA evidence
will also become law because it was tied to the bills signed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new laws expand the use of DNA evidence so that law
enforcement can catch criminals as well as help locate missing
persons,'' said Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who has pushed for
more extensive use of genetic testing, which has been called the
most important forensic breakthrough since fingerprinting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new laws also provide an important framework by which
innocent persons who have been wrongly convicted may use new
scientific techniques to prove their innocence, while preventing
the guilty from manipulating procedures to delay or thwart the
administration of justice,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   California becomes just the third state in the country to allow
inmates postconviction DNA testing of evidence. New York and
Illinois have similar statutes. The bill's author, Senate President
Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, called it ``probably the best
bill in the nation'' in allowing DNA testing for prisoners claiming
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a proud day for justice in the state of California,''
Burton said. ``This is very, very significant, far-reaching
legislation, and I'm pleased to have been a part of it and pleased
that the governor saw fit to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendocino County Public Defender Jeff Thoma, a nationally
recognized expert on DNA who helped negotiate the final version of
the Burton bill, said postconviction testing in California will
have immediate tangible results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that we will have at least 25 to 50 cases within the
first year come before different courts in the state in which
judges believe there is a genuine reason for postconviction DNA
testing,'' Thoma said. ``Sometimes you're talking about a life as
opposed to a test that costs less than $1,000. It seems like a
no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of DNABILLS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The Burton bill, which was supported by a broad coalition that
included prosecutors and victims' groups, was also welcomed by the
state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly our view that this is probably the most
important criminal justice bill of the year,'' said ACLU
legislative director Francisco Lobaco. ``The last thing you want to
see is innocent people being incarcerated in prison, and that has
been the reality, as has been shown throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Another bill that Lockyer backed, sponsored by Assemblyman Mike
Machado, D-Linden, will allow law enforcement to use DNA to solve
serial crimes. Previously, only samples from convicted felons could
be included in the state Justice Department's DNA data bank in
Berkeley. Under Machado's bill, a DNA sample can be taken from a
suspect who is charged with a crime and compared to other unsolved
cases.
</P>
<P>
   The bill could help make the DNA data bank more successful in
cracking cases. Lockyer's top priority this year has been to
improve the DNA lab. The Chronicle reported last year that the
lab's attempts to build a comprehensive data bank of convicted
murderers, rapists and other felons were mired in huge backlogs.
</P>
<P>
   The same lab will handle the new DNA data bank of relatives of
missing children. The legislation by Sen. Jackie Speier,
D-Hillsborough, will impose a $2 fee on death certificates,
providing $3 million a year for five years to pay for the data
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Samples voluntarily given by family members will be matched with
DNA taken from 2,000 unidentified remains in county morgues around
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Swartz, whose then 7-year-old daughter Amber disappeared
from her Pinole home in 1988, provided her own DNA sample for the
missing persons database earlier this month and welcomed the
governor's decision to sign Speier's bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although matching the missing to the unidentified dead is not
something most parents would want to hear, it's better to know
rather than to continue on not knowing,'' Swartz said. ``This bill
will not only answer the question for thousands of parents in
California, but potentially for parents in other states as well. It
just opens up the doors to so many possibilities of closure.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of DNABILLS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Speier said that along with providing closure for families, the
system could also provide law enforcement with new leads in solving
missing persons cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a remarkable and very important step forward in
addressing something we should have addressed a long time ago,''
Speier said. ``It's really unconscionable that we've had the
remains of 2,000 people, 150 of which we know are children, sitting
in coroner's offices for years unidentified.''

OPEC DEMANDS CONCESSIONS FROM WEST ON AID AND TRADE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  CARACAS _ Making a grab for the moral high ground in their
dispute with industrial nations over high fuel prices, the world's
main oil producers announced Thursday that they will use their
clout to demand that the West give aid and trade concessions to
poor nations.
<P>
   Ending a two-day summit, the leaders of the 11-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries downplayed their
long-bitter divisions and declared a new, united front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have triumphed, we have achieved our objectives,''
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said in the conference's closing
speech. ``We have found the road again, we have relaunched OPEC on
the world stage.''
</P>
<P>
   A group long known more for its avid pursuit of wealth than for
social conscience, OPEC urged in its closing declaration that
``industrialized countries recognize that the biggest environmental
tragedy facing the globe is human poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the group took few concrete steps to implement social
goals. The declaration, which contained 20 resolutions, repeated a
series of platitudes and mild exhortations that did not commit OPEC
leaders to any major initiative beyond meeting again in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration urged more coordination within OPEC, strongly
asserted its members' right to a fair price for their oil and
criticized consumer countries' high taxes on oil products.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also agreed to study proposals for an OPEC bank,
university and research and development institute _ steps that, if
implemented, would give substance to the group's claim to be acting
on behalf of developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   But simply having the feuding leaders _ representing rivalries
as bloody as Iraq and Kuwait or as religiously charged as Iran and
Saudi Arabia _ sign the same piece of paper was a great
achievement. The summit was OPEC's first since 1975 to be attended
by heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   And by making a big show of unity and lending their collective
economic weight to the fight against economic globalization _ which
speaker after speaker condemned as cruel and unjust - the assembled
leaders made clear their belief that OPEC is now a coherent,
powerful force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who chaired the summit, noted in a closing press
conference that French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and other
leaders of G-7 industrial nations have phoned him and sent messages
in recent days, asking for a summit meeting with OPEC to discuss
high fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez and the other leaders made clear that they will
insist on concessions on matters unrelated to oil _ such as
forgiving poor nations' debts. The declaration called for ``a
substantive effort for debt reduction initiatives by the
international donor community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we speak with the heads of state, we will not just talk
about oil prices,'' Chavez said. ``This is just one small point
among an infinite number of issues we need to discuss, such as debt
levels, technology transfer, oil price speculation and the
excessively high taxes levied by consumer countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez indicated that OPEC may become a major thorn on
environmental matters, too _ demanding fuel-tax cuts and loosening
of environmental fuel-content rules, which OPEC blames for
disrupting supply and raising prices.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the sort of pressure a united OPEC may wield
against the West _ and the complex political trouble it might cause
the White House _ Chavez cited Venezuela's victory in a 1996 ruling
by the World Trade Organization against the United States. Under
the ruling, U.S. gasoline-content laws were deemed to discriminate
against foreign gasoline _ mainly Venezuelan _ and the
Environmental Protection Organization was obliged to revise the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists used the case as ammunition against the WTO
during chaotic protests at the organization's summit meeting in
Seattle last December.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC officials also have complained about California's gasoline
standards, blaming them for distribution bottlenecks because they
are stricter than the federal norm.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer of oil, sought to temper
the tone struck in the summit declaration by advocating prudence in
discussions with industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah caused a minor flurry in international oil
markets by saying late Wednesday night that his government ``is
ready to supply whatever amount necessary to stabilize the world
market.'' In response, the benchmark crude price fell $1.12
Thursday to $30.34 a barrel, the lowest since Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   But Abdullah's comment was merely a restatement of oft-expressed
Saudi policy.
</P>
<P>
   The summit declaration noted that taxes comprise the bulk of oil
prices in Western nations and urged those countries to reduce them
``for the benefit of the consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, the United States will release 1 million barrels of
oil a day from its strategic reserve, in an attempt to drive down
prices, while OPEC will produce 800,000 more barrels a day in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez _ who frequently praised Abdullah throughout the summit _
appeared to have struck a personal bond with the prince, who is
next in line to the Saudi throne. In fact, Chavez seemed to have
made friends with nearly all the visiting heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main benefits of this summit has been simply to get
to know all the other heads of state closely, to develop a personal
rapport,'' Chavez said. ``We now can simply pick up the phone and
call each other to discuss things.''
</P>
<P>
   The only permanently stone-cold face was that of Iraqi Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan, whose demand for a summit
condemnation of the U.N. oil sanctions against his country was
rebuffed.

 GIANTS' ANSWER BLOWIN' IN THE WIND  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If the Giants are serious about winning the
World Series (and the playoffs that lead up to it), and I think
they are, I have some important advice.
</P>
<P>
   Flags.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Giants could cruise to the world title merely on the
strength of their current level of hitting and pitching. But why
not cover all your bases, so to speak?
</P>
<P>
   My feng shui expert recommends that the Giants install eight
flagpoles someplace behind center field, and fly eight flags like
the Giants' banners that currently fly from poles along the
Embarcadero.
</P>
<P>
   Flags promote good chi, center field is a strong chi power area,
and eight is a number associated with prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Do not dismiss my expert, Deborah Gee. When the Giants' ballpark
was nearing completion, Deborah and I toured the park so she could
assess the feng shui.
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui (pronounced fung shway) is the ancient Chinese art of
orderly arrangement of elements. Good feng shui promotes a positive
flow of chi (life force) in a room or building, and therefore in
the people.
</P>
<P>
   It was breakthrough research. Nobody had ever feng shui'd a
ballpark. I figured that if the Giants got their chi flowing, the
champagne wouldn't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Gee gave the new ballpark a big thumbs-up. The green seats, the
view of the water and mountains, Willie Mays Plaza, the clock
towers _ all dandy chi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team will do much better in this location,'' Gee said.
</P>
<P>
   In her assessment (and my words), Candlestick Park's feng shui
couldn't carry Pac Bell Park's feng shui's jock.
</P>
<P>
   How accurate was Gee's reading? Go check the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to the Giants to add the eight flagpoles.
</P>
<P>
   Gee was on the money before, and as they say in baseball, you
should dance with the feng shui expert that brung you.
</P>
<P>
   DID YOU watch the big Greco-Roman wrestling upset at the
Olympics on Wednesday night? Unknown Wyoming farm boy (Farms in
Wyoming? Who knew?) beats Russian superstar for gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God for TV announcers, because I would have had no idea
who won. I didn't even know which part was Greco and which was
Roman.
</P>
<P>
   This is an esoteric sport. Even this monumental U.S. upset did
not inspire me to grab the phone and order season tickets. It was
like watching midgets move a piano, but without the comedic
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Confession: I was sort of rooting for the Russian. Undefeated
his whole  &UR; life &LR; , a great warrior who reads poetry, and this was
his last match.
</P>
<P>
   Russian athletes used to be such great evil villains, but now
they tend to be sympathetic, tragic characters from a crumbling
country.
</P>
<P>
   I root more for the stories than along national lines. I root
for the white guy sprinter, the black guy swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pretty sure the Russian wrestler got screwed somehow. The
judges didn't give him full credit for his triple axel or
something.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the great things about the Olympics. We all become
instant experts, making bold judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Diving judges: Blind as fruit bats. ... USA men's basketball
``dream team'': Room-Service All-Stars. ... Cathy Freeman: Babe.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I worry. That monstrous Olympic flame burning over the
stadium? That's got global warming written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   FASHION POLICE: San Marino is an old-money suburb of Los
Angeles. The money is so old that George Washington has pimples.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Willie saw a San Marino Police Officers Assn. ad in the
San Marino paper, an opinion poll. One question was, ``In the
summer months, when temperatures are in the 90s and 100s, would you
be willing for your police officers to wear a uniform of a polo
shirt and shorts?''
</P>
<P>
   And if it gets chilly, they could drape a sweater over their
shoulders?
</P>
<P>
   I worry that the idea will get the OK and the community will be
polarized into two warring shirt-logo factions: little polo-player
and little alligator.
</P>
<P>
   THE ELEVATOR at the Oakland Military Examining and Processing
Station _ which, I believe, is where they conduct the autopsies on
UFO aliens _ got stuck between floors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jim Eldred, one of the passengers, picked up the emergency
telephone and found himself talking to a woman in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Her question: ``Just where, exactly, is Oakland.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the globalization of all phone services. In the old days
you would call directory assistance (then Information) for the
number of a restaurant and the operator would tout the joint's
onion rings.
</P>
<P>
   Now she or he says, ``San Francisco? What state is that a member
of?''
</P>
<P>
   So if Dr. Eldred's surgery team is still waiting for him, please
check the elevator shaft. He'll be glad to hear from you.
</P>
<P>
   SIZE COMMUNITY, that's the phrase one S.F. supervisorial
candidate used in reference to (I assume) people who transcend
petit-ness or svelte-ivity.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Elliott writes, ``The really weird thing is how automatic
it has become to call any group a `community,' as though they all
hang out together just because they have something in common.
Nobody gets to be an individual anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   A warm welcome, Beth, to the individuality-seeker community. You
may choose from among a wide variety of residence-card styles.

A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE: WAITING TO HEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ For the past five months, Ian Laperriere
has been thinking about this weekend. And the future.
</P>
<P>
   After rehabilitating from surgery to repair a torn anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee, Laperriere, the Los Angeles
Kings third-line center and chief enforcer, returns to the ice for
the first time Saturday night in Las Vegas against the Colorado
Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to come back tonight when the Kings play at San Jose
in an exhibition game. But after spending 185 minutes last season
in the penalty box that included a NHL-high 21 major penalties,
Laperriere had plenty of time to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am 26 years old and I realized if I wanted to still be in
this league when I am 30, I better make sure this knee is right,''
Laperriere said. ``It's been so hard to be away from this, I can't
wait to get back. But I also learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, this is the same Laperriere with a big smile and
easygoing nature off the ice, who takes on the biggest brutes in
the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope he doesn't think he has to beat up 20 guys the
first night,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said. ``He'll do anything
for the team and always has. But he's healthy after putting up with
a lot of pain for the past two years and we want to keep him that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere first injured his knee two years ago but continued
playing. Last December, he was taken down from behind and hurt it
again but decided he could finish the season.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kings were eliminated by Detroit in the first round of
the playoffs, Laperriere underwent a complete reconstruction. Then
came the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an ACL, you actually feel fine after about six to eight
weeks,'' trainer Pete Demers said. ``You start to think you are
ready to get back out there. But there still is a lot of scar
tissue to break down. It's a five-month process.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Laperriere also agreed to terms on a four-
year, $3.45 million contract. He might have gotten a little more,
but the length of contract was more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went for the security,'' said Laperriere, who spent the
summer in his native Montreal. ``When I was going through the
rehab, my knee felt pretty good after six weeks. But I knew I was
nowhere near ready. I must be getting smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned, however, Laperriere found his enforcer's job
had been given to newcomer Stu Grimson and his third-line center's
spot taken by Bob Corkum.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Laperriere will be working out on right wing and might
play some center with the first unit if Jozef Stumpel does not end
his holdout or if Brad Chartrand or Eric Belanger falter in that
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less to think about on the wing,'' Laperriere said.
``Right now that is good for me. When I finally get out there, I'll
want to do everything at once. This way I can ease back in.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: The Kings expect to lose goaltender Steve Passmore in
today's waiver draft. Edmonton has expressed interest. Boston and
Ottawa also have goaltender needs. . . . The Kings paired their
roster to 28 by sending defensemen Rich Brennan and Peter
LeBoutillier to minor league Lowell, Mass. They also designated
defenseman Philippe Boucher for assignment. Boucher, who was rusty
in camp after missing all but one game last year because of foot
surgery, will be assigned after the Kings see who they lose in the
draft.!dlim!!end!

<P>
   LOS ANGELES Los Angeles drivers pay more to motor their sedans
than drivers in any other city in the nation because of high fuel,
insurance and fix-it costs, according to a consultant's report. But
at least we don't live in Sioux Falls, S.D., where the study says
motorists have the lowest vehicle expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles ranks as the most expensive city in the country to
drive -- $9,254 a year -- while Sioux Falls ranks as the least
costly at $6,171, according to the study released Thursday by
Runzheimer International, a consulting firm for government and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But many Angelenos said they'd pay whatever it takes to power
their automobiles here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the car,'' said Michael Reyes, 22, of Woodland Hills, a
suburb 25 miles northwest of Los Angeles. ``That's why I got it,''
he said, speakers blaring from his 2000 Acura Integra. ``If I can
afford it, I'll drive it.''
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive areas to drive include Los Angeles,
Philadelphia, Providence, R.I.; Bridgeport, Conn.; and Detroit. The
least expensive areas include Sioux Falls; Des Moines, Iowa; Eau
Claire, Wis.; and Bismarck, N.D.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, it costs a 25-year-old man with a clean driving
record $2,800 to drive a 2000 Ford Taurus, as compared with $700 in
Sioux Falls, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, miscellaneous car taxes cost $352, but nothing
in South Dakota; and $56 vs. $47 in registration fees, said Peter
Packer, spokesman for Runzheimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is one of the most expensive cities in America,''
Packer said. ``Los Angeles has always been one of the most
expensive places to own a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks in South Dakota were elated to be ranked last for less
cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great. Geez. It's perfect, that's great,'' said Jeff From,
sales manager for Sioux Falls Ford, whose family leases a Taurus.
``We don't want everybody to know because we don't want everybody
moving out here.''
</P>
<P>
   There, a 2000 Ford Taurus driver will spend $3,083 less to
operate a car through rain and snow than a driver in the same-model
car cruising sunny Ventura Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley
region of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For its study, the Rochester, Wis.-based company compared auto
insurance rates, fuel prices, the cost of oil, tires, maintenance,
license and registration fees, and vehicle depreciation in 105
cities.
</P>
<P>
   For its vehicle, analysts selected a fully loaded 2000 Ford
Taurus SE with a 3.0 liter, six-cylinder engine and automatic
transmission driven within 50 miles of any city. Costs are based on
four-year trade-in with 60,000 miles on the odometer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics attacked the report as failing to factor in bad weather
-- which adds rust, dings and the price of snow tires to many cars.
If the study considered those things, the cost of driving in South
Dakota and other snow-belt cities would be closer to what it costs
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these surveys normally don't take in consideration are
regional differences,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the
Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``So these things make good headlines, but I think everybody
shrugs and says, So what?''
</P>
<P>
   Drive a Taurus in L.A. and pay 4.18 cents a mile, or go to Sioux
Falls and shell out 3.44 cents, Packer said. ``The least expensive
places are locations in the Midwest of the United States, the most
expensive tend to be on the East and West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high cost of driving, many Angelenos wouldn't trade
their hometown for anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothin' to do there (Sioux Falls),'' said Canoga Park
resident Nefi Vargas, 23, his Ford Focus fresh with a new dealer
plate. ``Just to be here, I wouldn't mind paying $3,000 more.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Salvadore Villegas, 48, of Woodland Hills, who wasn't
surprised by the report: ``In Los Angeles the weather is the best
in the country. I love California.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff From of Sioux Falls had other things to say about his
city, with its population of about 128,000 residents -- about a
third of South Dakota's population -- living in the middle of the
prairie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's 80 degrees. The sun shines. A little breeze. It's
beautiful. The leaves are just starting to turn their autumn
colors, it's great.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got our winters ... you get into some cold days, at
50, 60 degrees below (zero) with wind chill -- it's common,'' From
said.

TEXAS RESERVE TACKLES MAY HAVE BIG HOLE TO FILL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If any player on the Texas roster would be
apprehensive about playing a game without defensive tackle Shaun
Rogers in the lineup, logic dictates it would be linemate Casey
Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   As the other All-America candidate in a tackle tandem described
by coach Mack Brown as ``the best I've ever coached or played
against,'' Hampton figures to receive extra attention from Oklahoma
State blockers if Rogers is sidelined, as expected, for the game
Saturday because of a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has not practiced this week, creating a major personnel
shuffle along the defensive line as No. 13 Texas (2-1) prepares for
the 11 a.m. Big 12 conference opener at Royal-Memorial Stadium
against Oklahoma State (2-1). Rogers' absence would force the
Longhorns to try to contain Cowboys tailback Reggie White, the
nation's No. 11 rusher (127.3 yards per game), without a player who
has collected a team-high 34 tackles for losses in his past 16
games, including seven this season.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, said Hampton, who expressed confidence that redshirt
freshman Marcus Tubbs and other reserves can fill Rogers' size-18
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be fine,'' Hampton said. ``The other guys didn't start
out as defensive tackles, but they're real strong. They're just as
strong as Shaun and me, but they are still learning how to use that
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs (6-foot-4, 280 pounds), who began his college career as a
tight end, played 46 snaps in the 48-0 rout of Houston last week
and recorded two sacks. Tubbs is expected to start Saturday but is
50 pounds lighter than Rogers (6-4, 330) and was barely tested in
the running game by the pass-happy Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries and off-season attrition at the tackle
positions, Hampton is the only tackle with extensive game
experience who has practiced this week. Tubbs and Miguel McKay, a
former linebacker, are the likely candidates to replace Rogers.
Cole Pittman, a starter at defensive end in the first three games,
has shifted to tackle this week to provide depth. Pittman's move
opens a starting spot at end for freshman Kalen Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were made, Brown said, to maximize Texas' chances of
putting the clamps on an OSU ground attack that ranks 21st
nationally, at 191 yards per game. After three consecutive games
against passing teams, Oklahoma State represents the first major
test for a Texas run defense allowing only 1.3 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't stop the run this week, we've got no chance to
win,'' said Brown, whose tackle ranks were thinned during preseason
camp by three noteworthy deletions.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Curry, a fifth-year senior, quit the team. Heralded
signees Marcel Moses and Sonny Davis enrolled in junior college
after failing to reach NCAA academic-eligibility requirements. In
addition, reserves Stevie Lee (foot) and Ryan Haywood (shoulder)
went on the injured list before Rogers joined them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Longhorns remain confident that the newcomers prepared
to join Hampton in makeshift tackle tandems will be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tubbs is probably as good as most starting defensive tackles
in the country,'' middle linebacker De'Andre Lewis said. ``But
people don't see that because Casey and Shaun are so spectacular,
they make everyone else around them seem average by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the off-season, we've talked about building quality
depth at every position on defense. Marcus stepped in and showed
some of that against Houston. We're confident in what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he was ``amazed'' by Tubbs' two-sack effort against
Houston in his first extended stretch of playing time at the
college level. But he cautioned that the challenge will be greater
this week against a more balanced offense.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs, cousin of San Francisco 49ers linebacker Winfred Tubbs,
said Hampton has ``helped me out a lot'' in recent workouts and
expressed optimism that he can be a productive fill-in for Rogers.
But not a true replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch Shaun, just about every play is like watching a
highlight reel,'' Tubbs said. ``I'm not at that level, but I think
I can do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches and teammates are counting on it. nn

SHAQ GETS HALF HIS WISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ After leading the Los Angeles Lakers to
their first championship in more than a decade, Shaquille O'Neal
had just two requests of his employer this summer: a burly power
forward and a fat contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   He got the player _ old friend Horace Grant, acquired in a
recent trade. But O'Neal is still waiting for the four-year, $117
million extension that owner Jerry Buss all but promised him in
June.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, a lighthearted and delirious moment when Buss
made that commitment. On the night of the championship, covered in
confetti, O'Neal bellowed, ``Extension! Extension!'' To which Buss
replied happily, ``Whatever you want, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner had made earlier public statements to that effect, as
well, but O'Neal enters next week's training camp without an offer
in hand. And considering the Lakers' tightening purse strings,
there's no guarantee O'Neal will get the deal he wants.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he's not making it an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I disappointed? Why don't you talk to Leonard about that,''
O'Neal said, referring questions to agent Leonard Armato. ``I've
never really been one to talk about money in the paper. I have a
great job and I make good money.''
</P>
<P>
   But, O'Neal acknowledged, he expected to have the deal signed by
now.
</P>
<P>
   It could become a sore point down the road as the NBA's MVP
seeks what could be his last major contract. A four-year extension,
the maximum allowed, would take O'Neal through 2007 and his 35th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Armato said it's up to the Lakers to get it done, but he was
uncertain whether an offer was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, I don't want to speculate,'' he said. ``Maybe
you ought to talk to the Lakers organization. . . . I think the way
to approach this is to ask the Lakers if it's a priority for them.
Because that's really the determining factor here. It's incumbent
on them if they'd like to extend to take the initiative to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be a more complicated matter than it seems. Although
the Lakers want to reward O'Neal, who at age 28 just had the
greatest season of his eight-year career, they are working under
some onerous financial constraints, albeit self-imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Buss has ordered management not to exceed the
threshold for the NBA's impending luxury tax. After this season,
teams with payrolls above the threshold _ expected to be $55
million to $57 million _ will have to pay a dollar-for-dollar tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' payroll is already in that range, and most players
are due raises for 2001-02. For perspective, consider that this
season the combined salaries of O'Neal and Kobe Bryant alone will
be almost $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   If O'Neal is granted the maximum allowable extension _ $24.75
million in 2003-04, with 12.5 percent increases thereafter _ he
would make a staggering $34 million in 2006-07, the final year of
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, O'Neal is widely considered the best player in the
game now, and the last person to hold that mantle _ Chicago's
Michael Jordan _ made $33 million in his final season, 1997-98.
Since that time, however, the NBA has adopted a new labor deal that
includes a maximum starting salary of $14 million, as well as the
payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers paid O'Neal what he's worth _ a concept no one
argues _ they might be hamstrung when it comes time to sign other
players in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers officials won't discuss finances publicly, but general
manager Mitch Kupchak insisted the club wants to keep O'Neal happy
and under contract until he retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't say 'Los Angeles Lakers' unless you say
Shaquille O'Neal,'' Kupchak said. The contract extension ``is first
and foremost on our agenda. I think he wants to be here forever and
we want him here forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Lakers could have offered the extension anytime
since Aug. 1, Kupchak said the club was consumed with other
personnel matters, specifically attempts to find a power forward
and to trade Glen Rice. They eventually dealt Rice for Grant and
also signed free agent Isaiah Rider.
</P>
<P>
   Buss has also been out of town for most of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaquille and his representative recognized what needed to be
done during the summer. Thankfully, they chose to be a little
patient and let us take care of the immediate, which was to try to
improve our (roster),'' Kupchak said. ``I think there's enough
incentive for the Lakers and Shaquille to address the extension
issue and have some type of resolution in a timely fashion, and
hopefully one that's beneficial to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains unclear is whether the Lakers are able or willing
to offer O'Neal the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   But in an era when Portland owner Paul Allen and Dallas owner
Mark Cuban throw around millions without even blinking _ and scoff
at the salary cap and luxury tax _ O'Neal's supporters believe the
Lakers cannot afford to be tight with the checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does (the luxury tax) stop Paul Allen from stockpiling
players?'' Armato said. ``Where there's a will, there's a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sources point to the Lakers' estimated value ($282
million) and the team's net profits (about $50 million) and note
that success is closely tied to O'Neal's popularity and production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has to develop his own or her own strategy with
respect to spending,'' Armato said. ``Paul Allen has demonstrated
his strategy and there are other strategies that are certainly
possible. So the Lakers have to decide for themselves what it is
that's important to them and implement a strategy.''

NUMEROUS FIRINGS OF MANAGERS EXPECTED IN OFF-SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most amazing statistic this season isn't the number of
homers hit by Sammy Sosa, the number of runs driven in by Frank
Thomas, the number of hits by Darin Erstad, the number of
strikeouts by Randy Johnson or the number of runs given up by Pedro
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing statistic this season is this: 0.
</P>
<P>
   That's the number of mangers fired. Zero. Nil.
</P>
<P>
   There were times when the Reds' Jack McKeon, the Astros' Larry
Dierker and the Phillies' Terry Francona appeared in imminent
danger of losing their jobs, but they survived.
</P>
<P>
   How amazing is it? Assuming no owner or general manager drops an
unexpected ax in the next three days, it will be the first time
since 1942 that no one has been canned during the season.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a realization that not even the best manager can win
with a team full of mediocre players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't build the Empire State Building out of Legos,'' is
the way Phillies closer Jeff Brantley put it in defense of
Francona.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but don't expect the trend to continue. Consider it a
fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Pink slips are expected to be handed out early and often in the
off-season. Add a couple of managers who might depart for better
jobs, and a dozen or more jobs could come vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Managers in real danger of being canned are Francona, McKeon,
Dierker, the Pirates' Gene Lamont, the Diamondbacks' Buck
Showalter, the Dodgers' Davey Johnson and the Devil Rays' Larry
Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox's Jimy Williams and the Blue Jays' Jim Fregosi are
on the bubble, as is Tom Kelly, the Twins' manager since 1986.
Mariners manager Lou Piniella and Giants manager Dusty Baker are in
the last year of their contracts, and also could be moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Lamont will begin the merry-go-round, perhaps as soon as Monday.
Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy recently told Lamont that the club
will not be renewing his contract, a conversation that was leaked
to the media to the disgust of the Pirates' players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's totally unprofessional,'' outfielder Brian Giles said.
``To have two weeks left in the season and let it leak out that the
guy is not going to have his contract renewed is unprofessional and
it's embarrassing to the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles is having a fine season, but the players have only
themselves to blame for Lamont's dismissal. McClatchy envisioned a
90-victory season, but the Pirates are going to fall about 20
short.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to meet expectations also is likely to be the demise of
Francona, Dierker, Johnson, Showalter and Rothschild. There are
valid reasons why their teams didn't play well in almost every
case.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies expected to be contenders after signing Andy Ashby
and Mike Jackson, but Ashby didn't pitch well and Jackson didn't
pitch at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros fell from the top of the National League Central
because they traded away pitcher Mike Hampton and outfielder Carl
Everett, because second baseman Craig Biggio was injured and
because their pitchers didn't adjust to pitching in Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays thought their offense would make them a force in
the AL East after trading for Vinny Castilla and signing Greg
Vaughn, but they overlooked the fact that their pitching staff
wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks saw themselves as a World Series team,
especially after acquiring Curt Schilling in July, but floundered
down the stretch. Injuries and players who couldn't repeat career
years were the primary culprit, but never mind. The blame goes to
the manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know in my mind what the problems were this year, but what
good does it do to talk about it?'' Showalter said. ``That sounds
like an excuse, and there are no excuses in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   If Williams leaves Boston, it won't be because of Boston's
record. It will be because of his deteriorating relationship with
GM Dan Duquette. Williams said last weekend that Duquette should
fire him because he refused to back him when it came time to
discipline outfielder Carl Everett. The Red Sox might have been
tempted to do just that when it appeared that Alou was going to be
available, but Duquette and CEO John Harrington met with Williams
on Monday in an attempt to mend fences.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been reports that Mariners GM Pat Gillick and
Williams have an informal agreement in which Williams would manage
in Seattle next season. That job is expected to be open because
Piniella is expected to go home to Tampa to manage the Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins' job also could be open for the first time in 15
years, as new management is tempted to clean house. GM Terry Ryan
is in trouble, but Kelly is such an icon in the Twin Cities that
he's probably safe.
</P>
<P>
   Managers being hired and fired in the off-season is nothing new,
of course. It happened eight times last year. The fact that no one
got fired this summer only means the total will rise this
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're having a bad year, you think it's the manager's
fault,'' Dierker said. ``A new manager gives you a fresh start
mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just amazing that no impatient owner opted for that fresh
start during the season.

LOU'S VOODOO: HOLTZ FIGHTS SOUTH CAROLINA `CHICKEN CURSE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This might be the perfect marriage of football coach and school.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Lou Holtz, an unmatched poor-mouthing sandbagger, who,
when he coached Notre Dame, always managed to portray Navy as a
national-championship contender the week the Midshipmen played the
Fighting Irish.
</P>
<P>
   And here's South Carolina, a school whose mascot should be a
black cat, a school whose fans believe their only luck will be bad
luck. South Carolina, home of the Chicken Curse. When Holtz,
college football's Mr. Rescue, went 0-11 last year, Gamecocks fans
shrugged and said, ``Heck, even Holtz can't win here.''
</P>
<P>
   The honeymoon apparently was simply delayed a year.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina, which entered the 2000 season with the nation's
longest losing streak (21 games) is 4-0 and ranked No. 23. The
Gamecocks will try to beat Alabama for the first time when they
play the Crimson Tide on Saturday in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're 23, there's a lot of bad football teams, because I
don't think we're the 23rd-best football team in the country,''
said Holtz, whose team rallied to defeat Mississippi State, 23-19,
Saturday. ``I was disappointed in our play. We made some foolish
mistakes, we've got our longest injury list and our longest list
for bonehead play of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are looking up at South Carolina. The Gamecocks are
undefeated and Holtz is pessimistic. \Nsubheds:KINDER, GENTLER
LOSER Last season, Holtz's woe-is-us comments were on target. The
0-11 record is the worst in his career, which is in its 29th
season. The Gamecocks, who because of injuries and inefficiency
used six quarterbacks, were outscored 278-87.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if there was one thing that came out of last year it
is how distasteful losing is to me,'' Holtz said. ``We went through
a difficult time. Adversity either pulls you together or pushes you
apart, and I think it's pulled us together.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, Holtz endured the death of his mother. His wife
Beth's throat cancer flared again. His son Skip, the team's
offensive coordinator, was hospitalized for a week with a severe
gastric infection. A plane on which Holtz was to make a recruiting
trip crashed, killing the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Holtz wondered about his decision to get back into
coaching. He ended a 11-year career at Notre Dame on tarnished
terms in 1996. His sometimes-grating methods, his high standards,
his intense practices wore thin with players and those surrounding
the program. He made up his mind to change his methods when he got
back on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the mistake of listening to how tough and difficult I
was,'' said Holtz, who spent the 1997 and 1998 seasons as a
college-football analyst for CBS. ``I decided last year to be a
kinder, gentler guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Zero victories and 11 defeats made Holtz realize kinder and
gentler wasn't going to work. When the season ended, he prepared
the Gamecocks for a boot camp of an off-season. Every morning, the
players showed up for 6 a.m. ``volunteer'' workout sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz pulled out the motivational stops. Players moved into
on-campus dorms. During two-a-days, players turned in their car
keys so they had to ride buses together. Freshmen were given media
guides and instructed to get the signatures of every teammate,
high-school-yearbook style.
</P>
<P>
   Before fall workouts, each South Carolina player stood in front
of his teammates and talked about himself. Call it emotional male
bonding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way for us to get to know our teammates,'' said Andre
Offing, a senior linebacker from Houston. ``My best friend told us
that his sister had been raped. I didn't know that. I told
everybody about growing up with a single parent, trying to stay out
of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a lot to do with how coach Holtz has brought us
together and the love we have now for one another.''
\Nsubheds:TURNING IT AROUND South Carolina defensive-ends coach and
recruiting coordinator Dave Roberts, a former Baylor coach,
believes it has taken a year for Holtz's style to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to lay a foundation,'' Roberts said. ``It took awhile
to teach them how to play, to practice, to get their intensity up.
It was a full-court press, on and off the field. More and more of
the players started to buy into being tough and physical. You could
see the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past three decades, Holtz had been wedded to a
veer/option attack. Last December, though, Holtz decided to
modernize. He instructed son Skip to devise a four-wide-receiver
attack. The new scheme has spread the field, enabling the Gamecocks
to move the ball much more easily.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is 39th in total offense, which is good enough to
support a defense that ranks sixth nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a hungry bunch,'' Florida coach Steve Spurrier said.
``I watched the tape of them playing Mississippi State. If we could
get our players to play that hard, we'd have a chance to be pretty
good this year. We're trying to get our guys to play as hard as
South Carolina's players play.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Saturday's game at Alabama, it is the Gamecocks who
are 4-0, while the Crimson Tide is 1-3. In his five previous
coaching stops, Holtz has had his team in a bowl in Year Two. South
Carolina needs two victories in its last seven games to qualify for
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always say, `How did you change this team around?' ''
the 63-year-old Holtz said. ``If you change people, you usually
change the product on the field. I've tried to get players to raise
their standards, raise their expectations, show them how to be
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every situation is different, but I think what's been the
constant is my stubbornness, my absolute refusal to accept failure.
I refuse to compromise. Sometimes that's an asset, and sometimes
that's a liability.'' \Nsubheds:BUT, THE CURSE... The Chicken Curse
was coined by sports writer Doug Nye of ``The State'' in Columbia,
S.C., in the early 1970s. It's a catch-all excuse for anything bad
that happens to South Carolina teams. It's a rural legend whose
power has extended to the Olympics (Kevin Joyce, a South Carolina
basketball player, was on the 1972 U.S. Olympic team that lost to
the Russians) to the NCAA basketball tournament (the Gamecocks
flamed out in the first round in 1997 and 1998) to baseball (South
Carolina was ranked No. 1 last season but was upset one step short
of the College World Series).
</P>
<P>
   But South Carolinians place their passions and their support
with football. Even though the Gamecocks were winless and woeful
last season, the school averaged 78,273 fans for six home games in
80,250-seat Williams-Brice Stadium, ranking 13th nationally. Only
Notre Dame and Louisiana State had losing records and averaged more
fans.
</P>
<P>
   In 106 seasons of football, South Carolina has won 10 games
exactly once (1984). George Rogers won the Heisman Trophy in 1980
for an 8-4 team. The school's only bowl victory in nine tries came
in the 1995 Carquest Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But the end of the 21-game losing streak, the victories against
ranked Southeastern Conference rivals Georgia and Mississippi
State, the 4-0 start have turned the fans giddy. Some travel
agencies are already offering bowl-trip packages.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicken Curse, though, looms.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've gotten excited before, and then we've come crashing
down,'' Jason Humphries, a native of Greenville, S.C. and a
lifelong Gamecocks fan, told ``The Associated Press.'' ``We just
don't want to crash again. Just when we get good, we get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Several key starters, including quarterback Phil Petty, could
wind up missing the Alabama game. Still, when Petty was hurt late
in the game with Mississippi State, walk-on quarterback Erik Kimrey
entered the game and, without even warming up, threw the
game-winning touchdown pass on a fourth-and-10 play.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things that used to go against us seem to be working
for us,'' South Carolina junior center Philip Jones said. ``Maybe
the year 2000 brought an end to the Chicken Curse.''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State cornerback Fred Smoot seemed to agree. He used
some words that South Carolina fans rarely hear associated with
their team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the magic,` he said, ``and the team with the magic
always prevails.''

GOODWIN SPARKLES WITH ARM AND GLOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Outfielder Tom Goodwin is not known for his arm,
but in recent games he's combined it with his speed to become as
valuable to the Los Angeles Dodgers in center field as he is at the
top of the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in three games this week, Goodwin sparked a
key double play.
</P>
<P>
   He preserved Sunday's 1-0 victory over the Padres with a sliding
catch of a shallow fly by Ed Sprague and caught Ryan Klesko off
first for the final out of a game in which Goodwin also ran down a
ball at the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a good job out there,'' Johnson said Sunday about
the 32-year-old, who was acquired in the July 31 trade involving
Todd Hollandsworth. However, Johnson added,``With his arm, I don't
know how he got it back in there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goodwin did it again Wednesday in the fourth inning, when he
ran down a fly ball by J.T. Snow and started a relay to first base
to double up Bill Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just doing my job,'' Goodwin said. ``Sometimes I make them
look harder than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin was the beneficiary Thursday when Giants center fielder
Marvin Benard was unable to duplicate the solid outfield play.
Goodwin beat the throw to second after leading off the first with a
fly to left center that Benard could not handle.
</P>
<P>
   __ Another one goes down: At this point, it's almost easier for
Johnson to list the Dodgers who are healthy as opposed to those who
are injured.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Adrian Beltre became the latest member of the
disabled when he fouled a ball off his right foot earlier in the
week. He was removed from Wednesday's game because of the problem,
and Paul LoDuca started in Beltre's place Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the injured Dodgers, catcher Angel Pena, had surgery
Thursday morning to repair a ligament in his right thumb. Team
officials said the surgery was successful and Pena should be ready
by spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Jeff Williams and Ismael Valdes are scheduled to have
more tests on their hands to determine whether further treatment is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   __ Record watch: With a playoff berth officially out of the
picture, the Dodgers season is reduced to tracking personal and
team milestones. Shawn Green reached one Wednesday when he hit his
43rd double of the season to tie him with Steve Sax for the
second-highest season total by a Los Angeles Dodger. Wes Parker
holds the record with 47 doubles in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Green entered Thursday's game two RBI shy of 100, a mark that
would put him with Eric Karros and Gary Sheffield to form the first
L.A. Dodger trio with at least 100 RBI each.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield is a home run away from tying Duke Snider's
franchise-record 43 home runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, the Dodgers tied the major-league record
for pinch-hit home runs in a season (12) as well as tying the
franchise record for home runs in a season (208).

COWBOYS WON'T SPECIFY `DISCIPLINE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys handed out league-approved
``discipline'' Thursday to free safety George Teague and two other
players involved in Sunday's controversial demonstrations,
retaliations and ejections at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be confirmed if Teague, strong safety Darren Woodson
or running Emmitt Smith was fined by the Cowboys, although Teague
said earlier in the day that he ``had been told'' to expect a fine
from either the league or the team. Excessive or embarrassing cases
of unsportsmanlike conduct have been known to carry a $5,000 fine
from the league office.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones declined to specify what he meant by
``discipline'' for his three players and emphasized Thursday that
the matter was ``being handled internally.'' He wouldn't even say
if the disciplinary actions varied from player to player.
</P>
<P>
   It was much clearer in San Francisco where wide receiver Terrell
Owens for one week without pay _ $24,294. Owens started the
controversy by running to the middle of the field and striking a
celebratory pose on the Cowboys' blue star after scoring his first
of two touchdowns. Owens later did it again.
</P>
<P>
   Teague used a flying shoulder to knock Owens off the blue star
the second time.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Campo called all the incidents ``a serious matter''
and didn't appreciate Teague and Woodson, who were ejected late in
the game, leaving the stadium before the rest of the team came off
the field and missing out on Campo's post-game talk.
</P>
<P>
   Smith wasn't given a penalty for running helmet-less to the
middle of the field, kneeling and slamming the ball atop the blue
star while staring at the 49ers bench. This came shortly after
Owens' first demonstration. Owens was penalized for taunting only
after the second incident in which Teague tagged him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboys have handled it,'' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said.
``They've disciplined Smith, Woodson and Teague, and have discussed
it with Gene Washington \Rwho levies league fines\S. It is in line
with what normally would have been done by the league office. There
will be no further discipline by the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Teague met and talked briefly on the sideline at
practice Thursday. Teague listened, then ran off and made an
interception a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   If Teague was fined, he might not have to pay it because of
appreciative Cowboys fans who see Teague as a hero and Owens as a
no-class jerk who was trying to rub the Cowboys' collective noses
into a 41-24 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did get a phone call from some guy whom I met once, and he
told me, `If you get fined, my company will take care of it,' ''
Teague said Thursday before a decision came down. ``I figured they
all were drunk, watching TV. But the guy called me back probably
three more times this week.''
</P>
<P>
   After practice, Teague politely declined comment on the
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a ``weird'' week for him, beginning when he joined
up with some friends at Joe's Crab Shack immediately following the
game. He was both flattered and surprised by all the attention,
saying, ``I think it's kind of weird to get that kind of
recognition just for standing up for something.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa Bay, Bucs veteran guard Frank Middleton told reporters
that he would help Teague pay any fine and that ``if somebody
\Racted as Owens did\S at Raymond James, y'all would have a story
to write about for a whole month because I won't let it happen.
That's disrespectful.''
</P>
<P>
   Several callers to North Texas radio shows this week have asked
how to send in money to help pay Teague's fine.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's being called ``discipline,'' without any
indication how much that is in dollars. \Nsubheds:Briefly Defensive
tackle Leon Lett (strained right hamstring) missed practice for the
second day in a row but is expected to start Sunday at Carolina.
Wide receiver Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail (sprained left ankle) also
missed practice for a second consecutive day, but coach Dave Campo
said he is ``comfortable'' Ismail can give playing a shot. Middle
linebacker Dat Nguyen (sprained ligament in his left knee) and
cornerback Charlie Williams (staph infection as a complication of
surgery on his left knee) are listed as day-to-day after practicing
Thursday. Campo said, ``If Dat is 100 percent, he's our middle
linebacker.'' Nguyen's fill-in, Barron Wortham, has had 17 tackles
in two games.  &LR; tagtop:This report contains material from ``The
Tampa Tribune.''

SUPER DERBY IMPACT ON BREEDERS' CUP UNLIKELY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a 3-year-old is shooting for a spot in the Breeders' Cup
Classic, the Super Derby at Louisiana Downs is always a good place
to prep. Sunday Silence, Unbridled and Concern are a few of the
horses that raced in the Super Derby and won the Breeders' Cup
Classic later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   And the Super Derby should get a lot of attention this year
(Saturday, 3-3:30 p.m. on ESPN), because the 3-year-old colts are
doing the best running on the track this fall. This trend started
when Captain Steve won the Kentucky Cup Classic over Golden Missile
two weeks ago at Turfway Park.
</P>
<P>
   But it really took hold last week at Belmont Park. First there
was Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus, who absolutely toyed
with a decent field to win the Jerome Handicap. It was his first
start in 125 days, but he still rattled off the fourth-fastest time
in the 131-year history of the race.
</P>
<P>
   In the race following the Jerome, the Vosburgh Stakes for
sprinters was dominated by 3-year-olds. Trippi and More Than Ready,
both also-rans in the Kentucky Derby this year, finished 1-2 while
beating older horses without much challenge in the Vosburgh. Though
they're not Classic horses _ they'll likely race in the Sprint on
Breeders' Cup day Nov. 4 _ their command of the Vosburgh shows the
sort of talent the 3-year-old class has this year.
</P>
<P>
   So there's bound to be a serious Breeders' Cup player among
Tiznow, Commendable and Mass Market _ the headlining horses in this
year's Super Derby. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold your breath.
</P>
<P>
   Tiznow, who'll be the Super Derby favorite, is the brother to
Budroyale. Last year, Budroyale finished second in the Breeders'
Cup Classic. And Tiznow became a graded stakes winner in his own
right when he won the Affirmed Handicap this summer at Hollywood
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Tiznow also ran second to Skimming in the Pacific Classic in his
last start. In the process, Tiznow rang up a three-digit Beyer
speed figure (a ``Beyer'' assigns a figure to a final time of a
race that attempts to compare races conducted at other tracks _ the
higher the figure the better).
</P>
<P>
   But Skimming might be a horse for the course. He ran two big
races at Del Mar, but he couldn't beat Sir Bear or Ecton Park at
Prairie Meadows and he finished up the track in the Woodward
Stakes. And the Woodward is the race that has put to question the
abilities of Lemon Drop Kid because of the slow winning time of
that race.
</P>
<P>
   Tiznow will be heard from, but he won't become a big star until
the Strub Series early next year at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Commendable and Mass Market appear to be second-tier
3-year-olds. Though they've won some races, the Belmont Stakes
included, it's always come against second-level competition by and
large.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Derby will be a nice race to watch, but it's unlikely
it will produce anything eye-catching come Breeders' Cup time.
LATE SCRATCHES...
\Nsubheds:Mattress Mac springs Houston businessman Jim ``Mattress
Mac'' McIngvale has pulled his sponsorship of the Texan Juvenile
Stakes _ and taken with it the expected purse of $550,000 _ because
of the controversy over his plan to restrict the race to horses
ridden by female jockeys. The race for 2-year-olds will still be a
part of Texas Champions Day on Dec. 2 at Sam Houston Race Park, but
the purse will be $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comment was made to me from people at the track that
anybody with a good horse would not run with female-only jockeys,''
McIngvale said. ``My answer to that was, `Why in the hell do they
put female riders on them in the mornings for workouts?' ''
</P>
<P>
   McIngvale, who owns a furniture store in Houston, said he wanted
to use female-only jockeys because his customer base has a high
percentage of women.
\Nsubheds:For openers Though Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie was
down in every business category compared with last year on opening
night of the quarter horse season, the three-date opening weekend
showed increases in almost every category. Average attendance of
5,609 per night was up 6 percent. On-track wagering on the live
races of $270,406 per night was down about 1 percent. And off-track
wagering was up 39 percent at $671,628 per night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening weekend was good,'' Lone Star general manager Steve
Sexton said. ``In the comparison between Saturday night this year
and last year we were up $41,000 in on-track live \Rwagering\S.
That was the only way to compare apples to apples, so that's a good
sign.''
\Nsubheds:Valhol's jockey Jim Jackson, a resident of Rockdale who
is the owner of Valhol, said he has had trouble attracting a
``name'' jockey to ride his horse since the disqualification in
last year's Arkansas Derby. Valhol, who's scheduled to race in the
$400,000 Meadowlands Cup with Ricky Frazier riding on Oct. 7 in
East Rutherford, N.J., was disqualified when jockey Billy Patin was
accused of carrying an electronic shocking device.
</P>
<P>
   Though Edgar Prado rode Valhol in the Preakness last year, that
was before Prado moved his tack to New York. And Jackson said he
thinks some other jockeys have avoided Valhol because Jackson
``dumped on'' Patin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy created a hell of his own making,'' Jackson said. ``I
had to defend myself like he had to defend himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gutierrez A year ago, Cat Thief was winner of the Breeders'
Cup Classic, but even jockey Pat Day questions what can be done for
the slumping horse.
\Nsubheds:SPOTLIGHT ON ...
Cat Thief: From Classic win to classic also-ran Fusaichi Pegasus.
Lemon Drop Kid. Giant's Causeway. Captain Steve. Golden Missile.
Behrens.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time to discuss the possible favorites for the
Breeders' Cup Classic, which is 36 days away, the names keep
popping up. But the name of the defending champion isn't one of
them, and it has nothing to do with the often-used excuse _ that he
has been retired to the stud farm.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief has competed in nine races this year, but it looks as
though he's nowhere close to being in the form needed to repeat as
Breeders' Cup Classic champion on Nov. 4. In fact, he hasn't won a
single race this year, a feat that has put him in the record books.
</P>
<P>
   Since the inception of the Breeders' Cup in 1984, only one other
horse has gone 0-for-9 in the year after his Breeders' Cup victory.
That was Success Express, who won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in
1987 and went 0-for-9 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``His last race just was not good,'' jockey Pat Day said. ``I
don't know what they'll do with him now.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if Cat Thief shows up for the Breeders' Cup
anyway. He won the Classic last year at double-digit odds and has
been successful at the site of this year's Breeders' Cup _
Churchill Downs. He finished third in the 1999 Kentucky Derby and
was second in the Stephen Foster Handicap to Golden Missile this
year at Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse that scares me is Cat Thief,'' Golden Missile
trainer Joe Orseno said. ``He's due.''
</P>
<P>
   He's overdue.
\Nsubheds:INSIDE THE NUMBERS... Record for Cat Thief Since the
inception of the Breeders' Cup in 1984, 21 horses have gone winless
the year after winning a race on Cup championship day. Cat Thief,
Breeders' Cup Classic winner last year, is one of those horses. But
he needs one more loss to break the record in this category. Horse

HARVEY SIGNS, EAGER TO PLAY WITH MAVS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ After signing a three-year, $2.3 million contract
Thursday, rookie Donnell Harvey can focus on earning some playing
time at the Mavericks' crowded power forward position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of pressure off of me now because people can stop
asking me about when I'm going to sign,'' Harvey said. ``So I'm
ready to go now.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey said he held up signing his contract because he wanted to
set up a trust fund after Mavericks owner Mark Cuban arranged for
him to receive $646,920 of his first-year salary up front. That
trust fund has been established, Harvey said, allowing him to
receive a certain amount of living expenses each month.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey is scheduled to collect $718,800 this season, $772,800
next year and $826,700 for the 2002-03 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have signed all 16 players on their roster heading
into the start of training camp Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to sign my contract; it's just that I
hadn't taken the physical,'' Harvey said. ``I'm just waiting for
the season to start now that I've gotten that out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was unsigned, Harvey played on the Mavericks' summer
league teams. Last month, he also spent three weeks in Los Angeles
working with Mavericks developmental coach Kiki Vandeweghe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of procedure now,'' Cuban said. ``Now, he's
just waiting on his money.''  &LR; subheds:Alexander, Finley impress
Courtney Alexander and Michael Finley gave Mavericks fans a reason
to be excited about the prospect of the high-scoring rookie and
high-scoring All-Star playing together.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander and Finley, both guards, worked so well together
Thursday at the Landry Center that it seemed as if they had been
teammates for years. In one sequence, Finley and Alexander were on
a two-on-one break, and Finley lobbed a perfect pass to Alexander,
who caught it on the fly and jammed it home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wondering how we would mesh,'' Alexander said. ``But
he's very unselfish, and he's definitely someone who I think I can
play very well with.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, noting that the Mavericks are deeper at every position,
said he is anxious to play alongside Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main thing is just to get the most out of my teammates, to
know their strengths and their weaknesses, and get them in a
comfortable position where they can be most effective,'' Finley
said.  &LR; subheds:Tickets to go on sale Single-game tickets for the
Mavericks' 41 regular-season home games go on sale at 12:01 a.m.
Sunday on the Internet at www.nba.com/mavericks/arena.html, or by
calling Ticketmaster at (214) 373-8000.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets also can be purchased at the Reunion Arena box office or
Ticketmaster locations, including Foley's Department Stores and
Fiesta and Kroger grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks hope to boost single-game sales with an event from
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday that includes three radio stations
broadcasting from Reunion and appearances by Mavericks owner Mark
Cuban, forward Gary Trent, Mavs Man, the Mavericks Street Team and
the Mavericks Dancers.

 &HT;    BRUCKHEIMER: FILM IS ABOUT MEN, FOR MEN {ndash} AND WOMEN(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's really no argument. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer likes to
blow things up.
</P>
<P>
   At least in his movies.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Bruckheimer built his reputation on films like
(beginitalic)The Rock, Con Air (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Armageddon(enditalic), where spectacular action
sequences and special effects always take center stage.
</P>
<P>
   So it would seem that (beginitalic)Remember the
Titans(enditalic), a film about a high school football coach who
battles racism in the South, is a big departure.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says the man who virtually invented the rock-and-roll
action movie with (beginitalic)Top Gun(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's always really about the same thing,''
Bruckheimer says. ``It's about the camaraderie among men. It's
about doing the right thing. {ellipsis} It's always the brotherhood
of man, and the ability to look out for one another.''
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Remember the Titans (enditalic)is set in 1971 and
focuses on Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a stubborn, defiant
man who's hired to coach the first integrated team in the history
of Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who also worked with Bruckheimer on the nuclear
submarine drama (beginitalic)Crimson Tide(enditalic), was the only
actor that he considered to play the strong-willed Coach Boone.
</P>
<P>
   ``And had he said no, I don't know where I would have gone,''
Bruckheimer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to get this movie made - by the way, nobody wanted to
make it - both Denzel and I had to give up large portions of our
fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Although (beginitalic)Remember the Titans (enditalic)is clearly
another guy film, Bruckheimer says women will enjoy it as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a 10-city tour, and more women came up to me and said,
`Jerry I hate football. I would never go to a football movie. I
can't stand it when my husband watches. I love this movie. I'm
going to tell all my friends to go see it,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because again, it's about emotion; it's about these guys,
about Will (Patton, who plays Washington's reluctant assistant
coach) and Denzel getting these kids to get along with one other
and become winners, against a very turbulent backdrop.''
</P>
<P>
   Tackling the sensitive issue of race relations was made easier
because the film is based on a true story, Bruckheimer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate because this is history, this happened, we
documented it,'' he says. ``It's not 100 percent correct. We had to
combine characters and change some things around to make it more
dramatic. But it's much easier when you're dealing with a real
subject, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing easy, however, about the training that the
actors received.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our actors went through a two-week training camp,''
Bruckheimer says. ``They hated it. They got up early in the
morning; they did calisthenics. They threw up. They were sore; they
were beat up. But you know what? It shows in the movie. They look
real. Some of the kids had never touched a football before.''
</P>
<P>
   Although (beginitalic)Remember the Titans (enditalic)promises to
be a hit at the box office, there's much more anticipation
surrounding Bruckheimer's next film, (beginitalic)Pearl
Harbor(enditalic), which is scheduled to open May 28.

Drivers must remain in top shape to meet demands of auto racing
<TEXT>
<P>
   By TERRY BLOUNT
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ So you happen to be one of those people who thinks
race car drivers are not athletes. Here's a little test for you to
simulate what a driver will experience Sunday during the
Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   First, go outside in your back yard. Take a treadmill. Put on
long flannel underwear, warm-up pants and a jacket _ the equivalent
of the Nomex firesuit the drivers wear.
</P>
<P>
   Find a motorcycle helmet or old football helmet in the garage
and put it on. Put golf gloves on each hand. Have buddies stand on
each side of you.
</P>
<P>
   Now get on the treadmill at a pace of 6 mph and maintain that
pace for two hours while your buddies give you forearm pops on your
arms and legs every few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   When it's over, assuming you are still alive, you probably won't
ever say again that race car drivers are not athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be fit,'' said Dario Franchitti, the 1998 winner
in Houston. ``I used to think driving was all about upper-body
strength, but it's not. You use your entire body. Endurance also is
very important, because you have to be able to go flat-out for two
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The example used above is not an arbitrary assumption. It comes
from the results of a study published this year in the Journal of
Strength and Conditioning Research.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patrick Jacobs, a professor for exercise physiology at the
University of Miami, and Dr. Steve Olvey, CART's chief medical
officer, conducted the study to determine what a driver goes
through physiologically during a race.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed a person expends a lot of energy by driving
competitive laps on a track. Most of the exertion comes from
lateral forces while cornering and G-forces on the body under
acceleration and braking. A G-force is a unit measuring the
inertial stress of a body during acceleration in multiples of the
acceleration of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a driver will pull four to five G's on some turns
of a street course, like the 1.5-mile layout in downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean? Pulling four G's in a corner means that in
order to keep your head upright, your neck muscles have to work
four times harder than you would if you were lying on your side in
the bed and holding your head off the pillow.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the fact that drivers are doing that every lap for
a two-hour race while wearing a helmet, and you get the idea.
Fatigue can set in during a race, and fatigue can be costly _ even
disastrous _ to a driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a driver is fatigued, it can affect his responsiveness and
his ability to communicate properly with his team,'' Jacobs said.
``That's why it's so important for these drivers to be physically
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men who will compete this weekend have a fitness
level that would compare to a distance runner or an Olympic
swimmer. An example is Max Papis, who drives the Miller Lite
Ford/Reynard for Team Rahal.
</P>
<P>
   Papis, 30, an Italian, has a body fat count of only 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I needed to start working on my body because it was my
tool,'' Papis said. ``A driver has his body and his mind as his
throttle, brake and gearbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The engineers and mechanics work very hard to give me a great
car, so I must be able to get 110 percent out of the car. To do
that, you have to be clear in your mind, and you can't do that
unless you are fit in your body.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitness is a top priority for Papis. He has a team of three
doctors in Italy _ Dr. Enrico Arcelli, Dr. Claudio Castiglione and
Dr. Giovanni Bassi _ that he corresponds with on a regular basis
about his fitness routine. The doctors also consult with former
Italian Olympic skier Alberto Tomba, along with other Italian
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctors have a tremendous amount of experience in training
the mind and the body,'' Papis said. ``They've taught me a lot,
including never being satisfied with my performance and how to turn
negative situations into positives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've also helped me to be a stronger person with a stronger
drive. They've taught me a lot about what athletes do to perform at
their best.''
</P>
<P>
   The workout routine Papis uses is designed to simulate his heart
rate during a race _ which can be as high as 170 beats per minute.
A typical workout includes one hour of running or cycling while
wearing a heart monitor to record data on a computer. That
information is e-mailed to Papis' team of doctors in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Papis also has a daily weight training routine that includes 12
machines. He moves from one machine to the next without resting in
order to keep his heart rate high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to my workout is to be stronger, mentally and
physically, so I'll be prepared to suffer in the race car,'' Papis
said. ``A driver can experience some big pain during a race. I have
to be able to overcome the pain and get the most out of my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers can get tossed around like a rag doll during a race.
They can suffer rib injuries, wrist and hand injuries and separated
shoulders just from being bumped against the car at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ovals track aren't that physical for you,'' Franchitti said.
``But a road or street course will knock the heck out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti was the test subject Jacobs and Olvey used in their
research, some of which was done at the road course in Sebring,
Fla. They found that Franchitti's metabolic expenditure on one lap
was equal to cycling at 16 mph or running a mile in nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti's resting heart rate is 55 beats per minute, which
would compare to the heart rate of a competitive marathon runner.
During the four-lap test at Sebring, his heart rate increased to
125 beats per minute, proving how fit he is considering the amount
of energy he was exerting.
</P>
<P>
   Like Papis, Franchitti works hard at maintaining his fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I will bike all day in the offseason, and I usually
run for an hour or so,'' Franchitti said. ``I've started doing
yoga, and it's amazing the strength you need to do it properly. But
there's nothing like driving the race car. You can work all winter
on your fitness, get in the car, and find muscles you haven't been
able to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Most drivers also are careful about what they eat. Papis is on a
specialized, high-complex carbohydrate, low-fat diet. Franchitti
said his diet includes lots of water, no junk food and little
alcohol during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every driver in the CART series does something to stay
fit. Michael Andretti has a full gymnasium in his home and is a
fanatical user of his Stairmaster. Christian Fittipaldi competed in
a triathlon last year.
</P>
<P>
   They might sit in a car for a living, but these men realize
staying in shape is mandatory if they hope to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think of myself as an athlete,'' Papis said. ``If
I weren't a race car driver, I still would be involved in sports.''

Super Mario not so according to A.J.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's terrific that big-time auto racing has become an
annual fixture on the Houston sports scene because Houston and auto
racing always will be synonymous. Why? Because of one man, a man
with a famous last name that he hardly needs to use.
</P>
<P>
   Say A.J. and pretty much everybody in our town, or the United
States, knows of whom you speak. It makes not a bit of difference
that A.J. Foyt has been retired from competition for seven years
and hasn't won the Indianapolis 500 in almost a quarter of a
century.
</P>
<P>
   The best race car driver who ever lived? No point in asking that
question in Houston. Only two initials need apply.
</P>
<P>
   But a strange thing happened here Wednesday night. In
conjunction with this weekend's Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix of
Houston CART race downtown, they held a fancy party for a bunch of
folks in tuxedos at the George R. Brown Convention Center for the
express purpose of, besides raising money for charity, honoring
Mario Andretti as racing's driver of the century.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered what A.J. thought about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Poppycock),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt, to be sure, never has conceded anything to anybody when it
comes to driving a car fast. But what really got his goat was that
Texaco, the sponsor of several CART races, chose the one in Houston
for putting the king-of-racing crown on Mario's head.
</P>
<P>
   His beef is justified, too. That's tantamount to going into
Boston and proclaiming Wilt Chamberlain the finest center in
basketball history. Or feting Joe Montana in Baltimore as the
quarterback to end all quarterbacks. Or putting up a plaque at
Yankee Stadium for Ty Cobb, ordaining him the greatest baseball
player ever.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt, 65, doesn't claim to be the No. 1 driver for the ages. He
reels off a list of forgotten names from the first half of the
century, legends long before his time, who ``might have all been
able to beat my butt.'' A.J.'s point is that it's pointless to
ordain anybody the greatest with racing conditions having changed
so dramatically over the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   But his point also is that, if we're going to compare resumes
here, there's no way in Hades that Mario's holds any kind of edge
over his. For the sake of argument, here are their respective
credentials. You be the judge:
</P>
<P>
   Foyt _ Won USAC-CART national championship seven times. Won four
Indy 500s. Holds all-time CART record for victories with 67. Only
driver to win the Indy 500, the Daytona 500 and the 24 Hours at
LeMans.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti _ Won USAC-CART national championship four times. Won
Indy 500 once. Ranks second all-time in CART victories with 52.
Only driver to win the Indy 500, the Daytona 500 and the Formula
One world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt does seem to have a distinct advantage, save for that last
item on Mario's side of the ledger, the Formula One title. But,
yikes, don't get A.J. started. He swears it's common knowledge that
Andretti's F1 little-known teammate in 1978 consistently outdrove
him, yet was kept from reaping the rewards of same by the team's
bosses because Andretti was the superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt, by his own admission, never wanted any part of F1. He
hates its street courses, and he hates how money rules who wins the
races. Besides
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people made A.J. Foyt,'' he said. ``I didn't need
to prove anything in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   You won't see Foyt hanging around the Texaco Grand Prix. He
wants no part of it, either. His loyalties are solely to the Indy
Racing League, CART's North American rival in open-wheel racing,
and the rift between the circuits figures hugely in the distance
between him and Andretti, a CART backer.
</P>
<P>
   The two speed demons used to be good friends, though. Foyt is
godfather to John Andretti, the son of Mario's brother, Aldo. That
Mario has become the spokesman for Texaco, a company A.J. has
resented for snubbing him early in his career, heightens the
tension.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt was at Indy last week for the Formula One race and, when he
heard Andretti was ``badmouthing'' the Brickyard _ a sacred site to
A.J. _ he went ballistic. No matter that he had just had a heart
angioplasty, or that he would wind up in an emergency room there
when his post-op medicine gave him a fierce bellyache.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over and told Mario what a (jerk) he is,'' Foyt said
proudly.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. grudgingly had accepted the Associated Press' voting him
and Andretti, recently turned 60, co-drivers of the century. But
being ignored at Wednesday's soiree _ save, ironically, for a brief
photo image of the two of them side by side and smiling after a
race _ brought out his feisty Super-Tex side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's settle this on the track,'' Foyt said. ``Just me and
Mario, at Indy or Texas World (Speedway). Any time. I'll still whip
his butt.''

AGAIN, BROWN GETS NO SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's only fitting the Los Angeles Dodgers waited
until after Kevin Brown was gone to start hitting
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers managed just one hit through the first five innings
Thursday. An inning after Brown was removed from the game, they
produced three consecutive hits and scored two runs to take the
lead for the only time in an eventual 5-3 loss to San Francisco in
front of 44,513 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of run support throughout the season left Brown with a
13-6 record, which belies his effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's had a better season this season than last,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``He's certainly been dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great year last year. Some of the production that was
there wasn't there this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown went 18-9 with a 3.00 ERA in 1999. He entered Thursday's
game ranked second in the National League with a 2.56 ERA, but had
five fewer victories than a year ago. The Dodgers have been shut
out three times and scored a total of 10 runs in Brown's six
losses.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Brown also hurt himself.
</P>
<P>
   He had two wild pitches, hit a batter and gave up two walks and
six hits in five innings in his final start of the season. It was
just the third time in 33 starts this year Brown lasted less than
six innings. He also had eight strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's hitting resumed in the seventh inning,
highlighted by a two-run home run by Barry Bonds. The shot to right
field off reliever Onan Masaoka was Bonds' 49th of the season.
Pinch hitter Felipe Crespo added a two-out solo home run off Mike
Fetters in the eighth inning to give the Giants 222 home runs this
season, a franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   Power hitting wasn't required to give San Francisco the initial
lead, though. A wild pitch scored the Giants' second run. Brown had
another wild pitch the next inning and loaded the bases by issuing
a walk. He got out of the jam when shortstop Alex Cora snagged a
line drive by Ellis Burks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' lone lead came when Paul LoDuca's sacrifice fly
scored Eric Karros to make it 3-2. Todd Hundley had tied the game a
batter earlier with an RBI-single that chased San Francisco starter
Shawn Estes.
</P>
<P>
   Estes did his best to help the Dodgers' offense in the fourth
inning, but all it could produce was one run. The rally started on
a two-base throwing error by Estes on a comebacker by Shawn Green.
A wild pitch advanced Green to third and the next two batters
walked to load the bases for Hundley, whose fielder's choice
grounder scored Green. LoDuca loaded the bases again, but Cora
struck out to end the threat.

Bessinger, who once waged a lawsuit to keep blacks segregated in
his restaurants, has been distributing religious tracts along with
his sandwiches, tracts that suggest that slavery was biblically

his tax-cut proposal; Al Gore spends the night at the homes of
local teachers before spending the next day in their schools. But
the vice president is about to take the approach to another, much

   RUSKIN-CENTENARY (New York) _ Much has been made of John Ruskin
(1819-1900) this year. It is the centenary of the death of this
artist, art and architectural critic extraordinaire, social
reformer, polymath lecturer, first official professor of art in
England (at Oxford University) and an admirer of little girls. The
Morgan Library has mounted its own show of Ruskiniana, a
biographical assemblage of 133 objects: letters, manuscripts,
photographs, drawings, paintings and artifacts. They were mined
entirely from the Morgan's own Ruskin collection, proclaimed by the
library to be one of the world's most comprehensive. By Grace

JONES SAYS COWBOYS CAN STILL BE A SUPER TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Despite Dallas' dismal start and woeful
performances in blowout home losses to Philadelphia and San
Francisco, owner Jerry Jones said reaching the playoffs and making
a Super Bowl run are still attainable goals for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Jones said if the Cowboys (1-3) don't recover and are
forced to rebuild in the off-season, he remains firmly behind
first-year head coach Dave Campo.
</P>
<P>
   Jones conceded that part of the motivation for hiring Campo to
replace Chan Gailey after last season was because of Campo's
stability as a member of the Cowboys' coaching staff since 1989 and
the opportunity for a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said tweaking, not massive changes, could put the Cowboys
on the path to another championship run. Hiring a coach from the
outside would require too much upheaval, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, however, said Campo is his man no matter what and won't
be blamed if the Cowboys continue to falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get to that point, and obviously I'm not conceding to
rebuilding, Dave is the right guy,'' Jones said. ``He is what Jimmy
\R Johnson\S was with me at the beginning. It's my sense, if we had
to go through tough times, the kind of individual you want in that
situation is a Dave Campo.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, however, reiterated that he's not interested in talking
about the future because he still has high hopes for the 2000
season, starting Sunday against the Carolina Panthers (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   Even with the season-ending knee injury to receiver Joey
Galloway, Jones' optimism is primarily based on the same things he
felt good about coming into the season, the Cowboys' core of
talent, especially with a healthy Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are counting on guys that are premium players who have been
Pro Bowl players,'' Jones said. ``Those kind of players we have
used and other teams have used to go to Super Bowls. This group
still has it. There's nothing I've seen out there that will keep
that core base of players from having the kind of year I'm talking
about. I'm talking about this year.''
</P>
<P>
   And though he's extremely disappointed in the Cowboys'
early-season play, he said he is not presiding over a dead football
team, just a poor-performing one.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Cowboys' 29th-ranked defense is at the
bottom or close to the bottom in nearly every statistical category
and that their 21st-ranked offense has been largely inconsistent
and shown no ability to keep up with the high-powered attacks
displayed by most of the top NFL teams.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said ``the thing that's really keeping me going is that I
see the adjustments we can make that will allow us to win games,''
adding that he believes the Cowboys need only nine victories to
make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to adjust upwards 50 to 60 percent of the areas
in our execution and play,'' Jones said. ``That's going to change
the L's to W's. That's not a huge adjustment across the board.
That's really a 15 or 20 percent adjustment. And it's really
execution and doing smart things out there across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can change this things to wins, wins, wins. I'm not going
to say we can't win nine games.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is realistic enough to admit that a turnaround will be
difficult, especially considering the Cowboys' late-season schedule
includes Jacksonville, Baltimore, Tennessee, Tampa Bay and
Minnesota, in addition to divisional games with Washington,
Philadelphia and New York.
</P>
<P>
   He said the 32-31 loss to Arizona might end up being the most
damning because it reduced the Cowboys' margin of error. Yet Jones
said there is reason for hope, even after the embarrassing setbacks
to the Eagles (41-14) and 49ers (41-24).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen enough in the first four games to believe that,''
Jones said. ``That is based on the fact that I am not asking to
reverse a 41 to x score. I'm talking about reversing different
aspects of the game by 15 or 20 percent. That's how you get your
wins rather than your losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he would have a different outlook if the Cowboys had
played their best football and been trumped by those scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we can play better than we did in those two games,''
Jones said. ``If I thought we were looking at a dramatic
turnaround, the one you are looking at because of those scores and
1-3, I wouldn't say this. But it's closer than that in my mind. We
have to improve. But we are closer than that.''

STARS' REBELLIOUS BUG WON'T DIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's like a big, fat roach. Even when you think you've squished
it, it somehow wriggles out from under your shoe and slips away.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, it's crawling up your leg, or scampering
over the cheese and crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Yuck.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same thing with this annual, ongoing conviction around
the NHL that it's only a matter of time until the weary and
frustrated Stars' players revolt and depose head coach Ken
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   You know, pull their own little coup on the mean and nasty
tyrant who masquerades as a kindly Captain Kangaroo look-alike by
day, but turns into the grinch who steals all the pucks by night.
</P>
<P>
   And just think, the season doesn't even start until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tired story, as dog-eared as my personal well-worn
paperback copy of ``Lonesome Dove'', but without the substance.
It's plain foolishness, considering Hitchcock, in the past three
years, has led the Stars to the conference finals and two
consecutive Stanley Cup Finals appearances.
</P>
<P>
   His way wins and he has the hides on the wall to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, this ``roach'' just won't die.
</P>
<P>
   It was scurrying around the Stars' kitchen again yesterday, big
and black and ugly as you please, thanks to ESPN's Al Morganti, who
authored an NHL preview on the network's Web site this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dallas Stars will have `issues' with coach Ken
Hitchcock,'' Morganti predicted. ``It's no secret that the Stars'
locker room has been near revolt at times while under the reign of
Hitchcock. However, the team's success has always been enough to
convince the players that Hitchcock's way, while stressful, gets
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stars are now two seasons removed from their Cup in 1999,
and if there is any struggle early in the season, you can bet
Hitchcock will start hearing the rumblings of an unhappy locker
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? You mean professional players might whine and complain
and try to blame someone else if they're not producing? Say it
ain't so, Al.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Morganti added an important codicil to his
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the players need to realize is that GM Bob Gainey knows
the price a team has to pay to win a championship,'' he said, ``and
he will not surrender a premier coach for players who are tired of
paying the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is another way of saying that Gainey doesn't suffer fools
kindly.
</P>
<P>
   The point that Morganti is missing, or has forgotten, is that
Gainey took care of this last year.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a story broke out of Phoenix that the Stars
players were on the verge of a revolt. It was such a problem, the
Stars won the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, when the Stars struggled early and players began to
whine, Gainey made it a point to go down to the locker room and
tell them, in so many words, to shut up and play.
</P>
<P>
   They did.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't want to be the player that needs reminding this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, being somewhat removed, there are things I can see
or bring to the group that someone else might not see,'' Gainey
said during the Stars' 6-2 exhibition loss to Colorado on Thursday
night at Reunion Arena. ``It's my experience of being part of 25 or
30 different teams over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what \RMorganti\S is basing his story on. It's a
good story, I guess, but I go to the bookstore and the shelves are
full of good fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock also remained unruffled by Morganti's speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what people are saying is that we've been to the top
of the mountain so many times the last three years, they don't feel
like we can get back to that level again, or that we won't want to
pay that price again, and thus there'll be conflict,'' Hitchcock
said. ``Maybe there will. But I'm not backing off and I know the
leaders of our group aren't backing off.''
</P>
<P>
   There'll be no changes in his approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't win by being a nice guy,'' Hitchcock said. ``You win
because you push buttons. Players crave discipline because they
know discipline leads to success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there will be growing pains, especially as we add
younger players, but as far as effort and as far as discipline, I'm
not backing off a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   All the predictions of doom and revolt are predicated on a weary
Stars team getting off to a slow start, a scenario Hitchcock
vigorously disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evaluate us on our skill level, don't evaluate us because you
think we're going to be tired,'' Hitchcock said. ``Losing last year
cleaned the slate. This is new. When you've won, when you've been
as successful as we've been, just-abouts don't cut it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players are very fresh and they feel good. We're not the
tired team people seem to think we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Not nearly as rebellious either. Nevertheless, I doubt we've
seen the last of this ``bug'' with nine lives.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody got a can of Raid?

DODGERS APPLAUD LASORDA'S GOLDEN OLYMPIC TRIUMPH
</HEADLINE>

By KEVIN MODESTI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES The loudest cheer at Dodger Stadium in 2000 was
reserved for somebody who hasn't worn a Dodgers uniform in four
years, for something he did thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lasorda came home from Sydney, Australia, as an Olympic
hero, and the baseball fans of Los Angeles, who hadn't had much to
shout about this season, greeted him with open throats Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He was introduced -- as if the Hall of Fame manager needed an
introduction -- to the crowd between innings of a game against the
San Francisco Giants that happened to mark the end of the Dodgers'
home schedule. And the crowd of 44,513 responded with a two-minute
standing ovation as Lasorda took his bows in front of the
third-base dugout while the ballpark organist serenaded him with
``My Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, the Dodgers' senior vice president these days,
certainly will be the only club executive to earn applause this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But for a couple of minutes, you could forget the Dodgers'
disappointing season and bask in the Olympics afterglow. Lasorda
certainly has, in the two days since he coached an underdog team of
minor-league pros to a gold-medal-game victory over Cuba's seasoned
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bigger than the World Series, it's better than the
All-Star Game,'' said Lasorda, 73, who managed the Dodgers to
victories in two of the former and the National League to wins in
three of the latter. ``This is for the United States of America,
the land of opportunity! All of America was pulling for this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda said that soon after the 15-hour flight carrying him and
several of his gold medal-wearing players touched down at Los
Angeles International Airport on Thursday morning. Thursday evening
he was still carrying on in a pregame press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we won the World Series, the Dodger fans were happy but
the Giants fans weren't. But this is for all of America,'' he
roared. ``To win for your country, it's something to be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda said he has fielded congratulatory phone calls from
former President Bush and baseball great Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   His Olympics experience also included lunch with tennis stars
Lindsey Davenport, Monica Seles and Todd Martin, and a
command-performance pep talk to the gold medal-winning U.S.
softball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in a lot of fights in my day, but nobody could ever
knock a tear out of me,'' Lasorda said. ``But I cried when I saw
that American flag being raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody believed we had a chance. Nobody believed we belonged
on the same field as the Cubans. They had a lot of big, strong
guys, guys who were 32, 33, 34 years old. The first pitcher we
faced was throwing 95 miles an hour. We knock him out, and you'd
think it gets easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next guy throws 97, and the guy after that, he registered
100 on the radar gun three times. I had a bunch of kids nobody'd
ever heard of, and we beat 'em. ... This, really, I think, was the
greatest upset since David slew Goliath.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda said his greatest memory of the month with the U.S. team
was watching the players receive their medals -- ``and seeing those
Cubans over there crying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure they'll be cutting sugar cane when Castro finds out
we beat'em,'' he said as reporters winced.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reporters and autograph seekers at LAX to greet the
plane was Tommy Hawkins, the ex-basketball star who is the Dodgers'
vice president for external affairs. The two men are playfully
competitive about their achievements. When Hawkins received a Notre
Dame University alumnus of the year award in 1999, he made sure to
place it conspicuously on Lasorda's desk, with a note reading,
``Top this.'' Lasorda responded by leaving on Hawkins' desk a
certificate showing Tommy had received the blessing of the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought (after the U.S. victory) was, 'Now how am I
going to live with this guy?' '' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me before he took off from San Diego, and he said,
'I feeeel it (victory) in my bones!' I said, 'Oh, here we go
again.' But if he feels it, you better believe. As close as I am to
him, I still listen to his babble.''
</P>
<P>
   His young players listened, and played like it.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Doug Mientkiewicz spoke at the airport of how
Lasorda talked him out of a batting slump during the pre-Olympics
exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'If you don't start hitting, I'm going to have to
send you out of here.' He had a smile on his face,'' Mientkiewicz
said. ``I've never had a manager joke about a slump before. It
broke the tension, and I went on to have a great Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins doubts his friend's brief return to uniform has made him
think about a return to major-league managing. Then again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy will leave this place seriously feeling there is one
more game to win. It's just his nature. For him to sit back and
rest on his laurels? No,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be half of the fans cheering Lasorda Thursday were
thinking, ``This guy should manage the Dodgers next season''?
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, who contributes mostly advice and PR in his
front-office role, smiled but said: ``Tell them to forget it. I
don't want to manage. I've been to the top of the mountain in my
profession, the Hall of Fame. Besides, if I went back to managing,
it would cost me my marriage of 50 years. My wife (Jo) would be in
Reno before you knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   If this, then, was the last chapter of Lasorda's on-field
career, it makes for a definitive and overdue conclusion to one of
sports' true modern legends. Lasorda's retirement after 20 years as
Dodgers manager following a 1997 heart attack was clouded by
speculation he actually was fired.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe it isn't the last chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have asked me about four years from now in Athens,
Greece,'' Lasorda said, referring to the site of the 2004 Summer
Games. ``If I'm alive, they've got me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Karyn Kusama wanted her (beginitalic)Girlfight (enditalic)to be
a lot of things: gritty, realistic, emotionally moving. But she
didn't want it to be (beginitalic)Rocky(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   In (beginitalic)Girlfight(enditalic), which stars Michelle
Rodriguez as an inner-city teenager who takes up boxing, the
fighters don't knock each other's head off with every punch. And
that's just how Kusama likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't want a sort of an overstylized or
overchoreographed sensibility during those boxing sequences,'' says
Kusama, who wrote and directed (beginitalic)Girlfight(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   ``In amateur it's such a different style of fighting, and it's
quite a bit more raw and more desperate really. Because you're
dealing with kids who have less skill and more fear and are still
kind of figuring out whether or not they even want to be in the
ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with realistic fight scenes, Kusama wanted
(beginitalic)Girlfight(enditalic) to have a distinctive feel.
Because she was limited by her budget and shooting schedule, she
manipulated some old Fuji film stock to give the movie a richer but
grittier look.
</P>
<P>
   Kusama also paid close attention to finding sets that
illustrated the main character's inner-city environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just tried to keep an attention to color, an attention to
texture,'' she says, ``so that when there were really great peeling
walls already in a space where we were going to be shooting, we
just left those as they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who plays the female boxer Diana, adds to the film's
tone with her performance, Kusama says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has a very un-self-conscious demeanor as an
actor,'' the director says. ``She's very unaware of the camera. I
think there's a lot going on in her that she just lets kind of
happen, and the camera can pick that up.''
</P>
<P>
   In writing (beginitalic)Girlfight(enditalic), Kusama wanted to
tell the story of one female's transformation. She picked boxing
because she is a fan of the sport, having watched it with her
father as a child. And several years ago, she started boxing to
keep in shape.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all Kusama's hard work, it's unclear how the film will
do at the box office. It has no major stars, and Sony released it
under the Screen Gems label rather than Columbia, which is reserved
for bigger movies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kusama says she believes the studio is ``behind it 100
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think sometimes we have disagreements about how to be
behind the film,'' she says, adding that she has taken issue with
some of the marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not particularly in love with the poster. {hellip} I feel
the trailer gives a lot away,'' she says. ``Just that kind of
stuff. It's a crapshoot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But then, at the same time, I look at posters and I look at
trailers, and I think my materials are actually pretty good.''

 &HT;    `GIRLFIGHT THE SORT OF MOVIE THAT WEARS YOU OUT(a) 
 &HT;    (With GIRLFIGHT-DIRECTOR sidebar) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Girlfight is the sort of movie that wears you out.
</P>
<P>
   It's well-written and features a solid performance from Michelle
Rodriguez in the leading role, but it's so unrelentingly morose
that it becomes hard to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The movie seems to be purposely shot in bleak colors: grays,
blues and browns, and the settings are uniformly dark and dingy.
Yes, this is a movie about the inner city, but the first dozen
tenement shots sort of bring that home. And, hey, doesn't at least
one tree grow in Brooklyn?
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez plays Diana, an underprivileged teenager with family
troubles and a chip on her shoulder. After getting into several
fights at school, Diana decides to put her aggression to good use
and train as a boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Rodriguez is the best thing in the movie. She plays
Diana with gritty intensity, and her reactions seem perfectly
natural and unrehearsed, as if she's completely unaware of the
camera.
</P>
<P>
   And because Rodriguez really creates a character you can root
for, some will find the film uplifting. At times you wish she would
lighten up a bit, but you could argue it's just not in her nature.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem with (beginitalic)Girlfight (enditalic)is that
it should be a non-traditional sports movie, but it's really not.
Except for a female being cast in the lead role,
(beginitalic)Girlfight (enditalic)follows the standard path of the
young fighter who must train like mad and overcome adversity to
come out on top.
</P>
<P>
   So (beginitalic)Girlfight (enditalic)ends up being
very-well-done formula, but formula all the same.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are the usual raised eyebrows when Diana
shows up at a gym filled with guys to begin her training. But
because the movie must be more than 10minutes long, she ultimately
signs on with Hector (Jaime Tirelli), a wizened old trainer who
obviously attended the Burgess Meredith School of Cornermen and
Sages.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Diana must keep her training secret from her
dismissive father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), who is trying to
encourage her bookish brother to box. There are the usual fights at
the dinner table and other domestic squabbles as Diana battles for
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Her dad is sort of the central-casting domestic abuser that
always ends up in this type of movie. He can't understand his
daughter's love of boxing, or even bother to show up. Instead, he
just yells at her a lot, and we soon learn that he used to beat up
Diana's mom when she was still in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the film deserves credit for its
authentic-looking boxing sequences, which don't make every punch a
haymaker or every fighter a young Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Diana herself is no overnight sensation. She has to train hard
to get better, and never is able to walk into the ring and knock
out her opponent with one punch. In a way, the movie might have
been better served with more boxing and less angst, which actually
may have lightened the tone.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, (beginitalic)Girlfight (enditalic)packs some
emotional punch. You just might want to duck.

 &HT;    RE-RELEASED `EXORCIST' SCARES UP NEW FOLLOWING(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've only seen (beginitalic)The Exorcist (enditalic)on
television, you haven't really seen (beginitalic)The
Exorcist(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The terrifying tale of a possessed girl is a big-screen movie,
plain and simple. It is carefully constructed, filled with nuance,
designed to build fear one minute at a time. There can be no
escape, no break, just the horror unfolding before your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the scariest movie ever made, (beginitalic)The Exorcist
(enditalic)became an instant cultural phenomenon after it was
released in 1973. At theaters around the country, there were
reports of people collapsing or running out screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were too young to see it at the movies heard about the
``bad parts'' from older siblings, or whispered during recess.
Everyone knew about the ``pea soup'' projectile vomit, the spinning
head, the levitating bed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many children of the '70s first saw the film on TV,
heavily edited and interrupted by commercials. It was still scary,
but Mr.Whipple gave you a chance to catch your breath.
</P>
<P>
   By the time cable and VCRs came around, (beginitalic)The
Exorcist (enditalic)already had been quoted, copied and parodied to
death. We could watch the original, uncut version, but only on the
small screen, which drained much of its remarkable power.
</P>
<P>
   But Warner Bros.' decision to re-release the film gives an
entire generation a chance finally to see director William
Friedkin's frightening masterpiece in all its glory.
</P>
<P>
   The studio has added 11minutes of unseen footage, including the
so-called ``spider walk'' sequence (you'll know it when you see
it), some subliminal flashes of the devil's face, and a new,
slightly more windy ending. It also seems like the demon that
possesses Linda Blair's character is even more foul-mouthed than
before.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest improvement was adding six-track digital surround
sound, especially because the film's unique soundtrack plays a key
role in (beginitalic)The Exorcist's (enditalic)ability to whip up
fear.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on a bestseller by William Peter Blatty, which
was inspired by an actual exorcism in the Washington, D.C., area.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie is known for being frightening, Friedkin
actually spent quite a bit of time developing his characters and
building tension and suspense.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie opens, we watch Father Merrin (Max von Sydow)
search through a Persian archaeological dig and come across an evil
artifact.
</P>
<P>
   Then the story switches to Georgetown, where we meet Regan
(Blair), a happy young girl who lives with her actress mother,
Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), in a beautiful home. At first,
everything seems fine, but Chris starts hearing odd noises coming
from the attic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Regan becomes afflicted with a strange ailment, which
has her speaking in a guttural voice and thrashing all over her
room. Doctors run countless tests but ultimately are stumped.
</P>
<P>
   Regan's condition worsens until she is hardly recognizable, tied
to her bed to prevent her from hurting herself or others. As
experts scratch their heads, Chris consults Father Karras (Jason
Miller), a priest who also has training in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's initially skeptical, Karras ultimately asks
permission to summon Merrin for a secret ritual known as an
exorcism. That's when this movie really starts to get scary.
</P>
<P>
   You may have seen it on TV, but it's time to check out
(beginitalic)The Exorcist (enditalic)on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   But look out for those nightmares.

 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beautiful just doesn't know what it wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   With the casting of Hallie Kate Eisenberg (the 7-year-old from
the Pepsi commercials), the movie seems to be making a major push
for the cute vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the plot is nowhere near cute. In fact, it's pretty darned
ugly.
</P>
<P>
   The film focuses on Mona (Minnie Driver), a ruthless woman so
eager to win beauty pageants that she turns her back on her
illegitimate daughter, Vanessa (Eisenberg). Because pageants
usually don't allow mothers to be contestants, Mona pretends that
the girl belongs to her best friend, Ruby (Joey Lauren Adams).
</P>
<P>
   And get this: Mona doesn't even tell Vanessa that she is her
mother, even though the two look very much alike. Instead, she lets
Ruby raise the girl while Mona pretends she's just a roommate.
</P>
<P>
   As my pal Daffy Duck used to say, ``Despicable.''
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Beautiful (enditalic)is supposed to be a comedy,
but it's just not all that funny to watch poor little Vanessa try
to figure out who her mommy is.
</P>
<P>
   This is Sally Field's first stint as a director, and it's too
bad she couldn't get a better script.
</P>
<P>
   The basic premise is contrived. We're never told how Mona
manages to hide her pregnancy - in a pretty small-looking town -
and then transfer the child to Ruby without anyone tumbling. We
don't even get a little two-minute scene of a pregnant Mona moving
away.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as Mona rises through the beauty pageant ranks, not a
single neighbor or relative asks the obvious question. It's just
really hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Mona's selfish, boorish behavior, which supposedly
comes from a bad childhood, isn't limited to the treatment of her
own daughter. She sabotages other beauty contestants, including a
woman who receives a horribly scarred hand from the ordeal. For
good measure, she exploits a pregnant woman and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   All of this really gives (beginitalic)Beautiful(enditalic)
nowhere to go. Because this is a movie, we know that Mona can't
stay evil forever, but by the time she repents, we're really not
that eager to forgive her.
</P>
<P>
   The bright spot of the film is Eisenberg, who is very cute and
perky as young Vanessa. In fact, she may be the only thing that was
keeping Driver awake through this one.
</P>
<P>
   Driver never really looks comfortable in the beauty queen
get-ups, though she wears them through most of the film. And she
never achieves the plastic Barbie sheen of a true beauty
contestant.
</P>
<P>
   In the last half-hour, the movie decides that it must show us
most of the fictional beauty pageant, complete with talent
competition and evening gowns. Real pageants are dull enough
without having to sit through a phony one.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, (beginitalic)Beautiful (enditalic)will never win Miss
Congeniality.

   We hate to say it, but tonight really is must-see viewing for
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The appetizer is the premiere of Aaron Spelling's ``Titans,'' at
8. The peacock network is advertising this as a guilty pleasure,
and that's about right _ it's a total throwback to the prime-time
soaps of the ``Dallas''/``Dynasty'' era, but it's a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Principal and Perry King play a rich divorced couple
who live across the street from each other in Beverly Hills.
Yasmine Bleeth is King's new bride-to-be. And Casper Van Dien is
the long-absent son who returns to find that he already knows Dad's
intended _ very, very well. And those are just the highlights of
the family dysfunction. The title refers to the family's aerospace
business, but don't worry, you won't have to know anything about
flying to enjoy this trashy bit of fun.
</P>
<P>
   The main course, however, is the two-hour season premiere of
``West Wing,'' beginning at 9. This White House drama won nine
Emmys a few weeks ago, wiping the floor with HBO's superior ``The
Sopranos.'' We could be bitter about that, but this is a very good
ensemble drama that actually touches on big issues in a meaningful
way, and for that we should be grateful. Martin Sheen is at the top
of his game as President Bartlet, and Allison Janney is the best of
a sterling cast of White House aides and political players.
</P>
<P>
   The show's fans were divided on the cliffhanger shooting at the
end of last season _ shocking and powerful or merely crass TV
melodrama? In any case, tonight we'll find out who got shot and
maybe even why.
</P>

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Dogs sniff one another because
they are communicating on some basic level. They are communicating
with pheromones, odorless molecules that waft from most animals.
These powerful molecules carry important messages. Pheromones tell
animals what they are supposed to do, such as run, fight or have
sex. The nice thing about pheromone messages is that animals don't
have to worry if they are making the right decision. (Rowland

<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Many years ago I knew a
writer in New York who loved to boast about what he considered the
greatest accomplishment of his moderately distinguished career. He
sold Reader's Digest articles on three different people for the
magazine's then premier feature, ``The Most Unforgettable Character
I've Ever Known.'' In later years, and more appropriate to the
times, ``Unforgettable Character'' became ``Unforgettable
Personality.'' The subject almost always was someone who had
triumphed over great adversity, usually with a sense of humor,
humility and perseverance. (Jim Minter is a former editor of The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ My husband is a man of
principle. There is no way, Jim declared, that our family would
ever be a three-cat family. Two cats? Maybe. But three cats, as he
put it so tactfully, ``bordered on crazy-cat-lady status.''
(McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ The FAO Schwarz ``Utimate Toy Catalog'' that

 &HT;    Three's really the charm
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ My husband is a man of principle.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way, Jim declared, that our family would ever be a
three-cat family. Two cats? Maybe. But three cats, as he put it so
tactfully, ``bordered on crazy-cat-lady status.''
</P>
<P>
   My children are children of steadfast heart. There is no way,
they declared, that any cat would supplant Stella _ our great gray
cat who died in January _ in their affections.
</P>
<P>
   We have tried to be sensitive to their feelings. There has been
a lot of condescending adult talk about how Stella is in heaven and
how ``we're holding Stella in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Stella is in our hearts and Stella is in heaven, does that
mean heaven is in our heart?'' asked Veronica, our fledgling
philosopher. But after a proper period of mourning, we felt ready,
early this summer, for another cat. One cat, for starters.
</P>
<P>
   Enter a magnificent orange-and-white cat whose owner had found
abandoned. Her other cats hadn't taken to the newcomer, so she was
looking for a new home.
</P>
<P>
   We would take the cat on a ``trial basis,'' we decided, while
his owner was on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   He had a name before he was in the car two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Having recently seen the Masterpiece Theatre production of
``David Copperfield,'' we thought Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   Jim proposed the more obscure but ironic name of ``Barkis,''
after the suitor of David's nursemaid Peggotty _ the character
known for that most concise of great literary lines, ``Barkis is
willin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Alec was thinking mainstream. ``Oliver,'' he said decisively.
``He's Oliver.'' And Oliver he was, a name that seemed to suit his
wayfarer status.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, after Oliver had adjusted to his new home,
our friends Brian and Dea rescued a mother cat and four kittens
after one of the kittens became trapped in the sewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only takes one look,'' says my mother, an incorrigible cat
lover, and it only took one look for us all to agree to take home a
sleek black-and-gray tiger stripe kitten with inquiring eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Once again Jim hopefully suggested the name ``Barkis.'' Once
again the kids and I overruled him in naming the newcomer Dodger,
as in Oliver's artful accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   I also had my eye on Dodger's shy brother _ almost his twin
except for his gray-and-white markings and white socked feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Jim thundered, muttering something under his
breath about ``crazy cat woman.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been 18 years since I had a kitten in my life, and we all
fell irresistibly in love.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica carted Dodger around the house like a teddy bear, but
he never seemed to mind. She came to me one morning, Dodger scooped
in her arms, her brown eyes solemn. ``I'm holding Stella in my
heart,'' she said, as if guilty to be so attached to the
interloper.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger took to Jim the way cats always take to non-cat lovers.
``He likes me best,'' Jim observed. ``Do you notice how he always
snuggles up to me? And how loudly he purrs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I agreed. ``He likes you best. But don't you think he
needs a playmate for the times when you're not here?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim agreed wholeheartedly: Dodger needed a companion. Oliver
tolerated him, not bothering any more with the perfunctory hiss,
but spurned overtures at friendship.
</P>
<P>
   While we're still holding Stella in our hearts, we find we still
have room there for not one, not two, but three new cats.
</P>
<P>
   The sock-footed cat, lo and be- hold, was still available for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Barkis.

 &HT;    After being pilloried in Washington, Bert Lance finally honored
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many years ago I knew a writer in New York who loved
to boast about what he considered the greatest accomplishment of
his moderately distinguished career. He sold Reader's Digest
articles on three different people for the magazine's then premier
feature, ``The Most Unforgettable Character I've Ever Known.''
</P>
<P>
   In later years, and more appropriate to the times,
``Unforgettable Character'' became ``Unforgettable Personality.''
The subject almost always was someone who had triumphed over great
adversity, usually with a sense of humor, humility and
perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny September morning at the Resaca rest stop north of
Calhoun, Ga., on I-75, the thought came to me that if I were trying
to sell the Digest a story about my own most unforgettable
personality, I might need two or three cracks. But I would start
with Bert Lance.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century ago Bert Lance was the designated
scapegoat of an upstart Carter administration that had usurped the
Washington establishment. Jimmy Carter had appointed him director
of the Office of Management and Budget, a job sometimes described
as general manager of the United States government. After
Watergate, Republicans, media sharks and some disgruntled Democrats
needed another scandal. Lance was elected.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Georgia he had sinned terribly. He had run his bank
with his heart as well as his head. He had made some of his loans
on faith, out of a desire to help somebody he knew and trusted.
Never mind that he had never cost a single depositor a single dime,
and that Calhoun and Gordon County were dotted with businesses
started on one of those loans from Bert Lance's bank.
</P>
<P>
   A good banker shouldn't do things like marking over $100 to the
account when the young Baptist preacher in town had insufficient
funds to pay the grocery bill.
</P>
<P>
   Finally acquitted, he walked out of a federal courthouse in
Atlanta and went home to his roses and his apple trees on a high
hill in Gordon County, vowing to go without rancor. ``Bitterness,''
he said, ``breeds destruction.'' So there we were on a cool
September morning beside I-75 in Resaca, unveiling a sign that read
``Bert Lance Highway,'' an overdue recognition for the state's
first commissioner of the Department of Transportation and catalyst
for the completion of Georgia's superb interstate highway system.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a quarter of a century after leaving his Washington post
as the second most powerful man in the country, Bert Lance drew a
crowd to make presidential candidates envious. Gov. Roy Barnes was
there, along with former Gov. Joe Frank Harris, local and state
officials, legislators, a battalion of volunteers from a long-ago
gubernatorial campaign, newspaper folks, neighbors, and friends
from a lifetime of public and community service.
</P>
<P>
   The governors, present and past, and other distinguished
speakers gave eloquent tributes, pointing out that the honor was
much deserved and long overdue. Nobody put it better than an old
friend who was busy in Washington and had to write a letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Bert,
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Shirley and I could be with you, LaBelle and the family
for this important event.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one deserves having a section of one of the main
transportation arteries in this nation named in their honor more
than you. For more than four decades you have served the state and
this nation in an exemplary way.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has been a greater visionary for what Georgia could
become than you. No one has brought more common sense and
progressive thinking to public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those highway signs will stand as a monument to your work and
your life, but many of us know that there are many more unnamed
monuments to Bert Lance from Brasstown Bald to the Okefenokee.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time we were in the first grade together you have
been a friend and your advice not to copy your arithmetic paper was
as right as your advice to accept this new challenge in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are precious to the Miller family. You have always been
there for us when we needed you. I'll never forget who was there
first when my mother died. I respect you. I admire you. I love you.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely, Zell Miller''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people, if blessed with Zell Miller's talent with
words, could write such a letter to Bert Lance.

 &HT;    The smell made me do it
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Dogs sniff one another because they are
communicating on some basic level.
</P>
<P>
   They are communicating with pheromones, odorless molecules that
waft from most animals. These powerful molecules carry important
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Pheromones tell animals what they are supposed to do, such as
run, fight or have sex.
</P>
<P>
   The nice thing about pheromone messages is that animals don't
have to worry if they are making the right decision. They have no
self-doubt. They are not conflicted. They don't worry about the
morality or repercussions of their pheromone-induced actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it smelled right, so I did it. What's the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists reason that humans also release and react to
pheromone messages.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists figure that humans have evolved beyond the use
of pheromones for cues that control behavior. Our superior brains
supposedly allow us to make these decisions without interference of
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ACTIONS CONTROLLED BY ODORS
</P>
<P>
   People concerned with religion and morals don't like the idea
that human behavior might be controlled by odors. Humans are
supposed to make decisions based on reason and concepts of right
and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Neurogeneticists at Yale and Rockefeller Universities now say
they have isolated a human gene, V1RL1, that encodes for a
pheromone receptor in the mucous lining of the nose _ human noses.
</P>
<P>
   So far, these scientists don't know whether people use this gene
as a part of a message system to communicate primal urges. It that
is the case, scientists also don't know which urge is be triggered.
</P>
<P>
   One scientist, Joseph Falke, a biochemist at the University of
Colorado, told the Associated Press that the next job is ``to find
a pheromone that binds to the receptor and triggers a measurable
physiological response.''
</P>
<P>
   These researchers will float pheromone molecules out to the
noses of test subjects and see if they are overcome with the urge
to have sex, fight, flee, build a nest or whatever pheromone
messages do.
</P>
<P>
   Mice have more than 100 functioning genes. It's hard to imagine
what 100 mice messages might contain. Perhaps animals can read
pheromone messages from other animals.
</P>
<P>
   This may be why dogs take an instant dislike to some people and
form quick friendships with other people.
</P>
<P>
   People who like animals may smell different. There may be
pheromones for fear, love, hate, fidelity, strength, weakness,
health and the like.
</P>
<P>
   If true, scientists might do the human race a favor if they
kick-start the human pheromone message center.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, people are making a mess of things by using their
judgment to make basic decisions.
</P>
<P>
   It might be better to smell whether your sweetheart really loves
you or whether the used car salesman is telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Some perfume manufacturers already sell fragrances that claim to
contain pheromones that attract the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   Musk ox cologne supposedly has such a pheromone. Not many
people, however, want to attract huge, smelly bovines.
</P>
<P>
   Other fragrances claim to have actual human pheromones.
Insomniacs can buy these fragrances late at night on obscure cable
channels. These fragrances supposedly attract men or women,
depending on your tastes. Bisexuals must use both fragrances
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists know that hormones often override judgment and common
sense in many people. Why not pheromones? The Associated Press
story failed to say who is funding this research and what they
intend to do with it. Someone needs to find out if Bill Gates is
behind it.

 &HT;    Benches are simple, so dive in and make your own customized
plans
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once again I have been asked if I can provide plans
for an object that I've never heard of or seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to know if you have plans for a viewing bench for
a pool room, or where I could obtain one,'' a reader asks via
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   First, I have no plans, other than retirement as soon as it can
be arranged. Second, I'm not sure what a viewing bench for a pool
room entails. However, benches are pretty simple things, and I
would encourage my correspondent to forge ahead without commercial
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume that a viewing bench for a pool room needs to be
high enough to allow seated viewers to see what goes on atop the
table. Presumably that's the only thing that separates it from an
ordinary bench.
</P>
<P>
   Since I have no available measurements for a pool table, and I
don't know how far from the table the bench might be located, it
will be up to the correspondent to determine how high it should be.
I should think 2- 1/2 to 3 feet from the floor to the seat would be
in the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing to determine is how many people it should seat.
For the sake of argument, let's say four. More than that and we
might want to make two benches. Let's make it out of a good strong
wood, but not too hard to work. How about maple?
</P>
<P>
   Now, we want plenty of support, so let's make this fellow an
eight-legged bench, four in the front, four in the back. An
octobench, if you will. (You probably won't, but it was worth a
try.)
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to do is draw this octobench out to scale, an
inch to a foot. The undercarriage will need to have runners
connecting all the legs about halfway between the bottom of the
seat and the floor. If you want a back on it, extend the back legs
up high enough to support the back.
</P>
<P>
   Since it might be difficult to find 16/4 maple _ not to mention
its frightful expense _ let's laminate the legs from two pieces of
8/4 stock. This will also allow us to use bridle joints, rather
than mortise and tenons, to connect the runners and the seat
supports front and back. Mortise and tenons, however, will be
needed to connect the front of the understructure to the back. The
seat supports ought to be 4/4 stock about six inches wide. The
runners ought to be about three inches wide in 4/4 stock.
</P>
<P>
   The bench seat itself, of course, can be laminated from 4/4
stock, or if you want something airy you can put a half-inch of
separation between the planks. To make a comfortable back, the
uprights should be tapered back after they rise above the seat, so
the folks sitting on the bench can lean back a little. The boards
of the back could be let into the uprights; no more of a joint than
that would be required to make them very solid.
</P>
<P>
   You can make a lot of changes on this very simple bench, of
course, all without following anyone else's plans.

   COXNET HEALTHY LIVING 0926 -- As the annual breast cancer
awareness campaign gets under way next month, women with a genetic
risk for breast cancer will seem to be everywhere. But they are the
exception. Of the 182,800 women diagnosed with the disease this
year, only 5 percent to 10 percent of the cases will be attributed
to the mutated genes known to raise risks of breast cancer
(Guthrie, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes 4-column color

in her family.

   TELESCOPE _ Hal McAlister discovered the wonders of the night as
a fourth grader growing up in Chattanooga, captivated by the ``old
musty smell'' of a local observatory and the ability to see beyond
the limits of human vision. Now, at 51, he is about to realize the
dream of many youthful stargazers. Next month, Georgia State
University will dedicate an innovative new $13.5 million telescope
array high stop California's Mount Wilson _ one that will be able
to ``see'' distant stars as never before, exceeding even the limits
of the Hubble Space Telescope. In a way, the array of six
telescopes marks the realization of two parallel dreams _
McAlister's boyhood quest to probe the mysteries of the night sky
and Georgia's State's hopes of carving out a name for itself in
21st century astronomy. (Toner, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   TWIN-CONNECTION _ If it were written as a TV sitcom, the premise
would be rejected as ridiculous. Two strangers from Clark County,
Ohio, both redheads named Amy, are due to deliver twins within days
of each other. Both deliver twin girls. Both decide to be original
with their babies' names. Both choose Sidney (Sydney) and Savanna.
Both Savannas develop health complications requiring surgery. And
the women's friendship starts when a Dayton Children's Hospital
nurse makes the connection and tells Amy Combs, ``There's someone I
think you ought to meet.'' (Trump, Springfield News-Sun). WITH

great a season as ``The West Wing'' did is that everyone expects
you to do it again. When you are the best drama on network
television, you are judged only against yourself. After a brilliant
first season that culminated with nine Emmy wins _ including Best
Drama _ critical and ratings success and a controversial
cliff-hanger finale that left some television reviewers steaming,
``The West Wing'' returns next week in the season's most
anticipated premiere. By MARK McGUIRE.

   TV-THATSLIFE-REVIEW - The premise of CBS' ``That's Life'' isn't
Entirely new. Heather Paige Kent plays a late-blooming college
freshman just as Rhea Perlman did on ``Pearl,'' which bombed a few
seasons ago. That's life on television, though _ and this show has
a lot more going for it than ``Pearl'' ever did. The pilot airing
Sunday is good enough to bring you back next Saturday, when the
show moves into its regular time slot. By ANN HODGES.

retired law enforcement officer can evolve into as skilled a writer
as McGarrity. Even if it's a matter of writing about what he knows

well. By DOUG BLACKBURN. (For release Sunday, Oct. 1.)

MICROSOFT'S SECRET CODE TOO SECRET FOR USERS' GOOD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I just installed a new hard drive. Now I need
the serial number for my Windows 95 disk. I bought this machine
secondhand, so I have never had the number.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wrong Number
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WRONG: No, you've always had the number. You just don't
know where it is.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most irritating aspects of installing and
reinstalling a Microsoft product is having to keep track of some
25-character string of gibberish. Lose the product key, and you
might as well buy another copy of the software.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I understand that Microsoft is worried about bootleggers,
but this key thing isn't the way to handle the problem. In the
first place, it's inconvenient for the user. It's usually pasted to
the back of the CD jewel case or on an accompanying card. I don't
know about you, but these are among the most likely items in my
computer room to be trodden upon, covered with spilled margarita
mix and taken out with the trash. If the geniuses at Microsoft can
label a CD with some fancy hologram, they can sure stick a stupid
serial number on there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Second, all it takes is one ``borrowed'' key and a counterfeiter
can start cranking out thousands of copies of Windows Me, or you
can reinstall Win95. So what, exactly, is the number protecting?
Microsoft should trust its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to get off on a rant, but it seems I've lost my Office
2000 product key, and I'm in a rather foul mood about that.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, back to your Windows key: It's on your old hard drive,
if that still works. Just fire up Regedit (go to the Start menu,
select Run, type ``regedit'' in the blank and hit Enter). When the
Registry Editor is running, open the Edit menu and select Find.
Look for ``ProductKey'' (that's right, no spaces), and Regedit will
display the secret code.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a little hint that my close personal friend Heloise
will probably try to claim she came up with first: Get yourself a
Sharpie and scribble that number on the CD before you lose it
again. And, no, you can't write on the shiny side.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Here's an easy one for you: Is it more
practical to put the computer to sleep (on standby) or to turn it
off entirely when I know I will not be using it for the next 12 to
48 hours? I have it scheduled to defrag once a week at midnight
while I am sleeping. Will turning it off interfere with that
scheduled task?
</P>
<P>
   _ Perchance to Dream
</P>
<P>
   DEAR PERCHANCE: Uh, yeah, turning off the computer will most
definitely interfere with anything it's expected to do since it's,
you know, off.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, there's no reason to leave your computer on if you're
not going to be using it, unless you like helping the electric
company with its profit-loss margin. And there's really no task
that absolutely has to be performed in the middle of the night.
Personally, I don't like my computer doing things when I'm not
around to intercept error messages and make judgment calls.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's definitely a good idea to defrag the hard drive
occasionally. Windows Disk Defragmenter (in System Tools)
rearranges all the stuff on the drive so it can be retrieved or
used more efficiently. But once a week is too often. Try it monthly
while you're busy with other important chores, like knocking back a
few frosty ones, watching beach volleyball on ESPN. See, there's
another original hint Heloise didn't give you. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The only hint Heloise ever gave noted computerologist Dr.
Emilio Bombay was ``Get a life, loser. You'll never be as famous as
me!'' Write him at drbombay(at)star-telegram.com (snail-mail: Fort
Worth Star-Telegram, Box 1870, Fort Worth, TX 76101). Fax: (817)

POLLS HAVE POWER, BUT ANYTHING CAN STILL HAPPEN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL THOMPSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yeah, it's true. The pro-Bush crowd got a little cocky when
their guy was racking up double-digit leads in the presidential
preference polls before the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the Al-Gore-can't-lose gang went off the deep end, too, when
the Democratic nominee bounced out of his August convention with a
surge that carried him to commanding leads in some of the polls.
For a while there, the Democrats and the vice president's
cheerleaders in the media just about had us believing that Gore was
ready to write his inaugural address while George W. Bush was on
the verge of pulling his hat out of the ring and tossing in a
towel.
</P>
<P>
   So. We all learned the hard way _ again _ about putting too much
faith in polls that are, at best, nothing more than a snapshot of
the electorate's mood at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush-boosters _ and you can count me among them _ should be
careful, therefore, to keep their enthusiasm in check as the
Republican candidate rallies from the September swoon that so
encouraged his opponents and disheartened his supporters. Poll
results in recent days suggest that Bush has not only embarked on a
comeback but has reclaimed the lead in his up-down-up-again
campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's leads over Gore in most of the polls that show him ahead,
of course, fall within the margin of error _ meaning that the race
is a statistical dead heat. As most of the experts have predicted
all along, the battle for the White House is shaping up as a
barnburner that could keep us in suspense until the very last votes
are counted on election night.
</P>
<P>
   But considering that some polls showed Gore ahead by significant
margins as recently as last week, it seems fair to conclude that
the momentum has swung back to Bush. Which is not to say that the
pendulum won't lurch toward Gore in a day or two _ or maybe before
the ink dries on this particular exercise in wild-eyed guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   As long as we're guessing, though, let's take a stab at figuring
out what has caused the latest turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   During the first few weeks of September, it looked as though
Gore might keep building his lead in the polls until the polls
became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most experts on polling will
tell you that polls are a scientific measurement of public opinion
but are not predictive of the outcome of an election _ or at least
they're not supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that once a candidate establishes a comfortable
lead in the polls, voters begin to sense that the contest is over.
Supporters of the candidate who's behind tend to get discouraged
and lose interest; undecided voters tend to start moving toward the
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   The polls don't predict the winner, but they can influence the
next poll, which can influence the next poll, which can influence
the next poll ...
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the aura of inevitability engendered by a
candidate's dominance of the polls can't help but affect voters'
expectations _ and voters' expectations can't help but affect their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon could still occur in the 2000 presidential race.
The election is more than five weeks away. The debates between Bush
and Gore don't begin until Tuesday. When two spirited racehorses
are eyeball to eyeball heading into the home stretch, anything can
happen.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains: Why didn't Gore run off and hide when
everything was going his way? He got a convention bounce that
turned into a surge. He was winning the argument on his favorite
issues _ or the media said he was, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my theory: Gore isn't winning the argument on the issues.
Voters are still weighing his philosophy of more government and
more taxes against Bush's belief that the government should help
those who need help and get out of everybody else's way.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and another thing. Lots of voters like the idea that Bush is
exactly what he seems to be. Like him or not, there's no denying
that when it comes to the governor of Texas, what you see is what
you get.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, continues to apply the old saying about
acting to the art of politics: It's mostly about sincerity _ if you
can fake that, you've got it made.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has too many personalities, too many ever-evolving points
of view. He has been, everyone remembers, Bill Clinton's right-hand
man. Clinton has been, among other things, the nation's Liar in
Chief.
</P>
<P>
   The connection surely gives pause to thoughtful voters.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Nobody on the Dream Team ever wailed, ``Oh,
God, stop this,'' the way Mia Hamm did to inject a note of levity
during her team's cry-a-thon Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dream Team never lost, and probably never will, but the U.S.
soccer team did lose to their worthy opponent from Norway, which
only adds to their luster as the greatest American women's team _
ever.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after, they wept and passed the tissue box. This
is no cliche about women, no stereotype of female athletes, just a
straight reportorial fact. They love each other much more than
their silver medals, and they cried when they talked about it.
</P>
<P>
   They were back at the Nike Center, where they had met their
families Thursday night after the crushing 3-2 loss in sudden death
to Norway in the Summer Games final, a game that can legitimately
be put on a list of great sports events.
</P>
<P>
   It is always fascinating to watch athletes take defeat. The Boys
of Summer, the Brooklyn Dodgers, once lost a baseball playoff game
on Oct. 3, 1951, to their own worthy opponents _ only nobody in
Brooklyn called the New York Giants exactly that. It took the
Dodgers a decade or two to come to grips with what Bobby Thomson
had done to them.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was far too soon for the American women to deal with the
goal Dagny Mellgren produced in the 102nd minute. There was only
time to focus on the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine having Jordan and Bird and Magic and Ewing on the same
team,'' said April Heinrichs, the coach with the red eyes. ``We
did. For 14 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of them have been together practically since women's soccer
was invented. There are children either born or projected, second
careers to be pursued. Carla Overbeck, the captain who never got on
the field here, noted, ``I am the only one who has said I'm
retiring, but it's not like we won't see each other.''
</P>
<P>
   They were there for each other Thursday night. With their silver
medals around their necks, they repaired to the Nike Center in an
industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least my family loves me,'' said Kristine Lilly, one of the
old hands. ``They told us how proud they are. We had a chance to
reflect. My family had a great time here.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve and Brenda Mullinix were there for their daughter, Siri.
When she was a little girl back in North Carolina, her father would
kick soccer balls at a goal in their back yard, or she would bounce
on a trampoline, ``where I learned to dive.'' It always felt right
having the other side take pot shots at her, rather than romping
around the field like the Milbretts and Foudys of the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, three balls crossed the line, including the
ball that plunked to earth, was kicked and then skimmed the ground,
touching her fingertips, skittering into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' Mullinix said Friday. ``Particularly because I
got a touch on it. You wonder, did I do everything I could? I think
I replayed that last goal 1,000 times last night.''
</P>
<P>
   And on one of those 1,000 times, did Mullinix stay just a tad
closer to home?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some balls get through you,'' Mullinix said. ``You get down,
you get a hand on it, you hope you would stop it. But I wouldn't
change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs did not want to talk tough on this day of days, but
she hinted at other retirements and allowed as how there were great
young athletes in the system. She talked about learning from the
energy of Nigeria, the relentlessness of Germany, and the
gold-medal status of Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great game,'' she said. ``If we'd won, it would have
been even greater. But the fact that we lost and I'm considering it
was a great game tells you how great it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffeny Milbrett, who jumped higher for her header than a
5-foot-2 woman is supposed to, used the word ``numb.'' They were
operating on little sleep, and no gold medal, and they needed each
other. The only trouble was, whenever one would start talking about
each other, the box of tissues would start flying.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm started it, as she often does on the field, her voice
catching, her eyes tearing, her nose suddenly red. When she
finished talking, she rubbed her face with both hands and the box
of tissues came her way.
</P>
<P>
   They passed the tissues with the generosity and precision of a
great team, coach to keeper to defenders to midfielders to forwards
and back to the subs. They played like a team. They lost like a
team. They cried like a team.

LAWMAKERS NOT REASSURING WHEN IT COMES TO OPEN GOVERNMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By J.R. LABBE 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There is no right to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words, expelled from the lips of state Sen. David Sibley,
did little to comfort the assembled journalists at this month's
annual Freedom of Information conference in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a panel discussion titled ``A view from the Lege,'' Texas
lawmakers were supposed to preview upcoming privacy issues that
they expect to address in the Legislature. What they did was scare
the bejeepers out of anyone listening who is remotely committed to
open government in the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they talked about privacy, all right, in such ``Chicken
Little, the sky is falling,'' rev-up-the-black-helicopters
hyperbole that some in the audience weren't sure whether they were
at an open government conference or a preparedness convention.
</P>
<P>
   If these legislators communicate with their constituents in this
same vein, it's no wonder they are being besieged by people
demanding that something be done about invasions of their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley of Waco, state Sen. Ken Armbrister of Victoria and state
Rep. Steve Wolens of Dallas described in patronizing tones
scenarios of cybersnoops run amok. Why, citizens are under virtual
assault 24/7, with everything from their credit card numbers to
their medical records in peril.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not once did these elected luminaries make clear that there
are two distinctly different kinds of records: public and private.
Questions from audience members about the muddying of these lines
were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, as the new millennium dawns with all its rapidly advancing
technology, privacy concerns loom large on the radar screens of
Americans. Which is all the more reason for men who purport to be
leaders to act as moderating, rational, sane participants in the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Credibility. Accountability. That's what open government is all
about.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley, Armbrister and Wolens should be actively working to make
sure that their constituents clearly understand the difference
between publicly held information and that collected by private or
commercial entities. Government records, with few special
exemptions, must be available to any and all who wish to review
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Public Information Act sums up what every legislator
should take to heart: ``The people, in delegating authority, do not
give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the
people to know and what is not good for them to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but I forget. These are politicians, who can ride a wave of
privacy hysteria right into re-election. Plus, they don't consider
the media to be constituents; we're adversaries. Never mind that
the media has no more _ or no less _ access to public information
than any citizen.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Brian McCall of Plano was the fourth panel member. He
was the lone lawmaker to bring a degree of sanity and a modicum of
humility to the table. The others exuded an attitude of superiority
and condescension that was alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Armbrister used as an example of an abuse of open records
someone who filed a Freedom of Information request for a list of
locations for a protected species of cactus. According to the
senator, the information was used to poach the plant for sale on
the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it never occurred to Armbrister that the state
already has trespassing laws that should have taken care of the
criminal act. Instead, legislation was drafted to exempt the
endangered list from disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   How about if the state stopped asking people to catalogue the
flora and fauna on their private property? Then there won't be any
records to request.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Shipp, a reporter for Dallas-Fort Worth's WFAA/Channel 8
and a board member of the Freedom of Information Foundation of
Texas, asked each of the legislators to pledge that public
information currently available in paper form be made available
electronically. All were quick to respond in the affirmative, until
Wolens put on the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Wolens reminded his colleagues that when it came to disclosing
campaign finances, the Lege voted only to make available names and
amounts _ no addresses _ on the Web. Addresses are available to
those willing to dig through paper documents housed in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   When Shipp called them on it, saying this kind of tinkering
leads to a slippery slope of closing off certain information from
ready access, Wolens said, ``We're in the slippery slope
business.''
</P>
<P>
   And dragging every Texan down with them.

&HT;     HAIL OF BULLETS OPENS NEW SEASON OF `WEST WING' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only downside to having as great a season as ``The West
Wing'' did is that everyone expects you to do it again. When you
are the best drama on network television, you are judged only
against yourself.
</P>
<P>
   After a brilliant first season that culminated with nine Emmy
wins _ including Best Drama _ critical and ratings success and a
controversial cliff-hanger finale that left some television
reviewers steaming, ``The West Wing'' returns next week in the
season's most anticipated premiere.
</P>
<P>
   With its two-hour season kickoff Wednesday (9 p.m. Eastern, NBC)
the White House drama hoping to fend off the sophomore jinx that
has tripped up shows as forgettable as ``Laroquette'' and immortal
as ``The Sopranos'' (still better than almost anything on
television). Meanwhile, it must quell concerns raised from last
season's finale episode, which ended in a totally unexpected
assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The drama will pick up moments after it left off last spring: A
hail of gunfire erupted on the presidential entourage, with the
shots coming from skinheads secreted in a building across a plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody definitely got hit. Somebody may or may not die. So far
the only plot development critics were able to get out of anybody
connected with the NBC show came from Martin Sheen (President
Josiah Bartlet):
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to kill Charlie, I will give you that much,''
Sheen said in July, referring to the black aide Charlie Young (Dule
Hill) who is dating the president's daughter, Zoey (Elizabeth
Moss). ``That is as much as I can tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   The only cast member not returning is Moira Kelly, and her
character Mandy Hampton was not involved in the shooting. So keep
guessing.
</P>
<P>
   That assassination attempt ticked off television critics and
other viewers, if only because it was such a radical departure from
the dialogue-driven show crafted by creator Aaron Sorkin and his
co-executive producers, John Wells and director Thomas Schlamme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know many of you were troubled by it, that it possibly
didn't quite seem like the show,'' Sorkin told critics in July.
``The cliffhanger seemed a step down from what you expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you that the season opener ... might possibly go
some way toward helping you a little bit with the last few minutes
of the season finale.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlamme said he though those disappointed with the finale
``will be really happy when they see the next episode.''
</P>
<P>
   In the show's next two hours you will see flashbacks dealing
with each of the key characters (including Sheen, who initially was
slated to appear in only a handful of episodes).
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) gives Aaron an opportunity to go back and see how these
people got together,'' said Bradley Whitford, who plays deputy
chief of staff Josh Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin, who also wrote the late, great ABC dramedy ``Sports
Night'' last season, is notorious for blowing deadlines but
delivering brilliant scripts at the very last moment in a burst of
inspiration. That was not the case for last season's final episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the one moment in the entire season that I planned
ahead, that wasn't written on the fly,'' he said. ``I knew how I
wanted to begin this season, and I knew how I had to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin said his idealized version of the White House caught on
with viewers because ``there is a certain amount of
wish-fulfillment on the show.'' Although some conservatives have
been upset with the liberal-leaning tendencies of the show
(Republicans Marlin Fitzwater and Peggy Noonan, both veterans of
GOP White Houses, have joined Democrat Dee Dee Myers as
consultants), Sorkin said everyone across the political spectrum
longs for a government that tries to do the right thing for the
right reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite initial critical acclaim _ it was universally
hailed as the best new show of the season last fall before its
debut _ ratings were weak at the start. ``We didn't think we were
going to make it,'' Sheen said. ``It took weeks and weeks and
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   And now ``The West Wing'' is the best hour on television each
week. Hopefully, at least for the season premiere, it will be the
best two hours.

   SAN ANTONIO _ A bronze howitzer shell of the same type fired on
the Alamo in 1836 by Mexican troops is scheduled to go on exhibit
at the Alamo Gift Museum on Saturday as part of Texas
Archaeological Awareness Month.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden fuse and gunpowder removed from the shell as well as
other items left behind by the Mexican army after the Battle of San
Jacinto also will be on display, Alamo historian Bruce Winders
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first opportunity for the public to see artifacts
associated with events of the Texas Revolution,'' Winders said.
``Many of these things were very common then but are very rare
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrated in October, Texas Archaeological Awareness Month is
coordinated by the Texas Historical Commission in association with
the Texas Archaeological Society and the Council of Texas
Archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
   As part of archaeological awareness, ``Fall at the Alamo,'' an
interpretation of life during the Republic of Texas period, will be
held Oct. 21 at the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   The Alamo's observance of the monthlong awareness begins
Saturday with a presentation by Dr. Gregg Dimmick of Wharton.
Dimmick is scheduled to speak on ``The Mar de Lodo,'' or ``Sea of
Mud,'' at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. (CDT) at Alamo Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sea of mud is where the Mexican army got bogged down for
nine days,'' said Dimmick, a pediatrician and avocational
archaeologist who has been excavating for several years with
friends near the Wharton area in South Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always enjoyed archaeology and used to do some
excavations but hadn't done any until I began reading the history
of our area and realized the Mexican army had come through here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dimmick said he believes the Mexican army was not retreating but
regrouping and waiting for orders from the central government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our local mud was the final blow to the Mexican army,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the discoveries, including remnants of a Bowie knife, a
Spanish-style horseshoe, some musket parts, buttons, buckles and a
crossed-belt plate, have been made near the Middle Bernard River
near East Bernard.
</P>
<P>
   Dimmick's group has access to about 8,000 acres of rice fields
in Wharton County, where many discoveries have been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some rice fields are available to us only every three years,
so we can't really do traditional archaeology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Winders said both collections will be on loan and on exhibit at
the Alamo for several more years to come.

   Olympic stories from The New York Times News Service for
Saturday, Sept. 30:
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BKO-MEN (Sydney, Australia) _ In a game that came down to
the final shot, the United States edged Lithuania 85-83 Friday
night to reach the gold medal game. By Mike Wise.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BKO-WOMEN (Sydney, Australia) _ Lauren Jackson leads
Australia to its first appearance in a gold-medal game, where
Jackson and the Aussies will finally get their Olympic wish: a date
with Lisa Leslie and Team USA. Before nearly 15,000 of their
chanting fans, Australia beat Brazil, 62-54. Jackson's 16 points
and 9 rebounds leading the way. The United States struggled early
against South Korea before rallying for a 78-65 victory. By Mike
Wise.

   OLY-BKO-ARATON-COLUMN (Sydney, Australia) _ Sports of The Times
Column on the men's basketball team's narrow victory over
Lithuania. By Harvey Araton.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-TRACK (Sydney, Australia) _ Marion Jones stood on the
runway. This was her sixth and final long jump. She crouched and
swung her arms, then she leaned back and hopped slightly and began
her final, urgent sprint toward history. Her form on the runway was
awkward as usual. She looked like exactly what she was, a sprinter
trying to master the long jump. No other woman possesses her speed,
however, and when Jones landed with a sandy jolt she was 23 feet,
maybe even 24 feet, from the takeoff board. She had hoped for one
big jump, and this was it, clearly the longest of the competition.
But was it legal? Jones turned and hoped to see an official waving
a white flag, but it was red. The gold medal went to Heike
Drechsler, the last of the former East German champions. By Jere
Longman. And perhaps the biggest upset of the Olympics occurred in
the men's 1,500 meters when Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco lost to
Kenya's Noah Ngeny in 3:32.07.

   OLY-RHODEN-COLUMN (Sydney, Australia) _ Sports of The Times
Column on Marion Jones' struggles and ultimate failure in the long
jump. By William C. Rhoden.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-SOC-VECSEY (Sydney, Australia) _ Sports column on the end of
an era in women's soccer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-FIELD-HOCKEY (Sydney, Australia) _ The Hockeyroos are
Australia's wildly popular field hockey team. And by the end of
their 3-1 victory _ after the Hockeyroos had dismantled their
opponent's will with their deceptive stick skills, opportunistic
scoring and aggressive attack _ they were free to enjoy the buildup
to their gold medal. By Selena Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BOX (Sydney, Australia) _ In the most exciting,
highest-scoring bout of the competition, Ricardo Williams Jr. beat
Cuba's Diogenes Luna 42-41 Friday night for a berth in the
139-pound final. By Bill Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-TV-EBERSOL (Sydney, Australia) _ Dick Ebersol, the chairman
of NBC Sports, insists that he is not depressed about
lower-than-expected ratings, nor is he frantic to change anything
to resuscitate them. He is astonished at criticism that he is
carrying the Olympics on tape from 15 to 18 time zones away and
won't carry live events at 4 or 5 in the morning. By Richard
Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-IMPACT (Sydney, Australia) _ They call Australia the lucky
country, and there may be no better example of its good fortune
than the unexpected windfall Sydney is reaping at the end of these
Olympics. Thanks to a steep drop in the value of the Australian
dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, the broadcast rights earmarked
to the Sydney Olympic committee have risen in value by about $28
million. By Mark Landler.
</P>

   OLY-SOC-MEN (Sydney, Australia) _ Chile beats United States,
2-0, to win the bronze medal. By Peter Berlin.

Olympic gold. By George Vecsey.

&HT;     BORDER PATROL EXCEEDS RECRUITING FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DANE SCHILLER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The U.S. Border Patrol says cyberspace and an
emphasis on recruiting helped it double the number of new agents
from last year.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of some 900 agents brings the patrol's size to
9,061 _ the largest in its 76-year history _ but it is still
scrambling to meet a congressional call for 10,000 agents by this
time next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been a remarkable turnaround,'' Immigration and
Naturalization Service spokesman Sid Waldstreicher said from
Washington. ``We far exceeded what we thought we would be able to
hire.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 40,000 people _ 80 percent of the patrol's
prospects _ applied over the Internet as the agency posted want ads
on its Web site and a dozen other sites dedicated to sports,
minorities and employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to call them the millennium generation, this is
how they are recruited,'' Waldstreicher said.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Internet, applicants answer questions ranging from
educational background to willingness to pay relocation expenses.
The patrol also is branching out with ads in movie theaters and on
television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to marketing, the patrol has assigned 200 agents to
recruiting duty. This week, a recruiting team is visiting military
personnel in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning agents earn from $25,000 to $35,000 per year,
depending on experience, and must be based along the U.S.- Mexico
border.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 900 agents joined the agency during the fiscal
year that ends Saturday, compared with about 400 last year,
according to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   The increase occurred as the patrol, a branch of the INS, which
itself is part of the Justice Department, is competing with a
healthy economy to meet a five-year congressional mandate to become
of force of 10,000 agents by October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said the INS has dragged its feet recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, head of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on immigration, said the Clinton administration has
taken too long to make the Border Patrol a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they did better this year and that is progress,'' Smith
said. ``But they have been pulled along kicking and screaming for
the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he would introduce legislation next year to continue
to increase the strength of the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are still shifting agents around depending on
the latest pressure point,'' he said. ``I don't think there is
anybody that would argue seriously we have enough now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, who was chief of the patrol's
McAllen and El Paso sectors before being elected to Congress, also
said the patrol needs to do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize the outstanding efforts and
success of the Border Patrol this year, but let's not overlook the
fact that they have failed to hire the amount of agents mandated by
Congress over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem areas along the border, the areas that are still
not under control, are a direct result of the INS' inability to
follow through on (a) congressional mandate,'' Reyes said.

 &HT;    FBI takes computer from Bush media firm
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FBI agents have taken the office computer of an employee of
George W. Bush's campaign media firm as investigators stepped up
efforts to figure out who mailed Bush debate preparation materials
to an Al Gore dviser.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett told the Austin American-Statesman
today that Yvette Lozano's computer was voluntarily turned over to
the FBI late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, FBI agents told Lozano they had seen a Post Office
surveillance videotape showing Lozano mailing a package on Sept.
11, two days before the debate preparation materials arrived at the
office of former U.S. Rep. Tom Downey of New York. She said she was
mailing clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked if we would volunteer the information and we said,
``Yes.''' Bartlett said today. ``We have said all along we want a
full and complete investigation and we hope this helps bring it to
a quick conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear why the FBI wanted the computer and
officials with the federal law enforcement agency declined to
comment today.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano is an administrator for Maverick Media, whose sole client
is the Bush campaign. The package, bearing an Austin postmark,
included a videotape of a Bush debate preparation session. At the
time, Downey was playing the part of Bush in Gore's debate
preparation sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano and Mark McKinnon, head of Maverick Media, have said she
was at the Post Office on Sept. 11 to mail pants McKinnon was
returning to the Gap. Lozano and McKinnon also have said FBI agents
doubted the pants alibi, and said they beileve someone in the Bush
campaign might have mailed the debate materials to Downey as part
of a Bush campaign plot to have the upcoming debates postponed or
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has dismissed that theory as ridiculous.
Lozano and McKinnon have denied any role in the mailing of the
debate preparation materials.
</P>
<P>
   The first debate is set for Tuesday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign believes the debate preparation materials were
stolen and mailed to Downey.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE DEBATE MAKES NOISE, BUT NO CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It sounded like a dramatic gesture. Al Gore,
seizing on a suggestion from Republican Senator John S. McCain,
this week promised to order the Democratic Party to stop
advertising financed by unregulated ``soft money'' if George W.
Bush would deliver the same message to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, left out two crucial details: His party has
already spent much of its soft money, and his ban wouldn't affect
union spending, where he has a big advantage over Bush. In other
words, analysts said, Gore's proposal would leave him with a large
financial advantage, perhaps in the tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a point when Democrats have spent most of their soft money
and have most of their (regulated) hard money left, Al Gore throws
down the gauntlet,'' scoffed Ellen Miller, president of the
nonpartisan Public Campaign, which advocates overhaul of campaign
finance laws. ``It is a crass political decision.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Bush campaign declared the proposal dead on
arrival, demonstrating once again why campaign finance deals
offered in the heat of the contest are often not what they seem to
be. In a year when campaign finance overhaul was a major topic of
the primaries, the general election campaign is being flooded with
twice as much unregulated soft money as the last election,
according to the Common Cause advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   While the Gore proposal so far has gone nowhere in the
presidential campaign, it does follow two similar, and similarly
dramatic, moves in Senate races. Earlier this week, Democrat
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Rick Lazio agreed to stop
their parties from running soft money ads in their New York Senate
race. Then Maria Cantwell, the Democratic candidate for US Senate
in Washington, unilaterally pledged to tell her party to stop soft
money ads in her state, although her challenger, Republican Senator
Slade Gorton, has not agreed to a ban. Cantwell's move, however,
comes after she has spent $5 million of her personal fortune on the
race.
</P>
<P>
   But those moves in New York and Washington are minor compared
with the prospect of a ban on soft money ads in the presidential
campaign. The money that was designated for soft money ads in those
two states is now simply being poured into other contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is, can any political party these days
decide not to use money it has already collected?'' said Larry
Makinson of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which
tracks money and campaigns. ``It is inconceivable to me that they
could do that. If they decide not to use it in the presidential
campaign, what are they going to do, put it in a bank account until
2004?''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, such proposals are often unenforceable. In the 1996 US
Senate race in Massachusetts, Senator John Kerry and then-Governor
William Weld agreed to a $500,000 limit on the use of personal
funds. But each campaign wound up accusing the other side of
violating the agreement. Kerry won the race and there was no
mechanism to penalize a breach of the cap, which was an agreement
between two candidates and was not enforceable by the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd twist to the Gore proposal, the vice president made
the suggestion after it was first proposed by McCain, the Arizona
Republican, who earlier this year made campaign finance his top
issue against Bush in the primaries. While McCain now is
campaigning for Bush, the Bush campaign Thursday was livid that the
senator made a proposal that seemed to work in Gore's favor.
Thursday, McCain further upset the Bush campaign by telling the
Associated Press that he was sorry that Bush did not accept the
challenge to stop using soft money. ``I feel it was a mistake on
his part,'' McCain said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, along with Democratic Senator Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin, wrote in a Wednesday letter to the Bush and Gore
campaigns that a ban on soft money would help both candidates
attract new supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are able to reach such an agreement, we believe that
voters will take note of your leadership and react favorably to
your support for better, fairer elections,'' McCain and Feingold
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign ignored McCain's authorship of the proposal,
saying in a statement that Bush would look forward to working with
McCain ``to pass meaningful campaign finance reforms.'' The Bush
campaign said that Gore was making the proposal in an effort to
paper over his own ``history of disregard of campaign finance
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, president of Common Cause, said he hopes Bush
calls Gore's bluff and accepts the ban on soft money. But
Harshbarger said it is sad that the candidates accept the use of
soft money in the first place. Harshbarger is one of several
campaign finance activists who have sued the Federal Election
Commission over the use soft money, arguing the campaigns are
illegaly supplementing their campaign coffers by using the party's
soft money on campaign-like advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Harshbarger, ``at least it is an indication of the
political legs of this issue. The public cares about this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Bush campaign sees it, Gore is mainly hoping to give
himself an issue to exploit in Tuesday's presidential debate in
Boston. Gore not only is expected to chastise Bush for failing to
agree to the ban, but the vice president also is expected to point
out that he backs the McCain-Feingold campaign finance legislation
while Bush does not.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a proposal that has been sharply criticized by McCain,
has proposed banning corporate and labor soft money but would
continue to allow individual contributions. As a result, there
would be nothing to stop the flood of individual donations from
corporate and labor chieftains and others that often exceed
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a rather large loophole,'' Makinson said.

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ As the Western allies, led by the United
States, support the stirrings of democracy in Yugoslavia, ethnic
Albanians here are worried that the West's enthusiastic embrace of
any successor to Slobodan Milosevic will kill their dream of an
independent Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With Kosovo's first postwar elections looming next month, there
is increasing pressure on Kosovo's feuding politicians to behave
more like democrats, and for ordinary citizens to turn their backs
on the racketeers who control an overnight market economy that has
turned much of the province into a gold-rush town.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Koha Ditore, the newspaper read by most ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, ran a satirical piece suggesting that a statue
of Milosevic be put up in the center of Pristina because his
repression had done so much to spawn a separatist movement here.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposite may be true: If Milosevic goes, the raison
d'etre of Kosovo independence could go with him.
</P>
<P>
   It was the desire of many ethnic Albanians to break free from
Yugoslavia that indirectly led to the war in Kosovo. After a decade
of repression at the hands of Milosevic, who summarily stripped
Kosovo of its autonomy in 1989, the Kosovo Liberation Army
separatist group sprang from the ethnic Albanian community that
makes up 90 percent of Kosovo's population of 2 million. The
separatists took potshots at Serbian police in what observers saw
as a calculated attempt to provoke Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's crackdown against the KLA, especially the
indiscriminate killing of civilians and the hundreds of thousands
of refugees who fled the Serbian scorched-earth policy, led to
NATO's 78-day war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While Serbia suffered under Western sanctions for a decade _
punishment for Milosevic's serial warmongering in the Balkans _
Kosovo, since the end of the war in June 1999, has enjoyed the
advantages of being a United Nations protectorate, and the $300
million a year spent by the UN to prop it up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, with Serbian challenger Vojislav Kostunica
appearing to have a chance to oust Milosevic, and with the United
States and the European Union promising to ease sanctions and help
Yugoslavia if Milosevic goes, ethnic Albanians fear their struggle
will be quickly forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Veton Surroi, the publisher of Koha Ditore, is among those who
are wary of Kostunica and of the West's enthusiasm for him.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Kostunica has echoed Milosevic's rhetoric that
Kosovo must always remain part of Serbia, Surroi describes the
possible change of power in Belgrade as the replacement of ``a
nationalist of opportunism . . . by a nationalist of conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   But others suggest Kostunica's nationalist rhetoric during the
campaign was calculated so that Milosevic was not able to portray
him as being soft on Kosovo and, by extension, afraid to stand up
to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Louis D. Sell, a former US diplomat in the Balkans, said that in
private discussions, Kostunica reveals himself to be more open to
the idea of restoring Kosovo's autonomy. While Milosevic responded
to the demand for a return to automony with brutal, murderous
repression, Sell says, Kostunica displays a more pragmatic streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kostunica would consider autonomy for Kosovo.
Milosevic wouldn't even discuss it,'' said Sell, who is now the
Kosovo director for the International Crisis Group.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is home to the battlefields where the Serb nation was
formed, and to Orthodox shrines that many Serbs hold dear. Sell
suggests that Kostunica knows that the best way to keep Kosovo part
of Serbia is to allow ethnic Albanians to run the province where
they make up an overwhelming majority, thereby removing any need,
aside from sheer nationalism, to establish an independent Kosovo.
Milosevic's response, to throw Albanians out of government jobs and
close their schools, only bred resentment and support for
independence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sell believes ethnic Albanians here ``have not realized what the
Kostunica phenomenon means to them,'' and have been caught
unprepared by the depth of the popular opposition to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   He said the dream for independence, which never enjoyed much
sympathy in the international community, would have even less if
Kostunica takes power and steers Yugoslavia back into dialogue and
trade with a world that, aside from a handful of Serb sympathizers,
regarded Serbia under Milosevic as a rogue nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sell said Kostunica's reasonable approach toward autonomy would
also push back the demands for independence coming from Montenegro,
the republic that with Serbia forms Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Ilir Gashi, a 23-year-old housing contractor who describes
himself as a veteran of the Kosovo Liberation Army, like nearly
every young man here, said he does not trust Kostunica and does not
think the Western allies should either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a Serb, and you saw what the Serbs did to us,'' said
Gashi. ``America should not be fooled by Kostunica. He would have
done the same as Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kostunica was a withering critic of NATO's bombing of
Serbia and defended the government's crackdown on Albanian
separatists. But Kostunica's defenders say he is also someone who
would not have sent death squads to massacre civilians in Kosovo,
as Milosevic did, according to his indictment for war crimes by the
international tribunal at The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, United Nations officials say they hope the march
toward democracy in Serbia will serve as a wakeup call to ethnic
Albanians here who have shown ambivalence, at best, toward the UN's
call for them to unconditionally support democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Pristina, where an anything-goes atmosphere out of the
Wild West prevails, racketeers control many of the businesses,
legitimate and otherwise, that have sprung up since the end of the
war. UN police, preoccupied with preventing the revenge killings of
the 100,000 or so Serbs left in Kosovo, look on helplessly as
former KLA members shake down restaurant and cafe owners.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls suggest that the most popular politician in Kosovo
is Ibrahim Rugova, a pacifist whose party has been derided and
physically attacked by the political wing of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   UN officials and Western diplomats have made no secret of their
wish to see Rugova's party prevail in next month's local elections,
which will mark the first legitimate test of political opinion
here. Western diplomats remain skeptical of the commitment shown to
democracy by the former rebels and their political leader, Hashim
Thaci.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA's reputation was not enhanced this week when some of its
supporters threw eggs at candidates from Rugova's party at a rally
in Lipjan.
</P>
<P>
   As one UN official put it, speaking on condition of anonymity,
some ethnic Albanians have got to start acting ``more like
Kostunica's supporters and less like Milosevic's.''

RUST SPOTS STAIN THROUGH REPAINTED CAST IRON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October   1, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. It took a week to strip the cast-iron baseboard radiators,
but they came out very well. When I applied a latex enamel
undercoater as a primer, a few rust spots showed up. I don't think
I should paint over the rust spots, but what can I do?
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA McGURL, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. What you can do is take this lesson to heart: Never paint
steel, iron, tin ceilings, or other ferrous material with latex
paint, at least as a primer. The water in the paint will cause the
rust spots.
</P>
<P>
   So, what else you can do? Sand the finish to remove those rust
spots, but you do not have to take off all the latex undercoater.
Apply an oil-based primer and finish with an oil- based enamel.
Actually, if you use an oil-based primer you can finish with a
latex paint, but I do not suggest it.
</P>
<P>
   You can paint brass, copper, stainless steel, and aluminum, but
since the first three are good looking by themselves, why bother?
Painting aluminum with latex primer and paint is A-OK.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am putting in a new shed in my backyard. I am concerned
about excessive heat buildup in summer. Can I insulate walls and
roof to prevent that heat buildup, and to allow it to cool off at
night?
</P>
<P>
   P.H., Cyberspace
</P>
<P>
   A. Insulating the shed will do nothing for preventing heat
buildup in summer, or letting it cool off at night. The only way
you will get any cooling is with ventilation. If the shed has a
gable roof (two slopes), install a ridge vent. Also, if the roof
overhangs the walls to form an eave, ventilate the soffits, too
(the underpart of the overhang). This air circulation will keep the
shed as cool as the outdoor air, generally. And, of course, keep
windows and door open when it is very hot, or when you are working
in it. The ventilation will also allow rapid cooling off at night
by automatically releasing air.
</P>
<P>
   Insulation is effective only when the interior space is heated,
because insulation slows down the passage of heat from indoors to
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. One of my long, bluestone outdoor treads has cracked, after
five years. The treads were mortared in place and neither part of
the cracked tread moves. Can I fill the crack, which is hairline,
with anything to keep it from getting bigger? I am concerned that
water will get in the crack and freeze and expand, making
everything worse.
</P>
<P>
   GERTRUDE MORRIS, West Roxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is something you can try, although the treatment is
designed for concrete and other masonry, not actual stone. But it
is worth trying, and you might become a pioneer in fixing cracks in
stone.
</P>
<P>
   Use Thompson's Water seal, Drylock, or any other masonry or tile
sealer. Brush it on the crack (you don't have to do the whole
surface), let it dry overnight, and brush on some more. Repeat this
as often as possible. Eventually the sealer will bond with the
stone and may seal the crack. Because it is liquid, it will take a
while for the bonding to be effective. This treatment is unlikely
to work on anything much bigger than a hairline crack.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I put water-cleanup stain on my deck three years ago.
Recently I put on an oil-based semitransparent stain. Now the deck
is tacky in some spots, and some spots are shiny, others are not.
What happened and what can I do?
</P>
<P>
   KERRY REYNOLDS, Norton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You put on the new stain too soon, and it did not penetrate
the old stain, leaving some places shiny and tacky. I think you
should have waited at least five years for the old stain to wear
off, and since it is protected by a roof, it probably wouldn't have
worn off even then.
</P>
<P>
   To correct the situation, apply paint thinner liberally to the
deck, let it sit there for five minutes to dissolve the tacky
parts, scrub and rinse. Wtih luck you might flatten out the shiny
parts and dry up the tacky parts. If that doesn't work, you will
have to use chemical paint remover.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, when you apply any stain (and semitransparent
stain is the only type to use), try it on a small area; if it beads
up there is still some stain or sealer on the deck. If it
penetrates, then you can do the deck.

LOOK AT BNL IS A FAN'S DELIGHT, AND NOT MUCH ELSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
Barenaked in America 
Directed by Jason Priestley 
Starring: Jim Creegan, Kevin Hearn, Steven Page, Ed
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robertson, Tyler Stewart &QL; 
Running time: 90 minutes &QL; 
Rating: Not rated &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's apropos that this documentary about the Canadian pop band
Barenaked Ladies opens with comedian Jon Stewart riffing on the
random collision of history and music. ``Imagine if France had
won,'' he muses. ``There would be no Barenaked Ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   Glib humor is a huge part of BNL's massive appeal, second only
to the band's endless supply of infectious hooks. The film,
directed by ``Beverly Hills 90210'' alum and fellow Canadian Jason
Priestley, aims to capture both with a well-balanced melange of
performance footage, backstage and tour-bus antics, shots of
singer-guitarist Ed Robertson on the toilet, and interviews with
band members, fans, non-fans (an ingenious inclusion), and an
assortment of celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Shot during two weeks on a 1998 tour to promote BNL's
breakthrough album ``Stunt,'' ``Barenaked in America'' won't be
included alongside ``The Last Waltz'' or ``Spinal Tap'' in the
annals of classic rockumentaries. It doesn't immortalize a
transcendent performance (a term that may well be an oxymoron for
an easygoing band like BNL) or offer a compelling window on the
members' interior world. On the contrary, insights run more along
the lines of which ``Sesame Street'' character each of them
identifies with.
</P>
<P>
   In deference to devotees, we'll leave that mystery intact.
Suffice it to say Barenaked Ladies prove to be exactly the bright,
funny, very nice guys they seem to be in song and on stage, which
is, no doubt, the way their audience would want it. That's a good
thing, because it's hard to imagine anyone other than BNL fans will
be captivated by this good-natured slice of band life. Happily for
the filmmakers there are legions of them out there, especially in
Boston _ dubbed ``Barenaked Central'' in the film _ one of the
cities where concert footage was shot.
</P>
<P>
   News broadcasts describing the overflowing crowds at City Hall
Plaza are included, as are now-familiar concert rituals: the
tossing of Kraft macaroni and cheese, the raucous chanting of
``pants off for a thousand bucks!,'' and the full-band parodies of
unison dance moves. In one vintage bit, BNL hangs in front of the
White House, asking tourists if they've heard of them. An early
video of ``Be My Yoko Ono'' made at a public emporium called
Speaker's Corner _ with all the band members trying to cram their
faces into the tiny frame _ is one of many trips down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious note, keyboardist Kevin Hearn's battle with
leukemia is documented in detail during interview segments, and his
poignant return to the stage after a stem-cell transplant marks one
of the most gratifying musical moments in this sweet, if slight,
chronicle.

SOME TECH STOCKS RUNNING INTO A BUZZ SAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Uncle!
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has owned technology stocks knows you should be
strapped in and ready for some tough portfolio twists and turns
with those investments. But this year is turning out to be
extraordinarily hard on a large number of Massachusetts high-tech
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   What's remarkable in 2000 is the number of well-known names with
once-sizable stock market values that have been absolutely
hammered. The same trend has played out across the entire tech
stock market, erasing many billions of dollars of value.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at some of the Massachusetts companies that have
lost three-quarters or more of their stock market value this year,
a level of decline that usually befalls a handful of speculative
micro-cap stocks and one or two bigger companies in the midst of
epic-scaled business meltdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Allaire Corp., a well-known Newton company that sells
Web development software, have plunged more than 88 percent since
the start of the year. A company worth nearly $2 billion in January
was valued at $236 million this week.
</P>
<P>
   We can point to at least seven others (there are many more) in
the same league. They include Akamai Technologies Inc., one of the
hottest initial public stock offerings of 1999, which is down 85
percent this year, and CMGI Inc., the Andover Internet incubator
turned Web operating company that has plunged 78 percent so far in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The stock declines of CMGI and Akamai combined have vaporized
about $60 billion in market value.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of the tech stock decline across Massachusetts
involves companies that once attached themselves to the buzz of the
Internet in one way or another. Typically they rose on the story of
some Web specialty, such as e-commerce or Internet consulting, and
took a beating when investors turned their backs on an industry.
</P>
<P>
   Internet consulting? Look no further than Boston-based Viant
Corp. (down 87 percent), Cambridge Technology Partners Inc. (down
81 percent), or even Sapient Corp. of Cambridge (down 41 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Generally, local Internet commerce companies have fared even
worse, though they haven't lost so much money. Mothernature.com
Inc. of Concord is down 88 percent. Rowecom Inc. of Cambridge has
lost 91 percent of its value so far in 2000. Down 75 percent this
year is a Needham firm, Smarterkids.com Inc., which raised $63
million by selling a piece of the company in an IPO last November.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these companies have not performed badly, but investors
have lost faith in the rosy long-term assumptions required to
justify the stock values placed on hot technology sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've seen since then is indiscriminate selling of those
same'' stock stories, said Dale Dutile, a Boston-based comanager of
MFS Emerging Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   Throw millions of new shares entering the market, thanks to the
expiration of lockup restrictions on insider investments at
companies that recently went public, and it only adds more pressure
on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai stock was already struggling this year when 58 million
more shares were unlocked for possible trading. Who knows how much
that hurts, but it surely doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   The question now: Where do those tech stocks go from here?
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund manager Fred Kobrick likens the spiral to the grim
investing environment of 1990, when worries about confrontation
with Iraq sent stock prices tumbling. ``I think the same thing will
happen,'' he said. ``We'll go normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick meant that a long series of investing momentum trends,
which tend to push stocks in a particular industry higher as a
group, would finally give way to pricing based more often on
individual merit.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to many of the stocks that have been hammered this
year, some money managers mince no words and say they had it
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a lot of those numbers and think it's a long overdue
correction of excesses,'' said Steven Demirjian of Westfield
Capital Management in Boston. ``This was such a big part of the
market last year, I don't think you can minimize what's happened
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone acknowledged at the time that many technology stocks
were being bid up in a bubble of investment euophoria. It should
come as no suprise that the price declines have been drastic, now
that the inevitable correction has taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an unusual period of speculation and indiscriminate
buying,''said Dutile, the MFS manager. ``That's different than
saying you had big companies blowing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had small companies that people were ascribing huge market
capitalizations to, and that's reversing,'' he said. ``The
underlying fundamentals of many of these companies never changed.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make it any easier to watch.

   Tommy Reamon sits behind the desk on a day that is still more
summer than fall, talking about a season already played.
</P>
<P>
   Reamon has done this before. He is good at it. His days as a
running back at Missouri, as a wannabe actor who had a fling in
Hollywood and minor parts for a few years, including a role in
``North Dallas Forty'' _ his character was named Delma Huddle.
</P>
<P>
   But his role now is bigger, more important. He plays it with
more passion, too.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to get to Michael Vick, if you want to backtrack and
find out where it all started, you come here, to the head football
coach's office at Warwick High School.
</P>
<P>
   Reamon talks easily about the past _ and the future. He has
played a variety of roles with his former player. Mentor, father,
adviser, friend. Pick the day, pick the subject, and Reamon can
recite his lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw Michael was in seventh grade,'' said
Reamon, sitting back in his chair. ``He was just different. There
was something about him that seemed special.''
</P>
<P>
   Reamon says this knowing the outcome of the story _ or at least
as far as his role was concerned. ``It was down the road at
Ferguson High School in August of his freshman year,'' Reamon said.
``It was the first time I saw him throw a ball. I just said, `Wow.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He then came up to me and said, `Coach, I want you to make me
as good as Aaron Brooks.' '' Brooks was one of Reamon's former
players who went on to play at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Reamon laughs. As good as Aaron Brooks? Three years after
leaving high school, two years into his college career, and 10
months into a new role as the prototype quarterback of the future,
Michael Vick has gone way past what Aaron Brooks did.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
One name says it all &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback who will start for Virginia Tech Saturday
afternoon against Boston College at Alumni Stadium has made the
quantum leap into that gray area where the persona is bigger than
the person.
</P>
<P>
   Where one word is enough for recognition, like when you talk
about golf and you only need to say ``Tiger'' to know the subject.
Where, if the discussion is basketball, you just say ``Michael''
and people know.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vick is starting to feel the power of that, of being
part of the select _ and sometimes difficult _ world of a Tiger
Woods or a Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   All of it changed in New Orleans last January when Vick and the
Hokies fought a losing shootout with Florida State for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   FSU won the game _ and the national championship with its 46-29
victory _ but Vick won something more, something on such a large
scale that Vick still can't comprehend it.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the 323 yards of total offense. It was his style.
His flair. It was play after play of ``can you believe that?'' type
of football. So much so that a few days after the game, Vick was
back in Virginia with his buddies, watching a taped replay of the
game, and even he was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did some things in that game,'' said Vick, ``and I said to
myself, man, what was I thinking. How did I do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick says this sitting in an office of the newly renovated
football complex Virginia Tech has in Blacksburg.
</P>
<P>
   He is no longer Michael Vick, of course. ``My life has changed
in dramatic fashion,'' said Vick with a shrug. ``But I'm ready. I
take it in stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's tough. He can't go out to eat anywhere in
Blacksburg anymore without being besieged. At Tech's annual fan day
festivities this summer, there were two lines for autographs. One
for Vick and one for the rest of the Hokies _ with the line for
Vick nearly doubled that of his teammates, stretching nearly the
length of a football field.
</P>
<P>
   Vick is clearly uncomfortable with that aspect of his fame.
``We're trying to make him feel as normal as possible,'' said Tech
coach Frank Beamer, who obviously has a vested interest in a happy
and contented Michael Vick. ``But he's kind of refreshing. He
hasn't changed. It's the people around him who have changed. He's
still a team guy. He likes to compete. And the more at stake the
better he is. He responds to competition. He responds to
challenges. He needs to continue to develop. There is more for him
to learn at the college level.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-ranked Hokies bring their 3-0 record to Boston
College. Vick has completed 26 of 44 attempts for 412 yards, or a
59.1 percent completion rate. He has rushed for 219 yards and three
touchdowns on 25 carries.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A double life &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things are so much different now. The Hokies are no longer the
little school that could. And Vick may have an ``S'' underneath his
game jersey, but he also has a target on it.
</P>
<P>
   Get Vick and you get the Hokies is the game plan of the week.
</P>
<P>
   And Vick is leading two lives _ as a football player and as a
celebrity. He is one person, but there are two sets of rules, of
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Tech has tried to make things easier. Sharon McCloskey, a senior
associate athletic director, has filled the role of watchdog for
many of the outside activities and queries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he sat down and did everything people asked of him,'' said
McCloskey, ``he wouldn't have time to do anything at all. We try to
make sure that nothing interferes with his class time and with his
football. We've tried to tell him that his image is as important as
what he does on the football field. He can make more money from
endorsements than he will playing if he keeps the right image.''
</P>
<P>
   McCloskey says Vick has approached that aspect of his career the
way he prepares for a game. ``He absorbs a lot, like when he plays
football,'' she said. ``He goes out and reads defenses and figures
out what he is going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick knows what it's all about. ``I don't get a big head,'' he
said. ``I don't feel that any great pressure is on me. I'm going
out and playing football for me and my team. I don't think I have
to show what I can do or that I can top last year. I feel I'm
handling it in the right way. I feel I can be successful and do the
right things.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick says the attention, the notoriety, the loss of privacy
haven't affected him. ``I've enjoyed my life,'' he said, ``even
though it has changed. I want to make the most of it, while I have
a chance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He first got an up close and personal look at the change when he
was invited to ESPN's annual award show last winter. ``That was
different,'' he said. ``I felt out of place there. Mark McGwire,
Peyton Manning, and Michael Irvin. I'm there with all those big
shots and they were coming up to me and saying, `Hey Michael, how
are you doing. We enjoy watching you play.' It made me feel like a
marquee player.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Humble beginnings &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bright lights couldn't be any further from where Brenda
Boddie is this late summer afternoon. She is at Gildersleeve Middle
School in Hampton Roads, waiting to take her annual physical _ just
like all the bus drivers in the Hampton Roads school system.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Boddie is 37. Her life is one of routine. Driving a bus,
taking care of her family. She is also Michael Vick's mother,
although she is and looks young enough to be his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this person on the field,'' said Boddie, who was a high
school cheerleader and a mother at 16. ``But he's still my little
boy. Something like that is scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vick has a younger brother and an older sister. His
father, Michael Boddie, has only recently come back into his life,
perhaps the reason Vick chose to use his mother's maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Vick says his father wasn't around early in his life, but things
have gotten better. It has been Brenda and Tommy Reamon who were
his early anchors. And those anchors remain strong to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advice I give him,'' said Brenda with a wistful smile. ``I
tell him no kids, no drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Reamon is more forceful. He has been part of Vick's daily life
since he made the bold move to start him as a freshman in high
school over a more experienced senior. ``I said, `Michael, I'm
throwing you to the wolves.' He got creamed the first game, but he
worked at it and worked it. It was an introduction to the real
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Reamon has worked at keeping the wolves at bay. It
was Reamon who cut a deal with Beamer and Virginia Tech. Vick would
only go to Tech if he would be allowed to redshirt his freshman
season.
</P>
<P>
   After flirting with lots of colleges, including Florida State,
Syracuse, and Virginia, which was heavily courting Vick's main high
school rival, Hampton QB Ronald Curry (who went to North Carolina),
Vick chose Tech because of Beamer and the assurances that he would
not play as a true freshman.
</P>
<P>
   It was a true test of faith for Beamer, who saw three QBs go
down with injuries in fall 1998, but didn't budge on activating
Vick. ``He showed me something there,'' said Reamon. ``To his
credit he stayed with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Reamon is surprised at the rapidity of the climb Vick has
made. ``I always thought he would be great, but I didn't think it
would happen this fast,'' he said. ``The Sugar Bowl changed
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Reamon continues to prepare Vick for the changes yet to come.
Agents are already a problem, although Vick and Reamon and Brenda
have made it clear that if an agent contacts him now, it will mean
certain elimination. ``I've talked to him on how to be in front of
the camera,'' said Reamon. ``I want him to make the right choices.
I said to him, `You are now a product. Your private life is over.
You cannot get caught up in this stuff.' He needs to understand
it's a business now.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick has heard the words. He says he understands what it's all
about. A year ago at this time, people were just learning his name.
He could walk on campus and not many people would bother him. He
was just another redshirt freshman QB with big ambitions. He says
he had a master plan when he started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would go to college,'' he said. ``The first season
I would learn, the second season I would get better, and the third
and fourth seasons things would take off. Now things are happening
real fast. Things happened a little quicker than I thought. I think
of the difference between last year and now and it's amazing.
Everything is totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   He is asked about the future beyond this season _ which could
very well be his final collegiate season. ``In 10 years,'' he said,
in answer to a question, ``I see myself in the NFL, maybe finishing
up my career, having a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he comes back from the future with the quickness of one of
his passes. He understands he can't do it all or try to do it all.
``Sometimes I feel like I have to make a play, go for it all, but
sometimes you can't do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he focuses again on his goals, on his dreams. The dreams
that Brenda has for him, the hopes Tommy Reamon has for him. The
dreams he has for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' he said, ``it's right there for me. I just have
to go out and get it.''

   It's been a rough day, and you want to unwind. You sit down and
want to tune the radio to something relaxing. Should you pick:
</P>
<P>
   -- New age music?
</P>
<P>
   -- Classical music?
</P>
<P>
   -- Easy listening?
</P>
<P>
   -- Acid rock?
</P>
<P>
   You're absolutely right! There is no wrong answer to this one,
say researchers at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in the March 2000 issue of International
Psychogeriatrics, they compared the emotional effects of classical
music with various other genres selected by listeners.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the listener-selected music was always the
most relaxing to the person who chose it _ even if it was acid rock
or a marching band.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Her grandfather was a slave turned freedman, her father
a Baptist minister turned college president, and she an aspiring
musicologist turned Realtor before stumbling into the world of
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The part-time job Anna Faith Jones took so she could spend more
time with her children turned into a passion and a career, and
Jones became the successful and widely admired president of the
Boston Foundation, increasing its endowment from $100 million to
nearly $700 million over 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the 68-year-old Jones, doyenne of the nonprofit world
in Boston and a prominent figure in reshaping local philanthropy,
said she will retire at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was the first African-American woman to head a community
foundation in the country, and has become a prominent leader of the
philanthropic world nationally, serving as chairwoman of the
Council on Foundations, a national group.
</P>
<P>
   Under her leadership, the Boston Foundation has been transformed
from a small but venerable institution to the region's dominant
local grant giver. And the foundation has just finished its best
year ever, benefiting from a new generation of philanthropists
seeking to give away money earned in the booming technology and
financial services industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a quintessential example of the person who helps to
connect those with resources to those who have needs, and she
brings to that a deep respect for the strengths of both parties,''
said the Rev. Ray Hammond, pastor of Bethel AME Church in Boston.
``She never saw poor or disadvantaged communities as being without
assets, and she always worked to develop those assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also steered the foundation, which is focused on helping
the poor, toward supporting the arts and the environment. She
argued that poor people need cultural enrichment as much as anyone,
and the organization has pushed elite arts institutions to do more
for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have real dollars that make real differences in people's
lives,'' said Mark Volpe, managing director of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, who called Jones ``one of the most highly regarded
leaders in the philanthropic world.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Boston Foundation supported the first Boston
Pops concert in the city's Franklin Park; the foundation also
supports a program at which artists-in-residence at the Isabella
Stewart Gardner Museum work with schoolchildren. In one recent
instance, the artists helped a group of Boston fifth-graders
compose an opera inspired by a Renaissance painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gardner does not have this kind of work endowed, so we are
dependent on grants,'' said Anne Hawley, the museum director.
``They have enabled this program to continue and thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the foundation gives the bulk of its money to educational
and social service organizations, and, unlike national foundations,
its charity largely stays within the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Jones said she decided to retire in
part because she has become a victim of her success _ in the
process of growing the Boston Foundation, her job has become
increasingly administrative and managerial, and she misses a more
active personal involvement with causes she cares about.
</P>
<P>
   She said she expects to spend her time volunteering for a
handful of causes _ she cited the Kettering Foundation, which
studies democracy around the world, and the NAACP legal defense
fund as examples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've accomplished what I want to accomplish, and the job
itself is moving into a direction where most of the demands are
such that it doesn't engage my passion,'' Jones said. ``I will
follow this passion (for helping the poor), but it will be more
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Central to the foundation's ability to come to the aid of so
many has been Jones's successful transformation of the
organization's finances and its mission.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation had long been hamstrung by an antiquated
financial structure that by 1998 left it underperforming in the
rocketing stock market. Over the last two years, however, the
foundation has diversified its portfolio, hired a broad array of
managers, dramatically increased the percentage of its assets in
stocks, and, as a result, has seen its endowment grow more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation now is facing intense competition from companies
such as Fidelity Investments, which is offering to manage the
charitable activities of its wealthy clients. In response, the
Boston Foundation has been a leader in a new form of active
philanthropy, popular among the newly rich entrepreneurs, in which
donors retain an active role in determining the distribution of
money managed by the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston Foundation struck me as having a unique combination
of being august and innovative, and it's a pretty compelling choice
when you add that together,'' said Thomas W. Bird, a Boston venture
capitalist who made his money with a technology company in Silicon
Valley and then chose the foundation to help him give part of it
away when he moved to Concord. Bird wanted to give to educational
causes, and the foundation helps him find specific organizations
that interest him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking to be actively involved, with some professional
guidance. What's great is you get a partner in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation gives away about 5.5 percent of its endowment
each year _ an amount that totalled $53 million last year. The
group also gives many small grants to small organizations _ it had
1,900 beneficiaries last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her gender and ethnicity, Jones is seen as an
inspiration, particularly for black women, in a city not known for
the diversity of its power structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me personally, having Anna Faith Jones as one of the
first, if not the first, African-American women in a major
leadership role in this city, has provided me with a role model,''
said Linda Whitlock, president and chief executive of the Boys and
Girls Clubs of Boston. ``She's been a guidepost for me in my
role.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation board plans a national search to find a
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of the Fort Point Channel neighborhood of Boston,
Jones said she wants to spend more time with her grandchildren, and
to begin a project researching her family history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here because I wanted a part-time job, but now I think
I'm missing my grandchildren, and I want to spend more time with
them,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Get two nights of good sleep in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Eat right for two days straight; nothing spicy, no shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   Clear the decks. Put off what can be put off. Concentrate. Spend
two straight days with the briefing books, run through one last
practice round versus the stand-in. Then chill the last day. Turn
on the Olympics. Go for a walk somewhere quiet. Watch a movie. Take
an afternoon nap.
</P>
<P>
   Then go in there and tear the other guy's face off. In a nice
way, of course. Be, in the following order: calm, relaxed,
resolute, informed, knowledgeable, humorous, self-deprecating,
baleful to those who'd threaten America, and, incidentally, don't
forget to ask people for their vote, respectfully.
</P>
<P>
   Got that?
</P>
<P>
   It's all you need to know about how to win a presidential
debate. The one Tuesday night in Boston is the most important event
of the campaign. About 40 percent of the voters are firmly for
George by now, roughly the same number are just as strong for Al,
period, and the debate is about which fellow closes the sale with
11 of the remaining 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And fellas: no props. Please!There's nothing cheesier than one
politician playing ``gotcha'' with some shopworn manifesto or some
airy-fairy pledge-to-ban-soft-money-or-bad-breath.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mistake to be over-prepared and come across stale.
Ronald Reagan and Michael Dukakis both made this mistake. In 1984,
Reagan was forgetful and out of synch against Walter Mondale in
their first debate. Afterward Reagan chief of staff Jim Baker
claims the Gipper's own entourage had ``brutalized'' him with their
over-thorough prep work. And Dukakis, feverish and hoarse the day
he debated Bush in 1988, clicked into automatic pilot when Bernie
Shaw asked the infamous question about the candidate's wife being
hypothetically raped and murdered. The Duke regurgitated his
memorized anti-capital punishment speech, without appropriate
indignation about the premise.
</P>
<P>
   This advice applies to you both, men. You can't be too
aggressive, too nervous, too uncertain. George, don't use words you
can't pronounce, unless you work in ``subliminal'' as a joke, after
you've practiced it 50 times.
</P>
<P>
   Al, your off-camera line at the MTV audience taping worked well:
``Have you heard I invented the environment?'' You know you have
the ``stiff'' problem. The only two words that should be scrawled
on your dressing room mirror are: ``Lighten up!''
</P>
<P>
   George, you know Gore is going to try to trip you up with
complexities about the federal establishment and foreign policy.
Back-pedal away from details wherever you can. Details are not your
game. Themes, Dubbaya, themes!
</P>
<P>
   Al, you have more experience in this sort of thing than the
other guy. But look what happened with that ferocious Russian
Greco-Roman wrestler who hadn't lost a point or a match in 13
years. Be on guard. You should not be too condescending, too
critical, too mean to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   George, you're going to be asked to justify things you've said
about Gore. ``I just don't trust him,'' for instance. Jim Lehrer
will be sure to ask if that means you're calling him a liar. You
better have a set explanation handy.
</P>
<P>
   Al, you're going to have to send some kind of
I'm-not-Bill-Clinton message. You know that. Your wording better be
just right, so that it puts some insulation between you and
you-know-whom, but doesn't dis Bill, whose economic record is the
best thing you've got going for you.
</P>
<P>
   George, you know you're going to hear the old Gipper line, ``Ask
yourself this question: Are you better off today than you were four
(eight?) years ago?'' Since the answer is demonstrably ``yes!'' for
a large proportion of the population, you'll probably have to come
back with some sort of ``Yeah, but . . .'' response that gets into
what you call ``the education recession.'' Because there ain't no
economic recession, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Al, the GOP game plan is to brand you a lying exaggerator. It
would help to have a list of the nasty things the GOP has put out
about you, then ask Bush to rein in his attack dogs.
</P>
<P>
   George, you did an excellent job of playing the wounded innocent
after your guys hatcheted John McCain all over South Carolina, New
York, and Michigan. Gore is going to pose a bit more of a problem
when you take refuge in your ``Who, moi?'' act. Be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Al, you've gotten more mileage out of picking Joe Lieberman as
No. 2 than George has with Dick Cheney. Try to work plenty of Joe
(the Anti-Clinton) Lieberman into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   A final word to both you: break clean, and above all, avoid low
blows. The guy who goes negative loses swing voters in swing
states.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the thoughtful moderates in Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Missouri, and Wisconsin. What'll they think about something I'm
about to utter. Nice wins, usually. But you can't let the other guy
push you around. Strong, but nice; that's the ticket. To the White
House.

`LIGHTWEIGHT' BUSH LOVES THE LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one enjoys the dumbing down of George W. Bush more than
George W. Bush. Everywhere he looks, foes and friends, comedians,
and sober historians cite his butchery of English and his blank
stares on current affairs as if he would be the first president who
would fully utilize the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   In a routine about Bush's governance of Texas, comedian Jay Leno
said, ``They executed a guy with an IQ of 63. Can you believe it?
Bush turning his back on one of his own!''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lemann wrote in The New Yorker that Bush would ``come
to the presidency with a lighter resume than anybody has had in
least a hundred years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seinfeld'' producer Larry David, a supporter of Bush's rival,
Al Gore, said Bush is ``making it possible for a lot of idiots like
myself to actually consider running for office.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Bush columnist Michael Kelly wrote that the need for Bush is
so bad that ``the country can afford a 40-watt president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush the person may not like this, but Bush the politician is
eating this up.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has practiced all year for the presidential
debates, he is still joking that he still loses his mock battles
with Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. Appearing on ``Oprah,''
Bush played up his awe of being at Phillips Academy in Andover and
``how brilliant all the other kids were.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox TV's Paula Zahn and MSNBC's Brian Williams have asked Bush
what he thinks of critics who label him ``dumb'' and
``lightweight.'' Bush has responded:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them. You know, if that's what they want to say, they can
say it. But guess what? I was underestimated in 1994 and became
governor of the second biggest state in the union.''
</P>
<P>
   He has said, ``I take great comfort in the fact that they said
the same thing about President Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the thing to remember before the debates between Bush,
the Republican presidential nominee, and Gore, the Democratic
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has already turned lightweight into heft. The first debate
is here in Kennedyland, and presidential biographer Richard Reeves
favorably compares Bush's position to John F. Kennedy's advantage
against Richard Nixon in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're almost totally similar,'' Reeves told CNN. ``Kennedy,
we forget now, was seen as a kind of likeable lightweight against
the vice president of the United States who seemed to know
everything about everything. I think that there are real parallels,
except that, in this case, Bush is Kennedy and to a certain extent,
all he has to do is show up and not faint and people will say he
did fairly well.''
</P>
<P>
   That happened in 1994 when Bush ran for governor against popular
incumbent Ann Richards. Richards sat too high on her horse,
flinging barbs that irritated even the tart tongues of Texas. She
likened Bush to a ``jerk,'' and used other diminutives to paint
Bush in Lilliputian terms. ``If his name wasn't Bush,'' Richards
said, ``He wouldn't amount to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In their only debate, Richards pounded on Bush, saying he sat on
the boards of five companies that lost $371 million. Bush stayed on
a shallow but consistent theme that was resonating throughout the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Richards said, Bush responded with a mantra of
``welfare, education, and juvenile justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush waited until Richards wore out Texans with her attacks. At
one point during the debate, a questioner from the audience said to
Richards, ``I personally feel that we've heard enough about it in
the campaign.'' So had Texans, who elected Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Paul Begala, the political strategist who is Gore's
coach on debating Bush, both swear that they are not
underestimating Bush. That is hard to believe when Begala has
recently written that Bush has ``all the intellectual curiosity of
a slug'' who is ``worse than dumb, he is lazy. He does not read; he
does not ponder, he does not study, and this is much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Daley, Gore's campaign chairman, said, ``Bush has got to
hit some pretty dramatic doubles, triples, and home runs. Singles
won't do it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   That cockily assumes all Bush can hit is singles. With such
piling on, the nation will be pleasantly shocked if Bush can even
stagger from the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is set. Gore has to worry about being seen as too
bright. All Bush has to do is bring his 40 watts. Digging at Gore's
aura of intellect, Bush said, ``We need less planners and
thinkers.'' Bush is hoping Gore will turn off voters with too much
brain. If so, the dim bulb that blinded Ann Richards could be on
his way to becoming a nite lite in the Oval Office.

LIEBERMAN A HOT TOPIC AS ROSH HASHANA BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rabbi Daniel Judson will be eating his words this weekend, and
perhaps he should be eating his yarmulke.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, Judson stood before his congregation and
scoffed at the leaked list of potential Democratic vice
presidential candidates, predicting that Vice President Al Gore
could not choose Senator Joseph I. Lieberman to be his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said there would be no way they would nominate Lieberman,
and I actually said I would eat my `kippah' if they did,'' Judson
said, using the Hebrew word for skullcap. ``Almost every member of
my congregation agreed with me.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, as Jews gather to celebrate Rosh Hashana, Judson
will again be before his congregation in Canton, Mass., but this
time he'll be seeking to draw moral and historical lessons from
Lieberman's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Judson, like rabbis in synagogues across the nation, will be
addressing the same fundamental questions: What does Lieberman's
nomination and his public and proud proclamation of his faith mean
for American Jews?
</P>
<P>
   Not since Egypt and Syria invaded Israel on Yom Kippur of 1973
has there been such broad consensus about what to talk about in
synagogues during the High Holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible for a modern rabbi not to address this
during the High Holiday season, because it has become clear that it
is an epochal event in American Jewish history,'' said Rabbi Noam
E. Marans of Temple Israel in Ridgewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Judson, rabbi at Temple Beth David in Canton, will suggest that
the positive reaction to Lieberman's nomination reflects a decline
in anti-Semitism in the United States, while the apparent
acceptance of his religiosity offers an opportunity for American
Jews to rethink their views on public expressions of Jewishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question is, `How come the Jews thought there was no way
they were going to do it, but the Democrats did it?' '' Judson
said. ``We have overestimated the level of anti-Semitism in this
country, and we need to re-evaluate our sense of where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Many rabbis will be focusing on Lieberman's religiosity, which
runs counter to a secular trend in American Jewish life.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at this level of possible power has been as Jewish as
this Jew,'' Marans said. ``Does his role-modelling break the
stereotype that somehow Jews who are completely immersed in their
Judaism are at a disadvantage in climbing the secular mountain?''
</P>
<P>
   Most rabbis will be combining those themes, suggesting that the
Lieberman nomination is a chance to reflect on the attitudes of
America generally, and American Jews in particular, toward Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our wider society is expressing more than a passing curiosity
in traditions that an un-identified Jew had long since dismissed as
antiquated and irrelevant,'' said Rabbi William Hamilton of
Congregation Kehillath Israel in Brookline, Mass. ``All of a sudden
America seems to respect the Jewish way, so what's an un-identified
Jew to do?''
</P>
<P>
   One of Lieberman's own rabbis, Barry Freundel of Kesher Israel
in Washington, will also choose this theme, saying ``he (Lieberman)
challenges those who assume Jews can't really be comfortable in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The High Holidays _ Rosh Hashana, which marks the start of a new
year in the Jewish calendar, and Yom Kippur, which is the day on
which Jews atone for sins against one another and against God _ are
the most stressful points of a rabbi's year, because many more
people show up at synagogue to mark those holidays than on any
other occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Christians come for Christmas and maybe for Easter,
Jews tend to come for the High Holidays,'' said Rabbi Ruth Alpers,
a professor of practical rabbinics at Hebrew Union College, the
seminary for Reform rabbis. ``In many congregations, High Holidays
are the one chance rabbis have to reach the most number of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis often agonize about High Holiday sermon topics, with some
attending workshops for ideas, or waiting until the last minute to
choose from a number of alternative speeches they have prepared.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, ``Gore took care of all of us rabbis by
selecting Senator Lieberman,'' said Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   In numerous interviews about their sermons, rabbis repeatedly
compared Lieberman to baseball players Hank Greenberg and Sandy
Koufax, both of whom drew attention for their refusal to play ball
on Jewish holidays. Lieberman has refused to to campaign on the
Jewish sabbath, and he is taking time away from his campaign this
weekend to celebrate Rosh Hashana at his synagogue in New Haven and
next weekend to mark Yom Kippur, most likely at his synagogue in
the Georgetown section of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But rabbis said the nomination of Lieberman is the first truly
American event to be of such broad interest in the diverse Jewish
community, which previously has coalesced largely around issues
involving Israel. (Many rabbis this year will also give sermons
that touch on the Middle East peace talks, and some will touch on
topics from ``Survivor,'' a hit television show, to ``Jew vs.
Jew,'' a new book on Jewish factionalism in the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all rabbis will be talking about Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, home of Republican presidential nominee George W.
Bush, Rabbi Steven Folberg of Congregation Beth Israel and Rabbi
Martin J. Pasternak of Congregation Agudas Achim will both be
talking about other subjects. Bush has close ties to the Jewish
community in Austin, where some leading Republicans are Jewish and
where Bush has been known to show up at a Passover seder on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reason is I'm not really sure that there's an
ultimate religious message in Lieberman's candidacy that is weighty
enough for these days in which people are hungering for a spiritual
message and at a time when I have the largest audience of the
year,'' Pasternak said. ``But my second reason is that I'm in
Austin, Texas, and I've got Republicans out there (in the
congregation). I don't want to endanger my status with them as a
rabbi, so that they might feel uncomfortable with me or not come to
me because politics is such an emotional issue.''

&HT;     OLYMPIC DYNASTY ENDS FOR USA 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     By GWEN KNAPP

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ An American Olympic dynasty ended on Friday,
and it didn't involve a basketball, a softball or any of the usual
paraphernalia filling sporting-good stockrooms from Bangor to
Carlsbad.
</P>
<P>
   The synchronized swimming team, which had won a gold medal at
every Summer Games since the event joined the Olympic program in
1984, finished fifth. On Wednesday, the American duet had finished
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   After a poor showing in the technical routine Thursday, the
Americans hadn't expected to move into the gold-medal spot, but
they were disappointed in their scores for the free routine. The
judges gave them mostly 9.6s for technical merit and 9.7s for
artistic impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our sport, it seems like sometimes it's very poorly
called,'' said Anna Kozlova, who emigrated from Russia in 1993 and
became an American citizen, in time to compete for her new country.
``Since the U.S. has been on top for a long time, people are very
happy to pull them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozlova trains with the Santa Clara, Calif., Aquamaids. The
entire U.S. team belongs to either the Aquamaids or the Walnut
Creek, Calif., Aquanuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian team won the gold, and Kozlova watched unblinkingly
while the swimmers received their medals. She said she knew four
members of the championship team. Kozlova had been one of Russia's
top synchro swimmers, and she surely would have been on the podium
had she not emigrated.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she had any regrets, Kozlova said quietly but
firmly: ``I have everything I want.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians swept both the duet and eight-woman team
competition. They scored perfect 10s from four of the 10 judges,
including the one from Japan, whose own team was in second place,
waiting to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very strong and very flexible,'' said American coach
Chris Carver.
</P>
<P>
   She praised the Russians for being able to lift their legs
extremely high above the surface when they did the synchro
equivalent of a handstand. She also said they moved quickly between
figures and held steady, barely quivering when they rose out of the
water.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians did an exceptional lift, boosting a teammate out of
the water on their legs. The Americans also did an assortment of
demanding lifts, boosting Kristina Lum up into crowd-pleasing
poses.
</P>
<P>
   The routine that really thrilled the audience, though, was the
Canadians' depiction of various Olympic sports. They came out last,
wearing simple costumes that looked like old-fashioned track
outfits, completely devoid of sequins.
</P>
<P>
   To the ``Chariots of Fire'' theme, the Canadians entered the
water out of a runners' starting crouch. They lifted teammates
posing as a cyclist with legs spinning, an archer, and a pair of
judo fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The routine didn't have the same degree of difficulty as others,
but it was good enough for bronze.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans performed to a medley of classical music,
including Vivaldi's ``Four Seasons,'' and acted out the life of a
storm. Their costumes were black with a picture of Father Winter,
blowing a cold burst of air, silk-screened on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans believed they tried one of the most difficult
routines in the program, partly because they stayed underwater for
3 1/2 minutes of the 5-minute program. But Carver conceded that the
judges probably considered the Russian performance even more
difficult. The Japanese, she said, delivered a lovely routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan, to me, is very decorative, very much like their
culture,'' she said. ``You know how beautifully they present their
food. That's how they do their synchronized swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's technical program, the Americans ran into trouble
immediately. One swimmer miscounted underwater and did an early leg
lift, about two beats ahead of everyone else. The judges put the
team in fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty hard to overcome,'' Carver said.
</P>
<P>
   So the women had to be content with a free routine that many of
them considered the best they'd ever done. One woman left the pool
with a small fist pump, and Carrie Barton and Elicia Marshall did
their traditional wave to the crowd, pounding their hearts and then
raising a peace sign.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Pease-Olson, a returning member of the 1996 team, said
she saw her husband, Eric, after the program, and he put the best
spin on the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `At least, it (the error) didn't happen today,'' she
said. ``So you know you had a recovery you can all feel good
about.''

BRONCOS A LINE MODEL

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Before and after. Best and worst. Night and
day.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' offensive line and the Denver Broncos' offensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have a line Bill Belichick covets and he can only
hope his current group of nomads develops into something resembling
it.
</P>

   The Denver line is so good it has made former Marine Mike
Anderson a star running back. It's so good Brian Griese has had
enough time to accumulate the best passer rating (116.2) in the
league. Yes, even better than St. Louis Rams wonder Kurt Warner's
111.9.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got some athletic people on the line and I think
they're well-coached,'' Belichick said. ``Alex (Gibbs) is an
excellent offensive line coach, there's no question about that.
They play with real good continuity and they've been able to keep
the same people together through a period of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure about all the stats, all the weights and
everything. I coached Tony Jones at Cleveland and Tony's good, a
Pro Bowl left tackle, but he's no 275 pounds. I can tell you that
having coached him, he's no midget, he's as big as most left
tackles in the league. However big that is, that's plenty big
enough. And Matt Lespsis is no midget either. Whatever their size
or weight, they function well together as a unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs may be the most effective assistant coach in the NFL. He's
done his job quietly. In fact, he's had a policy of not speaking to
the media. His players normally have respected that and kept quiet
as well. Only at certain designated times _ when players face
$10,000 fines for not being accessible to the media at the Super
Bowl _ have some of the players chosen to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also have an offensive line coach, Dante
Scarnecchia, who doesn't speak to the media (usually because he's
not allowed to). Unfortunately it hasn't worked for him. At least
not yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos epitomize strong line play, and they do it with
quickness and intelligence. That's not to say they aren't big and
strong, but as Belichick points out, ``When you get five guys
thinking as one and playing as one you see very few mistakes within
the group where they miss somebody or they turn a guy free or you
can see there is a missed assignment. And that's very, very rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs's system is so flawless that when he lost Gary Zimmerman
and Brian Habib, he plugged in Dan Neil at right guard and Lepsis
at right tackle and didn't miss a step. All-Pro center Tom Nalen, a
product of Boston College, is the anchor and seems to reflect the
temperament of the whole. The Broncos' line has an attitude that it
won't get beat and prides itself in opening gaping holes, be they
for Anderson or Olandis Gary or Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Who are these guys?
</P>
<P>
   Mark Schlereth, 6 feet 3 inches, 287 pounds, has had 25
surgeries and one kidney stone procedure in 12 NFL seasons. He's
started 136 games and has spent six seasons with the Broncos. He
was a 10th round pick out of Idaho and joined the Washington
Redskins in 1989 as the first Alaska-born player in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 6-5, 291, is in his 13th year out of Western Carolina. He
was a rookie free agent pickup by the Browns in 1988 and has spent
the last four years with Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Nalen, 6-3, 286, is his seventh year, all with Denver. The
Foxborough native was a seventh-round pick (218th) overall out of
BC in 1994. He's played in three Pro Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Neil, 6-2, 281, out of Texas, was a third-round pick in 1997 by
Denver and already has established himself as one of the best
guards in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Lepsis, 6-4, 290, is in his fourth year out of Colorado. He was
signed by the Broncos as a rookie free agent in 1997. He started
all 16 games at right tackle last season and is now a fixture.
</P>
<P>
   With no 300-pounder in a day and age when every other line has
some if not all players at 300-plus pounds and some pushing 400,
how do the Broncos do it? The approach is not dissimilar to what
Belichick was trying to build in Cleveland, basically taking guys
who weren't drafted very high and developing them into quality
players. Belichick is trying to do this now with recent
acquisitions Sale Isaia and Joe Andruzzi to go along with a star
like Damien Woody, who was a No. 1 pick, veteran Bruce Armstrong,
and free agent pickup Grant Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil is another guy who was a low draft pick,'' said
Belichick. ``They had to wait a year for him because he couldn't
play because of an injury. Now he's a starting guard and he's a
good player. Lepsis is another guy, you can see him developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have come along and they've developed them and the
players have worked hard and the system has pushed them and it's
brought them together. They've got a good football team and they've
done it over a period of time and I think that's the test, being
able to do it year in and year out.''
</P>
<P>
   While Belichick has been disappointed in the play of his line,
he has seen some improvement. He has second-round pick Adrian Klemm
(knee injury) waiting in the wings, and Greg Robinson-Randall, who
is getting his feet wet this season and will likely step into a
starting role by next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots allowed 12 sacks the first three games and only
five the last two weeks (conversely the Broncos have allowed eight
sacks in four games). Running back Kevin Faulk had a pair of
80-yard-plus games before being held to 46 last week, when the
holes just weren't there. The Broncos' defense is ranked fourth
against the run, which means the Patriots' offensive line will be
tested again.
</P>
<P>
   This is Week 5 of the new Patriots' system. It is Year 7 for
Nalen and his Bronco gang. Denver's great line wasn't born
overnight, but it's flowing now. One wonders if the Patriots' line
will ever be that good.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Rod Beck still watches the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we were eliminated,'' he says, ``I'd still be watching
the scoreboard. There's a little fan in all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   And every day this week, when Beck has looked back, he sees the
same thing. Yanks lose. Yanks lose. Yanks lose. Yanks lose.
</P>
<P>
   Four games in a row. They lost to the Tigers Monday, then were
swept by the Devil Rays in Florida. Ten losses in their last 12
games. The Bombers had a nine-game lead Sept. 13. They were 7 1/2
games ahead 12 days ago. Five and a half games ahead with eight
left to play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're 3 1/2 ahead with four to play. One Yankee win or Sox
loss, and it's over.
</P>
<P>
   It should have been over a long time ago. It ain't over yet.
Friday, while the Sox are in St. Petersburg to play the Devil Rays,
the Yankees go to Baltimore, where they have to face Mike Mussina,
who struck out 15 batters in seven innings Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On NESN, broadcaster Jerry Remy is joking about bus tours to
Florida being organized all over New England. Prediction: Another
Yank loss and a Sox win against the Devil Rays, and the Delta
counters at Logan Airport in Boston will be jammed.
</P>
<P>
   On Yawkey Way this morning, they'll be lining up extra help to
work in October. Just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the damnedest thing I ever saw,'' said Beck, who
was the winner in relief Thursday night when the Sox completed a
three-game sweep of the White Sox, the team with the best record in
the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to say stranger things have happened,'' Beck said,
``but I don't know if anything stranger has ever happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope it plays out that way. The only way it can happen
is if we win out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox won with Carl Everett, Dante Bichette, Jason Varitek,
and Jose Offerman on the bench. They won with starting pitcher
Ramon Martinez recording two more hit batsmen than outs (0).
</P>
<P>
   They won with Izzy Alcantara hitting a three-run home run on a
3-and-0 pitch. They won despite a monster home run by Frank Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   They won with Derek Lowe on the mound once again to register the
final out, for his 41st save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still alive,'' Lowe said with a laugh. ``We're still on
life support, OK, but we live for another day. You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks are 87-71. The Sox are 84-75. If the Sox sweep the
Devil Rays this weekend and the Yankees lose three in Baltimore and
a makeup game against the Florida Marlins Monday, a one-game
playoff will be necessary. Where will it be played?
</P>
<P>
   Don't know. It was such an unlikely scenario, they never
bothered to flip a coin to determine where such a playoff would be
held. Sox spokesman Kevin Shea said Major League Baseball informed
the Sox a coin flip will be held only if and when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the Yankees are thinking,'' Lowe said, ``but
sometimes winning one game is tougher than it seems. There's only
one thing for us to do, and that's win every game. Tampa has been a
tough customer. They've pretty much owned us the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox hadn't lost five games in a row all season until
the Red Sox came to town. Roger Clemens, one of the hottest
pitchers in the game since mid-June, was clocked early by the Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams sat in the visting manager's office with a bemused
expression on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just got to try to keep winning,'' he said. ``We're going to
play a team that's hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez thought his season was over. Sox win Friday and
Saturday, Yanks lose both days, Petey's back in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   It's ridiculous. It's preposterous. It will never happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see us get this thing down to Sunday,'' Lowe said.
``It would just be something, having to come down to the last game
of year when we were 5 1/2 back with eight to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck, who was on a Giants team in 1993 that won 103 games and
didn't go to the playoffs and was on a Cubs team that had to win a
playoff game against the Giants to advance in 1998, was asked if he
would cut off his hair if it happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens, it will be because of the hair,'' Beck said.
``If it happens, everyone will have to grow their hair long.''
</P>
<P>
   He ran his hands across both sides of his receding forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``And shave their power alleys, too,'' he said.

FOR EBERSOL, OLYMPICS BET IS PAYING OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not easy being a sugar daddy.
</P>
<P>
   But Dick Ebersol doesn't seem to mind. The NBC Sports chairman
convinced his bosses at General Electric to spend $3.5 billion for
the next four Olympics, and the Sydney games _ the first under the
deal _ has generated so much criticism and ridicule about
everything from the dwindling TV ratings to dope stains on gold
medals, that a lesser man would have folded soon after the Opening
Ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Not Ebersol. Not the man who claims his one passion _ outside
his family _ is the Olympics, a flame that started in 1972 when the
Yalie dropped out of school to work as an intern in Munich for
network sports guru Roone Arledge.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Dick has not been happy with his critics and the
ongoing taped-versus-live debate. Oh sure, Ebersol would have loved
for the American gymnasts to have performed better, but he can't
control the athletes. He called sports editors ``fools'' and the
live coverage by Canadian Broadcasting ``a colossal joke.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the fact is that the ratings for these Games are off by
as much as 35 percent from those in Atlanta. Ebersol readily
concedes that he has been unable to deliver on his guarantee to
advertisers of a 16.1 minimum rating. As a result, NBC already has
had to add a ``make good commercial'' each hour during the Games
and will add more commercials to NBC's upcoming broadcasts of the
Major League Baseball playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Ebersol quickly points out that Olympics coverage is still
smoking the competition. For Tuesday's prime-time broadcast (8-11
p.m.), for instance, NBC drew a 13.5 rating/21 share, which was 80
percent above the network's normal average of 7.5 rating. NBC's
prime-time numbers more than tripled Fox's (4.4/7); more than
doubled CBS's (4.8/8) and was 73 percent better than ABC's 7.8/13.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research further reported that NBC's 12-day
Olympic prime-time average was 15.7/25, some 227 better than Fox,
191 percent over CBS, and 134 percent better than ABC.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty clear that having the Olympics in this age of
fragmentation _ even when the results are known and the coverage is
taped _ still provides a big advantage over the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Games' top markets are in the Mountain and Pacific
time zones, including Salt lake City, San Francisco, Sacremento,
Portland and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have repeatedly said the tape delay would not be a major
issue for most Olympic viewers,'' Ebersol told reporters in Sydney.
``The Western markets where the time difference is the greatest _
including Seattle, where they have the option to watch the Olympics
live before the sun comes up on CBC _ are the highest rated cities
in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol told the New York Times that the CBC strategy was ``so
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We compete with the CBC in Seattle,'' Ebersol said. ``In prime
time we are averaging a 20 rating there, and for the same events in
the early morning, it's getting a 0.6. When 100,000 people out of
32 million watch, it's a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol has acknowledged that NBC underestimated the competition
in September when viewers have a choice betweeen baseball and
football. Ebersol also told reporters that he plans to shorten the
five-hour prime-time telecasts by at least 30 minutes during the
Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   But Ebersol makes no apologies. ``My No. 1 job is to deliver the
largest audience possible,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is just as clear. NBC sold about $900 million
worth of advertising. The Sydney games cost $705 million. You do
the math.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sizing up Patriots &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CBS analyst Phil Simms wouldn't be surprised if the Patriots
pulled an upset in Denver. He said the team has played hard in each
of its four games, and though the Patriots have lost every one, the
team ``doesn't have any glaring weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he also said ``they won't make the Super Bowl, and even
if they make the playoffs, they won't be a factor. They haven't
been able to come up with big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the former NFL quarterback, some of that is
coaching, but most of the problem lies in the hands of the players.
In the game against the New York Jets, Simms said the Patriots
played an almost perfect game and still lost because the Jets were
able to come up with the big plays when they needed them.
</P>
<P>
   Simms and Greg Gumbel will call Sunday's game in Denver. If the
Patriots lose, Simms said Bill Belichick will have to reevaluate
his team and make plans for the future. ``The big question facing
the Patriots is whether to make drastic changes or tweak the team
here and there,'' Simms said.
</P>
<P>
   The most important factor is Drew Bledsoe. Unlike previous
years, Bledsoe has been plagued by a weak offensive line and an
even weaker running game. Under those circumstances, Simms said,
Bledsoe must be more efficient and able to convert the few
opportunities he has into big plays. Bledsoe hasn't been able to
get it done.
</P>
<P>
   And when the offense is not producing, Simms said, ``defenses
have little to fear and become much more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much do you think the Patriots miss Curtis Martin?'' Simms
asked.

`OLD AMERICAN' IS CAPTIVATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
The Old American 
By Ernest Hebert 
Hardscrabble Books/University Press of New England, 287 pp.,
$24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the first American bestsellers were the ``captivity
narratives'' _ part adventure stories, part morality tales _ that
gave accounts of the capture of colonial settlers by Native
Americans. The best-known come from the New England frontier during
the century between the outbreak of King Philip's War in 1675 and
the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, a hundred-year period
during which some 1,200 men and 400 women were taken captive.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Rowlandson's account of her capture during a raid on
Lancaster during King Philip's War went through four printings
during the year after its publication in 1683. Cotton Mather wrote
three dramatic accounts of the capture of Hannah Dustan during a
raid on Haverhill in 1697, and her escape after killing and
scalping her captors. The narratives _ however straightforward or
dramatized _ led to a whole series of novels dealing with Indian
captivity that appeared during the 19th century, by authors such as
James Fenimore Cooper and Catherine Maria Sedgwick.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Hebert's ``The Old American'' stands firmly in this
near-forgotten tradition. It is a great story, convincingly and
colorfully told, though it tails off a bit toward the end _
perhaps, as was the case with so many of the captives themselves,
the story loses interest when the captivity comes to an end.
Hebert's tale is based on the story of Nathan Blake, who was taken
prisoner during a raid on Keene, N.H., in 1746 and was ransomed by
his wife three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, a professor of English at Dartmouth College, is best
known for a series of novels dealing with contemporary New England
life. His accomplishment in ``The Old American'' is to have written
about the people on both sides of the frontier conflict with the
benefit of contemporary insights into the relationships between
captives and captors (relationships frequently seen in hostage
situations) without losing a sense of the historical time and
place.
</P>
<P>
   In Hebert's fictionalized account, Blake is taken captive by an
aged Algonkian chieftain with the Franco-Indian name of
Caucus-Meteor and taken to a Native American village near Montreal
after successfully surviving the gauntlet _ by choosing to walk,
rather than run. A friendship between Blake and his captor
develops, which allows Blake to become Caucus-Meteor's confidant
and, eventually, a partner in his efforts to secure the future of
the village after his death. In a historical note, Hebert says that
the marriage of Blake and Caucus-Meteor's oldest daughter _ which
may seem a novelist's invention _ has its basis in the fact that
the real Blake was elected head of the family after his captor's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Caucus-Meteor is, of course, ``the old American'' of the title _
the early settlers initially called the native people
``Americans,'' as Hebert notes. It is part of Hebert's
accomplishment that his insight into the thinking of his Indian
characters at a time of cultural transition is generally credible.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert's account of a tribal gathering to debate whether the
village should abandon its nomadic traditions and create a
permanent farming community is a stunningly effective bit of
storytelling. ``The speeches go on and on,'' he writes, ``and a
mood of fear and desolation grips the villagers. For the first time
they understand how divided they are. It begins to look like the
Americans are going to split into two groups and go their separate
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   While the focus of Hebert's tale is the captor-captive
relationship, one particularly striking incident involves Blake and
another captive who had survived the gauntlet with him _ an
incident that suggests why so many captured settlers either
remained with their Native American captors, or recalled their
period of captivity as a happy time in their lives. After the
gauntlet, the two had been taken by different tribes; when they
meet several years later at a trading camp, ``they have difficulty
communicating.'' Neither speaks the other's Indian language, and
neither knows more than a few words of French. It is not until
later that Nathan tells Caucus-Meteor, ``Neither I nor Sam thought
to speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old American'' is an admirable book and deserves a place
among the classic tales based on the frontier captive experience.

ARNOLD TO FLEX GLOBAL MUSCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the purchase of its parent company by Paris-based Havas
Advertising SA earlier this week, Arnold Communications is poised
to emerge as a global ad agency, Ed Eskandarian, its chairman and
chief executive, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Arnold has evolved in the last decade from a small
regional agency to a national player. And now, ranked as the
18th-argest ad agency in the United States and the largest in New
England, it prepares to pursue international ambitions as part of
the fourth-largest ad agency in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're entering the third stage of Arnold's lifetime,'' said
Eskandarian. He will now head a division of nine Havas-owned ad
agencies, including Arnold, with other home offices in Brazil,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold was a small Boston ad agency when Eskandarian bought it
10 years ago. Through acquisitions, Arnold quickly grew into a
regional powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   By Eskandarian's reckoning, Arnold entered its second stage in
1995 when it emerged as a national player by winning the ad account
for Volkswagen of America.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Drivers wanted'' campaign for VW has won much acclaim. It
was hailed again Thursday when it took top honors at the Hatch
Awards, which salutes the best creative efforts of New England ad
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold looked to be on its way to becoming a global player in
1998 when it was acquired by Snyder Communications Inc., a direct
marketing firm based in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The sale allowed Eskandarian, now 63, to cash out his investment
in Arnold. And Snyder seemed to offer a potential platform for
Arnold to broaden its reach.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for Eskandarian to use Snyder's high-flying stock
price to finance a string of ad-agency acquisitions that would give
Arnold both bulk and scope.
</P>
<P>
   Then the value of Snyder's stock plunged, and founder Daniel
Snyder became focused on a new business _ the ownership of the
Washington Redskins, a National Football League team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock took a tumble, and acquisitions were put on hold,''
Eskandarian said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Havas Advertising announced plans to acquire
Snyder Communications for a reported $2.1 billion. That transaction
was completed Monday, and it gives Arnold, and Eskandarian, another
opportunity to evolve to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   Havas operates four divisions, including two divisions of ad
agencies. Following the Snyder acquisition, plans call for
Eskandarian to head up one of those ad-agency divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition should make Havas the fourth-largest
communications company in the world behind WPP Group PLC of London,
the Omnicom Group of New York, and New York-based Interpublic Group
of Cos., which owns Boston ad agency Hill Holliday Connors
Cosmopulos and a majority stake of the Wenham ad agency Mullen.
</P>
<P>
   Under Snyder, Arnold was charged with putting together a network
of ad agencies from scratch. Under Havas, Arnold begins with a
network of nine agencies already in place on several continents.
</P>
<P>
   Having global reach should help the Havas network of ad agencies
led by Eskandarian attract more business.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how that is supposed to work: In France, for example,
Havas is the ad agency for Alcatel, a French telecommunications
giant. When Alcatel needed a US agency, Havas recommended Arnold
and, after a pitch, Arnold won the job.
</P>
<P>
   That's a pattern Havas and Arnold hope will be repeated. Arnold
now creates ads in the United States for EMC Corp. of Hopkinton,
the computer storage company, and Arnold recently won the US
account for Monster.com, the job-search Web site based in Maynard.
</P>
<P>
   Both EMC and Monster.com use other ad agencies outside the
United States, Eskandarian said. With partner agencies in Latin
America and Europe, Arnold can now go to such clients and offer to
handle a larger portion of their business, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of Eskandarian's new job, like his job at Snyder,
will be pursuing acquisitions, this time possibly in Australia,
Latin America, and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   One potential hitch: Stock prices for communications giants such
as Omnicom and Interpublic are off sharply this year as the US
economy slows, and stock is the currency such companies as Havas
use to make acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   With his new global role, Eskandarian said he plans to delegate
the day-to-day operations at Arnold. A new appointment should be
announced within a few weeks, he said. In 1999, Arnold reported
$140.9 million in revenues on billings of $1.1 billion.

FIDELITY SAYS IT'S TIME TO TURN A PAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One would hardly call Edward ``Ned'' Johnson III a
newspaper man.
</P>
<P>
   That his Fidelity Investments ever delved into the news business
has always been viewed with some irony in media circles. The
chairman of the investment giant is perhaps the most private man in
the mutual fund world. He rarely grants interviews and is almost
never seen at public events where other fund executives regularly
schmooze.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has approached the news business as dispassionately as
it reviews a Web-infrastructure venture deal or analyzes stocks in
its growth funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw early on that the clustering and consolidation of
newspapers was a key trend,'' said Steven Akin, president of
Fidelity Capital, the arm of Fidelity that controls venture
investments like Community Newspaper Co., which Fidelity agreed to
sell Thursday to Boston Herald publisher Patrick J. Purcell. ``We
got in on that, we believe, on the early side.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Akin said, Fidelity is content with its return on that
investment. ``We are very satisfied with where we come out on
CNC.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity is ending its grand experiment as a newspaper
publisher, selling its chain of community papers to New England's
underdog daily and continuing its focus on fast-growth, high-tech
venture deals.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows a dogged effort by Purcell to acquire Community
Newspaper Co., which Fidelity had long declined to sell. Fidelity
finally gave in, it appears, rather than set out to acquire more
papers itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that to take the newspaper group to the next level,
we'd have to continue this clustering strategy,'' Akin said.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity entered the newspaper business in 1986, with the
acquisition of six North Shore papers. Many acquisitions later, the
company owns more than 100 local papers. In recent months, Fidelity
showed interest in acquiring additional properties. Community News
actively bid for the Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette, now owned by the
Globe's parent, The New York Times Co., and The Patriot Ledger of
Quincy, which was taken off the market last week.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Fidelity is leaving the field altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity would not reveal the sale price of its news group, but
industry sources said they expected the amount to top $100 million.
Akin said Fidelity's return on its investment from the newspaper
group was competitive with industry benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Kivijarv, director of publications at Veronis Suhler, a New
York investment bank that focuses on the media industry, said
newspapers _ even local papers _ are still hot properties. ``People
are paying more now for newspapers than they ever have before,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fears that the Internet would crush the newspaper
business, the firm predicts 6.4 percent annual growth in
advertising revenues through 2004 and 2.4 percent circulation
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's clear these are far from the blockbuster numbers
that venture capitalists, including Fidelity, are seeing from their
Internet, telecommunications, and networking investments. Asked
whether the Herald's offer had been too good to refuse, Akin said,
``I wouldn't couch it in financial terms only.''
</P>
<P>
   Akin suggested that helping the Herald build its franchise was
attractive: ``It looks like the right thing to do,'' he said,
declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has had several high-profile disputes with media
outlets over the years, including the Globe, over coverage that it
has deemed unflattering. The company has not advertised with the
Globe for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Akin said Fidelity Capital invests in companies for many
reasons, beyond pure investment returns. He said running a business
is a way for Fidelity to learn about a sector. With newspapers, he
said, ``We've been able to learn a lot about content and the role
it plays'' in the Web era.
</P>
<P>
   There were layoffs over the years, difficult cost-cutting, and
efforts to merge cultures that often clashed. Community News is now
profitable, Akin said. The red ink turned to black in 1998,
according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Other holdings in the Fidelity Capital group include
BostonCoach, the $90 million private car and van service, and the
Seaport Hotel, which the fund firm developed on the South Boston
Waterfront. Two years ago, Fidelity sold money-losing Worth and two
other magazines. In 1997, Fidelity sold Wentworth Gallery Ltd., a
chain of fine-art stores.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company is plowing money into software companies,
Internet infrastructure players, and telecom start-ups. Its
portfolio includes more than 60 investments, from Authoria, a human
resources software provider, to Adero, a Web content delivery
company, and Nextel, the digital cellular company.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity would not reveal the dollar value of its venture
portfolio. In the second quarter, Fidelity Ventures made four deals
worth $3.5 million, according to data compiled by
PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Ventures' best-known success is Colt, a European
telecommunications company that was the firm's first initial public
offering. Other wins include WebSpective, which was purchased by
Inktomi for $110 million, and Nexabit Networks, bought by Lucent
Technologies for $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper deal is expected to close by Nov. 1, contingent on
the Herald's completing its due diligence.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell said other investors are backing him in the deal, but he
did not name them.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas H. Lee Co., the Boston buyout firm, is often rumored to
be one of Purcell's partners, but it is not believed to be in this
deal. FleetBoston Financial Corp. (preceded by BankBoston) is
Purcell's longtime banker.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity said it was not financing the deal, calling it an
``outright sale.''

REALISTIC `GIRLFIGHT' SCORES A KO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
GIRLFIGHT 
Written and directed by: Karyn Kusama 
Starring: Michelle Rodriguez, Jaime Tirelli, Paul Calderon,
Santiago Douglas, Ray Santiago 
Running time: 113 minutes 
Rated: R (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karyn Kusama's ``Girlfight'' is a terrific little uppercut of a
boxing movie and close to a perfect one. It immediately snaps you
to a keener, more intimately focused attention than the usual
studio behemoth. Not just because it puts a young woman in the ring
_ although that's certainly part of the reason _ but because it
operates on several levels, most of which never make their way into
boxing movies. Because Kusama has boxed, she gets the physicality
right. To Michelle Rodriguez's angry, bristly high school senior
named Diana Guzman, sweat and leather are perfume. The first time
she's sent to a gym on an errand by her macho father on behalf of
her brother, she feels at home. Her problem is persuading various
men she belongs there.
</P>
<P>
   One, her younger brother, is happy to hand her the gloves and
the money their father pays each week for training, declaring with
relief that he's content to be a geek. It takes her a little longer
to persuade the trainer, Hector (Jaime Tirelli). But he's impressed
enough by her raw talent and her attitude to take her on as a
student. In no time, he's asking himself whether a woman can fight
in a slightly different way because she has a lower center of
gravity. What Diana learns from Hector, apart from discipline, is a
scientific approach to fighting. Heart has its place, she learns,
but so does training.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon) is not, in any sense, in her
corner. One reason Diana keeps getting into trouble at school for
punching out other kids is that she's still angry over her mother's
suicide, for which she blames her father. But as she gets better at
boxing, an unforeseen thing happens. She falls for another boxer
named Adrian (you can't say Kusama hasn't got a sense of humor with
this inverted reference to ``Rocky''). Between the two of them,
they move miles beyond the usual punch-your-way-out-of-the-ghetto
cliches in which this genre is rooted.
</P>
<P>
   They, of course, are punching their way out of the ghetto. But
Adrian (Santiago Douglas) also subverts genre stereotyping by being
gentle as well as being a good boxer. If Hector becomes the
benevolent surrogate father Diana never had, Adrian shows her a
masculine tenderness and solicitude that includes teaching her to
eat salads. The effect is to soften Diana and make her risk showing
her own emotional vulnerability. But ``Girlfight'' is too smart and
too realistic to fall into the usual Hollywood trap of having a man
come along and kill the toughness of a strong woman by neutralizing
it with romance (a venerable Hollywood tradition _ Samson and
Delilah in reverse).
</P>
<P>
   Diana stays strong, while growing and deepening emotionally.
Swinging from the heels, Kusama KO's conventional expectation. It
makes you want to cheer. Between them, Kusama and Rodriguez get a
couple of big things right. Kusama doesn't ask that Diana give up
boxing to get love and make contact with her femininity. And
because she herself has clocked time in gyms, Kusama neither
romanticizes what goes on there, nor deemphasizes it. What goes on
outside the gym is ultimately more important than what goes on
inside it. But ``Girlfight'' doesn't make the mistake of
downplaying or undervaluing what goes on when Diana has the gloves
on. ``Girlfight'' is comfortable with its physicality.
</P>
<P>
   It makes clear that part of Diana's growing self-confidence
stems directly from her increased physical prowess. This, in turn,
comes not via swinging from the heels and winning the big fight on
a last, desperate angry lunge (usually the case with movie
square-offs), but from hard work over a period of time. When we do
see Diana win a fight, it isn't by a falsely dramatic knockout;
it's by a decision. Rodriguez is an ideal Diana. Credible as one
who can throw a punch that can inflict pain, she's also credible as
one who sometimes is a pain. The film isn't afraid to have us
sometimes dislike her. But her purity and intensity make her
heroic. She and this film that respects her by rendering her and
her world in unadorned realistic terms, bypassing cheap prefab
myths, are twin blasts of fresh air. ``Girlfight'' could have gone
wrong in a dozen ways. But it goes shiningly right.

WALLFLOWERS DELIVER `BREACH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thoughtful, well-constructed rock 'n' roll is having a hard time
getting heard these days. It is being overwhelmed on the one hand
by syrupy boy bands and navel-baring teen girls, and on the other
by angry metal-rappers who color everything with a macho brush.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob Dylan of the Wallflowers knows this isn't the easiest time
for his band to drop a new album, but he's moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you wait for the right time, you'll never get out
of the house,'' the son of Bob Dylan says. ``And if it is a great
time for what you do, then you're probably going to get a novelty
song on alternative radio and then be done. I actually take a lot
of comfort in not being lumped in with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence his credo: ``When you don't fit in, your actual chances of
longevity are a lot stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wallflowers hit their stride with their 1996 sophomore
album, the rootsy ``Bringing Down the Horse,'' which sold 4 million
copies, aided by hit singles ``Sixth Avenue Heartache,'' ``One
Headlight,'' and ``Three Marlenas.'' And the new ``Breach,'' which
comes out Oct. 10, is an even better album, showing Dylan's growth
and his willingness to take chances with different sonic textures
and lyrical twists, from the rocking new single, ``Sleepwalker,''
to the wistful ``Hand Me Down,'' which many observers say is about
his relationship with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   The latter tune has lines like ``Look at your worn-out shoes /
Living proof evolution's through'' and ``You feel good and you look
like you should / But you could never make us proud.'' The lyrics
give the media a juicy hook to grab on to, but Dylan, now 30 and
happily married with two of his own children, says that listeners
shouldn't jump to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a song directly about myself and him?'' he says,
referring to his father in the third person. ``Yeah, there are
parts of it in there, but it's not really unique to me. Having
insecurities and shadows to work with, and having expectations, I
mean I don't know anybody who doesn't have that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, I don't demand that people get exactly what I'm
talking about,'' Jakob says. ``So you're left with just the music
and you're left to interpret it and I like that. . . . A lot of
times when you find out what songs are really about, you're kind of
bummed out, because maybe your interpretation was better. But, hey,
these are not term papers. They're just songs _ half of them are
true, and half of them are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the success of the last Wallflowers album has changed
his relationship with his dad, Jakob says no. ``I don't think that
record changed anything. I hope it didn't. People have imagined
that there's a distance between (my father and me), or some kind of
rip or friction, but truthfully, there is not.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album has a consistency that the Wallflowers have not
matched before. ``Letters From the Wasteland'' is a powerful
breakup song, with Dylan singing the verse, ``You abandoned me into
these fields of rank and file.'' The song ``Murder 101'' likewise
details the death of a romance (Elvis Costello adds some snappy
backing vocals), while more hopeful, reassuring emotions are voiced
in the hidden track, ``Babybird,'' a love letter to Dylan's
children.
</P>
<P>
   The album took a long time to make _ and elicited rumors that
Dylan was suffering from writer's block _ but that wasn't the case,
he says. The problem was that he simply didn't like his first batch
of tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard when you go on tour for as long as us _ two and
one-half years,'' notes Dylan. ``All I seemed able to draw from was
touring and being successful or not successful. And I don't like
that kind of material. So I just had to take some time off. I
waited about five months to settle in until I had something I
thought was more inspiring to write about.''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan, whose group is expected to play the soon-to-be-reopened
Paradise club next week in a get-reacquainted show (no ticket
details yet), is clearly, like his dad, in this business for the
long haul. ``If you're going to continue doing this past your
adolescence, then you'd better care a little more and dig in a
little deeper,'' he says.

WASHINGTON CARRIES `REMEMBER THE TITANS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
REMEMBER THE TITANS 
Directed by: Boaz Yakin 
Screenplay by: Gregory Allen Howard 
Starring: Denbzel Washington, Will Patton, Wood Harris, Ryan Hurst,
Donald Faison, Craig Kirkwood, Ethan Suplee, Kip Pardue, Hayden
Panettiere 
Running time: 113 minutes 
Rated: PG (thematic elements and some language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Remember the Titans,'' starring Denzel Washington, wants to be
to high school football what ``Hoosiers'' is to high school
basketball _ namely, the best movie of its kind based on a true
story. It almost is, aided by the fact that it isn't just a sports
movie. When Harold Boone took over as coach of the T. C. Williams
High School football team in Alexandria, Va., in 1971, it was a
fishbowl job. Alexandria had just been integrated. The black and
white players weren't used to being in the same building, much less
on the same team. Boone, a type-A specimen, knew that a lot of eyes
were on him, and that many could not be considered friendly.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, you will say, a pall of uplift hovers over this saga
like an umbrella defense. But Washington crashes through it, and
carries the film with him, sometimes in spite of itself. Although
he's as dynamic as anybody on the A-list, Washington got there by
demonstrating the ability, as all top stars do, of seeming to let
the camera come to him. In this film, his face is not exactly a
mask of inscrutability. We know what Coach Boone wants. He wants to
win and get the crackers off his neck. But he wants to win in any
case. We can tell by the way he bites on his whistle, and by the
angry way he blows it.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is a drillmaster here, whose opponent isn't always
the other team, or even racist animosity. It's the intrinsically
messagey nature of the film _ or would be, if Washington didn't
catch us in his moment-to-moment channeling of Vince Lombardi as
Coach Boone. He basically doesn't give his squad time to develop
racial rifts. He works them too hard and too long to leave them
much energy for much else. Because the role is so strewn with
dramatic, if not moral, pitfalls, Washington's achievement in
making the coach a riveting figure is all the more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   I wish the film had trusted its story and its star a little
more, and refrained from detonating a big groundswell of music at
each and every plot point, each and every game. We don't need the
kind of prodding and cueing the film keeps throwing at us. Yet it
works, anyway. Ultimately we root for it more than we cringe from
it. Another big reason is Will Patton, who provides some of the
quiet contrast the film so desperately needs, as the dismissed
white coach, Bill Yoast, who decides to stay on as Boone's
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, he's motivated by loyalty to his returning players, and
by a need to get them through a difficult transition. But he also
does a superb job of embodying the message that not all Southern
whites were bigoted, that some were dignified gentlemen who acted
on their principles with quiet dignity, even when it got
inconvenient. One related moment comes when a transfer quarterback
from California, of whom the Southerners don't know what to make,
drops into their midst because his Army-officer father has
experienced integration, believes in it, and enrolls his son where
he thinks his family's principles should be.
</P>
<P>
   Kip Pardue is fine as the no-longer-surfing backfield ace, but
then the entire team is engaging, especially Ryan Hurst, as the
white team captain who surprises himself by turning out to be a
bridge-builder; Wood Harris, as the black teammate who becomes his
friend; Ethan Suplee, as the roughneck whose frequent family
relocations cause him to identify more with the team's black
members than his fellow whites. Hayden Panettiere, as the white
coach's young daughter and football maven, is one who could have
perished under a load of terminal cuteness, but doesn't. The
soundtrack, on the other hand, almost does.
</P>
<P>
   You're never unaware that a lot of buttons are being pushed in
this inspirational story. You can't help wishing that a bit more
doubt and complexity had been written into it, to say nothing of a
few quiet interludes. Perhaps the training camp sequences in
Gettysburg might profitably have been downplayed in this film that
isn't exactly starved for symbolic dimension. Still, while I'm
largely immune to the proddings of football uplift movies, I'd be
lying if I didn't admit to getting caught up in ``Remember the
Titans.'' Washington and the others score in this predictable but
rousing film where the big victory is over attitudes.

DENEUVE ENTHRALLS IN `PLACE VENDOME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
PLACE VENDOME 
Directed by: Nicole Garcia 
Screenplay by: Garcia, Jacques Fieschi 
Starring: Catherine Deneuve, Jean-Pierre Bacri, Emmanuelle Seigner,
Jacques Dutronc, Bernard Fresson, Francois Berleand 
Running time: 117 minutes 
Rating: Unrated 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some critics, writing of Catherine Deneuve's recent films, have
lazily referred to her as ageless, thus missing the whole point of
what has made her a much more interesting actor during the last two
decades of her career than the first two. Although she has always
been one of the world's most beautiful women, she has in recent
years struck me as the female equivalent of Paul Newman _ an actor
who learned how to act once dazzling youthful good looks were no
longer the issue. Deneuve is more than cool in manner; she has a
solid foundation of good horse sense that has enabled her to
incorporate into her characters the fact that she's aging, thus
deepening them, making them more complicatedly human and affecting.
</P>
<P>
   She'll startle more than a few longtime moviegoers as a factory
worker who is anything but glamorous in the forthcoming ``Dancer in
the Dark.'' Right now, there's much to savor in ``Place Vendome,''
Nicole Garcia's richly textured thriller packed with so many
criminal and amatory betrayals that Deneuve's alcoholic widow of a
highly regarded diamond dealer can hardly sort them out. The
latter's unexpected suicide means that she will either sink
permanently into the alcoholic fog that keeps her shuttling in and
out of a pricey private clinic, or sober up fast and get some
answers. She chooses the latter course, and although she backslides
a couple of times, she soon looks like the natural appraiser her
character once had been.
</P>
<P>
   What undid her as an ambitious diamond dealer in her youth was
an ill-advised shady deal with a charmer who left her in the lurch
after having seduced her into trouble. Now it appears he's back in
the picture, in the person of Jacques Dutronc, who brings a
wonderfully lived-in face to the wheeler-dealer who apparently has
been up to his old tricks, similarly seducing Emmanuelle Seigner's
Nathalie, who reminds the widow of herself 20 years ago. Deneuve's
character is named Marianne _ a play on Deneuve's having been
chosen as the personification of the personification of France
itself. Again, looks. Yet the thing that's moving about Deneuve's
Marianne is her vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, it was her emotional naivete. Now, Deneuve uses the
fact that age has begun to blur those perfect facial contours to
feed into a sense that Marianne is fighting hard to rally, to
empower herself out of the mess she's in. She's adamantly refusing
her brother-in-law's entreaties to sell the famous old family firm
on the flossy Place Vendome, home of the Ritz. ``You think you're
strong enough,'' she says at one point, sighing at how easy it
would be to just let go again when her resolve is tested by events.
Yet she learns she'd better be strong to play the game she's
playing with seven diamonds her husband had stashed away,
especially after she learns that the DeBeers monopoly and a new
Russian cartel have their eyes on the stones as well.
</P>
<P>
   Deneuve is wonderful in several ways. Once she comes out of her
alcoholic fog, her eyes make us realize that part of the reason she
drinks is that she can still be hurt. Yet there's also a certain
hardness and a hard-won wisdom in those eyes, right there alongside
her characteristic watchfulness. Nor is she entirely a victim. When
she catches up with her old flame, she skewers him with casual
cruelty, observing in passing that he dyes his hair now. And we can
see all the old acquisitive instincts kick in when she slips on the
jeweler's loupe and is obviously turned on by the diamonds. The
reason that she's able to exhibit so many facets, of course, is
that writer-director Garcia's script allows her to.
</P>
<P>
   It's rare that a crime movie achieves such emotional complexity,
but this one is smartly layered, allowing as well for French
culture's way of allowing human impulse to bend a rule here and
there. The other players are scarcely less juicily characterized.
Dutronc doesn't just give us the charmer's charm; he projects as
well a believable tenderness that makes the charm work as well as
it does. Seigner is another plus as the young comer who isn't as
hard-edged as she thinks she is. And the marvelous Jean-Pierre
Bacri carries off with hangdog triumph the role of a disbarred
lawyer and present-day repo man, who becomes Marianne's ally,
partly because his rumpled look and damaged life allow her to relax
and even identify with him. Rarely is a movie about gems itself a
gem, but ``Place Vendome'' is a rare exception as it snatches
romance and regeneration from a slag heap of venality and
world-weariness.

`THAT'S LIFE' LOOKS TO RISE ABOVE FORMULA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THAT'S LIFE 
Starring: Heather Paige Kent, Ellen Burstyn, Paul Sorvino, Debi
Mazar, Kevin Dillon, Sonny Marinelli 
On: CBS 
Time: Premieres Sunday at 8 p.m., then moves to Saturdays at 8
p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rule number one about judging a new TV series like ``That's
Life'': Be conditional in your affection. You never know if the
promise of a superior pilot is going to pan out and deliver the
next ``Once and Again,'' or if it's going to deteriorate into
string cheese and leave you forever branded with sheer and utter
disgrace and shame. Because even ``Veronica's Closet'' looked like
a winner for the first half hour _ I swear.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``That's Life'' is a promising newcomer that recalls
the ethnic comedy and spirit of the movie ``Moonstruck.'' Its
strong-willed heroine is a 32-year-old working-class woman named
Lydia DeLucca (Heather Paige Kent), who dumps her lug of a fiance
and enrolls at nearby Montclair University, much to the disgust of
her Italian-American family. Off campus, Lydia's got the Sopranos
Lite: a whiny mother (Ellen Burstyn) who's allergic to her
daughter's independence, a cop brother (Kevin Dillon) who torments
her like she's still 10, a passive father (Paul Sorvino) who
operates a toll booth and listens to the music of Joe Pesci, and a
neighborhood of Old World women who send bereavement cards when she
breaks her engagement. On campus, she's got ``Felicity'' with
attitude: Muffys in BMWs, elitist professors, and the constant
trill of a thousand cell phones ringing.
</P>
<P>
   It all veers dangerously close to TV's familiar culture-clash
formula, with Lydia torn between her blue-collar roots and the
university snoots. But the show's creator, Diane Ruggerio, is also
interested in the well-acted ensemble and their nutty, Tri-State
flourishes. She's aiming for slice-of-life dramedy, a genre that
depends on local color as much as _ if not more than _ plotting.
Why else would she have recruited not only Burstyn and Sorvino but
Debi Mazar, who personifies local color? Mazar plays Lydia's
beautician friend Jackie with all the gum-chewing wisecracks and
scene-stealing you'd expect. When Jackie styles Lydia's hair on her
first day of college, she comes up with a twirling, towering
creation that couldn't be further from the flat-haired Gwyneths
also signed up for ``Post Modernism and the Decentering of Self.''
It's a kitsch coif that screams 1950s, and Lydia is horrified.
</P>
<P>
   The writing of ``That's Life,'' which airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on
CBS before moving to Saturdays at 8 p.m. also tries to lift it a
level above formula. The premiere episode is clever enough to bury
the series' central theme into the plot, when Lydia's psychology
professor assigns her a paper on whether her life is
pre-determined, or whether she has free will. Also, with Lydia's
voiceover guiding us through comic might-have-beens and early
memories, the narrative structure has a bit of dash. The only
gimmicky piece in ``That's Life'' is the soundtrack, which blasts
songs like ``Mambo Italiano'' like a nonstop jukebox in a
neighborhood cantina. They're Italian, we got it.
</P>
<P>
   As the lead, Kent is better than her recent sitcom gig in
``Stark Raving Mad'' might have suggested. She's passionate, tough,
not conventionally pretty, and a good mirror for the curious people
around her. She makes a desire to learn appealing, but not a big
moral deal. I hope, though, that the show continues to develop each
member of its ensemble, and not keep them hanging around Kent only
as comic relief. Kristin Bauer's Miss New Jersey 1988, for example,
who's still clinging to her former reigning glory. Surely, there's
a tragicomic backstory there.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Providence'' and ``Judging Amy,'' ``That's Life'' is
built around a woman chasing her own identity despite cultural and
familial pressures. But it doesn't seem bent on cloying
emotionality (except for a moment or two toward the end), and it
doesn't overwhelm us with gratuitous melodrama. It's breezy fun _
at least so far.

`BEAUTIFUL' IS BARELY SKIN DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
BEAUTIFUL 
Directed by: Sally Field 
Screenplay by: Jon Bernstein 
Starring: Minnie Driver, Joey Lauren Adams, Leslie Stefanson,
Bridgette Wilson, Kathleen Turner, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Kathleen
Robertson, Michael McKean, Gary Collins, Linda Hart, Brent Briscoe 
Running time: 112 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (language and thematic elements) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gap between satire and sentiment proves unbridgeable in
``Beautiful,'' Sally Field's directing debut. The idea is to have
Minnie Driver's love-starved Mona learn the difference between
outer and inner beauty as she grows from 12-year-old ugly duckling
to national beauty pageant finalist. But the lesson in life is
rendered in off-puttingly simplistic terms. Worse, the film cops
out at the end by embracing the beauty pageant, treating it as
something of value, not as an apotheosis of the shallow values the
film had been steering Mona to reject. Maybe the reason the film
seems so tepid and compromised is that Field is just too nice.
</P>
<P>
   What's funny at the start is young Mona's single-mindedness. She
keps entering contest after contest even though she never wins.
Fueling her drive, it soon becomes clear, is that she's looking for
love she isn't getting from her unaffectionate mother. The big
thing Mona has going for her is a mousy girlfriend, Ruby, whose
devotion approaches the saintly and whose sewing abilities mean
that Mona gets a succession of upgraded gowns and costumes. How
saintly is Joey Lauren Adams's Ruby? When Mona becomes pregnant and
gives birth to a daughter that would disqualify her from the beauty
pageant circuit, Ruby passes off the baby as hers.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy begins to ebb when Mona's desperation and dirty
competitive tricks give way to more basic emotional needs. When
Ruby is jailed because of a misunderstanding and Mona goes off to
California as Miss Illinois in her first national contest, it's
with the little girl who looks like Mona but has been told Ruby is
her mother. Events unfold along deflatingly predictable lines as
Mona feels more and more conflicted and the initial prickliness
that had existed between her and the little girl is replaced by
mutual neediness and chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   The tame, confused script sinks the film, although Field shows
skill directing actors. Driver totters under the sellout of Mona,
but Adams _ so memorable in ``Chasing Amy'' _ survives the
canonization conferred upon Ruby. Field's directorial abilities are
perhaps best revealed in the surprising degrees of complexity she
gets from Bridgette Wilson and Kathleen Robertson in peripheral
roles as Mona's competitors. Perhaps I'd have been less sour about
``Beautiful,'' and not demanded sharper, more wicked satire if I
hadn't just come from a screening of Christopher Guest's ``Best in
Show,'' opening Oct. 13, in which he does for dog shows what he did
for amateur theatricals in ``Waiting for Guffman.'' In any case,
``Beautiful'' is, on any level, anything but.

2 U.S. BOXERS RETAIN GOLD MEDAL HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ From his corner ringside perch Friday night,
the U.S. boxing coach, Tom Mustin, watched the first round unfold
between his fighter, Ricardo Williams Jr., and Cuba's powerful
Diogenes Luna and had just one thought: We're in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the ring, Williams had already tested the prefight plan
and come to a similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to counterpunch over his right hand like we talked
about,'' Williams said afterward. ``He ducked it and threw a quick
right that hit me right in the forehead. I said to myself, `It's
going to be a long night.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan was to stick and move, don't slug it out. But I knew
right then my only chance was going toe-to-toe for four rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams willingly took on the hardy, more experienced Luna, but
by the midpoint of their semifinal, things weren't looking much
better for the American. Williams, a 139-pound light welterweight
from Cincinnati, had a sore left cheekbone and was behind in the
official scoring by 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this juncture that the referee separated the fighters
after a clinch. Williams dropped his hands because the referee had
shouted to stop punching. That's when Luna hit Williams on the side
of the head. Luna got a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said, ``I got mad.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was the most spirited round and a half of the 2000
Olympic boxing tournament.
</P>
<P>
   With a torrent of lefts and rights, Williams backed Luna onto
the ropes, then pounded him into a corner, outscoring the Cuban by
16-8 for the remainder of the third round to take the points lead.
Then, in an extraordinary final round, with both exhausted fighters
winging dozens of power punches, Williams and Luna traded the lead
with every exchange. Williams rallied last, a left and a right put
him ahead, and he held on to win on points, 42-41.
</P>
<P>
   The total of punches scored, 83, was 33 more than in any other
bout in these Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Williams will fight Mahamadkadyz Abdullaev of Uzbekistan for the
gold medal Sunday. Joining Williams in the gold medal round Friday
was the American featherweight Ricardo Juarez, who defeated Kamil
Dzamalutdinov of Russia on points, 23-12. The U.S. light
middleweight Jermain Taylor was defeated by Yermakhan Ibraimov of
Kazakhstan, 29-14.
</P>
<P>
   Ibraimov was too determined for Taylor, who for the first time
in the Olympics looked sluggish. Taylor will still receive a bronze
medal.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez, who will also face a Kazakh fighter, Bekzat
Sattarkhanov, in the finals, is a reigning world champion and was
expected to get to the gold medal round. Juarez is the team's
smartest fighter, its most disciplined and its most tenacious. He
has won 68 consecutive bouts and, among his teammates, should make
the most immediate impact as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams, 19, was not considered a top American medal
contender in part because he had a history of undertraining. And he
was hardly favored against Luna, especially after Luna won his
quarterfinal fight with a one-punch knockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to dig deep in a lot of ways,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Mustin has called Williams the most talented American fighter on
the team because of his hand-eye coordination and foot speed. But
his training habits, while adequate, at one time were not
exceptional. That has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I had talent and I could get by with that,''
Williams said Friday. ``But the other guys had talent and
determination. I had to fix that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a loss in last year's world championships to Abdullaev,
whom he will face again for the gold, which was the turning point
for Williams. Eleven years earlier, his father, Ricardo Sr., who
had a brief professional boxing career, had taken his son to the
gym to learn to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had three sisters,'' Ricardo Jr. said. ``They didn't want me
playing with Barbie dolls all the time. My dad taught me the sport,
and I liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the father, a part-time artist and a full-time
painter for the Cincinnati housing authority, took the son aside
and suggested he make the most of his ring skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important time in my life,'' Ricardo Jr. said. ``It
was time to see just how much I could make of my boxing. It was
conditioning and ring work.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has charged through the Olympic tournament, with no
performance more convincing than Friday night's. Luna and Williams
were trading bombs in the middle of the ring and on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Mustin said: ``That was no boxing match. They were tossing
some luggage out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fight's final seconds, Williams finally thought the extra
work was going to pay off. He heard his father yelling from his
ringside seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was yelling, `Stick and move,''' Williams said. ``The
original plan. He probably knew I was ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   With 15 seconds to go, Williams had a 1-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my track shoes on,'' Williams said. ``I think I would
have beat Michael Johnson late in that round.''
</P>
<P>
   Luna threw a left hand with six seconds left that Williams
danced away from, though it grazed his face. It was the last punch
in the fight of the tournament. But the judges, perhaps with
fatigue in their fingers, did not score it as a landed punch.
Williams had won.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that the two Ricardos _ Williams and Juarez _ are the
last gold medal hopes for the Americans. No U.S. boxing team has
failed to win at least one gold medal since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved that we've got two guys left,'' Mustin said. ``I
sure don't want to be the first coach not to win one in 52 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But the day's events, especially Williams' surprising and heroic
victory, had bolstered Mustin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty lucky to be going to war with these two guys,'' he
said.  &QL;

THE BANGLES REUNITE, IN HARMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susannah Hoffs is breathless. She starts and stops and starts
again, searching for a way to describe what it feels like to be a
Bangle again. Once she finds the right words, they tumble out with
the giddy bounce of, well, a Bangles song.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of feeling completely like I've come home
to something that is so familiar, but that's also better,'' says
Hoffs, on the phone from a hotel room in Chicago. ``We're better
with age. It's like we understand each other in a new kind of way,
and we know how to be better friends. It's not that we weren't
before, because we were great friends before. But being on the road
all the time ... it can do something to you. We just needed a
change. And we ended it instead of taking a year off.''
</P>
<P>
   So goes the happy, then sad, then happy story of four
harmonizing girls _ women now _ who came up in LA's '60s-influenced
Paisley Underground and hit it big in the late '80s with a string
of Top 40 songs like ``Manic Monday,'' ``Walk Like an Egyptian,''
``If She Knew What She Wants,'' and ``Eternal Flame.'' They were on
top of the world and sinking fast.
</P>
<P>
   When singer-guitarist Hoffs, guitarist Vicki Peterson, and her
sister, drummer Debbi Peterson, and bassist Michael Steele decided
to call it quits in 1989, anything vaguely resembling harmony had
vanished. They'd had it on a lot of levels: a grueling cycle of
touring and recording, an increasingly glossy sound _ encouraged by
the record company and management _ that was responsible for their
biggests hits, and the media's focus on gamine, girlish Hoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult for everyone,'' Hoffs recalls. ``The band
wanted the world to know that this is a group, like Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young, that has a structure of four singers and four
writers, with no one focal point, no one lead singer. And I think
that created a frustration, and that frustration led to tension,
and it became painful all the way around.''
</P>
<P>
   So painful, in fact, that when Hoffs began calling the others a
few years ago to feel them out, to see if anyone had an interest in
getting together to write or play, she didn't get an enthusiastic
response, Hoffs confesses. ``I was pretty actively calling people
for years. It was so traumatic when it ended, I think they were in
a mind-set that it would just never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele had escaped to Northern California to write and paint.
Vicki Peterson was working with her band the Continental Drifters,
based in New Orleans. Debbi Peterson and Hoffs were both involved
in solo projects, recording with other bands, and raising families
in Los Angeles. Hoffs's ministrations finally succeeded, however,
and last year the band recorded a song for the soundtrack to
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' which her husband, Jay
Roach, directed. A few weeks later she got a call from an old
friend putting together a George Martin tribute, and the Bangles
reunited for their first live show in 10 years _ singing five
Beatles songs at the Hollywood Bowl. The chemistry, Hoffs says, was
back.
</P>
<P>
   So it's official: the Bangles are back together, out on a
mini-tour and approaching phase two with a newfound thoughtfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess one perk of getting older is all this wisdom and
understanding,'' Hoffs muses. ``For me, being a mom has given me a
lot in terms of figuring out a way to make things work. If
someone's cranky, instead of no one talking about it or dealing
with it, you ask `how do we fix this?' One of the prerequisites we
set up going in was it had to be a positive experience for
everybody. No one should feel like they're compromising. No one
should feel like they're having their souls ripped away. You can
say no.''
</P>
<P>
   The four have been writing like crazy, generating new material
and incorporating songs and ideas each has been honing over the
years. They're going into the studio as soon as they get off the
road in October, and hope to release the fourth Bangles album next
year. The band is starting to introduce new songs at the live
shows, and of course serving up plenty of old favorites. More
important, says Hoffs, there's a sense of personal harmony as sweet
as the vocal harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just did three shows in a row at House of Blues in LA. We
were careful planning our set, and it had this really nice flow. I
really think everybody saw what we wanted them to see _ that
there's this great balance going on. Everybody has their moment,''
says Hoffs. ``Everybody shines in their way.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Life hasn't been the same since
meeting Earl Grey
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I like to start the day with a cuppa tea,
sitting on the balcony, reading the newspaper and watching the
morning traffic of people on their way to work.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when I drank coffee instead. But I have found tea to be
so much more ... well, civilized.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that it was my uncivilized appearance that led to
this realization.
</P>
<P>
   Some years back I was staying at the Ritz in London for a night
or two before heading off to Scotland and Ireland on assignment.
</P>
<P>
   I was traveling, as I do whenever I can, with only a single
piece of luggage, a carry-on bag at that.
</P>
<P>
   It never ceases to astonish airlines personnel at the check-in
counter that someone going to Europe for a couple of weeks has no
bags to check.
</P>
<P>
   But it's an easy way to travel and not so hard to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   You really don't need much more than a couple of extra pairs of
pants, a few neatly folded shirts, underwear, socks and toilet
accessories, all of which will go into a bag that will fit into the
overhead compartment.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to even throw in a tie and a sports coat, which I
had failed to include on the trip that had me staying at the Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   When I showed up at the hotel dining room that evening in my
usual garb _ a zipper jacket, blue Oxford shirt and khaki pants,
comfortable shoes and white socks _ the maitre 'd seemed sincerely
happy to see me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, good evening, sir!'' he sang out, smiling warmly and
nodding his head in a friendly way.
</P>
<P>
   Returning the smile and nod, I asked for a table for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm afraid not, sir,'' he said, shaking his head in a
friendly way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a problem with the way I'm dressed?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm afraid so, sir,'' he said, still smiling his warm
smile. ``But I'm sure you will be welcome in the tea room.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I ended up supping at the Ritz on tea and
biscuits. I stopped short of trying to order iced tea or, for that
matter, gravy with the biscuits. As it turned out, what they call
biscuits is what we call cookies.
</P>
<P>
   But I have to say that tea in the tea room of the Ritz was jolly
good and quite refreshing, and I came away much impressed with Earl
Grey.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you don't know about Earl Grey, whose name happened to be
Charles. The Epicurious Dictionary can tell you all about him and
his tea:
</P>
<P>
   ``Earl Grey: This popular black tea was named for Charles Grey,
the second earl in his line, who was also prime minister to King
William IV in the early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``An amalgamation of Indian and Sri Lankan teas, Earl Grey gets
its elusive flavor from oil of bergamot. The Earl is said to have
been given the recipe by a Chinese mandarin with whom he was
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergamot (BER-gah-mot) is a small acidic orange, and bergamot
oil is produced from its peel. Funny they didn't use a mandarin
orange.
</P>
<P>
   No matter: Earl Grey tea, of which there is any number of
varieties, seems to have caught on over the last century and a
half.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays it's sold even in the supermarkets of my little
hometown _ though I wouldn't be surprised if you asked for Earl
Grey the clerk would scratch his head and tell you that to the best
of his knowledge they don't have anybody working there by that
name.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, if you're passing by my house on your way to work
in the morning, wave to me there on the balcony. Honk if you love
Earl Grey.

AUSTRALIA'S HOCKEYROOS WIN GOLD MEDAL IN FIELD HOCKEY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Argentina, Netherlands, Spain)  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The train that winds into Olympic Park was
slowly easing by the hockey stadium earlier this week when a boy
sprung from his seat. Sticking his painted face against the window,
he was searching the empty field in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the Hockeyroos?'' he asked. Better yet, what are
they? At first, the name sounds like a cuddly team mascot or the
title of a Disney film. But the Hockeyroos are neither. They are
real and they are tough. This is the Australian women's field
hockey team, a group of unflinching, unrelenting players who have
become their nation's most dominant international team. With a
following that goes well beyond just a cult niche, they have left
their country dizzy with their success over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, a swarm of chanting Aussies packed the hockey
stadium for their beloved team's gold medal match against
Argentina. And by the end of their 3-1 victory _ after the
Hockeyroos had dismantled their opponent's will with their
deceptive stick skills, opportunistic scoring and aggressive attack
_ they were free to enjoy the buildup to their gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd counted down the last 10 seconds, the Hockeyroos
embraced each other, linked arms and started celebrating. The
Olympic favorites _ a team that has now won three gold medals in a
row _ could finally feel relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say there was some tension,'' said Rechelle Hawkes.
``There were a few girls who were nervous. It was pretty quiet
before we came out. But once it started, we all came together.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of them will be going their own way. Expected to
depart is Coach Richard Charlesworth, the adored taskmaster who
pushed his team to be perfectionists. He was visibly moved as he
watched his players bask in their moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterward, he just stood up briefly and said he was really,
really proud of us,'' said Jenny Morris. ``He had some tears in his
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were waiting for the emotional impact of the night to hit
them. At age 32, Hawkes, who was playing in her fourth Olympics, is
retiring from competition with three gold medals, equaling the
total of the Australian swimming icon Dawn Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be mentioned in the same breath as Dawn Fraser is amazing,
but I couldn't have done it without this team,'' Hawkes said.
``Winning in Atlanta was special, but this is the best way to go
out. I'm really just over the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   She was among the many. As the team completed a victory lap
around the field, the steel-framed stadium trembled with the roar,
but perhaps the most touching display of admiration came from
Argentina. The silver medalists lined up in two parallel rows,
formed a bridge with their hands, and then ushered the Aussies
through their gauntlet as a show of respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we achieved was important,'' said goalkeeper Mariela
Antoniska, who endured a flurry of 17 attempts and saved a
remarkable 14 of the shots. ``I'm disappointed, but Australia is a
very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bronze medal game, the Netherlands beat Spain, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies have been excelling for years. Under Charlesworth,
the team's reputation as intimidators has flourished. They are not
dirty, but hard-nosed. If they are hurt, his players refuse to show
it. If they are afraid, they learn to hide it. Friday night, the
Aussies were anxious beneath their facade but shook it off in the
opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Although they missed some early shots, some of which glanced off
the goal posts, the Australians were on the attack. Nine minutes
into the game, Alyson Annan slipped in front of the net and used
her stick like a pool cue. Faced with a thicket of legs and sticks,
she poked the ball past a diving Antoniska.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the first half, the Aussies took a 2-0 lead after
they converted a penalty corner opportunity into a goal. This time,
a quick-thinking Juliet Haslam was in the right place to turn a
deflection off the post into a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of allowing Argentina to get back into the game,
Australia opened the second half by taking advantage of another
penalty corner situation. Three minutes into play, Morris reached
out and slashed the ball between defenders and into the net from
the top of the circle. Ahead, 3-0, the Aussies were revealing just
how dominating they have come to be, and why they are the pride of
their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anything prepares you for the emotion of
this,'' said Morris, who had difficulty speaking without getting
emotional. ``This is a bloody great night. To win a gold here is
just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the rest of the world came to discover the
answer to, What's a Hockeyroo?

These powerful molecules carry important messages. Pheromones tell
animals what they are supposed to do, such as run, fight or have
sex. The nice thing about pheromone messages is that animals don't

with their babies' names. Both choose Sidney (Sydney) and Savanna.
Both Savannas develop health complications requiring surgery. And

   SYDNEY, Australia _ The kid from Adelaide finally caved in three
weeks ago. Between the interview requests, the slippage in her game
and the mounting expectations of a nation, Lauren Jackson no longer
felt like the star of the Australian national team.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, she was just another overwhelmed 19-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably shouldn't think about the pressure, but before the
Olympics I just collapsed in a crying heap,'' Jackson said. ``It
was everything I guess, the Olympics and everything else. I was
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke moments after leading Australia to its first
appearance in a gold medal game, where Jackson and the Australians
would finally get their Olympic wish: A date with Lisa Leslie and
Team USA.
</P>
<P>
   Before nearly 15,000 of their chanting fans at the Super Dome in
Olympic Park, Australia beat Brazil, 64-52. Jackson's 16 points and
9 rebounds led the way. The United States struggled early against
South Korea before rallying for a 78-65 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Swoopes scored 19 points before leaving the game with
about four minutes left while holding her left knee. She was
expected to play against Australia. Leslie added 15 points and 12
rebounds, while Natalie Williams contributed 11 rebounds and 10
points.
</P>
<P>
   The gold medal matchup on Saturday between the Americans and the
Australians has been anticipated for two and a half weeks after a
spirited exhibition between the two teams in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians opened an 18-6 lead in the opening minutes of
that game and trailed only 38-37 at halftime. They were run off the
floor in the final minutes, losing, 83-62. The game featured a
minor altercation between Jackson and Leslie, who chest-bumped
Jackson after Jackson had scuffled with Swoopes under the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized what she was doing,'' Jackson said. ``I came back
to her and said, `What do you want? Do you want a piece of me?' She
ran off. I won't stand for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women are seeking their second straight gold medal.
They will have to battle not only Jackson, Michele Timms and
teammates but also a loud, partisan crowd that would love to see
Goliath brought down.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, we're the team you love to hate,'' Leslie
said. ``We have a saying back home: Don't player hate. Celebrate.
We play hard, is all. If they want to play clean, we'll play clean.
If they want to fight, we will fight. We can go any way.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. ``Why we're the bad guys, I don't know. Can't we all
just get along?''
</P>
<P>
   The game will also mark the end to Teresa Edwards' 16-year
international career. The five-time Olympian and starting U.S.
point guard will finish her career against Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it, the end of my blessed career,'' she said, almost
facetiously. ``My family is ready for me to come home. Am I
thinking about it? I don't have time to worry about Teresa Edwards'
last game. I have to worry about the gold medal.''
</P>

   Australia won its first women's basketball medal in Atlanta four
years ago, taking home the bronze. With the development of Jackson
and the maturing of Timms, Kristi Harrower and Michelle Griffiths _
players with Women's National Basketball Association experience _
the Opals have become one of the world's strongest teams.
</P>
<P>
   They move the ball around the perimeter, wait for Jackson to
come open on the blocks and get back to play transition defense.
Australia swept through the preliminary games and is 7-0 over the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson entrenched herself as one of the game's preeminent
players, backing her way in for layups, spotting up for 3-pointers
and rejecting shots back to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We engulfed her with confidence,'' Timms said. ``She was just
young and going through a lot. She's back now, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jackson, ``I was crying after every game. I wasn't playing
well. I was getting really scared. After playing America in
Melbourne, it lifted a little bit and after that I was confident,
back to my old attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I really think we can beat the Americans. We showed
we could play with them. Now we just have to take the next step.''

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ You must understand, Dick Ebersol said, he
loves the Olympics. He relishes controlling the production, is
riveted by athletic sacrifice and adores his staff. He has worked
20-hour days, rarely seen his wife and his youngest son, and looks
as if he needs a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, finishes producing
the last prime-time broadcast at 3 p.m. on Monday, he said: ``I'll
be sad because it's over. I'd like it to go on for another week.''
</P>
<P>
   He insists that he is not depressed about lower-than-expected
ratings, nor is he frantic to change anything to resuscitate them.
He is astonished at criticism that he is carrying the Olympics on
tape from 15 to 18 time zones away and won't carry live events at 4
or 5 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media would love to have us treat the Olympics like a
basketball game: just tip it off and assume everyone knows
everything about the Olympics,'' he said Friday. ``But the reason
the Olympics are popular is that Roone Arledge decided in 1964 that
outside a core audience, Olympic sports don't have a core audience
in the U.S., so you can't treat them like any other sport.''
</P>
<P>
   This should be a time of lavish praise for Ebersol. It is not.
He will never receive the kudos accorded Arledge, his mentor at ABC
Sports, and still his guiding light. Arledge invented the Olympic
format that Ebersol has adopted, writ large, in the era of the
Internet, 100 or more cable channels and fractionalized viewer
interest. Arledge created the tape-delayed Olympics in a
three-network universe when the financial stakes were smaller and
mass audience easier to predict.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of hosannas for Ebersol is why he called his former
rival at CBS Sports, Neal Pilson, now an industry consultant, to
thank him for praising NBC's production and saying it is not
responsible for lower ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol laughed when he read in a newspaper column that he had
ruined the Olympics by carrying them on tape or was in trouble with
his bosses at General Electric for not delivering enough on the
$705 million Sydney rights fee. First, he said, the Games will
produce an estimated $80 million profit. Second, he said, ``You
can't get any more straightforward support than the chairman of
your company saying, `If you change a thing, I'll punch you in the
nose.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol is one of the smoothest executives in television, the
longest-serving of the network sports' division presidents, and the
most cognizant of shaping his public image. He is as fluent in the
language of production as he in the minutiae of Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every day in Sydney, usually in late afternoon, he has
emerged from his control room for 5 to 30 minutes, tired but
somehow energetic, loquacious, sometimes puffing a fetid cigar,
eager to fill the pads of an audience of reporters sometimes as
small as one.
</P>
<P>
   He has rarely disappointed. If he hasn't put the best possible
spin on the ratings, he has alerted his audience to a particular
feature. Repeatedly he has excoriated ``jealous'' newspaper editors
for assigning stories comparing NBC's taped Olympics to what he
calls the Canadian Broadcasting Co.'s ludicrous live ones without
reporting on the CBC's minuscule predawn ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But if you've missed those numbers, he has them ready for you in
a handout.
</P>
<P>
   He described newspaper bashing of his production as
``bloodsport,'' a result of being more immediate, even on tape,
than newspapers are from Sydney. ``I'm convinced that this is the
newest Olympic sport,'' he said. ``It goes on in the United States,
in Australia, in Europe. Editors have had a hard time getting used
to the dominance of television in the Olympics.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He cannot see how his production is failing viewers. Nightly
surveys, he said, produce viewer satisfaction of more than 90
percent, and he added, he is not framing the questions. He
confesses to underestimating the depressing impact of an Olympics
in September, when young people are returning to school, and adults
are returning from vacation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the September telecasts, he said, historically
high Olympic ratings from 11 p.m. to midnight have slumped. ``We
plateau at 11 o'clock, then the local news break hits, and you
could have live naked water polo and viewers won't come back for
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has minimized the effect of the Internet on viewing habits
and insists that until it is possible to wall off countries and
sell online rights the way television rights are sold; he will not
diminish his taped broadcasts with live video on his Web site,
nbcolympics.com.
</P>
<P>
   But Ebersol's strategy has been mocked in Australian newspapers
and on the ribald nightly Olympic recap program, ``The Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not letting it bother me much,'' he said. `` If I had any
sensitivity about it _ and it's far less than it was in Atlanta _ I
don't have any now.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Atlanta, he had superior ratings as a shield against
criticism of his production. Through Wednesday, NBC's average
Nielsen rating of a 14.5 and a 25 share is off 19 percent from the
1992 Barcelona and the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and 36 percent from the
22.5 and 42 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Each rating point equals slightly more than a million television
households and the share is the percentage of TV sets in use that
are tuned to a particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Costas, the prime-time host, said Ebersol had handled the
Sydney broadcasts with the same equanimity he brought to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very optimistic person with a sure sense of himself,''
he said. ``It's an understanding of what a leader does. There is no
flagging of spirits here. That's largely because of Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   As he looks ahead, Ebersol said, much of the Winter Games in
Salt Lake City will be carried live, but the Athens Summer Olympics
in 2004 will be on tape. ``Live doesn't work in Athens with its
seven-hour time difference,'' he said. ``Where would a final fit in
prime time? You'd have to run it in the middle of the night. Do you
wake an athlete up and send him to the stadium at 2 in the
morning?''
</P>
<P>
   And so, it seems, Ebersol is arming for another media lashing.

&HT;     PARADISE FOUND: A REFUGE FROM CELL PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ I'm going for the gold. It's down to the
quarterfinals. Wish me luck.
</P>
<P>
   The sport, a new one on the program at Sydney 2000, is Cell
Phone Avoidance. I've been in Australia three weeks now and haven't
used a cell phone once. That places me in a highly elite category
of Stone Age scribes who refuse to make concessions to this modern
world of ours.
</P>
<P>
   I hate cell phones. That makes me a misanthrope on a grand
scale, since I appear to be one of the few people left without one.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ring that annoys me. If it's not
``dee-da-lee-da-da-da-dee,'' it's ``Waltzing Matilda'' or the
``Charge of the Light Brigade'' or the theme from ``Godfather.''
Aarrrgh!
</P>
<P>
   Put 200 reporters in one room waiting for a press conference and
an eruption of cell-phone ringing results. This is all the more
infuriating since a sign on the door clearly states ``Please turn
off your mobile phones.''
</P>
<P>
   As a press conference is about to begin, the moderator politely
asks people to turn their phones off. Fat lot of good that does. As
the bronze medalist from Jamaica is explaining her race strategy,
several cell phones go off within seconds of one another.
</P>
<P>
   Civility and common sense give way to an overriding sense of
self-importance: ``I'm soooo important, I have to take this call;
never mind the press conference.''
</P>
<P>
   My abstinence is actually counter-productive and altogether dumb
because cell phones represent an easy way to communicate with the
folks back home. Nothing worth doing is worth doing easily, I say.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's a liberating feeling not being in touch. Don't
call me, I'll call you. Find me if you can, Jack.
</P>
<P>
   While cell phones at the Olympics make sense (nothing worth
doing is worth doing sensibly, I say), back home they seem little
more than a fashion accessory.
</P>
<P>
   Get in the car, punch up the cell phone and tell people you're
in your car. Go to a bar, punch up the cell phone and tell people
you're in the bar, then show your lack of proper grammar by saying
in a loud voice, ``Where you at?''
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Where are you?'' and where that is is a place I don't
want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Where I want to go is the top of the medal platform for the gold
in Cell Phone Avoidance. Wish me luck.

&HT;     TEXAS TROOPERS TAKING STEPS TO AVOID PROFILING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DARYL BELL and RUDOLPH BUSH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Amid growing national concern over racial
profiling, the Texas Department of Public Safety has acknowledged
that it has been keeping detailed information since March 1 about
the race and sex of all people stopped by state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   The results of this study should be released within two months,
department spokesman Tom Vinger said late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racial profiling is against DPS policy and we feel against the
(U.S.) Constitution and is illegal,'' Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Activists working to stop racial profiling praised that
statement and the study itself, but were concerned that the public
was not made aware sooner that such information is being gathered.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we're pleased they're doing it,'' said Will
Harrell, executive director of the Texas American Civil Liberties
Union in Austin. ``But I'll leave it to the philosophers if a tree
makes noise when it falls in the forest. As a member of the public,
I want to know if there is a problem. It's nice to know they're
taking a positive step, but it's a meaningless one if they don't
produce, analyze and publicize the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it seems like the DPS was hedging their bets. They
didn't want the public to know, especially if it raised a flag,
that they may have something to hide,'' Harrell said. ``The fact
they did it for some time and did not inform the public is
puzzling.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinger emphatically denied that the Department of Public Safety
was ``hedging its bets.'' He said the new record-keeping is in
response to growing public concern about racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't trying to sneak this under the radar,'' he said.
``Once we made a decision to gather the information it is by law
public record and it's going to come out sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping these records because it's a hot-button topic.
It's something the public is very interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the department has kept public records on the race
of people issued citations or involved in traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The racial breakdown, however, grouped whites and Hispanics
under one category.
</P>
<P>
   Now the agency is keeping tabs on all stops, including warning
tickets, and race is broken down into more specific categories _
primarily white, black, Hispanic and Asian.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Gov. George W. Bush said the governor supports
the policy. ``Governor Bush and the Department of Public Safety
absolutely do not tolerate law enforcement officers stopping people
simply because of their race or ethnicity,'' Linda Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   New laws requiring law enforcement officers to keep racial and
other demographic data on traffic stops have passed in Connecticut,
Kansas, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Missouri, Rhode Island,
Tennessee and Washington state.

&HT;     COP CREATES A COMPELLING TALE IN `JUDAS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union

<P>
   ``The Judas Judge,'' by Michael McGarrity. Read by Bruce
Greenwood. Abridged, approximately 4.5 hours. Simon &AMP; Schuster
Audio. $25.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem right that a retired law enforcement officer can
evolve into as skilled a writer as McGarrity. Even if it's a matter
of writing about what he knows best _ New Mexico, state police and
sex crimes _ he's doing it well.
</P>
<P>
   This is McGarrity's fifth novel in five years, all featuring
Kevin Kerney, who, like the author, is an accomplished cop looking
to retire. Yet, each time out McGarrity adds layers of complexity
to Kerney, making him more and more compelling. For example, we
learn (as does Kerney) in ``The Judas Judge'' that Kerney and a
Native American woman he went to college with produced a son, who
is also in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, McGarrity takes the reader/listener to the
sun-splashed vistas of New Mexico and its wide-open highways with a
feel for the land and an ability to express it in sparse detail
that take his books beyond mere police procedurals. He is a real
writer who surely will soon be recognized as such.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Half A Heart,'' by Rosellen Brown. Read by Jayne Atkinson and
Lisagay Hamilton. Abridged, approximately 6 hours. Simon &AMP; Schuster
Audio. $25.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the acclaimed author of ``Before And After'' and ``Tender
Mercies'' among other novels, has almost penned a compelling story
with ``Half A Heart.'' Almost.
</P>
<P>
   In brief, a white, upper-crust Houstonian tries to reunite with
the biracial child she gave birth to two decades ago, when she was
a graduate student in Mississippi in the 1960s. By letter, she is
able to reach the girl, now a high school graduate who was raised
in Brooklyn by her father, a math professor.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, mother and child, virtual strangers since the
girl was just a few months old, find it difficult to connect
emotionally. When they do bond, it is as if a made-for-TV movie has
seen its two hours end with conclusion that is emotionally
satisfying but feels forced and unlikely. Jayne Atkinson, the
primary reader, and Lisagay Hamilton, the voice of Ronnee, the
girl, add drama to a saga that seldom ventures beyond stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ``Monster,'' by Jonathan Kellerman. Read by John Rubinstein.
Abridged, approximately 5 hours. Random House AudioBooks. $25.
</P>
<P>
   Kellerman has deftly demonstrated for the better part of two
decades that a psychologist can craft thrillers every bit the equal
of the heralded lawyers making a small fortune as fiction writers.
</P>
<P>
   His alter ego, Dr. Alex Delaware, returns, for the 13th time, in
``Monster.'' This time out he's helping solve a series of bizarre
and brutal murders. The detective whom Delaware assists, Milo
Sturgis, is actually a more interesting character than the
protagonist, and if Kellerman had given him a greater share of the
stage ``Monster'' might be an even more interesting tale.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is maze-like, and Delaware's knack for following the
correct trail defies belief. Simpler would have been better, I
think.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein, a Tony Award winner for his performance in
``Children of a Lesser God'' and the reader for four previous
Kellerman works, is right at home here.

 &HT;    RESENDING TO CHANGE MINN. TO WIS. FOR RUSS FEINGOLD
 &HT;    COMMENTARY: No honor in scrapping ban on honoraria
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hard to believe, but the chief justice of the United States, of
all people, is pushing to return bribery to the federal judicial
system. No less than William H. Rehnquist himself is asking
Congress to scrap the 1989 ban on honoraria for Supreme Court
justices and most other federal jurists.
</P>
<P>
   And what is more, he has support for this curious notion from
some substantial part of the GOP caucus, though not, thank goodness
for small favors, from all. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kansas), chairman
of the Senate Ethics Committee, for one, opposes the move,
accurately calling it a ``retreat to the discredited practices of
the past,'' and Roberts's office is counting steadily increasing
numbers in opposition with him.
</P>
<P>
   The speaking fees were declared off limits when it became
apparent that for some judges the honoraria were little more than a
thin veil over raunchy influence-peddling. Corporations and
organizations with on-going and substantial legal interests _ trade
associations, ideological action groups and other special pleaders
_ were ponying fees in the thousands of dollars for the dubious
privilege of sitting at the feet of spouting federal jurists for a
half-hour or so.
</P>
<P>
   The judges seemed less chosen for their legal acumen and
entertaining way with words than for their strategic location in
courts likely to take up cases and issues of abiding interest to
the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist says it's necessary to let the speaking fees jingle
anew in judges' pockets to save the federal judiciary from
impending penury. If the judiciary has fallen on hard times, then
the proper and simple answer is to pitch for a pay raise, not to
ask Congress for a tin-cup franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Even the premise is iffy. Certainly jurists are losing out on
the white-hot oodles that partners in the big law firms are making
these days. Still, federal district judges make $141,300. Appellate
judges, $149,900, and Supreme Court justices $179,600.
</P>
<P>
   That's not exactly chump change, and the job has the best tenure
this side of death.
</P>
<P>
   Far from letting wink-and-nudge interests butter up judges with
speaking fees, Congress should be snapping up legislation
introduced by Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and Russ Feingold (D-Wis.)
to outlaw another practice that is equally compromising.
</P>
<P>
   Barred from larding judges with honoraria, the same sort of
sponsors have taken to setting up legal, ahem, seminars and then
paying for judges to attend and be wined, dined and spit-shined. By
a strange coincidence, these seminars are almost always held in
exotic places _ the Caribbean, Hawaii, resorts and prized golf
courses _ and never in, say, lecture halls at the local community
college.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the executive committee of the governing U.S.
Judicial Conference, which opposes the Kerry-Feingold bill, says
that ending the junkets would be a draconian intrusion into ``the
marketplace of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least he got the ``marketplace'' part right.

SPORTS COLUMN: DONT LOOK NOW, BUT THEY'VE CAUGHT UP 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ There should be no complaining now about the
result, the near shocking upset. No wingeing (whining), as they
like to say here. We wanted competition, didn't we? We've been
crying out for actual basketball contests of shooting and strength
and will, and not the dunk and pony shows that became so tedious
the minute Michael, Magic and Larry departed their grand Olympic
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of moaning about what Our Guys couldn't do on a night
the basketball world permanently readjusted its perception of
American dominance, how about we begin with what the Lithuanians
nearly did? How about that road stop of a country which in 1992
needed the Grateful Dead to chip in for uniforms so it could mark
its exit from Soviet stranglehold on the international sporting
stage?
</P>
<P>
   How about a population (3.7 million) that is less than Sydney's
waking up Saturday morning with the realization that its determined
collection of clashing consonants was a couple of heartbeats from
sending its opponent home as the Bad Dream Team? How about that
20-4 second-half run, as the Lithuanians sat back in the zone
defense, daring the Americans to make the jump shot? Years of
declining field goal percentages in our celebrated professional
league was the prophecy that our boys weren't going to convert
their jumpers here with any earthshaking regularity.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks here, Alonzo Mourning and Co. have been asking
people to stop comparing them to past U.S. teams, one in
particular, a most reasonable request. Yet at the same time,
Mourning also said that this team's defining trait was its defense,
and that Rudy Tomjanovich was coaching ``the greatest defensive
team ever.'' Excuse me, but was that a parade of Lithuanians,
French and Russians marching down the lane over the last several
days and, at times, scoring at will?
</P>
<P>
   The myth of the original Dream Team was that it was any kind of
team at all. In 1992, it was really an assemblage of great
individuals representing the 1980s, greatest of all basketball
decades. For the most part, those were the supremely talented
contemporary players who also had the fundamental skills of the
sport's more earthbound past. They stepped onto the court with a
pure sense of basketball intuition. They understood the game, its
ebb and flow, and when they sensed the time had come, they clamped
down defensively and the opponent would go eight or nine minutes
without scoring a point.
</P>
<P>
   The team staggering into Sunday afternoon's gold medal game
against France after an 85-83 semifinal victory Friday night was
just grateful it wasn't dead after Lithuania's best free throw
shooter clanked two of three late and crucial attempts. These guys
play with the least minute-to-minute continuity of any U.S. team
I've ever seen, and that includes the collegians who won the
Goodwill Games two years ago against some of these same
international outfits. If anything, Team 2000 is also a reflection
of the decade past. And with the exception of the Bulls, the 1990s
were about exciting but flawed players being marketed as the
transcendent superstars they were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sit here and make excuses and say we only won by two
points because Shaq wasn't here or Tim Duncan wasn't here,'' Vince
Carter said, composed again after he and the others on the U.S.
side looked as if they'd seen the Blair Witch in the game's final
minutes. Who's to say?
</P>
<P>
   Sure we can argue that if Shaquille O'Neal had come to Sydney,
Lithuania would not have been as close as it was. As earnest as he
is, Mourning has spent the last three playoff springs proving he is
not a dominant center, and in certain respects, is not a center at
all. O'Neal would be punishing these fellows but good, but he is
also the rarest of the physically gifted. So what are we saying?
The absence of one, even two, players from the big, bad USA is
enough to level the playing field against little ol' Lithuania?
</P>
<P>
   Based on Friday night, the close preliminary round game between
the two countries was no fluke. From the looks of things, the 21st
Century David Stern All Stars just aren't complete players enough
to be thrown together with a week's worth of practice in the
expectation that they will blow away teams that execute, shoot well
and _ most significantly _ are no longer in awe, or afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball has evolved in eight years,'' Carter said. ``My
expectation was just to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   True or not, what else could he say after running jubilantly off
the court with his index finger raised? On this night, he was just
happy to survive, to win at the Olympics, like all those other
athletes we've been saying we prefer.

 ON MOUNT WASHINGTON, `LOOK OUT, BELOW!'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mount Washington has always been a place of wonderful personal
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   I've been atop, geared with crampons and ice axe, when the winds
topped 100 miles per hour and exposed flesh froze instantly. Skied
the precipitous face of Tuckerman Ravine. Gulped water to avoid
dehydration in a hot summer climb out of Great Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Was I ever afraid on the mountain? Only once _ riding in a car,
driven by someone else, as it negotiated the steeps and switchbacks
of the Mount Washington Auto Road. Now there's an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   And it's an adventure that, foliage season upon us, many New
Englanders and vistors from away will attempt (weather permitting,
since it has been known to snow up there in the fall) in the weeks
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some things you ought to know before you go.
</P>
<P>
   You may have seen the bumper stickers that read, ``THIS CAR
CLIMBED MOUNT WASHINGTON.'' To that, I say big deal. They ought to
read, ``THIS CAR GOT DOWN MOUNT WASHINGTON.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because, with modern engines and better cooling systems,
overheating on the way up is not the threat it once was. Instead,
the dangers lurk in the descent, where the wrong transmission, bad
brakes, poor driving technique, or too heavy a load can lead to
dangerous runaways.
</P>
<P>
   The folks who run the Auto Road do all they can to protect you.
</P>
<P>
   A sign at the bottom warns that it is a steep, narrow mountain
road _ WITHOUT GUARDRAILS. Believe me, round a hairpin turn looking
right over the edge of an unguarded shoulder _ looking off into the
sky or down onto rocks above treeline _ and you might not feel
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell people that if they have a fear of heights, they might
not enjoy the experience,'' says Howie Weymms, general manager of
the Auto Road.
</P>
<P>
   They give you a pamphlet telling you how to drive the road _
note especially the part about using a low gear rather than your
brakes _ and they check your car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not your average Sunday drive,'' Weymms says is the
standard warning.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, there have been only two fatal wrecks in the history
of the road _ opened as the Carriage Road in 1861, first climbed by
auto in 1899 by an appropriately named Locomobile.
</P>
<P>
   The first was in 1880, when a drunk stage coach driver let his
team get away from him and a passenger was killed. Now there's a
refrain to echo down the ages: Don't drink and drive.
</P>
<P>
   The second was in 1984 when a Jeep Cherokee lost its brakes and
the driver tried to run out the journey to the flat fields at the
base. He hit the last tree on the way down and a passenger was
killed. See what I mean about being a passenger in a vehicle driven
by someone else. There's a pattern there.
</P>
<P>
   Running out failed brakes is not a good thing. If it happens to
you, drive onto an upslope off the side of the road, or dump your
car in a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think you're an expert so you don't need to pay
attention to the advice of those who know better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who thinks they're the greatest driver in the world
isn't,'' says Weymms.
</P>
<P>
   So you've been warned. But what about your car/van/truck/SUV?
</P>
<P>
   The Auto Road folks will check it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the car not from a mechanical standpoint, but from
the make and model,'' according to Weymms.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a car whose low/first-gear setting won't stay in
that gear on the way down _ that is automatically shifts out as you
gain speed _ and forces you to rely on your brakes, that car won't
be allowed to make the climb.
</P>
<P>
   Cars on this list include models from Honda, Saturn, Acura, and
Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, in fact, has quietly negotiated a deal with the Auto Road
management under which Honda pays for Honda owners denied access to
the Auto Road to ride up in tour vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Vans are suspect, mostly because of how much weight in people
and and gear they carry. Any pre-1996 Caravan, for instance, cannot
carry more than 600 pounds combined because Auto Road workers have
learned they overheat on the way up and burn up their brakes on the
way down.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs are also scrutinized _ because of their size, weight and
carrying capacities, and because of the attitudes of their drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Just as on the highways, many of these drivers feel privileged
and invulnerable. They forget that 7,000 runaway-pounds is 7,000
runaway pounds of deadly steel. A boulder or tree does not know
that that was a Chevy Suburban that just smacked it.
</P>
<P>
   Many SUV drivers, confident in their equipment, also have no
idea how to use that equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Waymms says, ``It's amazing how many people come out of the
cities in their SUVs who don't even understand their basic
mechanical gear.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto Road workers have been known to have to explain to some of
these folks how to shift their SUVs into low range, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   If you show up with too much weight packed into your vehicle,
there are secure lockers at the base of the Auto Road to offload
gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't believe us when we tell them that 150 pounds
makes a big difference, but it does,'' says Weymms.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the rules, use common sense, and you won't end up like
the Canadian couple who, in 1984, lost their brakes about a mile
above the toll house and tried to ride it out. They went through
the toll area approaching 60 miles per hour, crossed a field even
as they avoided a crowd at the bottom, leaped a river and landed on
the bank. Amazingly, there were no major injuries.

First lady 
For Jean Stapleton, it was an easy move from Dingbat to 'Eleanor'
... with plenty more in between 
By Valerie Kuklenski/Staff Writer 
There is something of a bygone time in Jean Stapleton that comes
through in little things, like the way she properly uses the
subjective ``one'' as in ``one would hope'' and little phrases like
``yes indeed.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Or the way she takes offense at an attempt to verify her age.
</P>
<P>
   It could be Stapleton's nature, or it could be the result of
having played Eleanor Roosevelt in the one-woman play ``Eleanor:
Her Secret Journey'' for more than 165 performances in Miami, San
Francisco and now at the Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going wonderfully, and of course this is an important
engagement because there are all these professional types, and if
you get their approval, it's very strengthening and encouraging,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She gives seven performances a week of the Rhoda Lerman play, in
which the former first lady reflects on the post-World War I years,
her husband's early political career and his affair with his social
secretary, which left Eleanor craving his attention and affection.
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton has made a long and successful career of a wide
variety of supporting roles on stage and screen, from the devoted
nurse in ``Romeo and Juliet'' and the spunky Aunt Eller in
``Oklahoma!'' to the campy medium in ``Blithe Spirit'' and her most
famous part, the ditsy yet wise Edith Bunker on the 1970s
breakthrough sitcom, ``All in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-woman show offers different challenges and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting and it's a wonderful exercise,'' she said.
``Of course it can't help but benefit one's growth as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's best answered by saying I don't plan to spend the rest of
my career doing a one-person show because I like to work with
people on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Stapleton will be taking the show to several more
cities (the tentative schedule includes Syracuse, N.Y.; Boston;
Palm Beach, Fla.; Houston; and San Diego) and hopes to land
off-Broadway next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleanor'' closes its four-week engagement at the Canon on Oct.
8, the same night Stapleton co-stars in the premiere of TNT's movie
``Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton plays the matriarch Byrd in the story of a family
still mourning an infant son's death when a baby girl named Sophie
is abandoned on their porch. Her mother's note says she loves the
baby and will come back for her someday, leaving the Malone family
torn between bonding with Sophie and trying to keep an emotional
detachment because of the inevitable separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby,'' based on the book by Patricia MacLachlan (``Sarah,
Plain and Tall''), stars Farrah Fawcett and Keith Carradine as the
parents and Alison Pill as their 12-year-old daughter, Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole story was so moving and so touching,''
Stapleton said. ``The script is so universal in how it deals with
family emotions. I was also attracted because Glenn Close was
connected to the project as an executive producer, and that was
enough for me. I knew then that the project would be quality.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the babies, multiple sets of towheaded twins portraying
Sophie's growth in a year, created some problems, especially one
child who seemed content only when Fawcett carried her around on
her hip, but they also delighted the cast and crew at the Nova
Scotia location.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one who was so outgoing, who's used most, the older one,
was so miraculous because she learned to speak during the shoot,''
Stapleton said. ``She started with one syllable here and there,
imitation. By the end of it she was speaking in sentences, and she
could name all our character names and with great joy she was
constantly calling them out. It was a miracle to watch this happen,
just marvelous.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her post-``Eleanor'' plans, Stapleton said she'll try
``whatever comes that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to do film, also theater,'' she said. ``A wonderful
play with people in it would be very satisfying. It's nice when one
can hop around in all the media, but the theater would be the place
I would care to stay for a long time, a long run if it's worthy.''
</P>
<P>
   In most New York productions that means eight shows a week, a
demanding schedule that wears out even the most vigorous actors.
That's where the age discussion comes up.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to confirm an almanac entry that gives her age as 77,
Stapleton bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never discuss age, nor do I confirm the accuracy of that.
It's a stereotype and it's not the right way to categorize people.
I think it's so wrong, so I don't indulge in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very bad for actors. It categorizes them and limits them.
I just disdain its use!''
</P>
<P>
   She paused. ``Nothing personal,'' she added with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   I replied that I was going to tell her she looked great for her
age, if in fact that age was accurate, but now I guessed I
wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, please,'' she said with a laugh. &QL;

THE WAGON YOUR FATHER WOULD HAVE WANTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's that eternal question we all face: When do we give up
living for the box?
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm not talking life and death. I'm talking finally having
to sell that sporty two-seater or the zippy sedan for a station
wagon that will, with practicality, haul all that we have
accumulated in life _ outdoor gear, kids, pets or, dare it be
spoken, grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo has just made the transition easier, though describing it
in a phrase is difficult. Has Volvo been taken out of the box, or
has the box been taken out of Volvo?
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 V70 T5 wagon, you see, is a rounded, gentle automobile
with the hauling capacity _ spacewise and powerwise _ of some
thumping SUVs. It remains rock solid in construction, but soft
exterior lines and a plush interior erase the stereotype of a
pipe-smoking, bearded gent driving a stiff but sensible box from
campus to chautauqua.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great car for the youthful (we're purposely not saying
young here) driver, offering that certain je ne c'est quoi that
says, ``Hey, I'm not old yet. Watch this baby go.''
</P>
<P>
   So fill it with your mountain climbing gear, your tents, your
fishing poles, your soccer balls, your weekend lumber. Cover its
roof with mountain bikes and kayaks. Fill its seats and cargo space
with toddlers and their diapers. Then kick back and enjoy the
sporty ride.
</P>
<P>
   That comes from the 2.3-liter 247-horsepower, inline 5-cylinder
turbocharged engine _ one of three engine options on the V70 _ that
delivers more bang than you'd expect in a station wagon, and more
than you'll find in a lot of sedans. The other engines are a
2.4-liter light-pressure turbo delivering 197 horses and a normally
aspirated 170-horse unit for those seeking the environmental high
ground with an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Enter this wonderfully rounded wagon, knowing that power will be
there for you whatever your load, and settle into the front leather
bucket seats. Legroom in vast, headroom the same, and the seats
themselves are armchair comfortable, but with stiff support up the
sides for those lateral challenges you'll face when you feel a
little sporty.
</P>
<P>
   It's billed as a five-passenger car (an optional third bench can
be installed in the rear cargo area), but more practically seats
four adults, given the hump in the middle of the rear bench seat.
Passengers back there will find good head- and legroom as well.
</P>
<P>
   This is a well-thought-out car. It has big buttons for climate
and sound control. Bins in the doors are divided into
subcompartments. The center console has two storage layers. The
glove box is divided. There are two pockets layered into the rear
of each of the front seats. And in the rear, folding out of the
floor of the cargo area, rises a grocery bag holder, winged,
netted, and bungeed to keep that yogurt and fruit from flying about
if you're feeling sporty even on the way home from shopping.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable thing about the Volvo is that, even though shorter
than European counterparts _ BMW 5 Series, the BMW X5, the Saab
9-6, or even Ford's Taurus, its cargo space is vast. Nearly 40
cubic feet behind the front seats. More than 70 cubic feet with
those seats folded down. If a full-blown, big SUV is not the car
for your, this Volvo may be. It's front-wheel drive, but if you
want it in all-wheel drive, there's the Cross Country version
hitting the market.
</P>
<P>
   Given its hauling capacity, if you plan to fill it up with
family and gear and go, you'll appreciate the turbo-charged engine.
The light-pressure turbo will give you boost when needed and you
may never even notice when it kicks in. It will likely be that
subtle. The regular turbo, this T5 was also subtle in activation,
yet distinct when the power kicked in. Aided by continuously
variable valve timing, it provided torque across a wide band of
RPMs (though the first few seconds of acceleration from a dead stop
are nothing special). But the latter is not what we're looking for
here. Solid power is, however, and the Volvo delivers that in
abundance, even while managing just over 20 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The ride can be a bit stiff, but given that you'll likely be
carrying big loads and you're handling all that power into corners,
that is a good thing. You don't need boaty body roll and dip in a
rig like this. Wouldn't want those bikes and kayaks swaying atop
the car in your pursuit of youthful exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension keeping it all in line has independent struts,
coil springs, and antiroll bar up front, and, at the rear, fully
independent multilink, also with coil springs and antiroll bar.
</P>
<P>
   Stability control _ limiting torque to spinning wheels _ and
enhanced ABS add to safer control.
</P>
<P>
   And this being Volvo, it is, of course, still built like a steel
box, with unit body construction, and airbags all around _ front,
side, and head airbags (with whiplash protection) and curtain bags
in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   This Volvo is part of a broad revolution taking place in the
auto industry today.
</P>
<P>
   Station wagons are becoming more SUV-like even as manufacturers
introduce new SUVs that address the complaints of those who say the
big beasts are dangerous, environmentally unfriendly, even
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to watch those lines blur over the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we'll watch cars like the Volvo V70, the
Beemers, the Saabs, and others roam the highways offering some of
the best features of each.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch
</P>
<P>
   --The positioning of vents in the center door posts. What a fine
use of hollow, dead space. Each outer rear passenger can now direct
air flow from a shoulder-high opening.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance
</P>
<P>
   --Placement of the cell phone jack to the right of the center
console. If you're plugged in, you'll find the cord continually
getting snagged on the shifter.

   &QL; 
The title fits, and he looks like one, too &QL; 
By David Kronke &QL; 
Who expected we'd be looking back so soon on the antics of MTV's
taste-impaired ``The Tom Green Show'' with a whiff of nostalgia for
its relative innocence? At its wildest, ``Jackass'' really defies
rational thought regarding what people will do to be on TV. Here's
how extreme this is: Repeatedly throughout the show, MTV airs this
disclaimer ``MTV insists that neither you or any of your dumb
little buddies attempt the dangerous crap in this show.''
</P>
<P>
   Host Johnny Knoxville (well, it's better than his real name,
P.J. Clapp) subjects himself to some fairly horrific and sometimes,
horrifically funny abuse. Like Green, he's a skateboard fan, so
there's some random thrashing, and some puerile silliness involving
cracking up shopping carts and bicycles, but that's just padding to
get to the stuff you'll be hearing about even if you can't imagine
watching the show.
</P>
<P>
   Knoxville allows himself to be hit head-on with pepper spray, a
stun gun and a Taser gun (his articulate response to each:
``(Expletive)!'' or ``(Expletive)in' hell!'') and discovers that
pepper spray is the worst. No, wait the worst is standing in a
well-stocked porta-potty when it's turned upside-down. Feel free to
die now basic-cable television can't possibly get any more
outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, though, Knoxville and his posse of pranksters
recall that line from ``This Is Spinal Tap,'' about the thin line
between clever and stupid. There are Green-style gags, like having
a trussed-up, nearly naked guy escape from the trunk of a car in
public, that are more about simple shock value than actual
inventiveness. As with Green's show, this kind of act has a fairly
brief shelf life before it becomes moldy, but unlike Green, there's
nothing witty about Knoxville beyond his being highly attuned to
his masochistic streak he's not funny unless he's being debased;
his responses to said debasement aren't clever or amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's very happy to humiliate himself most abjectly for
our amusement, so who are we to turn our heads? &QL; 
---``JACKASS'' &QL; 
What: Self-flagellation at its finest host Johnny Knoxville
subjects himself to much pain and suffering for laughs. &QL; 
Where: MTV. &QL; 
When: 9 p.m. Sundays. &QL; 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars &QL;

<P>
   LEE-GRANT-VIEWS (Undated) _ For the better part of the last
century the images of two of the greatest icons of the Civil War
remained fixed in the American imagination: Robert E. Lee as the
brilliant tactician fighting against overwhelming odds, and Ulysses
S. Grant as the heavy-drinking butcher who used the North's
superior resources to grind down the South. Those characterizations
are now being challenged by a string of books that are both more
admiring of Grant and more skeptical of Lee than would have seemed
imaginable only a short time ago. By Janny Scott.
</P>
<P>
   MACHINES-HUMANIZED (Undated) _ Technological fears and hopes are
now focused less on machines with moving parts than on electronic
objects that don't have any moving parts at all. Machinery _ real,
moving, mechanical machinery _ has come to seem almost amiably
old-fashioned, less like something out of Charlie Chaplin's
``Modern Times'' and more like the fussy C-3PO of ``Star Wars.''
Machines now seem closer to the human world than the technological
one. A comic, nostalgic and admiring accommodation now seems to be
developing between moving contraptions and their creators. By
Edward Rothstein.
</P>
<P>
   DYING-LANGUAGES (Undated) _ In the face of doubts and many
difficulties, the revival of indigenous languages is a growing
movement among American Indian groups, and it is fast becoming a
new subspecialty in the field of linguistics as well. By Alexander
Stille.

   GLEANERS-FILM-REVIEW (New York) _ ``The Gleaners and I'' takes

   POLLOCK-FILM-REVIEW (New York) _ Ed Harris' powerful
biographical film, ``Pollock,'' may be the first movie about a
painter to transcend the gushy cliches found in movies that try to
unravel the mysteries of artistic creation. It helps, of course,
that Jackson Pollock, the abstract expressionist giant whom Harris
portrays with a riveting blend of pent-up passion and unleashed

Two presidential candidates, two political dynasties &QL; 
By David Kronke &QL; 
Sure, the new fall season begins tonight, but we're electing a
president this year, and ``Frontline'' offers fairly useful
biographies of Al Gore and George W. Bush on ``The Choice 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   To folks not born into political dynasties, this year's decision
has to be a fairly deflating one, powerfully suggesting as it does
that a ruling class has in fact emerged in America. Both
candidates' families have led lives of privilege and power, which
might make it difficult for the rest of us to shoehorn our own
aspirations into the old-boys club called Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Choice 2000'' implies that virtually everything Gore has
done in his life outside of some recreational pot use has had an
eye on political placement (his enlisting for service in Vietnam
was even exploited by his father's senatorial campaign in the
'70s). Footage in which Gore proudly allies himself with tobacco
growers is eventually juxtaposed against his attack on Big Tobacco.
His intelligence, however, is never called into question.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, everything Bush has accomplished in his life can be
chalked up to his daddy's brand name, as Dubya has made a practice
of failing upward. Ironically, when his father was running against
Michael Dukakis in 1988, the younger Bush warned gravely against
electing an inexperienced governor president. He is, nonetheless,
shown to be a guy who knows how to use his wry sense of humor to
get things accomplished (amusingly, he ran a pointedly corrupt
stickball league in prep school).
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that the next president will have to prove
himself ``substantial enough, authentic enough to lead.'' ``Choice
2000'' sort of splits the difference Gore, it shows, is clearly the
substantial one, while Bush is posited as the more authentic of the
two. &QL;

'King' fell off its throne with this episode &QL; 
By David Kronke &QL; 
Hank Hill and the family make a, well, not so special but
particularly timely pre-season appearance on ``King of the Hill''
tonight. Hank's considering the upcoming presidential election he's
expecting his man, George W. Bush, to walk away with it all,
particularly if he can get dim-bulb Luanne to quit babbling about
the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   When Hank and the brood are invited to a Bush rally (Bobby
heroically rescues that proud Texas tradition, a diving pig, from
drowning in a pool), the man who makes propane his life is deflated
to discover his hero has a weak handshake. It's such a devastating
revelation he opts not to vote come Election Day: ``With voter
turnout at all-time lows, not voting makes me more American,'' he
tries to convince himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a particularly rich addition to the Hill canon. The
laughs, such as they are, are often forced, and the effort, however
backhanded, to do a little flag-waving for the democratic process
rings hollow. ``King of the Hill'' has managed to blend wry comedy
and poignancy in the past, but here, neither quality seems
particularly interested in coming to the fore. &QL;

The show's better than the title &QL; 
By David Kronke &QL; 
What TV show, save for maybe the ultra-contrived reality series
``Big Brother,'' couldn't use ``That's Life'' for a title?
Fortunately, there's more creativity at work in the show itself
than in its moniker.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Paige Kent stars as Lydia, a 32-year-old Jersey girl who
suddenly discovers what a lout her boyfriend is when he resists her
efforts to enlist in college. She's the all-around sort of guardian
angel who takes care of both the drunks in the bar where she works
and the neighborhood's stray cats.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia's ex isn't the only one with doubts her parents (Paul
Sorvino and Ellen Burstyn) and pals (Debi Mazar and Kristin Bauer)
have their doubts, as well, even though it's eminently clear that
street-smart Lydia is the glue holding this little community
together. Her first day at school is fraught with cutesy mishaps,
from an epic bad-hair day to sputtering car troubles. And oops! the
drunk she cuts off in her bar just happens to be her psych prof.
But nothing keeps our Lydia from giving lip to any highfalutin
diploma-waver this school can toss at her.
</P>
<P>
   CBS compares ``That's Life'' to ``Working Girl'' and ``Educating
Rita,'' but what it most resembles but don't tell anybody is
``Costello,'' Fox's short-lived sitcom from a few years back about
another mouthy dame who dumps her squeeze for a life of the mind.
Fortunately, this incarnation is exponentially less shrill than its
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's premiere episode is crammed with so many quirky
touches and characters that at times you feel exhausted on the show
producers' behalf. It's clearly a case of trying too hard, a
condition that no doubt will be resolved in due time. But at least
they're putting forth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Kent's an appealing performer, fully capable of
carrying this show until the ensemble cast gels and actually begins
to look like everyone really has known one another for years.
</P>
<P>
   ---``THAT'S LIFE'' &QL; 
What: Dramedy about a Jersey girl all grown up and attending
college in her 30s. &QL; 
The stars: Heather Paige Kent, Ellen Burstyn, Kristin Bauer, Peter
Firth, Kevin Dillon, Paul Sorvino, Debi Mazar. &QL;

   AMMAN, Jordan _ Arabs might get in trouble for criticizing their
leaders on the streets of many Middle Eastern capitals, but now
they can get on the Internet and join in with ``Mock the
Governments.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one offering of an Arabic satire page on ``Al-Bawaba,'' a
new Internet portal not unlike the more familiar Yahoo!.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Bawaba users can also go to the ``relationships'' English
bulletin board to discuss taboo subjects in Arab society. There,
one writer named Rania asks, ``Why are men in the Arab world
allowed premarital relations and then women not?''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Bawaba, meaning ``The Gateway,'' opened over the summer as
the latest of several major Arab Internet service providers, or
ISPs, providing mostly unfettered news, chat and links to sites
around the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   The still fledgeling Al-Bawaba joins the early Internet pioneer
Arabia.com, and the youth-oriented Planet Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Together, by being objective news gatherers and hosts for
bulletin boards, they are pushing the limits of free speech in a
region where dissenters from political or religious conventions are
often jailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sort of relief valve for people to say things they have
not been able to say or that have not been heard,'' said Daoud
Kuttab, director of the Institute for Modern Media at the
Palestinian Al-Quds University in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new ISPs are testing the economic waters
in an industry that is volatile enough even in America. In the
Middle East, computers are just catching on for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a mixture of modern technology, strategic planning and
entrepreneurial nerve.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Al-Bawaba's main editorial office is here in Amman,
where a few dozen journalists sit in modern work pods in the new
Merrill Lynch building. But the company is registered in Delaware
and its directors are in New York, giving it a foreign status that
could help insulate it from any attempts to control the content.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the satire page, Al-Bawaba intends to publish
literature and articles that have been banned in some countries.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the Web sites say that governments are already
finding out that the Internet is tough to patrol, much less
control. While some sites are blocked by the monopoly government
server in Syria, for example, users have learned to easily hack
their way through.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some governments seem more willing to give Internet speech
a wider freedom than, say, local newspapers or radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have resisted sacrificing or compromising the way we think
people ought to be able to communicate,'' said Osama El-Sharif,
editor in chief of Jordan-based Arabia.com. ``Eventually, it is not
us who will be changed, but the way the authorities will view
things that will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the main obstacle to success at the Arab Web sites
may be the same as that faces in the freewheeling Western Internet
world _ money.
</P>
<P>
   Even American ISPs and Web portals are cutting back and facing
advertising shortages. The Arab sites, meanwhile, have to carve out
a niche in a much smaller computer world.
</P>
<P>
   The Nua Internet Survey, used by the U.S. Department of Commerce
for on-line estimates, reports that only about 2 million of the
more than 270 million Arabs in the Middle East have regular
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   There is potential for growth. Though home computers are too
expensive for most Arabs, Internet cafes are flourishing in Jordan,
Egypt and Lebanon. Palestinians, exposed to computers in the
Western countries where many have made homes, help spread the word
and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Money for Al-Bawaba and Arabia.com comes mainly from a mix of
Arab conglomerates. One of Arabia.com's chief investors is hi-tech
savvy Saudi billionaire Prince al Waleed bin Talal bin Abdul Aziz
al Saud.
</P>
<P>
   Investors look toward a future that the Nua survey group says
could see 12 million Arab users in this region the next two years.
But, for now, the Web sites compete for a small pool of users and,
therefore, skeptical advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   El-Sharif says Arabia.com users click on 33 million of its pages
every month. But, he estimates that nearly half of its 300,000
regular users are Arab Americans. The 5-year-old Web site does not
expect to see any profits for another couple years.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to increase the audience, Arabia.com this month
launched a million-dollar ad campaign plugging the site throughout
the region, from newspapers in Egypt to billboards in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are targeted at young people. Not only are they open to
new technology, El-Sharif says, but they will become used to free
speech and spread the word as they mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the ones who will affect change in the future,'' he
says.

<P>
   Joey Lauren Adams, now seen with Minnie Driver in ``Beautiful,''
is an actress, but what she really wants to do is write. And write
and write and write.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who was the object of Ben Affleck's desire in Kevin
Smith's ``Chasing Amy,'' is enthusiastic about how much fun she has
had writing her first screenplay. The story is built around
characters much like her own family in North Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   If someday the movie is made, she envisions herself starring and
says that male lead would be her soulmate, if only he really
existed. Although she got off to a slow start with the project, it
now seems to have its own momentum as she nears completion of her
first draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'll be writing and it's like, 'Slow down, guys.'
They (her characters) just start going, and it's not even anything
I planned or thought about them saying,'' Adams said. ``I'm
writing, and I'm saying, 'Guys, you're going to Granny's for
dinner,' and they're like, 'No we're not, we're going out for a
drink.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although Adams, who received a Golden Globe nomination for
``Amy'' and starred opposite Adam Sandler in ``Big Daddy,'' said
she would be happy to work again with her ``Beautiful'' director
Sally Field, she's not sure whether she'll show this script to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really small movie. I don't know if she wants to
rough it in Arkansas, you know what I mean? We're going to be
staying on Granny's couch,'' she laughed. ``I don't know if I could
ask Sally to do that.'' &QL;

   AMMAN, Jordan _ Arabs might get in trouble for criticizing their
leaders on the streets of many Middle Eastern capitals, but now
they can get on the Internet and join in with ``Mock the
Governments.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one offering of an Arabic satire page on ``Al-Bawaba,'' a
new Internet portal not unlike the more familiar Yahoo!.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Bawaba users can also go to the ``relationships'' English
bulletin board to discuss taboo subjects in Arab society. There,
one writer named Rania asks, ``Why are men in the Arab world
allowed premarital relations and then women not?''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Bawaba, meaning ``The Gateway,'' opened over the summer as
the latest of several major Arab Internet service providers, or
ISPs, providing mostly unfettered news, chat and links to sites
around the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   The still fledgeling Al-Bawaba joins the early Internet pioneer
Arabia.com, and the youth-oriented Planet Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Together, by being objective news gatherers and hosts for
bulletin boards, they are pushing the limits of free speech in a
region where dissenters from political or religious conventions are
often jailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sort of relief valve for people to say things they have
not been able to say or that have not been heard,'' said Daoud
Kuttab, director of the Institute for Modern Media at the
Palestinian Al-Quds University in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new ISPs are testing the economic waters
in an industry that is volatile enough even in America. In the
Middle East, computers are just catching on for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a mixture of modern technology, strategic planning and
entrepreneurial nerve.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Al-Bawaba's main editorial office is here in Amman,
where a few dozen journalists sit in modern work pods in the new
Merrill Lynch building. But the company is registered in Delaware
and its directors are in New York, giving it a foreign status that
could help insulate it from any attempts to control the content.

   WOMEN-BOXERS _ (New York) _ At the April Golden Gloves
championships in Madison Square Garden, nearly 20 percent of the
entrants were women. Nationally, there are than 1,500 amateur and
400 professional female boxers, including the headline-grabbing
daughters of Mohammad Ali, Joe Frazier and George Foreman. Now a
new new wave of books and movies about women's boxing is giving the
sport a cultural context. The writers are educated women who also
box. ``They say that men box to get out of the ghetto,'' said Kate
Sekules, author of ``The Boxers Heart.'' ``I joke that boxing was
my way into the ghetto.'' (Eds: also see FILM-GIRLFIGHT) and
FILM-GIRLFIGHT-REVIEW.)  &QL;

   GUCCI-MISTRESS (New York) _ The former mistress of the late
Maurizio Gucci has been described as the single ``ray of sunshine''
in Gucci's life, which ended when his wife had him killed in 1995.
Now the mistress, Sheree McGlaughlin Loud, a former model,
describes her six-year relationship with Gucci, whom she met during
preliminaries for the 1984 America's Cup regatta. Loud said Gucci
suspected his wife was trying to poison him, but she just dismissed
it as too bizarre. ``All that belongs to another world,'' she said.
``And I was another person...'' Now she is married, expecting a
child and is communications director for Giorgio Armani's Le
Collezioni label.
</P>
<P>
   By Ruth La Ferla.
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH-FASHION (London) _ Cathy Horyn, the Times fashion critic
asks, ``Whatever became of London's surly, shoe-string
inventiveness?'' The recent shows were not worth getting out of bed
for, let alone crossing the Atlantic. There were moments of honest
fun (Matthew Williamson's raunchy skirts with rhinestone-flocked
baseball sweaters), but mostly what Horyn noticed were designers
mired in 1980s revivalism. Notable exceptions she writes were
Hussein Chalayan and Alexander McQueen, who alluded to images of
trauma and insanity in their shows last week. By Cathy Horyn.

   CLASSIC-CARS (New York ) _ The Louis Vuitton Classic at
Rockefeller Center, an annual event since 1995, is an exhibition of
50 of the world's rarest classic cars. According to the New York
City Police, last year's event drew 2 million spectators. This year
Murray Livingstone Smith, the show's curator, came up with another
classic event, the New York Style Awards with celebrities to judge
the cars. The 1940 Duesenberg won for A Night on the Town. The dark
green Rolls Royce won for Timeless Style Regardless of Age. Most
Surprising was the silver 1936/37 Dubonnet Hispano and Most Like to
Own was the 1953 Ferrari 342 America. By Alex Witchel, who
personally preferred the Lancia.

<P>
   CUSTO-FASHION-SPANISH (Undated) _ Custodio Dalmau, better known
as Custo, had his creative epiphany on a California beach. ``I saw
the first printed T-shirt in my life,'' he recalled. ``It existed
in Europe as a means for publicity, to advertise something, but not
as a fashion statement... It was the experience of my life.'' Today
Dalmau's snug-fitting psychedelic T-shirts decorated with images of
party girls are the marquee items of a moderately priced clothing
line that has a cult following. Customers line up for the
designer's personal appearances and to have him autograph their
t-shirts. By Elizabeth Hayt.
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-DEFELITTA-RISPOLI (New York) _ The talk on a jaunt
through Manhattan with Raymond De Felitta and Michael Rispoli was:
bars we have known and loved, bars we have worked in, bartenders we
miss, bars we miss, drinks we miss, bars where we fell in love and
the movie, ``Two Family House,'' which is about a bar. Raymond De
Felitta, the director and writer, had an uncle named Buddy, who
wanted to buy a place in Staten Island, live upstairs, and open a
bar where he could sing for customers. To play Buddy, De Felitta
chose Michael Rispoli, an actor who once worked as a bartender. In
this Night Out With ... column, they discover they have some bars
in common. By Linda Lee.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ The author loses restraint at bulb
bins, particularly when it comes to hyacinths. In the heyday of
hyacinths, the late 19th century, hundreds of varieties were on the
market. In 1872, the writer notes, one catalog listed 60 blues. Few
suppliers sell more than two dozen varieties; the author includes a
box on where the best can be bought. By Marty Ross.

<P>
   LEE-GRANT-VIEWS (Undated) _ For the better part of the last
century the images of two of the greatest icons of the Civil War
remained fixed in the American imagination: Robert E. Lee as the
brilliant tactician fighting against overwhelming odds, and Ulysses
S. Grant as the heavy-drinking butcher who used the North's
superior resources to grind down the South. Those characterizations
are now being challenged by a string of books that are both more
admiring of Grant and more skeptical of Lee than would have seemed
imaginable only a short time ago. By Janny Scott.

   With photo NYT9.
</P>
<P>
   MACHINES-HUMANIZED (Undated) _ Technological fears and hopes are
now focused less on machines with moving parts than on electronic
objects that don't have any moving parts at all. Machinery _ real,
moving, mechanical machinery _ has come to seem almost amiably
old-fashioned, less like something out of Charlie Chaplin's
``Modern Times'' and more like the fussy C-3PO of ``Star Wars.''
Machines now seem closer to the human world than the technological
one. A comic, nostalgic and admiring accommodation now seems to be
developing between moving contraptions and their creators. By
Edward Rothstein.
</P>
<P>
   DYING-LANGUAGES (Undated) _ In the face of doubts and many
difficulties, the revival of indigenous languages is a growing
movement among American Indian groups, and it is fast becoming a
new subspecialty in the field of linguistics as well. By Alexander
Stille.

</P>
<P>
   TABOO-FILM-REVIEW (New York) _ Nagisa Oshima's elegant
historical film ``Gohatto'' recycles a familiar metaphor _ male
homosexuality as a symbol of ``decadence'' _ that is so loaded with
dramatic implication it simply refuses to die. Reviewed by Stephen
Holden.
</P>
<P>
   GLEANERS-FILM-REVIEW (New York) _ ``The Gleaners and I'' takes
its title, and some of its inspiration, from an 1867 painting by
Jean-Francois Millet that shows three women in a wheat field. The
painting itself shows up early in Agnes Varda's wonderful new
documentary, thronged by camera-wielding tourists. Reviewed by A.O.
Scott.
</P>
<P>
   POLLOCK-FILM-REVIEW (New York) _ Ed Harris' powerful
biographical film, ``Pollock,'' may be the first movie about a
painter to transcend the gushy cliches found in movies that try to
unravel the mysteries of artistic creation. It helps, of course,
that Jackson Pollock, the abstract expressionist giant whom Harris
portrays with a riveting blend of pent-up passion and unleashed
physicality, threw his entire body into his work. Reviewed by
Stephen Holden.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPHOR-FILM-REVIEW (New York) _ Bahman Farmanara's ``Smell of
Camphor, Fragrance of Jasmine'' has a pixilated charm and, under
the surface, a current of despair. Reviewed by Elvis Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   SEVEN-FILM-REVIEW (New York) _ At times ``Seven Men from Now,''
the compact and efficient 1956 Budd Boetticher Western starring
Randolph Scott, plays like a work by Harold Pinter. Reviewed by
Elvis Mitchell
</P>
<P>
   LOVE-FILM-REVIEW (New York) _ ``It is a restless moment. Hong
Kong 1962,'' reads a title card at the beginning of ``In the Mood
for Love,'' and a restiveness that's almost voluptuous fills the
movie. Reviewed by Elvis Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON-SYMPHONY-CENTENARY (Boston) _ The Boston Symphony has
learned something from Carnegie Hall: Instead of renovating before
the centenary, and risking having the celebration marred by worries
about what had happened to the acoustics, it is having the party
first and doing the maintenance work later. The centenary party
takes place in two weeks, in the days leading up to the anniversary
of the hall's opening, Oct. 15. By Allan Kozinn.

 &HT;     LINCOLN: `WHO's BEEN SLEEPING IN MY BED?'
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _Poor Mr. Lincoln. There have been so many visitors
sleeping in his seven-foot bed.
</P>
<P>
   It's fine and proper to have overnight guests in the lonely
White House, but there is a strong perception that some of the
hospitality offered by President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
has been offered for a price.
</P>
<P>
   The White House acknowledges that many of the major donors to
the first lady's Senate campaign coffers have been invited to spend
the night.
</P>
<P>
   When the story first broke after the 1996 election that 938
persons, including many political donors, had been invited to sleep
in the Lincoln suite during Clinton's first term, I asked
then-press secretary Mike McCurry if the White House were for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' McCurry replied sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism that the Clintons have turned the White House
into a bed and breakfast for political contributors, it appears
that the first couple apparently sees nothing wrong in putting the
Lincoln Bedroom on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the historic rooms represent hallowed ground. On the
wall of the Lincoln suite there is a picture of the Civil War
president reading the Emancipation Proclamation to his Cabinet.
Lincoln signed the proclamation in that room.
</P>
<P>
   Also on a wall is a copy of the Gettysburg Address, which
Lincoln signed and donated for the benefit of the Civil War
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the White House released the names of 404 persons
who have stayed overnight at the Executive Mansion or Camp David
since the first lady launched her Senate campaign in July 1999. It
turns out that about 100 of the houseguests have chipped into her
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if there was any link between the White House slumber
guests and their donations to Hillary Clinton's campaign, press
secretary Joe Lockhart said: ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are friends, public officials and supporters to whom
they wanted to extend the opportunity to stay with them in their
home,'' he added. ``Any suggestion to the contrary is false and
unsupportable.''
</P>
<P>
   When quizzed, the first lady took the same tack. They have lots
of friends and supporters ``who spend time with us, spend the night
with us,'' she said, adding that the vast majority of guests had
not contributed to her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is particularly newsworthy,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chutzpah,'' an expression the first lady has adopted, comes to
mind when one considers that such transactions cheapen the White
House. Where is the reverence for this stately mansion that
represents so much to Americans? Apparently the appearance of a
payoff does not bother the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   The president loves showing his guests the Lincoln Bedroom and
the other historic rooms in the family quarters, which are not on
the regular visitor tours. On the same floor is the Treaty Room,
which was decorated by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and is used as a
private office by presidents. The nearby Queen's Room is also a
guestroom.
</P>
<P>
   Every president I've covered has said ``the White House belongs
to the American people.'' Clinton and other presidents like to quip
that they live in public housing. I have never heard a president
say the White House belongs to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, other presidents have invited major campaign donors
to functions at the White House and certainly have had friends and
relatives spend the night there. Former Presidents Ronald Reagan
and George Bush hosted many private gatherings in the Executive
Mansion for the deep-pocket members of the ``President's Club'' to
thank them for their generosity.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, a number of celebrities have enjoyed the Clinton
hospitality without having to fork over money to the first lady's
campaign, including former President Jimmy Carter, and King Juan
Carlos of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   So far none of the houseguests seems to have encountered the
legendary ghost of Lincoln who, in years past, was said to be heard
clumping down the hallway in his heavy boots. But we don't want to
scare away any potential guests-or donors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the self-designated ``cheerleader-in-chief,'' President
Clinton is on a roll these days, captivating his audiences at
fundraisers with nostalgic anecdotes. During one Washington
fundraiser recently, he recalled he had worked in Texas in the 1972
campaign for the losing Democratic presidential candidate George
McGovern against Richard Nixon. He said he would never forget
hopping on a plane in Dallas to go home to Little Rock when a
businessman asked him what he was doing. When he told the man he
was working for McGovern in Texas, Clinton said the man ``looked at
me, didn't crack a smile, and he said, `You know you're the only
white man I ever met for McGovern.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later while the Watergate scandal hearings were
underway, Clinton said his phone rang ``and it was this guy on he
phone. He had kept my card and he said: `I just called to tell you,
you were right and I was wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton apparently expects to have a lot of time for
reading in the next several weeks. On a recent trip to California
he dropped by a bookstore and left with a bag of books, including
Thomas Perry's ``Vanishing Act''; Tom Clancy's ``The Bear and the
Dragon,'' Michael Lerner's ``The Spirit Matters,'' Pat Many's ``The
Roosevelt Preserve,'' Margaret Mahoney's ``Saving the Soul of
Medicine'' and Jeff Shaara's ``Gone for Soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was prominently displayed in the store, he shunned
``The Breach'' by Washington Post correspondent Peter Baker. It's
the story of Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is working for his wife Hillary's election to a U.S.
Senate seat from New York, but he also is on a relentless travel
schedule to help Democrats win back the House and the Senate this
year. House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt says Clinton has
attended 137 fundraisers for the House, the Senate and the
Democratic National Committee. ``No other president in history has
come that close to that kind of industry to win the House, to win
the Senate,'' said Gephardt.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Marion Jones stood on the runway, blew air
from her cheeks and shook her arms as if she were shivering on this
hot, windy night at the Olympics. This was her sixth and final long
jump. She crouched and swung her arms, then she leaned back, hopped
slightly and began her final urgent sprint toward history.
</P>
<P>
   Her form on the runway was awkward as usual, her strides
chopped, her technique unreliable. She looked exactly like what she
was, a sprinter trying to master the long jump. No other woman
possesses her immense speed, however, and when Jones landed with a
sandy jolt she was 24 feet from the takeoff board. She had hoped
for one big jump and this was it, clearly the longest of the
competition. But was it legal?
</P>
<P>
   Jones turned and hoped to see an official waving a white flag,
but it was red and she scrunched her face in the smile that comes
with incredulous defeat. Half of her foot had been planted beyond
the takeoff board and the jump was a foul, her fourth on sixth
attempts. Gone was any chance of becoming the first female track
and field athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The gold medal went to Heike Drechsler, the former East German
champion who was once as versatile as Jones is now. Her winning
jump was a modest 22 feet 11\ inches, the shortest to bring Olympic
victory since 1984. Having won the long jump for a unified Germany
in 1992, Drechsler won again in 1996. At 35, she is the oldest
woman ever to win the Olympic long jump.
</P>
<P>
   The silver medal went to Fiona May of Italy, who jumped 22-8{.
Jones traveled the same distance, but she took the bronze because
her next best jump, 21-11, was shorter than May's. For most people,
perhaps for everyone but Jones, a pair of gold medals at 100 meters
and 200 meters, with two more possible in Saturday's relays, would
be a satisfying achievement at an Olympics. Among women, only Fanny
Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in 1948 has ever won four gold
medals in track and field at one Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But this defeat will linger like a pulled muscle. The winning
distance would not even have won a medal at the last three
Olympics. Jones has jumped a foot farther; at the Olympic trials,
she had jumped 23-{. The gold medal was there for the taking but
Jones could not find her timing. According to her critics, she had
been too proud, stubborn and loyal to seek outside help for her
undependable technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marion is a great fighter,'' Drechsler said. ``She has so much
speed. When she handles the speed in the jump, we have no chance.
She is the future. She has to work on the runup. With good rhythm,
she can jump very far.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she could consider these Olympics fun, given that her
husband, the shot-putter, C.J. Hunter, had tested positive for
steroids, and that her attempt to win five gold medals had failed,
Jones said, ``Fun is winning, that's what it comes down to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in myself,'' she added. ``I felt I let myself
down today. I'll be able to look back at this Sydney experience and
say it was a good experience, but fun is winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States took an unexpected gold medal in the pole
vault Friday night _ the first by an American since Bob Seagren in
1968 _ when Nick Hysong of Phoenix, Ariz., set a personal best of
19-4\ and won on fewer misses over his teammate Lawrence Johnson.
When the American record holder, Jeff Hartwig, failed to clear a
height at the Olympic trials, few believed the United States had a
chance to win any medal in Sydney, much less the gold and silver,
which had not been done in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought Jeff was our only chance, but Lawrence
and I came out here with the goal of saying, `We're out here, we're
ready to jump, we can do it too,''' Hysong said.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a kind night for expected champions.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps one of the biggest upsets of the Olympics, Hicham
el-Guerrouj of Morocco lost in the men's 1,500 meters to Kenya's
Noah Ngeny in 3:32.07. El-Guerrouj is the world-record holder at
3:26.00, and he had lost only one race since 1996, when he fell at
the Atlanta Games just as he was about to take the lead entering
the final lap. For four years, he had kept a picture of himself,
crying into his hands, as a token of self-flagellation and
motivation. This would never happen again. But, essentially, it
did.
</P>
<P>
   Paced by a teammate, el-Guerrouj went through the first 400
meters in 54.14 seconds, running near the front so that he would
not be spiked as he had been in an earlier round. Still, something
was wrong. El-Guerrouj had been feeling the pressure of redemption,
his coach said, and he had hardly slept more than two hours a night
in the last week. After one lap, the pace was too fast and he asked
his teammate, Youssef Baba, to slow down, said his coach,
Abdelkader Kada.
</P>
<P>
   The second lap took a minute, and at 800 meters el-Guerrouj
moved into the lead. It was a long time to stay in front on a windy
evening, especially when he was bothered by a thigh injury.
El-Guerrouj could not shake Ngeny, and off the final turn he
glanced sideways as the Kenyan prepared to make his move, drawing
away in the final 15 meters.
</P>
<P>
   El-Guerrouj finished second in 3:32.32 and sat on the track in
disbelief. Four years ago, the late King Hassan II of Morocco had
phoned him in the Olympic Stadium in Atlanta to comfort him in his
inconsolable defeat. Recently, the new king, Mohammed VI, phoned to
wish him well, but the expectation of an entire country had been a
heavy load to shoulder. El-Guerrouj began sobbing at his post-race
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to face this pressure,'' he said. ``Before
I got into the stadium, I already started crying.''
</P>
<P>
   There was pressure in the long jump, too, as Jones struggled
through an uncertain season, seldom able to convert her searing
speed into a propulsive leap, as Carl Lewis did with such
efficiency. She grew defensive earlier in the season when Mike
Powell, the world-record holder, and others suggested that she
needed refinement in her technique. She stood by her coach, Trevor
Graham, a former Jamaican quarter miler, saying she would not
abandon him because he had never abandoned her.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Jones never felt comfortable on the runway, Graham
said, slowing down one time, then speeding up the next as she
attempted futilely to find her rhythm as the wind swirled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to tell her to keep it under control,'' Graham said,
``but it's hard to tell the fastest woman in the world to slow
down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Instead, it was Drechsler who possessed the most secure balance
of speed and technique. She has been on the top of her game since
she first won a world championship in 1983 at age 18. Competing for
East Germany at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea,
Drechsler won a silver medal to Jackie Joyner-Kersee in the long
jump and bronzes to Florence Griffith Joyner at 100 meters and 200
meters. Four years later, the outcome was reversed and Drechsler
defeated Joyner-Kersee to win the long jump at the 1992 Barcelona
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's powerful, she's still got some speed and she's got the
most sound technique,'' said Willie Banks, the former world-record
holder in the triple jump and a contemporary of Drechsler's.
``She's quick off the board and holds her position to the landing.
Marion's biggest problem is that she doesn't attack the board with
force. She uses all speed without technically lifting off the
ground. You can see it because she falls forward when she lands.''
</P>
<P>
   Drechsler had jumped 23-8\ and 23-5\ at those previous Games,
results that were far beyond her Friday night. Much has changed
since Seoul. The Berlin Wall opened in 1989 and, later, so did the
secrets about East Germany's state-sponsored system of doping. Five
years ago, Drechsler was fined $4,300 for committing perjury
regarding a denial of drug accusations made against her in a book
by the German author Brigitte Berendonk, a former West German
discus thrower.
</P>
<P>
   Former East German athletes were granted amnesty, however, and
were not suspended after the system of doping was uncovered in
documents and court cases. Drechsler has never failed a drug test
and has become a popular athlete in Germany for her success and
perseverance. Friday night, she declined to speak about her past,
except to say that the German Olympic team felt truly unified even
if the country did not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is really a team, it doesn't feel like East and
West,'' Drechsler said. ``It's not so easy for the people, East and
West, to have this history in their heads. That will be a
generation problem. In the team, I feel we have no distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorced now, Dreschler is the mother of a 10-year-old son named
Toni, who prefers the decathlon to the long jump. She thought she
might give up the sport last year. After missing the Atlanta
Olympics with injury, she tore a calf muscle a year ago and sat out
the 1999 world track and field championships. Because the Sydney
Games were only a year away, she decided not to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little girl, I painted pictures of me with a gold
medal around my neck,'' Drechsler said. ``The Olympic Games are
always special for me. As a child, I always wanted to compete. I
was able to win this time. This accomplishment is the greatest at
the end of a long career.''  &QL;

Who expected we'd be looking back so soon on the antics of MTV's
taste-impaired ``The Tom Green Show'' with a whiff of nostalgia for
its relative innocence? At its wildest, ``Jackass'' really defies

</P>
<P>
   Host Johnny Knoxville (well, it's better than his real name,
P.J. Clapp) subjects himself to some fairly horrific and sometimes,
horrifically funny abuse. Like Green, he's a skateboard fan, so
there's some random thrashing, and some puerile silliness involving
cracking up shopping carts and bicycles, but that's just padding to
get to the stuff you'll be hearing about even if you can't imagine
watching the show.
</P>
<P>
   Knoxville allows himself to be hit head-on with pepper spray, a
stun gun and a Taser gun (his articulate response to each:
``(Expletive)!'' or ``(Expletive)in' hell!'') and discovers that
pepper spray is the worst. No, wait the worst is standing in a
well-stocked porta-potty when it's turned upside-down. Feel free to
die now basic-cable television can't possibly get any more
outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, though, Knoxville and his posse of pranksters
recall that line from ``This Is Spinal Tap,'' about the thin line
between clever and stupid. There are Green-style gags, like having
a trussed-up, nearly naked guy escape from the trunk of a car in
public, that are more about simple shock value than actual
inventiveness. As with Green's show, this kind of act has a fairly
brief shelf life before it becomes moldy, but unlike Green, there's
nothing witty about Knoxville beyond his being highly attuned to
his masochistic streak he's not funny unless he's being debased;
his responses to said debasement aren't clever or amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's very happy to humiliate himself most abjectly for
our amusement, so who are we to turn our heads? &QL;

What: Self-flagellation at its finest host Johnny Knoxville
subjects himself to much pain and suffering for laughs. &QL;

YUGOSLAVIA AND RUSSIA TO MEET FOR MEN'S VOLLEYBALL GOLD MEDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ As Vladimir Grbic drove the final spike into
their Olympic obsession Friday night, the Italians didn't even wait
for the ball to hit the floor before turning to trudge to the net
for the ritual handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Italian team had entered an Olympic men's
volleyball tournament as world champion. And for 30 minutes before
that final blow, the Italians had played as if they knew that once
again they would exit without the gold. After squandering a fistful
of set points in each of the first two sets, the Italians
capitulated in the third and lost to Yugoslavia, 27-25, 34-32,
25-14.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, all four semifinalists had come from Pool B of
the qualifying round. In the evening's first semifinal, Russia
outlasted Argentina, 27-25, 32-30, 21-25, 25-11. Argentina had
finished fourth in the six-team group, winning only two matches
before upsetting Cuba, the Pool A victor, in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Italy had topped Pool B, winning all five matches including a
five-set victory over Yugoslavia. But in the semifinals, the
Italian nerve failed. Italy has won the last three world
championships _ in 1990, 1994 and 1998 _ but has stumbled in each
subsequent Olympics. In Barcelona, Spain, in 1992, Italy lost in
the quarterfinals to the Netherlands, and in Atlanta in 1996, the
Italians lost in five sets in the final, again to the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 11 years, the team has been the favorite for
every tournament we've entered,'' said Andrea Gardini, the Italian
captain. ``We're used to pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first set Friday night, Italy had three set points at
24-21, allowed the Yugoslavs to draw level, and then had another at
25-24, before losing the next three points. In the second set, the
Italians had the first set point at 24-23. They squandered that,
and six more, before the Yugoslavs took the set at their third
opportunity. The Italians caved in, losing the first three points
of the third set, and trailed the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must apologize for the last set,'' Gardini said.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians played Friday night as they had for most of the
tournament, without the injured Andrea Giani, a 30-year-old veteran
of the three world championship teams. That placed an added weight
on Andrea Sartoretti's booming left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Sartoretti prepared to serve, standing 10 feet behind
the line, the Italian fans would begin to bellow, building to a
crescendo as he ran forward, hurled the ball high into the air,
leaped and unleashed a blow that sent it diving over the net at up
to 75 mph.
</P>
<P>
   On attack, Sartoretti's hammering spikes from the wing were the
favorite weapon of the Italians. In the crucial late stages of the
second set, Italy went to him time and again. But the Yugoslavs,
who knew what was coming, were lined up at the net ready to block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the 23rd point of the second set, everything was fine,''
Sartoretti said. ``After that everything was missing and I don't
know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 men in the Yugoslav team, six earn a living with
Italian clubs. Zoran Gajic, the Yugoslav coach, used only seven
players all night.
</P>
<P>
   In the first semifinal, Argentina wasted seven set points in the
second set but preserved their dignity by winning the third before
running out of steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team knew it was inferior to the Russians,'' said Carlos
Alberto Getzelvich, the Argentine coach, ``but had dreams of
reaching the final.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the second semifinal had even started, Gennadi
Chipouline, the Russian coach, was asked how he thought his team
might do against the Italians in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Results are difficult to predict because of the psychological
pressure is so great at the Olympics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Italy would testify to that.

   Joey Lauren Adams, now seen with Minnie Driver in ``Beautiful,''
is an actress, but what she really wants to do is write. And write
and write and write.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who was the object of Ben Affleck's desire in Kevin
Smith's ``Chasing Amy,'' is enthusiastic about how much fun she has
had writing her first screenplay. The story is built around
characters much like her own family in North Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   If someday the movie is made, she envisions herself starring and
says that male lead would be her soulmate, if only he really
existed. Although she got off to a slow start with the project, it
now seems to have its own momentum as she nears completion of her
first draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'll be writing and it's like, 'Slow down, guys.'
They (her characters) just start going, and it's not even anything
I planned or thought about them saying,'' Adams said. ``I'm
writing, and I'm saying, 'Guys, you're going to Granny's for
dinner,' and they're like, 'No we're not, we're going out for a
drink.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although Adams, who received a Golden Globe nomination for
``Amy'' and starred opposite Adam Sandler in ``Big Daddy,'' said
she would be happy to work again with her ``Beautiful'' director
Sally Field, she's not sure whether she'll show this script to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really small movie. I don't know if she wants to
rough it in Arkansas, you know what I mean? We're going to be
staying on Granny's couch,'' she laughed. ``I don't know if I could
ask Sally to do that.'' &QL;

   &QL;  HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF DEBATE NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   By Tania Anderson
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 - One of the most important events of the
presidential race is the first debate on Tuesday night. The two men
vying for The Seat in the Oval Office will try to convince
television viewers that their positions will best serve the needs
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   For the candidates, it could make or break the rest of their
campaign because a substantial amount of viewers are either still
undecided or not solidly supporting - Gov. George W. Bush or Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time debates are said and done, people make up their
mind,'' said Diana Carlin, professor of communication studies and
dean of the graduate school and international programs at the
University of Kansas. She serves as an advisor to the commission
that sets the format for the presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make those leaning, solidify their leanings,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   While communication experts say previous presidential debates
don't show obvious patterns, they do know that candidates generally
don't say anything in debates that they haven't said before while
on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   And Carlin added that she doesn't think there will be much
mudslinging in Tuesday's debate even though Bush and Gore have
launched a steady stream of attacks on each other in the last few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them are wanting to put on their best face,'' she
said. ``They will challenge one another. Candidates who have tried
to launch attacks during debates have had it backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   THE FORMAT
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 8 p.m., local television viewers tuned to a major
network or PBS will see Bush and Gore standing at podiums with Jim
Lehrer, PBS executive director and anchor of the NewsHour with Jim
Lehrer, as the debate moderator. This first of three presidential
debates will take place at the University of Massachusetts in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For about 90 minutes, Bush and Gore will answer questions tossed
out by Lehrer, who has formulated the questions but kept them
private from the campaigns. Each of the candidates has two minutes
to respond and then one minute to reply with Lehrer having the
discretion to extend the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   According to communication experts, there are three types of
questions that could potentially be asked by the moderator in a
presidential debate: initial, follow-up and cross examination.
</P>
<P>
   Initial questions get the debate started by asking candidates to
explain or defend a position or compare it to an opponent's. Many
initial questions are hypothetical, such as, ``What would you do
if_''
</P>
<P>
   Follow-up questions are directed at a candidate after an answer
is given. It's a way to probe the original response by asking for
elaboration or clarification or can be asked on an unrelated topic.
These questions can be asked immediately after the original
response or after each candidate has answered the first question.
</P>
<P>
   Cross examination questions are used by one candidate to
another. A separate time can be set aside for cross examination
questions or included in the follow ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very seldom does a single question turn a debate,'' Carlin
said. ``In the past, when something has gone wrong, it has slipped
past people. Viewers take pieces from every piece and patch it all
together.''
</P>
<P>
   All presidential debates are structured by the non-partisan
Commission on Presidential Debates, which was established in 1987
as a permanent part of every general election. The non-profit
group, based in Washington, D.C., is tasked with choosing the
location of the debate, its format and its moderator.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO LOOK FOR?
</P>
<P>
   Carlin, along with a group of university communication
professors, drafted a set of seven key points for how to get the
most of the presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   First, a viewer must set aside their partisan views and learn as
much as possible about each of the candidates and their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Second, viewers must pay close attention to Bush and Gore when
they talk about how to solve problems. This is a way to pull out
comparisons the Republican and Democrat make between or among their
programs and each other.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the candidate's debate strategy should be a major
concern, as well. Do Bush and Gore speak directly to the issues,
provide specifics and present new policies or information? Viewers
should pay attention to whether the candidates evasively interpret
questions to suit their agenda?
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates will try to create images for themselves.
Most candidates try to portray themselves as leaders and with
cherished American values while suggesting that their opponents
lack these qualities. Viewers should ask themselves what in the
responses supports their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth, viewers should be aware of the technical limitations of
televised debates. Television works by showing action and to create
action and minimize monotony, directors will show ``reaction
shots'' to show one candidate's responses to an opponent's
statement. Viewers should not let this distract them.
</P>
<P>
   The questions asked by Lehrer Tuesday night also should be taken
into consideration, specifically if they are adding to the debate.
One question to ask is if his questions encourage alternative
viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Carlin says a debate doesn't determine a winner or
a loser. Both Bush and Gore have goals for a debate and both could
claim victory if winning is defined as achieving goals set by their
campaigns. She says viewers should focus on the question of who
would make a better president.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATE THE DEBATE
</P>
<P>
   A good way to get the most out of Tuesday's debate is to debate
the debate with other people watching. The Commission on
Presidential Debates will hold discussion groups called DebateWatch
2000 around the country. Each group will send back a report on
people's reaction to the debate Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   One of these discussions will be held at Wabash College in
Crawfordsville, Ind. The intent of the discussion, which could draw
between 20 and 60 people, is to shape the structure of future
presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   Todd McDorman, assistant professor of speech at Wabash College
and a facilitator of the school's DebateWatch 2000, said he also
hopes it encourages this small group of participants to at least
vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing something like this, if we can get more students to
come out, it will increase the possibility of these people
voting,'' he said. ``Ideally we would have students be more
politically active.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, the new fall season begins tonight, but we're electing a
president this year, and ``Frontline'' offers fairly useful
biographies of Al Gore and George W. Bush on ``The Choice 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   To folks not born into political dynasties, this year's decision
has to be a fairly deflating one, powerfully suggesting as it does
that a ruling class has in fact emerged in America. Both
candidates' families have led lives of privilege and power, which
might make it difficult for the rest of us to shoehorn our own
aspirations into the old-boys club called Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Choice 2000'' implies that virtually everything Gore has
done in his life outside of some recreational pot use has had an
eye on political placement (his enlisting for service in Vietnam
was even exploited by his father's senatorial campaign in the
'70s). Footage in which Gore proudly allies himself with tobacco
growers is eventually juxtaposed against his attack on Big Tobacco.
His intelligence, however, is never called into question.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, everything Bush has accomplished in his life can be
chalked up to his daddy's brand name, as Dubya has made a practice
of failing upward. Ironically, when his father was running against
Michael Dukakis in 1988, the younger Bush warned gravely against
electing an inexperienced governor president. He is, nonetheless,
shown to be a guy who knows how to use his wry sense of humor to
get things accomplished (amusingly, he ran a pointedly corrupt
stickball league in prep school).
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that the next president will have to prove
himself ``substantial enough, authentic enough to lead.'' ``Choice
2000'' sort of splits the difference Gore, it shows, is clearly the
substantial one, while Bush is posited as the more authentic of the
two. &QL;

Hank Hill and the family make a, well, not so special but
particularly timely pre-season appearance on ``King of the Hill''
tonight. Hank's considering the upcoming presidential election he's
expecting his man, George W. Bush, to walk away with it all,
particularly if he can get dim-bulb Luanne to quit babbling about
the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   When Hank and the brood are invited to a Bush rally (Bobby
heroically rescues that proud Texas tradition, a diving pig, from
drowning in a pool), the man who makes propane his life is deflated
to discover his hero has a weak handshake. It's such a devastating
revelation he opts not to vote come Election Day: ``With voter
turnout at all-time lows, not voting makes me more American,'' he
tries to convince himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a particularly rich addition to the Hill canon. The
laughs, such as they are, are often forced, and the effort, however
backhanded, to do a little flag-waving for the democratic process
rings hollow. ``King of the Hill'' has managed to blend wry comedy
and poignancy in the past, but here, neither quality seems
particularly interested in coming to the fore. &QL;

What: The animated Texas family considers the presidential
election. &QL; 
When: 7:30 tonight. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dwight Yoakam is back. After spending several years preoccupied
primarily with film work, Yoakam is again touring and recording
extensively, and even doing club dates to get up-close-and-personal
with fans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rootsy return for the
singer-songwriter-actor-director-author, and it will bring Yoakam
to the Cowboys Concert Hall stage in Arlington, Texas, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam appeared in concert in July at the arena-sized Smirnoff
Music Centre in Dallas, then was quickly recruited for the more
intimate tour date at Cowboys in Arlington, where he's never played
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't booked acts that big before, but we thought we'd
give it a shot and see what happened,'' said Chris Lutz, Cowboys
Arlington marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   The Yoakam date has already paid off for Cowboys, which is known
as much for being a dancing and mingling place as a concert spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ticket sales are great,'' Lutz said. ``Pre-sales for this
concert are the best we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam's current national tour is low-key and lengthy, having
kicked off in early June and consisting of more than 50 dates,
ranging from casinos and festivals to fairs and clubs.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Yoakam was set to appear at two fairs (the Kern
County Fair in Bakersfield, Calif., and the South Plains Fair in
Lubbock, Texas) and a couple of clubs, the Celebrity Theatre in
Phoenix and the Far West Rodeo in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam took a three-year break from performing in the mid-'90s,
returning to the road again for his ``Last Chance'' tour in
mid-'99. That's when he discussed the the allure of returning to
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of nights, maybe it's hard to make that
shift, and I am getting older,'' he said at the outset of that
tour. ``But it's something you fall toward the way you would a
comfortable bed. It allows you a certain kind of embrace.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his long gaps off the road weren't aimed at getting out
of the live-touring business, as some had speculated; they were
just a way of keeping himself fresh artistically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've (toured) all my life,'' he said. ``I hope we still have
an access to (the fans) and always will.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his recent acoustic album,
``dwightyoakamacoustic.net,'' was planned as a special thanks to
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam released a message on his Web site, saying the album was
``a result of the audience's gracious and enthusiastic response''
to the acoustic performances on the ``Last Chance'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   New this year for Yoakam is an upcoming studio album to be
released Oct. 31, ``Tomorrow's Sounds Today.''
</P>
<P>
   Guests include Buck Owens, Chris Hillman (Byrds, Flying Burrito
Brothers) on mandolin, Flaco Jimenez on accordion, and Jim
Lauderdale on vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam's self-described ``gothic western'' film ``South of
Heaven, West of Hell'' debuted in Europe last spring, marking his
first turn as a film writer and director as well as actor. The
movie also stars Peter Fonda, Bridget Fonda, Billy Bob Thornton,
Vince Vaughn and Paul Rubens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was originally a morality tale of a person with survivor
guilt,'' Yoakam explained. ``It's like `Once Upon a Time in the
West.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam insists he focuses totally on each project when he's
working on it, which is why he was away from touring for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music will never leave me,'' Yoakam said, when asked if he'd
ever choose between film work and recording/touring. ``It's an
outlet to articulate all emotion for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why he's coming to Cowboys.

THE SHOW'S BETTER THAN THE TITLE
</HEADLINE>

(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' is Oct. 1) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
What TV show, save for maybe the ultra-contrived reality series
``Big Brother,'' couldn't use ``That's Life'' for a title?
Fortunately, there's more creativity at work in the show itself
than in its moniker.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heather Paige Kent stars as Lydia, a 32-year-old Jersey girl who
suddenly discovers what a lout her boyfriend is when he resists her
efforts to enlist in college. She's the all-around sort of guardian
angel who takes care of both the drunks in the bar where she works
and the neighborhood's stray cats.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia's ex isn't the only one with doubts her parents (Paul
Sorvino and Ellen Burstyn) and pals (Debi Mazar and Kristin Bauer)
have their doubts, as well, even though it's eminently clear that
street-smart Lydia is the glue holding this little community
together. Her first day at school is fraught with cutesy mishaps,
from an epic bad-hair day to sputtering car troubles. And oops! the
drunk she cuts off in her bar just happens to be her psych prof.
But nothing keeps our Lydia from giving lip to any highfalutin
diploma-waver this school can toss at her.
</P>
<P>
   CBS compares ``That's Life'' to ``Working Girl'' and ``Educating
Rita,'' but what it most resembles but don't tell anybody is
``Costello,'' Fox's short-lived sitcom from a few years back about
another mouthy dame who dumps her squeeze for a life of the mind.
Fortunately, this incarnation is exponentially less shrill than its
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's premiere episode is crammed with so many quirky
touches and characters that at times you feel exhausted on the show
producers' behalf. It's clearly a case of trying too hard, a
condition that no doubt will be resolved in due time. But at least
they're putting forth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Kent's an appealing performer, fully capable of
carrying this show until the ensemble cast gels and actually begins
to look like everyone really has known one another for years.
</P>
<P>
   ---``THAT'S LIFE'' &QL; 
What: Dramedy about a Jersey girl all grown up and attending
college in her 30s. &QL; 
The stars: Heather Paige Kent, Ellen Burstyn, Kristin Bauer, Peter
Firth, Kevin Dillon, Paul Sorvino, Debi Mazar. &QL; 
When: 8 tonight; thereafter, 8 p.m. Saturdays. &QL; 
Where: CBS &QL;

bc-JEAN-STAPLETON-FEATUR For Jean Stapleton, it was an easy move from Dingbat to 'Eleanor'
... with plenty more in between 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)

c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily Newsh  
 
There is something of a bygone time in Jean Stapleton that comes
through in little things, like the way she properly uses the
subjective ``one'' as in ``one would hope'' and little phrases like
``yes indeed.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Or the way she takes offense at an attempt to verify her age.
</P>
<P>
   It could be Stapleton's nature, or it could be the result of
having played Eleanor Roosevelt in the one-woman play ``Eleanor:
Her Secret Journey'' for more than 165 performances in Miami, San
Francisco and now at the Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going wonderfully, and of course this is an important
engagement because there are all these professional types, and if
you get their approval, it's very strengthening and encouraging,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She gives seven performances a week of the Rhoda Lerman play, in
which the former first lady reflects on the post-World War I years,
her husband's early political career and his affair with his social
secretary, which left Eleanor craving his attention and affection.
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton has made a long and successful career of a wide
variety of supporting roles on stage and screen, from the devoted
nurse in ``Romeo and Juliet'' and the spunky Aunt Eller in
``Oklahoma!'' to the campy medium in ``Blithe Spirit'' and her most
famous part, the ditsy yet wise Edith Bunker on the 1970s
breakthrough sitcom, ``All in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-woman show offers different challenges and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting and it's a wonderful exercise,'' she said.
``Of course it can't help but benefit one's growth as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's best answered by saying I don't plan to spend the rest of
my career doing a one-person show because I like to work with
people on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Stapleton will be taking the show to several more
cities (the tentative schedule includes Syracuse, N.Y.; Boston;
Palm Beach, Fla.; Houston; and San Diego) and hopes to land
off-Broadway next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleanor'' closes its four-week engagement at the Canon on Oct.
8, the same night Stapleton co-stars in the premiere of TNT's movie
``Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton plays the matriarch Byrd in the story of a family
still mourning an infant son's death when a baby girl named Sophie
is abandoned on their porch. Her mother's note says she loves the
baby and will come back for her someday, leaving the Malone family
torn between bonding with Sophie and trying to keep an emotional
detachment because of the inevitable separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby,'' based on the book by Patricia MacLachlan (``Sarah,
Plain and Tall''), stars Farrah Fawcett and Keith Carradine as the
parents and Alison Pill as their 12-year-old daughter, Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole story was so moving and so touching,''
Stapleton said. ``The script is so universal in how it deals with
family emotions. I was also attracted because Glenn Close was
connected to the project as an executive producer, and that was
enough for me. I knew then that the project would be quality.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the babies, multiple sets of towheaded twins portraying
Sophie's growth in a year, created some problems, especially one
child who seemed content only when Fawcett carried her around on
her hip, but they also delighted the cast and crew at the Nova
Scotia location.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one who was so outgoing, who's used most, the older one,
was so miraculous because she learned to speak during the shoot,''
Stapleton said. ``She started with one syllable here and there,
imitation. By the end of it she was speaking in sentences, and she
could name all our character names and with great joy she was
constantly calling them out. It was a miracle to watch this happen,
just marvelous.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her post-``Eleanor'' plans, Stapleton said she'll try
``whatever comes that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to do film, also theater,'' she said. ``A wonderful
play with people in it would be very satisfying. It's nice when one
can hop around in all the media, but the theater would be the place
I would care to stay for a long time, a long run if it's worthy.''
</P>
<P>
   In most New York productions that means eight shows a week, a
demanding schedule that wears out even the most vigorous actors.
That's where the age discussion comes up.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to confirm an almanac entry that gives her age as 77,
Stapleton bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never discuss age, nor do I confirm the accuracy of that.
It's a stereotype and it's not the right way to categorize people.
I think it's so wrong, so I don't indulge in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very bad for actors. It categorizes them and limits them.
I just disdain its use!''
</P>
<P>
   She paused. ``Nothing personal,'' she added with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   I replied that I was going to tell her she looked great for her
age, if in fact that age was accurate, but now I guessed I
wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, please,'' she said with a laugh. &QL;

LONG JUMP A LINE TOO FAR FOR JONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Being gifted has never been enough to make Marion Jones
a legitimate paid-up member of the Long Jump Club.
</P>
<P>
   She has jumped as far as 7.31 meters, the seventh-best female
long jump in history, but she did it on raw talent, not technique,
and not much has changed. She kind of wobbles around from jump to
jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a fighter, and she has so much speed,'' observed Heike
Dreschler. ``She's the fastest I've seen. But she has to work on
the run-up. With a very good rhythm, she will do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   That was free, media-solicited advice from someone who knows
whereof she speaks. Dreschler is the Once and Current Queen of the
Long Jump, having won the event in Barcelona eight years ago and
having won it again, this time at age 36, Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing she put an end to Jones's quest for five Olympic
gold medals. Then throw in Italy's Fiona May, whose best jump of
6.92 meters gave her the silver medal. Jones likewise jumped 6.92
on her third attempt, but May placed ahead of Jones because her
second-best jump exceeded Jones's, 6.82 to 6.68. Jones had to
settle _ and we do mean settle _ for a (yuck) bronze. ``After
having two golds around my neck,'' said the 100-and 200-meter
champion, ``a bronze doesn't quite compare. But it's better than
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the privacy of her apartment, she may very well have
bawled her eyes out to hubby C.J. Hunter, but in front of the
international media she was a wonderfully cheerful and gracious
interview subject.
</P>
<P>
   She had given it her best shot, she said. On this occasion her
best just wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   She fouled on her first, fourth, fifth, and sixth attempts. The
final try was a real tease, because she had landed out beyond the
numeral ``7,'' for what would have been a dramatic victory. There
was only one problem . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``On the last jump,'' she explained, ``I got to lay it all on
the line. It's what every athlete dreams of, coming back on the
last jump and jumping better than you ever have before. I saw the
7-meter mark, and then I saw the man holding up the red flag. It
kind of dashed all my hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no doubt about it. She had taken off a good
half-a-shoe over the line.
</P>
<P>
   There were no regrets. The four fouls were clear proof that she
was going after that gold medal, that she wasn't going to hope
someone ceded it to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' she said. `I put it out there. That's why
I had so many fouls. I went for it. I was flying down that
runway.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly. Everyone knows now that she is the Fastest Woman In
The World, and a certain amount of raw speed is necessary to be
successful in the long jump. Whom would you like in a sprint? Jones
or 36-year-old Dreschler? Jones, or 31-year-old May? This event is
about more than speed. Watching craftsfolk like those two is
enlightening, especially since Jones was trying to steal a gold
while practicing the event three times a week, and while refusing
to hire a long jump coach.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare public moment of pique, the otherwise unflappable Ms.
Jones didn't seem to like it when she was asked if she would
consider employing a full-time coach in this event. ``No,'' she
said, somewhat icily, ``I wouldn't consider it at all. I've said
several times that I jumped 24 feet in 1998. I haven't seen that
form in the last couple of years. But I think I'll get back to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she will. Doubting this woman is very foolish.
</P>
<P>
   With both the 4x100 and 4x400 relay teams qualifying for their
respective finals in her absence, her revised target was four
golds. But she made it very clear she would not apologize for
having brought up the idea of bagging five herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret at all having said I was going for five,'' she
declared. ``I had a shot at it, but it didn't turn out, you know.
I'll try to get refocused and help my US teammates bring home the
gold. I'm very happy we made the finals in both relays.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the long jump, well, this was simply a night for someone
else, not that there's anything embarrassing about taking home a
bronze. Any one of the full-time long jumpers in the field, nine of
whom finished behind this moonlighting sprinter, would have been
very honored to have that bronze.
</P>
<P>
   This night belonged to the fascinating Dreschler, who jumped for
the old GDR (the evil East Germans) while supposedly full of drugs
and who has had an even more impressive career without artificial
aid while jumping for the Good Germans. Winning jumping golds at
age 35 is a stupendous achievement, as Jones herself acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Heike deserved to win,'' Jones said. ``In 30 years I'll be able
to tell my grandchildren I competed against one of the best long
jumpers ever.''
</P>
<P>
   And in case you're wondering, Jones expects someone to be saying
that about her at some future Olympics, coach or no coach. If she
didn't believe that, she wouldn't be Marion Jones.

NEAR-LOSS TO LITHUANIA WAS UGLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Eight years ago, it was ``Beat me, whip me, take my
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's ``Bleep you.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years. That's all it has taken for the United States of
America to go from being the most respected force in the game of
basketball to the most reviled. Friday night, in the Super Dome at
Sydney's Olympic Park, the US came amazingly close to being the
most humiliated athletic team in the history of mankind. The
national team of tiny Lithuania absolutely, positively could have
won this game, and if it had, what transpired at Lake Placid 20
years ago would have looked, in hindsight, like some kind of
American mortal lock. This would have been the greatest sports
upset.
</P>
<P>
   Ever.
</P>
<P>
   Anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   What a truly pathetic sight it was from an American/NBA
perspective. Here was its sickeningly arrogant juggernaut, already
made to sweat by the likes of Lithuania (85-76), France (106-94),
and Russia (85-70 and a 4-point game at the half), needing every
bounce of the ball and every call and every last bit of defensive
energy on the game's final possession to salvage an 85-83 victory
over a team that is missing its two best players, Portland Trail
Blazer center Arvydas Sabonis and former Seton Hall standout, and
European star, Arturas Karnisovas.
</P>
<P>
   You had Americans kneeling on the sidelines on that last play,
looking very much like kids on those 15 seeds in the first round of
the NCAA when they're on the verge of defeating the No. 2 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Understand something: Lithuania is not what it once was. Absent
Sabonis, Sarunas Marciulonis, and the other veterans who were the
core of the 1988 Soviet Union team that won in Seoul, it is a
fair-to-middlin' European team; no more, no less. There are three
players on the roster with an American college exerience, but none
were, or are, important players. The rest are OK European types.
Not one would interest an NBA scout.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we were definitely the best team in the (Olympic) village
to play the US,'' points out Lithuanian assistant coach/advisor
Donnie Nelson, who has been associated with the Lithuania team for
a decade. ``Three reasons. One, we are the best defensive team of
all the others. Two, we follow a game plan religiously. Three, we
play as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   By playing aggressive defense, by doing what the coaches told
them to do on offense, and by playing selfless basketball, this
unimposing European squad has twice humbled the haughty Americans,
who are now so defensive about being exposed as something less than
demigods of the hardwood that they are resorting to infantile
behavior to justify themselves, to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thinks Americans would have said if the US team
had lost, Vince Carter sizzled. ``We didn't lose,'' he snapped. ``I
don't care what the world thinks. Look at the scoreboard.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Vince Carter who has endeared himself to the
international basketball community by acting offended when anyone
dares to guard him and who is so clueless he whooped it up and
pointed to the crowd after making a sneakaway dunk that gave the US
a 3-point lead late in the game, and who was yapping at Lithuania's
Mindaugas Timinskas after the game instead of shaking his hand and
walking off the court with his head down and his mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, Vince Carter was a pretty nice kid from North
Carolina. Now he is VINCE CARTER, the Slam Dunk King, and he can't
understand why these scruffy kids from the Baltic won't show him a
little respect.
</P>
<P>
   Ya see, Vince, it's not like that, anymore. The days of an
Argentine player yelling to the bench to have his picture taken
while he's posting up Magic Johnson have given way to unawed,
unimpressed athletes spitting in the great NBA faces. The awe
factor no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   This is precisely what FIBA president Borislav Stankovic had in
mind when he led the movement to get the NBA involved in regular
international competition. He reasoned that the gap between the US
and the rest of the world could be narrowed quicker if the rest of
the world had more direct exposure to the beast in order to learn
what made it tick.
</P>
<P>
   The whole original Dream Team business was strictly Show Biz, as
we all know. But the situation changed within two years, when, at
the 1994 World Championships in Toronto, US coach Don Nelson made a
simple substitution.
</P>
<P>
   One of the little Chuck Daly quirks in both the 1992 Tournament
of the Americas and the Barcelona Olympics was that he never called
a timeout, nor made a substitution that wasn't based on spreading
out playing time or politics. But early in the second half of a
game against the Russians, coach Nelson did something interesting.
He made a substitution based on need. The US was struggling with
the Russians, and he decided things would be better if he took out
Alonzo Mourning and inserted Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   So that's where the aura of invincibility was shattered forever.
Six years later, forget about invinciblity. Let's talk about
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, the fact that the international rules are
different was a mere irritation. Now it matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different game,'' explains Nelson. ``The
international game is not all about post-ups and isos. And I think
any time you have a compilation of players like a `Dream Team,' one
thing that's missing is a `glue' player, like a Kurt Rambis, a guy
who does the little things on a championship caliber team. Here,
it's more the passing game. NBA players aren't used to the need to
play for 30 seconds. The ball goes side-to-side three or four
times. It's just a different game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, but in this case there is still a huge talent gap.
We are talking about multimillion dollar NBA players against a team
containing, at best, a CBA player or two. Somewhere in here we need
to discuss the US team mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   After the Lithuanians had played the US tough last week,
Lithuanian guard Sarunas Jasikevicius, who played for Gary Williams
at Maryland (not always that well), had this to say: ``I think
they're gonna lose a game, and I think they're gonna lose a game
here. They are treating this like a vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting.
</P>
<P>
   We can only observe that the US was a disgrace against the
Lithuanians. ``Anarchy'' is not too strong a word to describe the
bench goings-on. Though lip service would later be paid to the
sense of urgency in the game's last minutes, actions indicated that
the US was a team that couldn't understand why the opposition
wouldn't simply surrender and allow them to get this thing over
with so they could go party.
</P>
<P>
   That type of arrogance was never a problem in the old days. It
was never becoming, but neither was it counterproductive. Now it is
both. People are no longer afraid of the Americans, and as long as
they keep acting the way they are on the court, people are starting
to despise them. This group is demonstrating zero class.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. America would be so much better served if
represented by Lithuania, which respects the game and plays it
honorably, than by Team USA, which, being the finest embodiment of
the Entitlement Generation, plays with no purpose and then forces
its coach, Rudy Tomjanovich, to embarrass himself in front of
people who know differently by telling us what great people
comprise this reprehensible team of his.
</P>
<P>
   The shame of all this isn't that the US might lose. That would
only be justice. The shame of it is that a team doesn't even have
to be very good to expose them as people. What's happening here
isn't really a basketball story. It's a people story as old as
mankind. The rest of the world is simply standing up to a classless
bully.
</P>
<P>
   The US plays for the gold Sunday. An awful lot of people around
here are shouting, ``Vive La France!'' Some of them are carrying
American passports.

<P>
   Sunshine is healthy. But it also can burn.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will receive a big dose of sunshine when Regulation FD
takes effect on Oct. 23. The directive, from the Securities and
Exchange Commission, will end disclosure of corporate information
to some people and not others, including guidance on earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are already complying with the new rule. In a
number of cases _ Intel and Eastman Kodak, for example _ what they
had to say was not pretty. Nor was the reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call/Thompson
Financial, which tracks analysts' earnings estimates, took time
last week to talk about Regulation FD and the profit outlook for
the remainder of the year. Here are excerpts from the
conversation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. It seems many companies are already complying with this rule. Do
you agree? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. I think that is correct. I don't have an exact figure, but there
are certainly a meaningful number of companies that are doing this.
No one can remember, for example, the last time Alcoa preannounced
their earnings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. What sort of impact do you foresee when everybody is forced to
live by the new rule?  &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. I don't know if you will see the full impact in the first couple
of quarters, because I think some corporate lawyers will advise
some companies to clam up completely, or close to it.
</P>
<P>
   That is not in the best interest of the companies, because they
will find that the earnings estimates will be more volatile, in
bigger ranges. And I think companies that don't say anything will
start losing some coverage if they are not giving guidance.
</P>
<P>
   But once the dust settles, it will be pretty much business as
usual, except that instead of giving guidance individually to
analysts, the guidance will come in the form of a preannouncement
or a Webcast. And we are going to see a lot more Webcasting of
conference calls and meetings.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. If the number of companies making preannouncements increases,
will the stock market become even more volatile?  &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. It will create more volatility because the ranges on earnings
estimates will be somewhat wider, and surprises will be more
frequent on both the upside and the downside.
</P>
<P>
   On average, over the last six years, companies have beaten
estimates by nearly three percentage points. That may get squeezed
down to a smaller number.  &QL; 
Q. How will this rule affect analysts? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. This will make their job harder rather than easier, but that is
good.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of good analysts out there, but a number knew
they could get away with not doing all the homework they should
because they could regurgitate what the company was telling them.
</P>
<P>
   There should be a two-way relationship between an analyst and
the company he or she is covering.
</P>
<P>
   As an independent, outside observer, an analyst is supposed to
do some digging. But the analyst should be contributing as much
information to the company as they are getting. The relationship
should be valuable to both sides.  &QL; 
Q. Even with the downside preannouncements, will third-quarter
profits be healthy?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Up until a week ago, we thought preannouncements were running
at about a normal pace. But since then we have changed our tune.
Now we are saying we will see more warnings than usual. Even if
some of those are due to Regulation FD, that is not the whole
story: there is a problem out there in that there are more
companies with earnings problems than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Right now we are expecting earnings growth of 16.4 percent for
the third quarter, down from an estimated 18.8 percent in early
July.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q. What about the fourth quarter? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. There could be some problems in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   You are seeing these warnings for the third quarter because the
American economy is slowing, energy prices are higher and the euro
is weak. I think all three of these factors will be in play again
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market is correct in paying attention to the
preannouncements we have seen, not for the impact they had in the
third quarter, but rather for the effect they will have on
fourth-quarter results. And the fourth quarter will tell us where
we are headed in the first quarter. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. Which are the strong and weak sectors? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. Consumer cyclicals _ be it autos, housing or apparel _ have
problems. Basic materials companies _ the papers, metals and
chemicals _ have also been crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Energy companies are going to do well in the third quarter. The
estimate for the sector now is an earnings increase of 91 percent,
up from 80 percent on Sept. 1. And technology is going to do well,
with a projected increase of 35 percent.  &QL;

DRESCHLER'S USES AGE-OLD SKILL TO JUMP TO GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The world-class athlete opened the window to greet the
big day. She felt the wilting humidity and the whipsaw wind. Her
optimally conditioned body instinctively responded to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   She crawled back into bed. And stayed there. And stayed some
more.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't necessarily the classic preparatory routine of
champions, but for Heike Drechsler, the emphasis is on ``classic''
more than ``champion.'' Oh, she awoke Friday morning as the owner
of four Olympic medals _ two bronze, a silver, and a gold _ but
they were antiques, from 1988 and '92. Her treasure chest also
included six world championship medals, including a pair of golds,
but they, too, were ancient, from 1983, '87, and '91.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, technically, Drechsler was still at the top of the game,
scheduled to compete Friday night in the Olympic long jump at
Stadium Australia. But she was supposed to be merely present, not a
presence. The most pertinent statistic by which to gauge her
potential for success was this:
</P>
<P>
   Age: 35.
</P>
<P>
   Make that 36 by Christmas, the cusp of middle age, when the
weather becomes more of a consideration in how much your bones will
shriek and creak than in how far your body will jump against women
almost closer in age to your 11-year-old son than to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to win today (was) in my thinking when I wake
up,'' said Drechsler. ``I just want to rest and lay around. I
looked and saw the heat and the wind and was a little afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   But the athlete who was an old lady, competitively speaking,
became a grande dame by bedtime. In fact, she had to stay up past
it, because late Friday, she was still answering questions from the
world media about how she captured her second long jump gold medal
eight years after her first _ and dashed Marion Jones's crusade to
win five golds here.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Drechsler outleaped everyone with a best of 6.99 meters
on her third of six attempts. That was enough to nudge her past
runner-up Fiona May of Italy and bronze medalist Jones, America's
Olympic cover girl. Both landed 6.92 meters into the sand pit, but
May earned her second straight long jump silver because she had no
fouls while trick-or-treat jumper Jones accumulated four.
</P>
<P>
   It was not startling that Jones, the 100- and 200-meter titlist,
lost, for the long jump is her weakest event. But it was astounding
that Drechsler won, for she has been around so long that she
initially competed for a now-defunct country _ East Germany, which
was reunified with its neighboring nemesis to the west a decade
ago. By then, Drechsler had earned fame as the youngest world
champion ever (18, in the '83 long jump), served as Jackie
Joyner-Kersee's foil in the Seoul Games long jump of '88, and, as
one of history's most versatile athletes, set world records in the
200 and long jump.
</P>
<P>
   Since East Germany was absorbed into one republic, Drechsler had
won Olympic gold in the '92 long jump at Barcelona, but in the
mid-1990s she'd also been involved in some of the lingering
ugliness from the days of a divided Germany. A book was published
exposing the East German state policy of giving its premier
athletes illicit drugs, and Drechsler was identified as one of the
artificially enhanced wunderkind. Enraged, she sued but lost in
court and was forced to apologize to the authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not fair to accuse the East Germans of doing things over
which they may have had no control or known nothing about,'' said
German jump coach Wolfgang Killing. ``It was a long time ago. I
think if we all got together and asked, we all have a fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Drechsler seemed to have experienced a mother lode of them in
recent years. She'd gotten divorced and been shuffled to the
periphery of the international stage, a victim of age and, not
coincidentally, injuries. She was infirm for the Atlanta Games of
'96, and when she developed a foot problem a week before last
year's world championships, she wondered why she was hanging
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``But four weeks later, I looked at my spikes and knew I still
wanted to do this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when beset by yet another setback this year _ a torn calf
muscle that cost her five weeks of training and rendered her an
afterthought coming to Sydney _ Drechsler resisted retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love sports very much,'' she said. ``In the beginning, it
was great. After 20 years, I still don't have feelings to give up
my fight in the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't have particularly optimistic feelings Friday,
even when she finally dragged herself to the stadium and found that
the humidity and wind had abated somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it was a dream to win the gold medal,'' said
Drechsler at her victory press conference. ``This year was not so
easy. And I wasn't sure about a medal, especially gold. I have
strong ladies sitting beside me.''
</P>
<P>
   Second- and third-place ladies. But at least the ever gracious
Jones _ who ``grew up watching Heike and Jackie compete against
each other'' _ figured she'd received a consolation prize in
addition to her bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell my grandkids in 30 years,'' she said, ``that I
competed against one of the greatest long jumpers in history.''
</P>
<P>
   And lost to her. That would be an appropriate epitaph for
Drechsler's career. Except it doesn't seem ready for one just yet.

 &HT;    ISRAELI RADIO SHOW CLOSES FAMILY GAPS, OPENS OLD WOUNDS
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ They call in with painful, unfinished business from
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, Hadaya, is looking for her uncle who escaped the Nazi
Holocaust to join the Soviet Army and was last heard from in a
postcard in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman was separated from an orphaned boy her family
cared for more than 50 years ago on their weeks-long refugee
journey from Europe. It turns out he's now a lawyer near Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others call inquiring about lost aunts and uncles who
were shoved out of the family consciousness by memories too bitter
for their parents to pass on.
</P>
<P>
   They are survivors, and children of survivors, of the Holocaust.
And they have found an unlikely home on Israel's afternoon drive
time radio.
</P>
<P>
   Five days a week for about 12 minutes a day, radio host Yaron
Enosh goes over the faxes or calls on his new show, ``The
Department for Seeking Relatives _ The Next Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to victims of the Holocaust, the show reaches out to
Israelis who have lost track of comrades from Israel's wars or
relatives separated in the waves of hectic immigration that built
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Enosh says he aims to reunite and repair the ``holes'' in
families still fractured from the national and ethnic catastrophes
faced by Israel, and Jews around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Israelis call in each day, and more than 90 have
found loved ones, or people with information about loved ones,
since the program began in early August. Some were reunited on the
air, making for somber and suspenseful reality programming.
</P>
<P>
   It began as an experiment.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Enosh, 45, realized he could not answer his
12-year-old daughter's questions for a school family tree project.
There were too missing branches.
</P>
<P>
   All of his grandparents, and several aunts and uncles perished
in the Holocaust. His parents, who escaped the Holocaust by fleeing
Poland for Russia, did not like to talk about the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to talk to my friends and many of them had the same
problem,'' Enosh says. ``But, I didn't know how big a phenomenon it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   He was soon to find out. His boss at the Voice of Israel,
Israel's national radio station, gave him a time slot in the summer
to discuss something ``light.'' Instead, he made the topic missing
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   He took the name of the show from a department in the Jewish
Agency, a charitable organization that facilitates immigration to
Israel. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Israelis sat riveted by
their radio as the department would read the names of immigrants _
the Holocaust survivors _ who had made it to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But, the new show was not a sure hit. Israelis have wavered over
the decades over how much they have wanted to delve into the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust killed about 6 million Jews _ a million more Jews
than the number living in Israel now _ and convinced the world of
the need for a Jewish refuge. A day of mourning for the Holocaust
every spring is still revered throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Holocaust also raises the specter of a vulnerability
that Jews never want to relive.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, says Rachel Peterburg, general director of a social
services center for Holocaust survivors, many Jews had arrived
before World War II to build what would become Israel and they
faced their own hardships. They were sometimes resentful of the
boatloads of needy Holocaust immigrants, noting that they had
declined to come help develop a Jewish state until the catastrophe
occurred in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But, Peterburg said the past 15 years have seen a greater
Israeli willingness to hear about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   According to Peterburg, there are about 200,000 Holocaust
survivors living in Israel and another 160,000 Israelis who were
small children just after, or while, the Holocaust was ending.
</P>
<P>
   The time seems right for the new radio program. According to
Enosh, ratings are not yet available, but more than 250 people
contact the show daily with requests about missing relatives or
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Enosh said he feels he has tapped into something central in the
Israeli psyche. He describes it as ``the big holes we have'' in
which family members are missing and, for the younger generation,
roots are obscured.
</P>
<P>
   He says about two-thirds of the requests that come to the show
concern the Holocaust. The rest seek people lost in the large
immigration to Israel from Morocco, Yemen and other eastern
countries, or from people looking for those they fought beside in
Israel's wars.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is still a small country, with maybe 5 million Jewish,
and one million Arab citizens. Frequently, someone can hear a name
on a radio program and know friends or neighbors from the same
family, platoon or town of origin.
</P>
<P>
   The stories have been riveting.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman Gomeh, 52, was born in a refugee camp in Cyprus after
World War II. His father disappeared and his mother, a survivor of
horrible death camp traumas, was unable to care for him.
</P>
<P>
   He moved through several foster families growing up to become a
self-made, hard-driving, computer executive. The gaps in his past
seemed distant, until his wife convinced him to call Enosh's show
and inquire for information about his father.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks later, while shopping in a hardware store, one
of the show's producers called his mobile phone and told him he had
received a response from a half-sister in Israel _ a half-sister he
didn't know he had.
</P>
<P>
   Gomeh and the sister were hooked up on the air. Suddenly, the
boisterous Gomeh was speechless. His new half-sister told him his
father lived in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   For Gomeh, it was an exciting and disturbing revelation. For
once, he had a family, complete with new siblings, nephews and
nieces. But, he was still angry at his father, now 79 years old,
for leaving him and starting another family far away.
</P>
<P>
   They have spoken by phone. Gomeh said his father ``cried like a
baby'' and asked that his lost son not judge him. Gomeh's
sentiments are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the father, after all. Even if he screwed me, even if he
cheated me and threw me away, he's your father and you have to know
him,'' Gomeh says, his eyes tearing up.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he says he is glad for the new radio show, not only
for him but for the many others who have similar stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is closing the historical gaps,'' he says. ``It is making
people come together.''

   Drinking low-fat rather than whole milk could be more likely to
infect you with food-poisoning bugs such as Salmonella and E. coli,
according to PHLS researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Although large dairies used by supermarkets use modern
equipment, most small dairies use pasteurizing machines that were
built before skimmed milk became popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't designed to separate the milk during the
pasteurization process,'' says Anita Rampling of the PHLS in
Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   To meet today's demand for low-fat milk, these dairies modified
their machines to skim off the cream. But Rampling and her
colleague Melody Greenwood investigated two modified farm dairies
which had failed a test designed to detect inadequately treated
milk. They found that the alteration often means the milk is no
longer pasteurized properly, so some bacteria are able to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flow rate is speeded up, so the milk is not held at high
temperature for long enough,'' Rampling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been problems with on-farm pasteurization in the
past,'' says a spokeswoman for the Food Standards Agency. ``But we
are not aware of this particular problem.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds that dairies that don't pasteurize their milk properly
could ultimately be shut down.

   Rampling says the problem is compounded by the way milk is
checked to ensure pasteurization has worked. The test looks for
phosphatase, an enzyme that is destroyed during pasteurization. But
phosphatase tends to bind to the fat in milk, so when the cream is
skimmed off, much of the enzyme goes with it. This means that
low-fat milk can test negative for the enzyme even if it hasn't
been pasteurized properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``For skimmed milk, you need a more sensitive test,'' says Ted
Langridge, an independent food science consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Rampling wants the law changed to ensure low-fat milk undergoes
such tests, which are available. Langridge agrees but goes further,
saying all milk and not just the low-fat variety should be screened
this way. &QL;

   Hospital superbugs thrive on sweat, say Danish researchers. They
have found that some antibiotics leak out of the body in sweat, and
believe that bacteria on patients' skin become resistant through
unrelenting exposure to the seeping drugs. Simple physical contact
would then be enough to pass on the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Niels Hxiby and his colleagues at the University of Copenhagen
suggest that doctors might have to limit the use of the most leaky
antibiotics. These include two widely used beta-lactam antibiotics
called cephalosporins.
</P>
<P>
   Hxiby and five other volunteers took five common antibiotics in
turn. He then measured how much came out in sweat samples from the
armpit and forearm. Sweat from all six people contained ceftazidime
and ceftriaxone. Both are ``third-generation'' cephalosporins,
widely used for treating chest and urinary tract infections.
</P>
<P>
   Hxiby says that we all sweat continuously, although most of the
time sweat evaporates without our noticing. So populations of
bacteria on the skin would be reduced to those that survive
exposure to the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the risk is highest in the armpit and the perineum
around the anus, as this is where you sweat most. We know that
these are areas where we see resistant Staphylococcus bacteria,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Antibiotic resistance coincided with the advent of leaky
antibiotics, says Hxiby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found a mechanism which explains why we've seen the
development of multiresistant staphylococci in the 1980s and
1990s,'' he says. ``That's when these third-generation
cephalosporins were introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Hxiby says the only solution might be to use these drugs much
more sparingly in future.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we know which antibiotics disturb the flora of the skin,
we can choose antibiotics that don't,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In previous experiments on himself with ciprofloxacin, a
broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat urinary
tract infections, Hxiby showed that bacteria on the skin developed
resistance only three days after he completed a weeklong course of
treatment. Hxiby says he's now tested 25 antibiotics, and plans to
test the theory further in patients who receive the drugs as part
of their treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important observation, no doubt about that,'' says
Alan Johnson, an antibiotic resistance expert at Britain's Public
Health Laboratory Service in Colindale, London. He agrees that the
phenomenon could be an important unforeseen factor in the spread of
hospital infections. But he warns against hastily withdrawing the
drugs, some of which are vital for intravenous treatment of serious
diseases. &QL;

   Landmines that hop around to foil the crews that clear
minefields are under development in the United States. The
so-called ``self-healing'' minefield can detect when a path is
being cleared through it and instruct the remaining mines to plug
any gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the technology is being developed because the United
States plans to sign the Ottawa Convention, which bans
anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-tank minefields are usually protected by small
anti-personnel mines. These are meant to hinder soldiers who try to
clear a route through the minefield. But anti-personnel mines are
banned under the Ottawa Convention _ already signed by more than
135 countries _ which the United States will sign in 2006. To make
future anti-tank minefields tougher to cross without anti-personnel
mines, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
has committed $13 million to the development of ``intelligent''
minefields.
</P>
<P>
   At Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M., Rush
Robinett and his colleagues are developing robotic anti-tank mines
that can plug gaps in a minefield by hopping about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was catching grasshoppers to go trout fishing when I noticed
that they jump around in a random fashion, hit the ground in an
arbitrary orientation, then right themselves and jump again,''
Robinett says. ``I said to myself: 'I can build a robot that can do
that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hopping has a distinct advantage over more conventional means of
getting about, Robinett says. ``Robots with wheels and tracks can't
crawl over things more than a fraction of the dimension of their
body. A hopping robot can clear things that are ten to one hundred
times its body dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   The mines will have a powerful piston-driven foot attached to
their base that should propel them more than 10 meters into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The self-righting mines will detect the distance to their
neighbors using ultrasonic sensors and communicate with each other
by radio. If some of the mines are removed or destroyed to make a
path through the minefield, the remaining mines will sense that
they are missing and hop around until they form a regular pattern
again. DARPA wants the minefield to reorganise itself within 10
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage of mines is that they are cheap, simple and
effective,'' says Tony Howgate of the Battlefield Engineering Wing
at Britain's Ministry of Defense. ``This isn't going to be cheap or
simple, and the more complicated it gets, the more unreliable it'll
be,'' he says. He also wonders what will stop the hopping mines
going astray. ``How are you going to know where they've hopped
to?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hiznay of the pressure group Human Rights Watch in
Washington D.C. says that the hopping mines must not be capable of
inadvertent, accidental detonation by a person _ a key tenet of the
Ottawa Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the system meets the definition of the treaty, this could
be a good alternative,'' Hiznay says. ``The main concern we have is
how sensitive the device's fuses are to the unintentional acts of a
person. We're asking governments to clarify what physical forces
are necessary to set off all types of mines.'' &QL;

   Members of an indigenous people in western Canada who donated
blood as part of a genetics study nearly 20 years ago are demanding
that the samples be returned. They say that the scientist who took
the samples, now an Oxford professor, has since used them without
their consent for entirely different research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed a paper releasing my blood for arthritis research.
Nothing else. There was no mention of any other kind of research. I
want it back,'' says Larry Baird, chief of the Ucluelet First
Nation, which is part of the Nuu-chah-nulth people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major issue around informed consent, when you tell
people one thing and you do something different,'' says Michael
McDonald of the Centre for Applied Ethics at the University of
British Columbia (UBC). ``This is a serious problem with indigenous
populations around the world. They're very, very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   The researcher who took the samples, Ryk Ward, head of the
department of biological anthropology at Oxford, says in a written
statement: ``It is common practice to retain samples for potential
further research use, however, all those who donated blood samples
... at any stage they may withdraw their consent to participate in
this research.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered to destroy any samples or hand them to another
repository.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, then at UBC, took samples from 883 members of the group
during the early 1980s to look for genetic markers for an unusual
form of arthritis. But in work published during the 1990s Ward used
some of the samples to analyze genetic diversity in the
Nuu-chah-nulth in relation to how and when humans populated the New
World. In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, he
says the material he used was collected ``as part of a biomedical
study'' between 1984 and 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, David Wiwchar of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal
Council newspaper Ha-Shilth-Sa published an article partly based on
Ward's research. Members of the community, recognizing Ward as the
person who took samples for arthritis research, took the matter up
with the Tribal Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council has shown New Scientist a copy of one of Ward's
consent forms, signed in 1983, which mentions only arthritis and
other rheumatic diseases. Council officials say Ward never asked
for further consent.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Spratley of UBC's office of research services says that
based on the original consent form, the university would have
required Ward to get further permission to conduct other studies.
But by the time Ward embarked on the genetic diversity research he
had moved to the University of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Caplan, an ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania,
can't see the problem as long as no one is identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you can show that it harmed, hurt or disenfranchised
someone, legally nothing is going to happen,'' Caplan says.
</P>
<P>
   Baird says the tribal council will decide what action to take at
a meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a small delegation of First Nation people on his
doorstep at Oxford may help,'' he says. &QL;

<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ In its 17 years of work for the wrongly
convicted, Jim McCloskey's Centurion Ministries has freed and won
vindication for 22 innocent people facing the death penalty or a
life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   For them, Centurion was a long shot. For Centurion to intervene
on their behalf, they had to be sure shots.
</P>
<P>
   Their cases had to be compelling; their claims of innocence
credible; their past, though not necessarily crime-free, at least
devoid of a pattern of earlier violent crimes, said McCloskey,
Centurion's founder, president and executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only interested in complete, factual innocence,''
McCloskey said, noting that his lack of confidence in some others'
innocence doesn't mean those people are guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Also important is whether ``chances (are) pretty solid that
they're going to be good, quiet, law-abiding citizens if they're
going to be released from prison,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the convicts whose struggles Centurion champions are
the ``voiceless, anonymous, forgotten, forsaken people'' who have
not become magnets for some political agenda, McCloskey said.
</P>
<P>
   The little-known A.B. Butler Jr. and several dozen others around
the country matched Centurion's criteria and won its help.
</P>
<P>
   The well-known Mumia Abu-Jamal and countless others have _
either directly or through their advocates _ sought Centurion's
help over the years, but didn't get it, McCloskey said.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal was convicted in the 1981 shooting death of
Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel Faulkner. His case is just the
type McCloskey would _ and has _ dismissed. One reason, McCloskey
says, is that he isn't sold on Abu-Jamal's proclaimed innocence.
Another is that Abu-Jamal has a network of supporters around the
world who often spark political protests on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, those for whom Centurion is most likely to fight,
like Butler, have little name recognition and nowhere else to turn,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Butler became the 22nd person whose freedom and
exoneration Centurion secured, by proving he did not kidnap and
rape a Texas woman in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Centurion recently brought Butler from his Texas home to its
Princeton office, where he took his name off the group's
active-case list. It had been on that list since McCloskey gave
Butler his nonprofit agency's full commitment five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Full commitment means McCloskey often works with a private
investigator and a defense attorney for five years or more to
uncover the evidence to free the wrongly convicted person.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's road to freedom and Texas Gov. George W. Bush's pardon
in June began with a letter pleading his case to Centurion about
seven years ago, after having exhausted other avenues of appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without (Centurion), I probably would still be in prison right
now,'' said Butler, who served 17 years of a 99-year prison term
for crimes DNA tests proved he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing McCloskey to fully devote Centurion to a case is like
winning the lottery, said Joan Whalen, the former Centurion worker
whose two-year correspondence with Butler was instrumental in
gaining McCloskey's support for him.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the selection process is random. Rather, it's that
McCloskey doesn't take full commitment to a case lightly.
</P>
<P>
   If he did, it would waste Centurion's scarce resources, which
consist of six employees, 22 volunteers and a $700,000 annual
budget, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   McCloskey decided not to risk those resources on Abu-Jamal's
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he's guilty, but his claims of innocence are
not nearly as compelling as a lot of other cases,'' McCloskey said.
Even so, McCloskey feels Abu-Jamal did not receive a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Taylor, professor of theology and culture at Princeton
Theological Seminary, leads one Abu-Jamal advocacy group, Academics
for Mumia Abu-Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's fair to set Mumia off in another place by
saying he might be guilty until he has a fair trial,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the American legal system, ``a person is innocent whatever
the doubts anyone has about the case until proven guilty in a fair
trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While Centurion can afford to give its full attention only to
the most compelling of the cases it deems credible, McCloskey says
his organization ignores no appeals it receives involving cases
with life or death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Before McCloskey commits to a promising case in full, a
Centurion case worker typically spends up to two years
corresponding with the convict to learn who that person is and
whether the details supporting the claims of innocence in the
letters remain consistent over time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if the claims continue to appear credible, McCloskey
visits the potential candidate in prison for a one-on-one
interview. The inmate must convince McCloskey of his innocence
during that interview or Centurion will reject the case.
</P>
<P>
   And if Centurion's investigation reveals strong evidence of
guilt instead of innocence, as happened with three of its cases,
McCloskey will halt Centurion's fight for the inmate's freedom, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ever catch you lying or have serious doubts that you're
not innocent, we drop your case,'' McCloskey said.

ONE HOME'S UNPLANNED ADDITION: A COURTROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
 By ROY FURCHGOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ We had done all the right things. We checked the
record of the home improvement contractor with state regulators and
the Better Business Bureau. We inspected the contractor's jobs in
progress. We checked references. We wrote and signed a detailed
contract and an additional written agreement that the contractor
would forfeit $100 for each day the job ran late. If the work
didn't go smoothly, we thought, we were covered.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, a year later, we were in a Baltimore courtroom, fighting
over a project that had run months late and was never finished _
and it was the contractor who was suing us.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor-homeowner relationship is a famously fraught one.
Almost everyone has heard horror stories about remodeling projects
from hell, and read the usual tips about how to head off trouble.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when the dispute winds up in litigation is seldom
dissected. Our experience disabused us of some cherished notions
about day-to-day civil justice and exposed the near-uselessness of
many of our precautions, especially when contractors are in such
short supply that homeowners have almost no leverage over them.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts with a house that my girlfriend, Guillemette
Brouillat, bought in November 1998 in Canton, a mainly industrial
area of Baltimore being gentrified with a technology center, stores
and waterfront condominiums. She paid $77,000 for a fixer-upper
near the tech center on a block that seemed poised for a
renaissance. Together, we set out to get the place up to scratch.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing about a dozen contractors, we chose Russell
L. Miller, a friend of a friend of mine. Miller returned calls
promptly, showed up on time for meetings, had good references, no
complaints against him on file, and he didn't object to our desire
to do the paint and tile work ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   He was not the least-expensive contractor around, but time meant
as much to Guillemette as price, because of the high cost of
renting space elsewhere while the work was done. Plus, her mortgage
agreement mandated higher interest charges during construction, and
a six-month deadline for completion.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition started on time, and the framing went quickly. But
progress soon slowed, then seemed to come to a halt. The nine weeks
specified in the contract elapsed. Nervous, we started doing more
of the work ourselves, and barely got the house to a state that
would satisfy the bank in time.
</P>
<P>
   As is usual with home improvements, Miller had been receiving
partial payments along the way, with a final payment of $7,314 due
on completion, plus $1,899 for work added to the project after it
had begun. By our initial reckoning, the job ran 91 days over,
making the late fee $9,100, almost as much as the $9,212 we owed
Miller. We wrote to him, offering to pay $1,899 for the extra work
and call the rest even. That was a lot less than he was expecting
but, we thought, more than he was strictly entitled to. We awaited
a counterproposal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Guillemette was served with a legal notice: Miller's
company, M&AMP;M Restorations, wanted to put a lien on the house for
the entire $9,212, ignoring the late fees, and was suing us to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   We hired a lawyer, Thomas A. Baker, a construction industry
specialist, who explained to us our first mistake: calling the
$100-a-day fee a penalty. As in most other states, Maryland law
generally allows ``damages'' for whatever the delay cost us out of
pocket, but not ``penalties,'' so a judge could throw out the whole
contract on that technicality, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Financially speaking, mistake No. 2 was plowing ahead with
litigation despite Baker's warning that the cost could rapidly
outstrip the amount at issue. But an emotional calculus was at
work: Guillemette was losing sleep worrying about the dispute,
fighting back would make us feel better, and lawyers don't charge
all that much more than therapists. So we countersued, asking for a
delay penalty that we now reckoned at $9,800, plus $4,521 to repair
faulty work.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, Baker had us spend tedious hours
amassing an accordion file full of photographs, specification
sheets, building codes, timetables and other evidence to support
our claim. Meanwhile, we received the specifics of M&AMP;M's claim,
which basically said the delay was our fault.
</P>
<P>
   (Asked last week to comment for this article, Miller said:
``Delays were caused by the homeowner's inability to complete the
work she had charged herself with doing in a reasonable amount of
time.'')
</P>
<P>
   We were sure that, given our evidence, the court had to back our
delay claim. But that was mistake No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Irrespective of proof, Baker told us, courts generally discard
such claims: ``Judges tend to say, `Is the work complete? If so,
pay the contractor.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Baker's advice, we grudgingly switched our sights to more
promising legal territory: work defects. Courts, he said, usually
support homeowners who hold back from a contractor the amounts they
spend to correct poor work. But by fixing some problems ourselves
and putting others off, we had made mistake No. 4: The courts,
Baker told us, care only about money actually spent and rarely
compensate homeowners for work they do themselves.
</P>
<P>
   (Asked last week to comment on the faulty-work claim, Miller
said, ``There were no complaints from the homeowner to myself or
any of my employees until after I had brought a lawsuit against
them.'')
</P>
<P>
   We were learning that at this level, lawsuits are anything but a
high-minded contest of evidence and argument. The court's main goal
is to clear cases from a crowded docket, and there is little
patience for aggrieved homeowners expecting meticulous pursuit of
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   When our first court date arrived in May neither side had budged
from an initial meeting in which we had offered to pay $4,000 of
the $9,212 Miller wanted, but he had come down by only $1,000, to
$8,212.
</P>
<P>
   Before hearing any arguments or testimony, Judge Richard T.
Rombro called the lawyers into chambers to get the bidding going
again. We raised our offer to $5,200, Miller came down to $7,412,
and Baker told us we seemed headed for a settlement at around
$6,000. We thought we could do better in a trial _ mistake No. 5,
since each additional day in court added $1,500 to our legal fees.
But the emotional math still added up, so we held firm.
</P>
<P>
   The next time around, in mid-June before Judge John C. Byrnes,
the settlement tango was reprised. ``The judge thinks the case will
settle for $6,000,'' our lawyer told us. Still too high, we
thought. But when Miller unexpectedly agreed to that figure, we
were on the spot: refusing might seem unreasonable to the judge,
who might find for Miller in a trial to teach us a lesson. Still,
the judge had yet to see our evidence. We decided to roll the dice.
</P>
<P>
   That might have become mistake No. 6, but for a curious turn of
events. The judge called Guillemette into chambers _ ``to bang her
over the head,'' Baker told me outside. The judge was polite but
firm, Guillemette reported afterward: ``He said, `We are not trying
this case over a couple of hundred dollars.'''
</P>
<P>
   Guillemette offered to drop the delay claim, and told the judge,
``I just want enough to fix the defects.'' He asked what proof she
had _ any photographs, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   At last! Guillemette produced our bulging accordion file,
starting with holes in water-damaged basement walls where light
could be seen streaming in.``They left it like that?'' he asked
her, amazed. Guillemette was dismissed and Miller summoned.
</P>
<P>
   We settled on a payment of $5,800 of the $9,212 Miller wanted.
All our trouble had won us a reduction of $3,412.
</P>
<P>
   We considered it a moral victory, if a pyrrhic one _ Baker's
bill came to $6,914, even after a generous gift of a day's fees,
and the house still needed work.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Over sandwiches afterward, we discussed how justice works in a
case like ours. Baker explained that while our case was unique and
all-important to us, judges have seen thousands like it. ``The
judge first meets with the lawyers to see if he trusts them,''
Baker said _ a wash in our case, with experienced local lawyers on
each side. Next, the judge might ask a few questions to help steer
the parties toward a settlement. Evidence might only enter into the
matter to satisfy the judge's curiosity, as in our case, or at a
trial, if settlement talks failed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Our fight didn't make economic sense in the end, but we thought
that we would at least be leaving a record that could guide other
homeowners. Again we were mistaken. To complete the settlement, we
had to agree to withdraw a complaint we had filed against M &AMP; M
with the Maryland Home Improvement Commission _ and the Better
Business Bureau does not report complaints that have been settled
out of court. There is a public record of the suit at the
courthouse, but you'd have to know just where to look.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned some expensive lessons, we thought about some
remodeling that my house needs, and asked Baker how we could
immunize ourselves against winding up in court again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't,'' he said, almost cheerfully. He insisted on paying
for lunch. &QL;

PLENTY OF ISSUES FOR GORE, BUSH TO CHEW ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October   01, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Presidential contests are taffy pulls.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans and Democrats stretch to opposite poles, and the
undecideds are like the taffy in the middle, gradually pulled to
one pole or the other, the gooey middle getting
thinner-thinner-thinner, till at the end one pole has the larger
blob of votes.
</P>
<P>
   That process requires polarization of the people in the middle.
Each campaign tries to portray the other guy as an unsafe choice.
So the Bush scheme is to demonize Al Gore on the theme: You can't
trust him. The Gore scheme is to portray George W. as a dope who
would wreck the economy and screw up Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear a lot of this from both men when the first
presidential debate of the season is uncorked Tuesday night at
UMass-Boston. Each man will try and draw a stark picture of the
policies of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Since the economy under Clinton has just won the Gold Medal for
being the most super-duper economy ever, the Republican attacks on
Gore probe elsewhere: He's a liar, he exaggerates the cost of his
dog's arthritis pills, he thinks he invented the Internet, etc. And
then there's the Republican claim that the Clinton-Gore
administration ``hollowed out'' the military, gave it too much to
do, weakened our nation's security, and won't spend enough on
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   It was to insulate defense and foreign affairs from political
mudslinging that President Clinton chose as secretary of defense
Bill Cohen, the Maine Republican who had served 18 years in the
Senate, six years in the House, and who had crafted a reputation
for independence and probity that spanned the partisan canyon that
has riven the Beltway Mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen recapped Clinton's appeal to him, saying the president
told him, ``I want to send a signal to the country'' that
Washington's partisanship would stop at the water's edge. Cohen
spoke Thursday at the New England Council's 75th anniversary dinner
for 700 business types at the Westin Hotel, where he received the
``New Englander of the Year'' award along with Blue Cross-Blue
Shield chief William Van Faasen.
</P>
<P>
   The election-year criticism of the Democratic administration's
custody of the military and national security was cooly rebuffed by
Cohen, a lifelong Republican: ``Every country in the world looks to
us,'' he said flatly, ``for setting the standard, for prosperity,
equality, liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has logged over 700,000 air miles visiting troops in the
field, been in every country of any consequence, as the civilian
chief of the mightiest military ever constructed. He talked of
seeing flight crews work in 140-degree heat on the USS George
Washington in the Persian Gulf, of Marines landing in East Timor to
build shelters for refugees, of Marines in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   US troops are ``the most advanced, respected and feared'' in the
world, but ``They're far more than warriors, they're peacekeepers
and relief workers _ we are the ones who are there when societies
collapse, and order needs to be restored in some Godforsaken hot
spot.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we have 100,000 uniformed men and women in Asia, and
as many in Europe, and 23,000 in the Persian Gulf. We are there
``to keep the peace, making the world safe, to be free and
prosperous.'' Pointing to the Serbian election just lost by
dictator Slobodan Milosevic, Cohen said the 78-day NATO air war
saved a million Albanians from ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 38,000 sorties, we lost two airplanes and no pilots,'' a
technological miracle credited to the skill and equipment of US
fliers. ``We settled their lives,'' he said of the Albanian
Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's speech was not broadcast; it was heard only by 700
people. In the campaign, as in the Congress, other issues crowd in,
some of them basic, some of them trivial. Neither the hugely
expensive national missile defense system (which Clinton has
stalled so the next president can make the costly decision) nor
America's complicated role abroad have been thoroughly ventilated
by the debate to date.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen repudiated the isolationist wing within his own party when
he addressed those who'd argue that American should pull back from
its interventions around the world. Plucking an admonition from
Oliver Wedndell Holmes Sr. to an earlier generation of Americans,
Cohen quoted: ``We must sail, and not lie at anchor, or drift.''
</P>
<P>
   What we're sailing now is aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf,
not square-riggers built of New England oak. But the mission is the
same, to Cohen as to Clinton: projecting America's role, mission
and force, if need be, wherever and whenever deemed vital.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ralph Nader's argument _ it will be amplified Sunday in
a big Green Party rally at the Fleet Center _ that there's not a
dime's worth of difference between the two major parties on issues
that matter, Bill Cohen would beg to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   On a new missile defense scheme that would outrage our allies as
well as our adversaries, on whether to insert Marines here or there
wherever massacre looms, on the newly authorized abortion pill or
on the appointment of Supreme Court replacements, there are
differences between the two major taffy pullers that the Greens
cannot honestly deny.

DELAYED? TAKE OUT FRUSTRATION AT THE AIRPORT GYM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Mass.)  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)   By LAURA KOSS-FEDER     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucky Gold, who makes 30 or more business trips a year, says
that being able to work out using a treadmill and free weights
while on the road is crucial to his well-being.
</P>
<P>
   So when Gold's job as senior vice president for business
development at the Marvin Group, an aerospace company in Inglewood,
Calif., takes him to Boston, as it does at least once a month, he
doesn't race out of Logan International Airport the minute he
arrives. Instead, he stops for an hour or so at a health club on
the airport grounds, at the Hilton Boston Logan Airport hotel.
Sometimes he even catches an earlier flight than necessary, to
allow time for exercise before his meetings in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having this facility right at the airport is so handy,'' Gold
said. ``Working out helps me stay mentally fit and better prepared
for any meeting I'm going to, or any presentation that I'm making.
And if I wind up getting delayed at the airport for any period of
time, then the health club becomes even more important.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air travel system becomes ever more congested and prone
to delays, airports are adding ground services to meet the needs of
business travelers or to simply help them pass the extra time.
These include more stores and restaurants, but also creature
comforts like gyms and health clubs. Some, like the one that Gold
frequents in Boston, are in airport hotels; others are in the
terminal itself or in freestanding facilities on airport property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody looks forward to a three- or four-hour layover, but it
is a major stress reliever for business travelers to do a little
shopping or get a quick workout while they're waiting at the
airport,'' said Randy Petersen, publisher of Inside Flyer, a
magazine for frequent travelers. Petersen himself expects to spend
200 days on the road this year for business.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines depend on business travelers _ who fly more often and
pay much higher fares than tourists _ for 46 percent of their
revenue, according to the National Business Travel Association,
which represents corporate travel managers. Airport authorities and
airlines alike have an economic stake in making airports as
appealing as possible to these road warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many harried business travelers, when faced with a
long delay or layover, are not looking for any distractions, just a
quiet spot to catch up on work or reading. ``There are those times
when I just want to return a few calls and look over some materials
before a meeting while waiting at the airport,'' said Ira Birns,
treasurer of Arrow Electronics, a components distributor in
Melville, N.Y., who travels about 25 times a year for his job.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who do want a break from the laptop and the cell
phone, a growing number of airports are helping to soothe frazzled
nerves by offering on-site gyms, like the Airport Fitness Center at
Pittsburgh International Airport. Mark Knight, regional director of
BAA USA, which operates shopping and other concessions at the
airport, said the center included exercise equipment, showers and
sauna, and had workout clothing available for sale or rent. A
single day's visit costs $9.99; a one-year membership is $420.
</P>
<P>
   In March, McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas added a
branch of the 24-Hour Fitness health club chain, the chain's first
at an airport. The club offers aerobics classes in addition to the
usual exercise facilities, and employs a sports nutritionist who
will pack healthy snacks for business travelers to take along on
flights.
</P>
<P>
   Airport hotels are also trying to tap into the growing pool of
the stranded, by marketing their facilities to airport passengers
beyond their regular guests. Like its sister hotel in Boston, the
Hilton Chicago O'Hare Airport regularly distributes fliers at
information booths throughout the airport encouraging business
travelers to buy $10 daily passes to its health club, which
includes a pool, whirlpool, exercise machines, sauna and showers,
according to the club's manager, Steven Andos. Tanning beds and a
personal trainer are also available.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 of the 800 people who use the health club on a typical
day are not hotel guests, Andos said, and roughly 15 percent of the
500 regular members are travelers who pass through O'Hare regularly
without staying at the hotel. The Boston hotel, which charges $9 to
$15 for a day, gets about 20 percent of its traffic from nonguests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people don't even mind that much being in the
airport for a few hours between flights, since they know they can
have a good workout, take a shower and leave feeling refreshed,''
Andos said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A chance to work up a sweat is not the only amenity that
airports, big and small, are offering to between-planes travelers.
T.F. Green Airport in Providence, R.I., has just 22 gates in its
terminal, but passengers can get a 15-minute massage there for $15.
Last month, the airport added express manicure and pedicure
service.
</P>
<P>
   The massage service at Nashville International Airport proved a
godsend for Jerry Daly, who owns Daly Gray, a public relations firm
in Herndon, Va., and who threw out his back on a recent trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing those massage chairs was like finding an oasis in the
desert,'' said Daly, who paid $15 for a 15-minute massage just
before heading home from a business trip. ``I was in so much pain,
and this made me feel somewhat better. This is a great service to
have at an airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Other airports, like Orlando International, have in-terminal
salons where travelers can get haircuts, massages or manicures.
</P>
<P>
   And the number and range of retail stores and restaurants in
airports growing, too: In the Airmall at Pittsburgh International,
many of the 105 stores are specifically aimed at business
travelers, including a Staples office products outlet. ``As many as
10 percent of business travelers we've surveyed have said that they
will purposely try to connect through Pittsburgh rather than
somewhere else, just to use our shops and services,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   For what ails some travelers, though, exercise or pampering or
shopping may not be enough. Kennedy International in New York, for
example, provides services for which there is no substitute. The
airport's chapel offers a setting for quiet prayer and a chance to
speak with a priest, minister or rabbi. When pain gets really bad,
there is an on-site emergency dentist.

<P>
   This is a story about the search for corporate citizenship, and
a cautionary tale of money, influence and the limits of American
power.
</P>
<P>
   The tale begins in 1925 in Augusta, Maine, where a local company
provocatively named American Foreign Power and Electric legally
incorporated a subsidiary, the Electric Co. of Ecuador (Emelec by
its Spanish acronym), to serve the rapidly growing city of
Guayaquil.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from Maine to Ecuador, but such was the reach of
Yankee business ingenuity in those pre-globalization days. Foreign
Power had already set up similar, quite lucrative companies in
Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Cuba. All were acquired in 1960 by
Boise Cascade, the forest products company, which was interested
because American Foreign Power had originally burned wood for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The Ecuadorian operation thrived for years, even after the
government started regulating its rates. Then, in the mid-1980s,
disputes began flaring. The American owners said they could no
longer charge enough to cover costs; the government said Emelec was
not meeting the terms of its concession.
</P>
<P>
   In binding arbitration, the company won a ruling that the
government had broken the 1925 contract and owed Emelec $52
million. The government refused to pay.
</P>
<P>
   While this dispute simmered, Emelec changed hands several times,
eventually coming under the control of a Bahamas-based entity owned
by an Ecuadorian tycoon named Fernando Aspiazu who has been in
trouble with his government. Yet it remained an American
corporation, filing an American tax return each year, though it
hasn't reported a profit or paid a dollar in taxes since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Now the story takes a twist. Aspiazu also happened to own a bank
in Ecuador, the Banco del Progreso, which failed in 1999. To
recapitalize the bank, he took steps to sell stock in his power
company, which he placed in a trust.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Ecuador seized the bank before the sale, and
arrested Aspiazu. (He has not been charged, but remains in jail.)
Aspiazu then tried to keep the power company's assets out of
government hands by creating another trust to sell Emelec's assets
and repay thousands of angry bank depositors. An American, Peter
Heberling of the Latin America Finance Group, was named the sole
trustee, and William Van Dieppen, president of the group, planned
to help with the liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiazu's motives are less than clear, but he seemed to think he
could act like Robin Hood. ``More than 500,000 families are
affected by the bank's failure,'' Van Dieppen said. ``Making sure
they get repaid can't hurt Aspiazu's chances of having his name
rehabilitated.''
</P>
<P>
   Any American investor lured by Latin America's promise fears
corruption and complication, which go hand in hand. Ecuador is one
of South America's least stable countries, and early this year
things really started to come apart. The economy was in such a
shambles that the president, Jamil Mahuad, tried to scrap its
currency in favor of dollars, but people took to the streets, the
army took the Presidential Palace and Mahuad took off for quieter
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   As the dust was settling, Van Dieppen was talking to four
potential American buyers for Emelec, including Enron. But the new
president of Ecuador, Gustavo Noboa, needed to send a message that
things had changed in the country for people like Aspiazu. He sent
troops and the police to seize Emelec headquarters in Guayaquil.
</P>
<P>
   The company appealed to the American embassy in Quito, only to
be told that Emelec, the direct descendant of American Foreign
Power, was not considered an American corporation. ``The State
Department did not do its homework,'' Van Dieppen said, adding that
he thought that the ambassador, Gwen Clare, had sided with the
Ecuadorian government. Van Dieppen said his calls to the ambassador
and the State Department were not returned. ``We felt totally
abandoned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dieppen then turned to the one tried-and-true fallback for
any company anywhere in the world: He hired lawyers to push
Emelec's interests in Washington. He went to Capitol Hill and lined
up the support of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. For a time he also paid
Kissinger McLarty Associates, the high-octane Washington consulting
firm led by Henry Kissinger and Thomas F. McLarty III, President
Clinton's former chief of staff, to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The investment in influence apparently paid off. On Aug. 28,
Clare said in a letter that the dispute had been raised by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during a visit to Ecuador.
``The government of Ecuador should quickly and fairly sort out the
competing claims on Emelec's assets,'' Clare wrote, adding that she
looked forward to working with the trust.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official familiar with the case said the
embassy's initial reaction was based on a mistrust of Aspiazu's
role. But after Helms' office and Emelec's lawyers and
representatives in Washington expressed interest, department
officials decided to take another look. ``Some things could have
been resolved faster,'' the official conceded. ``But these guys had
a lot of things on their platter.''
</P>
<P>
   He was alluding to the new administration led by Noboa, who also
seems to have changed his position. When he was victoriously
touring Emelec's seized offices, he brushed off reporters'
questions about constitutional violations, declaring, ``I have to
do what I need to do _ impose order on this country.'' But in a
recent speech to New York investors, he seemed almost contrite,
saying that the confidence of American investors, which Ecuador
desperately needs, is being restored because the nation is
``beginning to change.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what happened to American Foreign Power exposes some
of the rules of global influence game as it is now played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never assume that the United States government is necessarily
going to be on your side in your hour of need,'' Van Dieppen said.
Without top-notch representation in Washington, he said, ``no one
is going to take you seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Or in Guayaquil, either, it seems.

IN THE DATA MINE, THERE IS SELDOM A POT OF GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTn: Utah)  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 1) 
 &HT;    Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a
newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment
strategies appears every other week. E-mail:
strategy(at)nytimes.com.
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After eight years of publication, one of the investment
newsletters that I monitor called it quits over the summer. The
newsletter, named Beating the Dow, was one of several that
recommend stocks known as the ``Dogs of the Dow'' _ those among the
Dow Jones industrials that offer the highest yields.
</P>
<P>
   Because advisory letters come and go, I usually would not
consider the demise of one of them newsworthy. This case is
different, because it teaches us something about a dangerous
practice called data mining _ in which advisers continually run
investment strategies through databases until they find one that
has beaten the market. It seems that almost all strategies that
emerge from such a process, sometimes known as back-testing, stop
working after we start to follow them.
</P>
<P>
   To determine whether an apparently successful strategy is worth
a bet, we first need to know how many other strategies were also
back-tested. An adviser might have tested 99 strategies that failed
before coming across one that succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, the odds are overwhelming that the 100th
strategy will eventually fail, too. After all, we should expect
that a few randomly picked strategies will appear to work but don't
_ a phenomenon known in the scientific world as ``false
positives.''
</P>
<P>
   Because few advisers reveal how many of their strategies were
failures, the best practical defense against data mining is to test
the apparently successful strategy over a different period than
used initially. Few advisers have the patience for these tests
because they typically require years to complete. As a result, most
investors are unwitting participants in the real-time tests of
their advisers' data mining.
</P>
<P>
   I am not suggesting that Beating the Dow was engaging in data
mining simply because it favored high-yielding stocks. But I detect
signs of data mining in two of the specific portfolios the letter
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the ``Five-Stock System,'' one of the letter's
recommended strategies. That system calls for buying the five
lowest-priced stocks among the 10 highest-yielding Dow companies.
As far as I can tell, there was no basis for this approach other
than the fact that the stocks did better in back-testing.
</P>
<P>
   That is a sure sign of data mining, according to Grant McQueen
and Steven Thorley, finance professors at Brigham Young University.
They suggest that investors be on guard for any strategy in which
the only motive for tweaking a portfolio is that it improves
back-tested results.
</P>
<P>
   Data mining was also evident in another of the newsletter's
strategies, the ``Penultimate Profit Prospect.'' That approach
calls for buying just one stock: the second-lowest-priced issue
among the Dow's highest yielders. (The lowest-priced stock did not
do as well in back-testing.)
</P>
<P>
   Given these signs of data mining, it is no surprise that these
strategies were laggards. According to The Hulbert Financial
Digest, simply buying the 10 highest-yielding blue chips produced a
13.9 percent annualized return from the end of 1992 through June 30
of this year. In contrast, the Five-Stock System gained 11.7
percent and the one-stock strategy lost 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a number of other advisers have yet to learn such
lessons. One of the best-known proponent of these strategies is the
Motley Fool, the online investment site. It recommends the
``Foolish Four'' strategy, whose portfolio construction rules are
constantly being tweaked by back-testing.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the strategy worked like this: Start with the
Five-Stock System, but eliminate the lowest-priced stock and give
double weight to the so-called Penultimate Profit Prospect. In the
face of subsequent back-testing, this rule was tweaked to eliminate
the double weighting and to add a few other features.
</P>
<P>
   In response to its disappointing performance, Motley Fool is now
searching for yet more construction rules. Ann Coleman, a Motley
Fool writer, said the approach was to ``test and tweak and
brainstorm and test some more.'' Sounds like data mining to me. &QL;

REVIVING DEAD AND DORMANT LANGUAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ind., Calif., Ore., Hawaii, Ariz.)   By ALEXANDER STILLE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last seven years, Jessie Little Doe Fermino, a member
of the Mashpee tribe on Cape Cod, has been on a single-minded
mission to revive the language of her ancestors, Wamponoag, the
language that greeted the Puritans when they landed at Plymouth
Rock and that gave the state of Massachusetts its name. But when
she applied to the National Endowment of the Humanities for a grant
to create a Wampanoag dictionary, she was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent reasons: The Wamponoag language has not been used
in about 100 years, the known descendants of the original speakers
number only 2,500 and Fermino is trying to make a spoken language
out of a language that until recently existed only in documents,
many of them from the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got great reviews from the specialists, but the panel of
nonspecialists hated it,'' Fermino said.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Baldwin, who is reviving the language of the Miami Nation
in Indiana and raising his children in it, says he has met with a
similar mixture of encouragement and skepticism: ``I've run into
people who say, `I'll give you an `A' for effort, but you're never
going to revive that language.''' The last native speaker died in
1962, leaving no audio tapes of his speech, so Baldwin had to go to
graduate school in linguistics and work from documents to try to
create a Miami grammar and re-create the spoken language.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of doubts and many difficulties, the revival of
indigenous languages is a growing movement among Native American
groups from Hawaii to Cape Cod, and it is fast becoming a new
subspecialty in the field of linguistics as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer use the term `dead' language _ we now speak of
them as `dormant,''' said Leanne Hinton, a professor of linguistics
at the University of California at Berkeley, which recently
sponsored its fourth annual ``Breath of Life California Language
Restoration Workshop.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the workshop are busy preparing dictionaries,
grammars and education programs. Similar initiatives have taken
root at the Universities of Arizona and Oregon and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   There are 211 indigenous languages still extant throughout the
United States and Canada, but only 20 of them are spoken by the
youngest generation of their communities. The rest may well face
oblivion in the next 50 years. Only one, Navajo, has more than
100,000 speakers, and it, too, is declining among the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``All 211 are in danger of extinction,'' says Akira Yamamoto, a
professor of linguistics at the University of Kansas who works each
summer at the University of Arizona's language reclamation
institute.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the language revival movement is picking up steam,
some scholars outside of linguistics are questioning whether we
should try to save endangered languages at all. ``Languages have
died throughout human history _ our own language bears little
resemblance to the English of the 15th century,'' says Michael
Blake, a professor of philosophy at Harvard University, who
recently published a broadside attack on the movement to protect
endangered cultures in Civilization magazine. ``It is not
immediately clear to me why we should try to preserve them,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, Yamamoto says, is aesthetic: Languages, like animal
species, contribute to the richness and diversity of the world:
``If you speak English, you have one world; if you speak Navajo,
you have another world.'' For example, Yamamoto points out, in the
Algonquin family of languages, noun endings are divided into two
basic categories: animate and inanimate. So, while Romance
languages separate nouns by gender, the Algonquin sees the world in
terms of things that have spirit and things that do not. And,
Yamamoto adds, ``This is reflected in their culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake says it may be sad to lose languages but sometimes it is a
necessary price we pay for progress and freedom of choice in
society: ``I think we can acknowledge a sense of loss, but I think
these are losses that we suffer as a free people, when we decide
what norms to adopt and to leave behind. There are reasons that
these languages are dying out, that members of these communities
have decided to assimilate, and those reasons have to be respected,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of language revival respond that the idea of
``freedom of choice'' is highly problematic, especially in the case
of American Indian languages, which were frequently actively
suppressed. ``As an Indian to hear about languages `dying' or
becoming `extinct' hits at our core,'' says Baldwin. ``The federal
government has always wanted Indian people either to become extinct
or to assimilate.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of the Hawaiian language is an example. It was
spoken almost universally in Hawaii until the islands were annexed
by the United States in 1898. The Hawaiians had adapted their
language to written form, used it as the language of government and
begun translating much of world literature into it. But with
annexation, Hawaiian was suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   It had dwindled to about 1,500 fluent native speakers by the
1980s, when a group of professors at the University of Hawaii at
Hilo began a concerted effort to reclaim it. They set up a
preschool in which elderly Hawaiian speakers taught the language to
the children. Gradually, by adding a new grade each year, they
succeeded in creating a preschool-to-high school system in which
Hawaiian is the primary language of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't it be more useful for young Hawaiians to learn
languages like Spanish or French, which are spoken by millions of
people, rather than a language used by only a few thousand? And are
language revival programs holding youngsters back from acquiring
the skills they need to succeed in mainstream society?
</P>
<P>
   Blake says the children ``are going to lose some of the
opportunity that English education gives them.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates answer that students in the Hawaiian program score
slightly higher in standardized tests than native Hawaiian students
from English-language schools. The program's first graduates to
enter college all passed their English composition tests.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Ravitch, a professor of education at New York University,
is a frequent critic of progressive educational fads, but she has a
strongly positive view of language revival. ``I think cultural
retrieval is an important thing that people need to go through, as
long as it is voluntary and the children also learn English, which
they need to go to college. The language sustains their culture and
their link with the past, which is an important aspect of who we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravitch pointed out that her own grandchildren are attending a
school where instruction is half-Hebrew and half-English. ``The
revival of Hebrew is one of the great stories of linguistics of
modern times,'' she says. And she continues: ``I find the argument
that we should do nothing to preserve languages and culture toxic.
Otherwise, we are just left with mass culture, pop culture and the
whims of the marketplace.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Millions of voters will get a chance to see
Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush in a live,
unscripted showdown Tuesday night when the presidential contenders
square-off in the first of three debates that could sway the
outcome of the closest presidential election in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the 52-year-old vice president, and Bush, the 54-year-old
governor of Texas, will be trying to sell themselves to voters as
the best qualified to succeed President Clinton when he leaves
office in January.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hopes to steel his aw-shucks appeal with the detailed
knowledge required of a president. Gore is looking to connect with
voters by toning down his lofty policy-laden pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from staking out competing policy positions, the
candidates are hoping to seize an edge that could break open the
stubborn statistical dead heat in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, says the debates take on added significance this year
because the contest remains so deadlocked. The debates ``will be
the whole ball game'' _ potentially as decisive as the encounters
in 1960, 1976 and 1980 that gave challengers the momentum to win
the presidency, Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   In polls released Friday, Gore and Bush remained virtually tied,
though state-by-state surveys gave Gore the edge in enough states
to garner 293 electoral votes; Bush held the lead in states
commanding 191 electoral votes. A candidate needs to win enough
states to garner 270 electoral votes to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The three debates offer the candidates a total of 4 hours and 30
minutes of free prime time television time to reach the estimated
80 million TV viewers who are expected to be drawn to an OK-Corral
format that can spark memorable one-liners, disastrous gaffes and
fuel chit chat at the office water cooler for days afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kirk, the former Democratic chairman who co-chairs the
unofficial bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, likens
the debates to subjecting candidates to ``job interviews with the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk adds: ``The debates help voters decide if they want this
guy in their homes on their television sets for the next four
years. This is as real as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a veteran of five nationally televised presidential
campaign debates, told the Public Broadcasting System's ``Debating
Our Destiny'' project that the encounters ``give voters the best
chance they can get to take the measure of a person under some
fire'' and see whether a candidate ``can understand a situation in
a hurry and respond to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-Gore debate on Tuesday at 9 p.m. EDT takes place in
Boston at the University of Massachusetts adjacent to the John F.
Kennedy presidential library, with the candidates standing behind
lecterns.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters plan to march on the site to urge the debate
commission to open up the encounters to third-party challengers,
such as the Green Party's Ralph Nader and the Reform Party's Pat
Buchanan, who were not invited because they failed to draw at least
15 percent in six nationwide polls.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidates' showdown is followed on Thursday by
a debate between their vice presidential running mates, Republican
Dick Cheney and Democrat Joe Lieberman, at Centre College in
Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore meet again on Oct. 11 at Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, N.C., in a talk-show style format, seated
side-by-side with a moderator. The candidates last week for a
debate on Oct. 17 at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., for a
town hall-style meeting fielding questions from citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Each presidential debate is 90 minutes long and will be anchored
by Jim Lehrer of PBS.
</P>
<P>
   The ground rules permit the candidates to take notes and to
introduce people from the audience to illustrate a policy position,
just as the last three presidents have done during their State of
the Union addresses. The candidates cannot bring any crib sheets or
props into the hall or use video excerpts from the debates for
subsequent campaign ads. The political parties and independent
political organizations are free to harvest video moments of
triumph or embarrassment for ads.
</P>
<P>
   Despite candidates' pre-debate jockeying to lower expectations
for their own performance and raise the bar for their rival, Gore
and Bush head into the debates with formidable reputations for
staging stunts, blunting rivals' parries and recovering from snafus
on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a veteran of three presidential campaigns and 24 years in
the House, Senate and vice presidency, planned to closet himself
and his debate prep team at the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota,
Fla., from Saturday until leaving for Boston on Tuesday morning.
Gore used the setting that includes a shark tank and an impromptu
basketball court to prepare for his 1996 debate as vice president
against GOP vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said the debate was ``an opportunity to talk
directly with the American people,'' clarify differences with Bush
and give voters ``the information and let them make the choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, saying he wanted to ``stay in touch with the concerns of
the people I hope to serve as president,'' invited a dozen ordinary
citizens from around the country to help him prepare for what he
described as ``a job interview'' with the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who by the Bush campaign's count has taken part in at
least 45 debates during his political career, has often
demonstrated a knack for the political jugular, including during
his battle for the Democratic nomination with former Sen. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dramatically challenged Bradley's vote as a senator against
federal disaster relief for flooded farmers during a debate before
the Iowa caucuses in January, by introducing an Iowa farmer in the
audience who suffered flood damage on 300 acres in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you vote against the disaster relief for Chris
Peterson when he and thousands of other farmers here in Iowa needed
it after those '93 floods?'' Gore demanded of Bradley in the
debate's most dramatic moment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has shown an ability to recover from debate mistakes,
backpedaling quickly after telling voters in a campaign debate with
Bradley in New Hampshire that he would impose a ``litmus test''
requiring prospective appointees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to
fully support allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the nation's
armed forces. Gore quelled a political firestorm two days later by
saying that he would only require military officers to carry out
his policies as president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore showed in his 1992 debate with then-Vice President Dan
Quayle that he can thrust and parry, as well. When Quayle insisted
that Clinton had ``trouble telling the truth,'' Gore snapped back
with a rejoinder reminding voters of President George Bush's
flip-flop on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush, in case you've forgotten Dan, said, `Read my
lips, no new taxes,'' Gore injected.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato says that Gore should ``make his policy points without
being arrogant or appearing school-marmish.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee defeated by
the Clinton-Gore ticket, said in a PBS interview that Gore has to
fight the same tendency to dote on specifics that he had as a
senator-turned-nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're running for president _ they don't need to know how the
watch is made,'' Dole advised. ``Just tell them what time it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, saying he views the encounter as ``a great opportunity to
explain my vision for the country,'' planned to spend the weekend
at his 1,500-acre ranch in Crawford, Texas, where he has outfitted
a ranch bunkhouse that he uses for exercise equipment with lecterns
to rehearse for the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have the least experience in government of any
presidential candidate since retired Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower ran
in 1952. But the son of the former president won his shot at the
presidency in the first place by besting silver-tongued Texas Gov.
Ann Richards in a gubernatorial upset in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, an ex-oil field entrepreneur and baseball team owner,
tangled effectively during the 10 multi-candidate debates during
the GOP presidential primaries with his most durable rival, Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., a master of 17 years of give-and-take in the
House and Senate. Bush surprised McCain and threw the ex-Navy
fighter pilot on the defensive during a campaign debate in the
South Carolina primary by wielding a negative campaign leaflet
sponsored by the McCain campaign that had appeared on a voter's
windshield after McCain promised to end negative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato says that Bush must appear presidential and in command of
policy details to combat some voters' concerns that the Yale- and
Harvard-educated multimillionaire is ``not bright enough or quick
enough on his feet to serve as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabato adds: ``People will be looking to see whether he is truly
articulate and knowledgeable _ or grammatically challenged as he
has been on some occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, in remarks at Denison University in Florida on Thursday,
said it was ``critical'' for Bush to burnish his image as a
prospective president, adding: ``There's that feeling that he's not
quite ready for prime time, that he doesn't fit the suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said one mistake he hopes to avoid is glancing at his watch
as his father did impatiently during the three-way presidential
debate in 1992. As the GOP nominee put it: ``I'm not going to be
looking at my watch, I can assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President George H.W. Bush recalled that moment in an
interview for the PBS documentary. ``It took a little incident like
that to show that I was, you know, out of it,'' the former
president recalled. ``They made a huge thing out of that.''

   About 80 million Americans are expected to view the first
debate, Kirk said, down from the record of 98 million who viewed
the final presidential debate in 1992 but above the 66.4 million
who viewed the first nationally televised presidential debate in
1960 between then-Vice President Richard M. Nixon and Sen. John F.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The major broadcast and cable television networks will broadcast
the Tuesday night debate. NBC and Fox have opted out of national
broadcast coverage, citing other broadcast commitments. But NBC
agreed Friday to offer the debate to its affiliate stations around
the nation as well as via the cable network, MSNBC.

   Past participants in the presidential and vice presidential
candidates who have endured laser-like scrutiny during the 18
presidential and five vice presidential nationally televised
debates since 1960 know the dangers of words gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, known at the time as an acerbic Kansan, dealt his ticket a
blow in 1976 when, as the GOP vice presidential nominee, he charged
that 1.7 million Americans had been killed ``in Democrat wars in
this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Then-President Gerald Ford committed a gaffe of his own in a
1976 debate with former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, insisting in the
midst of the Soviet Union's Cold War control of Eastern Europe that
``there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never
will be under a Ford administration.'' The Ford-Dole ticket lost.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Mondale, the former vice president who carried the
Democrats' banner in 1984, paid the price for a triumphant one
liner by his rival. Then-President Ronald Reagan, 73 and the oldest
person to serve as president, had appeared flustered at points
during the first Reagan-Mondale debate.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second showdown, Reagan was affable, relaxed and in
command. When questioned about his earlier performance and the
impact of age, Reagan quipped: ``I want you to know I will not make
age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for
political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondale, in his interview for the PBS special, said he knew his
campaign was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked off and I was almost certain the campaign was over _
and it was,'' Mondale recalled. Reagan carried every state against
Mondale except the challenger's native Minnesota and the District
of Columbia.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The wild swings in popularity between Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush throughout the
summer have made for a volatile and unpredictable presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As the two hopefuls prepare for their first debate Tuesday in
Boston, public opinion polls find them locked in a contest that has
suddenly become too close to call. With just over a month to go
before the election, experts say the stakes in the debates couldn't
be higher.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore and Bush have been campaigning for more than a
year, the three televised meetings will be the first opportunity
for voters to see them alongside one another. A slightly more
flexible debate format is expected to allow for more unscripted
give-and-take than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debates are most important in closely contested elections,
like this one,'' said Alan Schroeder, a journalism professor and
author of the recent book ``Presidential Debates: 40 Years of
High-Risk TV.'' ``For that bloc of undecided voters who hold the
key to the election, the debates are what they are waiting for.''
</P>
<P>
   While polls show a narrow slice of undecided voters, analysts
say that a segment of the support for both candidates is extremely
soft, which might explain the double-digit leads both men have
enjoyed and then watched vanish throughout the summer. That
fair-weather support, the experts say, means voters could be swayed
by a stellar or disastrous debate performance.
</P>
<P>
   It's happened before. In 1976, a tight race forced President
Gerald Ford to debate an obscure Georgia governor and peanut farmer
named Jimmy Carter. In the closing moments of one of their debates,
Ford made the astonishing assertion that ``there is no Soviet
domination of Eastern Europe.'' A follow-up question failed to
convince Ford to back off his claim.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was replayed in news reports and, although the
term wasn't invented yet, became the ``sound bite'' of the debate.
A few weeks later, Carter inched by Ford in what was the closest
presidential election of the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reinforced this impression that Ford was a bumbler, which
was a false impression to begin with,'' said David Perlmutter, a
professor of political communication at Louisiana State University.
``It shows the demand for these candidates to be eloquent. This
wasn't true in the pre-TV era.''
</P>
<P>
   The first televised presidential debate, in 1960, almost didn't
occur. Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kennedy challenged incumbent Vice
President Richard Nixon to an on-air face-off, but Nixon's advisers
strongly argued against it. They sensed that the medium would be
kinder to the good-looking, articulate young senator than to their
boss.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was well aware of the political benefits of television.
Writing in TV Guide in 1959, he said that a candidate's ``TV
impression'' had little to do with his stand on issues, but rather
intangibles like perceived ``honesty, vigor, compassion and
intelligence ... the candidate's image.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy and Nixon finally squared off, 66 million viewers
tuned in to watch. They saw Kennedy, tanned and resplendent in a
dark blue suit, seemingly at ease before the TV cameras and studio
lights. Nixon, meanwhile, looked pallid and was dressed in dour
gray. He sat bolt upright in his seat and fidgeted.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Robert Dole, a staunch Nixon loyalist, said he
remembered hearing the debate on the car radio as he drove home to
Kansas and figured the vice president won easily with his mastery
of the issues. But when Dole saw a replay on television, he
concluded that Kennedy ``wiped him out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore and Bush camps have learned from the past. Gore has
studiously worked at shedding his reputation for woodenness while
Bush has tried to get rid of the smirk that seemed permanently
stuck to his face and made audiences wonder if he thought
everything was a joke.
</P>
<P>
   LSU's Perlmutter also said that debate preparation these days is
heavily weighted with pre-scripted ``gotcha!'' lines and even
snappy comebacks in the hopes of knocking an opponent off stride
and scoring the sound bite of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most memorable debate jibe came during a vice
presidential face-off in 1988 when veteran Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
launched his famous ``You, Senator, are no Jack Kennedy'' comment
at Dan Quayle, his startled vice presidential opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to make the debates less scripted, the Commission
on Presidential Debates has experimented with different formats
that force candidates to interact more freely and leave more room
for the unexpected. In 1992, at the urging of then-Gov. Clinton,
the debates took on a town hall flavor with questions from
undecided voters in the audience. They were the most-watched
debates ever.
</P>
<P>
   This year's first debate will be fairly traditional, with Gore
and Bush standing behind podiums on a stage answering questions
from public television newsman Jim Lehrer. The vice presidential
debate on Thursday and the Oct. 11 presidential face-off, however,
will feature the two candidates sitting at the same table with a
moderator, who will have the latitude to ask follow-up questions.
The town hall format will return for the final presidential debate
Oct. 17 in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that the debates are Gore's to lose. At a
time when the economy is robust, unemployment is low and crime
statistics continue to fall, political experts say that the onus is
on Bush to convince voters that it is time for new leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Faucheux, editor of Campaigns and Elections Magazine, said
Bush should avoid dwelling on the Clinton scandals of the past
eight years, tempting as it may be to try to tar Gore with them. He
said, however, that Gore's own involvement in fund-raising scandals
is fair game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Bush, I wouldn't utter the words `Bill Clinton' at
all,'' Faucheux said. ``To make this a referendum on the past is a
loser for Bush. If he makes the election about the last eight
years, the Democrats win because the statistics are on their
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Faucheux said that Gore, meanwhile, needs to remind voters that
``they are better off than they were eight years ago and don't
change the horse in mid-stream.'' LSU's Perlmutter said Gore also
has to be wary of ``stretching the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is renowned for his hyperbolic claims, from
inventing the Internet to being the inspiration for ``Love Story.''
Last week Gore came under renewed fire for telling a bogus story
about the high prices his mother-in-law had to pay for her
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Gore's campaign consultant, I would prescreen all of
his anecdotes,'' Perlmutter said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high stakes of this year's debates, two major
television networks won't carry the first one. NBC said it has a
contractual conflict and will broadcast a Major League Baseball
playoff game Tuesday. Fox has decided to forgo all of the debates
and air entertainment programs instead. The debates will be carried
on both networks' cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This marks the first year that the debates will be carried over
the Internet. FreedomChannel.com will do a simulcast of the debates
and last week offered the third-party candidates, who have been
excluded from the TV debates, a chance to take part in the Web
versions.
</P>
<P>
   FreedomChannel.com has invited Green Party candidate Ralph
Nader, the Reform Party's Pat Buchanan, Natural Law nominee John
Hagelin, Libertarian candidate Harry Browne and Constitution Party
nominee Howard Phillips to submit videotaped answers to the same
questions put to Gore and Bush. The tapes will be posted on the
Internet site within 48 hours after the actual debate.

<P>
   (UNDATED) Some key moments from earlier presidential debates:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nixon vs. Kennedy, 1960. In the first nationally televised
presidential debate, Sen. John F. Kennedy demonstrated a mastery of
the medium. He looked relaxed and tanned, while Vice President
Richard Nixon, who had refused CBS' offer of makeup and was running
a fever, appeared nervous and pallid. Radio listeners thought Nixon
clobbered his young opponent with an expert grasp of the issues,
but TV viewers were wowed by Kennedy's ease and grace. It was the
image that came to define Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ford vs. Carter, 1976. President Gerald Ford had held his own
through much of the debate with the little-known Georgia governor,
Jimmy Carter. But in answer to a reporter's question in the closing
minutes, Ford made a remarkable blunder when he asserted, ``There
is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.'' Ford figured it was a
minor misstep, but the comment dogged him for the rest of the
election.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carter vs. Reagan, 1980. Carter sought to portray his
Republican opponent as a coldhearted conservative by accusing him
of opposing Medicare. Former California governor Ronald Reagan's
good-natured reply, ``There you go again,'' became one of the most
memorable lines of any debate. Carter would acknowledge years later
that it showed how relaxed Reagan was and that he had a sense of
humor. Reagan scored again in his closing moments by asking
viewers, ``Are you better off than you were four years ago?''
Voters apparently decided they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reagan vs. Mondale, 1984. Reagan appeared lost and confused in
the first debate and would attribute his poor performance to
``overtraining.'' When the inevitable ``age issue'' arose in the
second meeting, Reagan was ready. He dryly responded, ``I will not
make age an issue in this campaign. I am not going to exploit for
political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.'' The
crowd roared and even former Vice President Walter Mondale laughed.
He would say later that he knew he had lost the election the moment
he walked off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush vs. Dukakis, 1988. In a gaffe-filled election, Michael
Dukakis' emotionless debate performance against Vice President
George Bush seemed to crystallize voters' concerns about the
Massachusetts governor's robotic personality. In the first question
of the debate, the liberal Democrat was asked if he would favor the
death penalty if his wife, Kitty, were raped and murdered. Dukakis
responded with a dry, wonkish recitation of his long-held
opposition to capital punishment. Voters were underwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle vs. Bentsen. In the vice presidential debate, a
much-maligned Sen. Dan Quayle sought to dispel his image as a
lightweight by noting that he had served in the U.S. Senate as long
as John F. Kennedy. His opponent, veteran Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas, turned to Quayle and scolded, ``Senator, I served with Jack
Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine, and Senator, you're no
Jack Kennedy.'' Quayle remained unpopular, but Bush won the
election.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush vs. Clinton vs. Perot, 1992. At the urging of then-Gov.
Bill Clinton, a town hall format was chosen for the first-ever
three-way presidential debate. Bush, whose popularity had tanked
along with the economy, seemed ill at ease from the start. In
contrast to the gregarious Clinton and the yakety Ross Perot, Bush
seemed wooden and uncomfortable. In full view of the TV cameras,
Bush broadcast his impatience by sneaking a peek at his watch,
twice. Bush would call it ``a little thing,'' but the gesture
seemed to confirm suspicions that he viewed the election process as
a distraction.

MIND TRIP 
`DREAM' SITE MIGHT BE A NIGHTMARE

   Take a trip to www.requiemforadream.com and you'll find yourself
wondering if you have taken the wrong potion in Wonderland. This is
not your usual movie promotional Web site, but then ``Requiem for a
Dream'' is not from your usual filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Aronofsky, whose first film, ``Pi,'' dealt with an
obsessed math genius, turns his attention to Hubert Selby Jr.'s
novel of drug-fueled delusion and isolation in the Coney Island
district of New York. ``Requiem,'' which stars Ellen Burstyn, Jared
Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans, is set for release Oct.
20 from Artisan. Though the film is currently unrated (it was
originally rated NC-17, but the filmmakers withdrew their
application), there is little as far as we can tell that is overtly
sexual, violent or advocates drugs.
</P>
<P>
   What you find when you first encounter the site which uses movie
scenes, excerpts from the book and sound bytes is an upbeat,
somewhat confusing scene. Soon, though, as you try to interact,
colors begin to fade, error messages occur, and you're directed
into weird places. If you don't know any better, you'll think there
is something wrong with your computer and you're no longer in
control. The site, according to Artisan, is meant to be an extended
mind trip that mirrors the characters' quest for happiness and
their ultimate disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   You be the judge as to whether this Web site works or not, but
it's clear that you'll be seeing more of these kinds of adventurous
sites as studios seek new ways to promote their films.

(Eds: FACT BOXES BELOW FOR `TUCKER' AND `YES, DEAR.' `Tonight'
refers to Mon., Oct. 2, 2000) 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If ``Yes, Dear'' and ``Tucker'' represent the networks' idea of
family programming, then maybe we should all be watching Cinemax
After Dark, the cable channel's adult-oriented programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tucker'' will likely go down in history as the first show
aimed at kids that opened with four consecutive (and not
particularly amusing) jokes about teen-age erections. And managed
to go downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially ``Malcolm in the Middle'' recast with a young
teen-ager, ``Tucker'' stars Eli Marienthal as a kid whose mom has
just gone through a rough divorce and is stuck living with his
harridan of an aunt (Katey Sagal of ``Married ... With Children'').
Forced to room with a bully of a cousin and dumb, cartoonish
misunderstandings the order of the day, not to mention jokes about
homosexuality, incestuous longings, voyeurism and sexualizing teen
girls, it's easy to sympathize with Tucker when he opines,
``There's not a single decent thing about being here.'' The show is
inappropriate for children and insulting to anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Dear'' is only nominally better. It features a workable
premise, if one that'd never be mistaken for fresh of two young
couples, one (Anthony Clark and Jean Louisa Kelly) are very uptight
about raising their baby, while the other (Mike O'Malley and Liza
Snyder) are seemingly brutally blase about their kids.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Malley whose previous sitcom was canceled last season
after only two episodes is the funniest thing about a show (what?
Jim Belushi's asking price hasn't dropped low enough yet?), one
must be concerned. Clark is an inspired comic who has been run
aground in uninspired TV vehicles (``Boston Common,'' ``Soul Man'')
and is no better served by the material here. Kelly is ordered to
smile beatifically at her man's japery, while Snyder is allowed to
slip in a wan wisecrack now and again.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's episode is about Kelly's character trying to wean her
baby off breast-feeding; the words ``jugs'' and ``ass'' are typical
punchlines. A future episode demonstrates true disconnect with
reality, when O'Malley manipulates Clark's baby's first steps with
show-biz special effects, with zany mayhem being the inevitable
result. Snuggled securely between ``The King of Queens'' and
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``Yes, Dear'' is ensured audience
sampling, but its future is hardly assured. Just ask ``Ladies
Man.''
</P>

 &HT;    GORE ATTACKS BUSH PLAN FOR ALASKA OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEVY CHASE, Md. _ Vice President Al Gore rushed to the defense
of Alaska's pristine 19 million-acre Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge in a long distance debate with Texas Gov. George W. Bush on
energy policy Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called the refuge a ``precious environmental treasure'' in
challenging Bush's proposal to open a portion of the Arctic
wilderness to gas and oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments came after he toured the lush wooded compound in
suburban Washington that serves as headquarters for the Audubon
Naturalist Society. The hastily arranged tour allowed the
Democratic presidential nominee to respond to an energy policy
speech Bush, the Republican nominee, delivered earlier in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The two presidential candidates have sparred over energy for
more than a week now since Gore persuaded President Clinton to
release 30 million barrels of oil from the nation's
571-million-barrel emergency supply in order to contain spiraling
gasoline prices and ease heating oil shortages before winter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused the administration of ``inattention and misplaced
priorities'' in its energy policies Friday as he outlined his own
10-year plan to open the Alaska wilderness to drilling, develop
alternative fuel sources and coax oil exporting countries to
provide steady oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore immediately seized on the Arctic wilderness proposal to
repeat his charges that Bush, a former oil man, is beholden to the
oil industry, which has provided substantial financial backing to
this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge _ one
of our greatest national treasures _ is bad environmental policy,
and bad energy policy,'' Gore said from a podium set up near a
butterfly meadow. ``The area is fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I will fight for all Americans, who deserve to have
our environment protected against those who would set the oil
companies loose in the most beautiful, fragile parts of our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental organizations responded similarly to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drilling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would be like
damming the Grand Canyon for hydropower or tapping Yellowstone's
Old Faithful for geothermal energy,'' said Adam Kolton, a senior
official with the Alaska Wilderness League. ``There is no
environmentally friendly way to raid America's most sensitive and
cherished Arctic wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted, however, that 1.5 million acres, or about 8
percent of the refuge, could be explored in an ``environmentally
responsible'' way.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bush was posing ``a false and outdated choice''
between a clean environment and energy security. ``We can achieve
both if we make responsible decisions,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raising the environmental risks of exploring for
oil in the refuge, Gore questioned whether the amount of oil that
could be reaped would be worth the effort. ``It would take years
and years of development _ to reap just a few months of increased
oil supply,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 million-acre refuge is roughly the size of the state of
South Carolina, located on the northernmost edge of Alaska. Its 1.5
million acres along the coast are considered the most promising for
oil and gas exploration, holding about 7.6 billion barrels of
recoverable oil. That compares to about 23 billion barrels in the
lower 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal agencies, it would take between 7 and 12
years for lease sales, permits and environmental reviews if oil
exploration were permitted in the refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore defended the administration's release of oil from
the emergency reserve to address short-term emergencies, he said
the United States must end its dependence on oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to build our lives around a fuel source that is
distant, uncertain and too easily manipulated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for better mass transit and for the revamping of
``dirty old power plants'' into modern, clean energy providers, as
well as investment in new technologies to clean up the environment
and incentives to encourage auto makers to build more efficient
cars.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will remain the dominant weather feature across
the Northeast on Saturday, providing mostly sunny days and crisp
nights. After patchy morning frost in the interior valleys of the
Northeast, readings will rebound in the afternoon to near normal.
Breezes will become light from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will develop along the Southeast coast
as a jet stream disturbance intercepts an old front. Some places
will have brief bursts of heavy rain. The interior Southeast will
be partly to mostly sunny.
</P>
<P>
   The Plains will turn noticeably warmer, with some spots from
western Nebraska to Texas reaching the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   A cool front pushing into the Northwest will direct moist air
inland from the Pacific, causing showers and low clouds. Southern
California will turn warm with offshore winds.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FOG SEASON
</P>
<P>
   Autumn is the foggiest season in much of the interior East. Fog
forms when when air near the ground is cooled enough for the water
vapor in the atmosphere to condense into visible water droplets. In
early autumn, the moist air of the warm season lingers near the
surface of the earth. At the same time, the lengthening hours of
darkness allow more of the day's heat to dissipate. The cooled air
at the ground is dense and therefore drains into low spots in the
terrain, making valleys prone to fog while nearby hilltops often
remain in the clear. &QL;

COLOMBIA KIDNAP VICTIMS HEAR OF HOPE BY RADIO &QL; 
with/ COLOMBIA KIDNAP-BOOK &QL; 
 &QL; 
By JOHN OTIS &QL; 
(C 2000) Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Reading slowly from handwritten notes at a
radio station, shell-shocked women and somber men do their best to
sound upbeat as they deliver reports of birthday parties, family
trips and school report cards.
</P>
<P>
   The homespun anecdotes are for a captive audience.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by relatives of kidnapping victims, the twice-weekly
radio program broadcast by state-run Radio Nacional in Bogota
provides news, messages of hope and audio love letters for
Colombians being held hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay healthy, calm and courageous as you go through these
trying times,'' one woman said in a message to her abducted husband
during a recent taping of the program. ``Try to find something good
in this situation. Be positive, and realize that God is on your
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, called In Search of Lost Freedom, has plenty of
potential listeners. With more than 2,000 people snatched so far
this year, Colombia has the highest rate of kidnappings in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Although the victims often spend months in the wilderness in
wretched conditions, their captors sometimes allow them to listen
to the radio.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, a handful of radio programs in Bogota and
other Colombian cities have sprung up to connect hostages with
their friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best way to do it because radio reaches every part
of the country,'' said Vivana Esguerra, the host of In Search of
Lost Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the number of Colombian kidnap victims has
skyrocketed thanks to Marxist rebels who partially finance their
36-year war against the government by extracting huge ransoms
payments for their hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for example, the National Liberation Army, the
smaller of the nation's two main guerrilla groups known as the ELN,
raided several restaurants on the outskirts of the city of Cali.
They grabbed more than 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing paramilitary groups and criminal gangs also take
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday nights when In Search of Lost Freedom is taped, dozens
of people fill the studio for a chance to speak into the
microphones for two or three minutes. As they wait, they nervously
cross out words, add new paragraphs and recite the letters to
themselves in hushed voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get a knot in your throat, and you can barely
talk,'' said Maria Velasquez, as she waited to read a message to
her kidnapped husband.
</P>
<P>
   One woman broke down crying midway through her letter. Esguerra
urged her to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax, breathe deeply, and start again,'' Esguerra said,
taking the woman's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of kidnap victims who live in far-off towns sometimes
fax their messages to the station or send prerecorded cassettes. On
one tape, a woman added a few verses of Happy Birthday for her
kidnapped boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Hostages recently released by their captors often show up at
Radio Nacional to provide news about fellow kidnap victims still
being held.
</P>
<P>
   Between speakers, a musician fills the airwaves by playing a
grand piano. After the program, relatives of hostages exchange hugs
and encouraging words.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd is a mix of the well-to-do and the working class, a
reflection of how Colombia's kidnapping business has evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnappers used to focus on the rich. But as the nation's civil
war intensified in the 1990s, guerrilla groups began targeting
farmers, middle-class families and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   One woman at the studio delivered a message to her brother, a
baker who was grabbed by rebels three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they took him by mistake. But now they want a $25,000
ransom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of the speakers' relatives have been missing for years
and are presumed dead. Yet their family members arrive at the radio
station every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the studio, everyone is equal,'' Esguerra said. ``From the
sons of the ostentatious millionaire to the wife of a humble
disappeared person, they all have the chance to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives suspect they are speaking into a void, that their
messages go unheard.
</P>
<P>
   But many hostages who have been freed say that they were
faithful _ and grateful _ listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Leszli Kalli, who was held for 373 days when the ELN skyjacked
an Avianca domestic flight last year, said that the missives from
her family broadcast from a radio station in the Colombian city of
Bucaramanga gave her strength during her darkest hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday evening, my mother advised me to repeat to myself
that I am rock solid and that nothing will ever hurt me,'' Kalli
wrote in her diary, which was later published and became a
best-selling book in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I adore Tuesdays when they transmit the messages.... Thank
you, God, for this gift that you gave me of being able to listen to
my mother,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge, a former hostage who gave only his first name, said that
his rebel captors didn't approve of the broadcasts. He used to
crawl under the covers of his bed with a transistor radio on low
volume and secretly listen to the messages.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Jorge came up with a code that a fellow hostage, who
was freed before him, passed on to Jorge's family. The code allowed
relatives to broadcast messages updating Jorge on the status of
ransom negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In one message, for example, Jorge's wife said that the imported
American paper for the printing press was too expensive and that
she would buy Colombian paper instead. That meant guerrilla demands
in U.S. dollars were too steep and that the two sides were debating
a smaller ransom to be paid in Colombian pesos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been very difficult without the radio. I would
have preferred to die,'' said Jorge, who spent a year in the hands
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest
rebel group known as the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   However, in her book How to Survive a Kidnapping, author Martha
Lucia Aristizabal points out that for some hostages, the experience
of hearing loved ones can be painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard them on the radio and, despite feeling happy, I also
felt depressed,'' says one former hostage in the book. ``I thought
about my family, and it made me very sad, and I knew that things
would only get worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I decided to pretend that I was alone in life,'' he says.

   JERUSALEM _ They call in with painful, unfinished business from
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, Hadaya, is looking for her uncle who escaped the Nazi
Holocaust to join the Soviet Army and was last heard from in a
postcard in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman was separated from an orphaned boy her family
cared for more than 50 years ago on their weeks-long refugee
journey from Europe. It turns out he's now a lawyer near Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others call inquiring about lost aunts and uncles who
were shoved out of the family consciousness by memories too bitter
for their parents to pass on.
</P>
<P>
   They are survivors, and children of survivors, of the Holocaust.
And they have found an unlikely home on Israel's afternoon drive
time radio.
</P>
<P>
   Five days a week for about 12 minutes a day, radio host Yaron
Enosh goes over the faxes or calls on his new show, ``The
Department for Seeking Relatives _ The Next Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to victims of the Holocaust, the show reaches out to
Israelis who have lost track of comrades from Israel's wars or
relatives separated in the waves of hectic immigration that built
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Enosh says he aims to reunite and repair the ``holes'' in
families still fractured from the national and ethnic catastrophes
faced by Israel, and Jews around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Israelis call in each day, and more than 90 have
found loved ones, or people with information about loved ones,
since the program began in early August. Some were reunited on the
air, making for somber and suspenseful reality programming.
</P>
<P>
   It began as an experiment.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Enosh, 45, realized he could not answer his
12-year-old daughter's questions for a school family tree project.
There were too missing branches.
</P>
<P>
   All of his grandparents, and several aunts and uncles perished
in the Holocaust. His parents, who escaped the Holocaust by fleeing
Poland for Russia, did not like to talk about the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to talk to my friends and many of them had the same
problem,'' Enosh says. ``But, I didn't know how big a phenomenon it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   He was soon to find out. His boss at the Voice of Israel,
Israel's national radio station, gave him a time slot in the summer
to discuss something ``light.'' Instead, he made the topic missing
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   He took the name of the show from a department in the Jewish
Agency, a charitable organization that facilitates immigration to
Israel. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Israelis sat riveted by
their radio as the department would read the names of immigrants _
the Holocaust survivors _ who had made it to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But, the new show was not a sure hit. Israelis have wavered over
the decades over how much they have wanted to delve into the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust killed about 6 million Jews _ a million more Jews
than the number living in Israel now _ and convinced the world of
the need for a Jewish refuge. A day of mourning for the Holocaust
every spring is still revered throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Holocaust also raises the specter of a vulnerability
that Jews never want to relive.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, says Rachel Peterburg, general director of a social
services center for Holocaust survivors, many Jews had arrived
before World War II to build what would become Israel and they
faced their own hardships. They were sometimes resentful of the
boatloads of needy Holocaust immigrants, noting that they had
declined to come help develop a Jewish state until the catastrophe
occurred in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But, Peterburg said the past 15 years have seen a greater
Israeli willingness to hear about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   According to Peterburg, there are about 200,000 Holocaust
survivors living in Israel and another 160,000 Israelis who were
small children just after, or while, the Holocaust was ending.
</P>
<P>
   The time seems right for the new radio program. According to
Enosh, ratings are not yet available, but more than 250 people
contact the show daily with requests about missing relatives or
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Enosh said he feels he has tapped into something central in the
Israeli psyche. He describes it as ``the big holes we have'' in
which family members are missing and, for the younger generation,
roots are obscured.
</P>
<P>
   He says about two-thirds of the requests that come to the show
concern the Holocaust. The rest seek people lost in the large
immigration to Israel from Morocco, Yemen and other eastern
countries, or from people looking for those they fought beside in
Israel's wars.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is still a small country, with maybe 5 million Jewish,
and one million Arab citizens. Frequently, someone can hear a name
on a radio program and know friends or neighbors from the same
family, platoon or town of origin.
</P>
<P>
   The stories have been riveting.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman Gomeh, 52, was born in a refugee camp in Cyprus after
World War II. His father disappeared and his mother, a survivor of
horrible death camp traumas, was unable to care for him.
</P>
<P>
   He moved through several foster families growing up to become a
self-made, hard-driving, computer executive. The gaps in his past
seemed distant, until his wife convinced him to call Enosh's show
and inquire for information about his father.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks later, while shopping in a hardware store, one
of the show's producers called his mobile phone and told him he had
received a response from a half-sister in Israel _ a half-sister he
didn't know he had.
</P>
<P>
   Gomeh and the sister were hooked up on the air. Suddenly, the
boisterous Gomeh was speechless. His new half-sister told him his
father lived in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   For Gomeh, it was an exciting and disturbing revelation. For
once, he had a family, complete with new siblings, nephews and
nieces. But, he was still angry at his father, now 79 years old,
for leaving him and starting another family far away.
</P>
<P>
   They have spoken by phone. Gomeh said his father ``cried like a
baby'' and asked that his lost son not judge him. Gomeh's
sentiments are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the father, after all. Even if he screwed me, even if he
cheated me and threw me away, he's your father and you have to know
him,'' Gomeh says, his eyes tearing up.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he says he is glad for the new radio show, not only
for him but for the many others who have similar stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is closing the historical gaps,'' he says. ``It is making
people come together.''

KIDNAPPING BOOKS BECOME BEST SELLERS 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN OTIS &QL; 
(C 2000) Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Life as a hostage in the mountains of
Colombia did not agree with Leszli Kalli. She was bitten by a
scorpion. She developed anorexia, and she argued constantly with
fellow kidnapping victims.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the 18-year-old student grew so bored that she
shaved her head in desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way to escape this monotony,'' Kalli wrote in her
diary. ``Everyone thinks that I have grave mental problems, but the
worst part is that I think so, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalli was one of 46 people kidnapped by Marxist rebels last year
when they skyjacked an Avianca domestic flight. Her harrowing
account of 373 days in captivity was published in June, just two
months after she was released.
</P>
<P>
   Called Secuestrada, or Kidnapped, the book is the latest in a
string of publications inspired by Colombia's status as world
leader in kidnappings. It became an instant best seller here.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 2,945 people were abducted in Colombia _ a rate of
more than eight per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``These books are very dramatic. People buy them, because there
is a sense that anyone in Colombia can be kidnapped,'' said
Francisco Miranda, who reviews books for the Bogota daily El
Tiempo.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian soap operas often weave hostage crises into their
plots. Free Country, a Bogota support group for relatives of
kidnapping victims, sponsors an annual prize for the best thesis
about abductions by a university student.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, artist Maria Elvira Echeverri, who was
snatched by guerrillas last year, will open an exhibition of 72
paintings based on the experience.
</P>
<P>
   The literary trend began in 1996 when Gabriel Garcia Marquez
published News of a Kidnapping, a true-life account of 10 prominent
Colombians who were abducted by henchmen working for drug kingpin
Pablo Escobar in 1990. Escobar's mission was to pressure the
Colombian government into eliminating a law that allowed drug
traffickers to be extradited to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Marquez wrote that some of the guards were constantly
high on crack and loved to threaten their hostages. But others grew
fond of their captives and gave them birthday cakes and Christmas
presents and even asked if they could date their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   When the central figure in the book was about to be freed, one
of her guards gave her a 9 mm shell to remember him by. ```Here,'
he said, not really joking,'' Garcia Marquez wrote. ```The bullet
we didn't shoot you with.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another recent best seller is How to Survive a Kidnapping, a
step-by-step manual for hostages and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The book includes chapters on negotiating with kidnappers and
dealing with fears of dying as well as thoughts of suicide. It
offers suggestions for freed hostages on how to put their lives
back together. Published earlier this year, the book is already in
its second edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who buy it are victims,'' said author
Martha Lucia Aristizabal.

A DARK GUCCI'S SUNSHINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Oct. 1) 
 By RUTH LA FERLA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To Sara Gay Forden, the most compelling character in
her new book ``The House of Gucci'' (William Morrow) may well have
been the one that got away. Forden's labyrinthine tale of familial
corruption, betrayal and greed in the renowned Italian luxury
empire spans the decades from 1921, when Guccio Gucci founded the
company, to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the author provides revealing glimpses of a
multitudinous cast of players, in particular Maurizio Gucci, whose
1995 murder, arranged by his former wife, is the book's framing
drama.
</P>
<P>
   One subject who eluded Forden during her research, however, was
Sheree McLaughlin Loud, a rangy American former model, who was
Maurizio Gucci's girlfriend during the turbulent years 1984 to
1990. Described in the book as the single ``ray of sunshine'' in
Gucci's life, Loud refused to return Forden's calls.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, Loud materialized at a book party for Forden given
by Rizzoli. Tears welling in her eyes, the tall, fair-haired Loud
embraced the author and confided, ``Those were some of the most
intense years of my life.'' She said that after reading the book,
she regretted her decision not to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, at her office in midtown Manhattan, Loud, 41,
who is now the communications director for Giorgio Armani's
Collezioni label, recalled the years of intimacy with Gucci, a
grandson of the company founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't tell a lot of people about my relationship with
Maurizio while it was happening, and I saw no reason to tell Sara
when she called,'' said Loud, dressed in an understated Armani knit
top and trousers. ``My experience in Italy had quite simply changed
my life. I didn't want it to be in some gossip book.''
</P>
<P>
   During her six-year relationship with Gucci, whom she met during
preliminaries for the 1984 America's Cup regatta, she made almost
weekly commutes between New York and Milan. ``I traveled by
Concorde, then by private plane, and I would arrive in Milan almost
any hour of the day or night,'' Loud said. ``To me the trip was
nothing _ it was just like a ride to the Hamptons.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gucci was separated from his wife, Patrizia
Reggiani. ``There weren't too many stabilizing people around him _
he had hardly any friends,'' Loud recalled. She spent days lolling
on the deck of his yacht, the Creole, or at his chalet in St.
Moritz.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci, who owned 50 percent of the company, was consumed by a
desire to restore the luster of Gucci's image, tarnished over the
years by cheap, overdistributed goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was living a movie,'' said Loud, who was 25 when
she met Gucci, 10 years her senior, referring to both her love
affair and the House of Gucci itself. So intimidated was she at the
start of the affair that she refused to set foot in the Fifth
Avenue store. ``After a year, I did go, and I bought this one
little bag, just to show him that I liked his product,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In dark moments, Gucci brooded. Domenico De Sole, Gucci's chief
executive, was in talks with Investcorp, the merchant bank, which
bought Gucci in 1993 and provided the funds for the house's
spectacular turnaround under the designer Tom Ford. Loud recalled
that after De Sole clinched the deal with Investcorp, Gucci
considered him a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought everyone was betraying him,'' she said. ``He swore
to me that Patrizia was trying to kill him. He told me she was
poisoning him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Loud dismissed his suspicions. ``I'm from
Connecticut, you know,'' she said. ``I come from practical people.
For me that kind of thinking is just too bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggiani, whom the Italian press dubbed the Black Widow, had
long sought her former husband's ruin. She was convicted two years
ago of engineering his murder and sentenced to 29 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Loud has since gone on to a new life. Last summer, she married
Rob Loud, a money manager, and is expecting her first child in
March. At work, she has her hands full, overseeing public relations
and marketing for Le Collezioni. But her years with Gucci haunt
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe Patrizia had him killed,'' she said,
incredulous. ``All that belongs to another world. And I was another
person. I dream about it.''

By DAVID KRONKE 
c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This time last year, TV critics were wringing their hands over
the sorry state of ethnic diversity among the casts of network
television shows. Well, we all have short attention spans. Even
though the season's new shows do boast a few decent minority roles
Andre Braugher in ABC's ``Gideon's Crossing,'' David Alan Grier in
NBC's ``DAG,'' Mykelti Williamson in CBS' ``The Fugitive,'' the
cast of UPN's ``Girlfriends'' things haven't changed enough to
honestly reflect our melting-pot culture.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the fact that a few series the
aforementioned, plus CBS' ``C.S.I.'' and ``The District'' and NBC's
``Deadline'' have created full-bodied minority characters who are
both heroic and hot-blooded, who are ingenious and irritating and
proud and prickly, all at once, is a most encouraging sign. In the
past, minorities were either blandly idealized or stereotyped as
villains. That a few of the new series will give their minority
characters both faults and virtues is good news both for viewers
and the actors playing these more nuanced roles.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, those intrepid TV critics have abandoned their
racial trading cards and are now wringing their hands over the
sorry fact that reality TV is poised to devour prime-time whole.
Anyone whose brain wasn't reduced to pabulum by ``Big Brother''
this summer can tell you that, short-run financial considerations
aside, the long-run ramifications for the networks are potentially
disastrous (there's a good reason these things are cheap to
produce).
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, isn't ``Chains of Love,'' NBC's impending reality
series handcuffing a woman to four potential suitors for days at a
stretch, something the network would have used as a lead-in for
``The Gong Show'' on weekday afternoons back in the '70s? It was
almost touching when, back in July, NBC's Scott Sassa and Garth
Ancier all but apologized to the nation's TV-beat reporters for not
jumping on reality's cheesy bandwagon sooner the journalists, who
couldn't believe their ears, tried to convince the executives that
they had been right in the first place. But of course Sassa and
Ancier wouldn't hear of it and burbled proudly about the idiocy
that ``Chains of Love'' (from the hacks who brought you ``Big
Brother''!) will soon bring to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the poster series
for reality TV, last season was something of an anomaly: The
networks didn't hemorrhage viewers as direly as they have in recent
years. (Tell it to Fox and the WB.) Don't expect the same good
fortunes this season.
</P>
<P>
   It's been generally accepted that this will be an underwhelming
season, and the sooner the new shows slated to be set before you
are officially deemed failures, the sooner those reality series
will be humiliating regular folks culled from your neighborhood.
So, in a way, it behooves us to really, really like the networks'
new offerings. Look at it this way which would you rather watch on
Fox, John Goodman playing a wacky gay dad or unknowns tossed
together on a ``Love Cruise''? OK, bad example. How about Internet
conspirators on ``Freakylinks'' or nobodies going through ``Boot
Camp''? OK, still a bad example.
</P>
<P>
   The new season boasts a lot of the same old, same old: film
actors trying their hand at TV (``The Geena Davis Show,'' ``The
Bette Show,'' ``Madigan Men''); TV stars starting anew (``The
Michael Richards Show,'' ``Welcome to New York,'' ``Cursed,'' ``The
Fugitive''); old ideas cast anew (``Tucker,'' ``Yes, Dear,''
``Titans,'' ``Boston Public,'' ``The Fugitive'' again); attractive
characters finding themselves after a brutal breakup (``That's
Life,'' ``Ed'' and again, ``Madigan Men''). You get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   So who will succeed? NBC long ago usurped the title of ``Tiffany
network'' from CBS (look at its Emmy success last month), but its
new season is iffy. CBS' is strong, but not strong enough to
encourage the highly sought youthful demographic to tune in. ABC
blathered along until ``Millionaire'' turned up; otherwise, it's
still pretty much blathering along. Fox's edgy ascendance decidedly
disappeared last year, as did the WB's; UPN became a force to be
reckoned with thanks only to an intentionally stupid show ``WWF
Smackdown!'' viewed by exactly zero opinion-makers or pundits,
which does zip for its further penetration into the nation's
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it's easier to pick losers than winners. Herewith, a
glance at some stupid network programmers' tricks, things that you
or I, who aren't professionals pulling down six figures, wouldn't
have done:
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY: NBC has placed ``Ed,'' a likable-enough quirky dramedy,
in a slot where the network has experienced nothing but heartbreak
lately: 8 p.m. Sundays. Which means possibly the show could
survive, but only because NBC has nothing else to try there.
Meanwhile, the WB has once again attempted to build a Sunday
programming bloc against fierce competition on the backs of series
that are either untried or have failed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY: NBC thinks its ``Daddio''/``Tucker'' hour at 8 p.m.
represents ``family'' programming, when any right-thinking parent
will direct her kids to anything but ``Tucker's'' erection gags.
They certainly provide a disastrous lead-in for the relatively
smart ``Deadline,'' a lighter incarnation of Dick Wolf's ``Law &AMP;
Order'' productions. CBS has begun treating its Monday-at-8:30 p.m.
slot like NBC's lesser Thursday time slots, sticking another lame
sitcom, ``Yes, Dear,'' between two successful shows, ``King of
Queens'' and ``Everybody Loves Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY: NBC, again, is dubiously entrusting ``Frasier'' to buoy
three iffy sitcoms: ``The Michael Richards Show,'' ``3rd Rock From
the Sun'' and ``DAG.'' ``Frasier'' has been one of the network's
crown jewels; to treat it so shabbily is a flagrant sign of
shameful disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY: I think NBC by and large presents the smartest
programming of all the networks, and yet here I am, picking on the
Peacock again. ``Titans'' is a gleefully stupid prime-time soap
from Aaron Spelling; ``The West Wing'' is Aaron Sorkin's
award-winning, wildly entertaining and, above all,
!ital!intelligent!off! show about presidential politics. The only
thing they have in common are creators named Aaron. How can NBC
think that these two shows will share even one viewer? And yet,
here they are, back-to-back on the schedule. There's no more
bewildering juxtaposition on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY: Two dumb moves The WB puts its best new show,
``Gilmore Girls,'' against the most enduringly successful sitcom on
prime time, ``Friends,'' while CBS mercy-kills its medical series
``City of Angels'' and ``Diagnosis Murder'' by throwing them up
against insurmountable competition: ABC's ``Millionaire'' and NBC's
``Will &AMP; Grace'' and ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY: CBS tosses its most promising and most costly series
``The Fugitive'' and ``C.S.I.,'' shows that could draw younger
demographics that the network desperately needs, not to mention
shows that would easily succeed on stronger, more competitive
nights on Friday. ABC offers up a series of struggling or unproven
sitcoms ``Two Guys and a Girl,'' ``Norm,'' ``Madigan Men,'' ``The
Trouble With Normal'' a move that practically defies America to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY: ABC and NBC throw old movies on a projector and take
the night off. CBS musters the second oddest programming
juxtaposition of the season: the female-skewing ``That's Life''
with the redneck-skewing ``Walker, Texas Ranger.'' &QL;

PENNSYLVANIA DIRECTS TRAFFIC TO ITS WEB ADDRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Neb.)   (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
 By MICKEY MEECE  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pennsylvania is using traffic jams to generate more hits _ not
fender-benders, but visits to its official site on the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   The state has put its Web address _ www.state.pa.us _ across the
bottom of its new blue, white and yellow license plates, albeit in
type small enough that only those with excellent vision or a
penchant for tailgating can see it.
</P>
<P>
   By June 2002, 9 million of these 72 square-inch billboards will
be issued in the state's first complete plate replacement since
1976.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the new plates, Gov. Tom Ridge said, ``The old,
faded yellow ones sent exactly the wrong signal.'' The right
signal, he said, was to promote the state's high-technology
prowess.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strategy has worked, said Anthony Haubert, a
spokesman. ``The number of hits on our Web site has increased
dramatically,'' he said. ``While it could be due to a number of
reasons, we do have the feeling that the deployment generated a lot
of those inquiries.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that advertising the site helped to ``put the state at
the forefront of technology and e-government.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the new design has received mixed reviews in the
Keystone State, the idea has caught on elsewhere. In 2002, Nebraska
will introduce a license plate imprinted with its own Web address:
www.state.ne.us.
</P>
<P>
   With several new cars promising built-in Internet access, will
motorists succumb to the temptation to visit the Keystone State in
cyberspace even as they cruise the Pennsylvania Turnpike in real
time?

No one would begrudge the cast of ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' a
little fun on the company money, so it's nice to see everyone
living it up in Rome. Tonight's fifth-season premiere is, however,
in keeping with the nature of these kinds of ``very special''
episodes: In order to make room for some very pretty scenic vistas,
it's not quite up to the series' usual laugh quotient.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to Ray's mom Marie's (Doris Roberts) savings, the whole
clan troops to Italy, where the family dynamic runs in ways you'd
expect. Marie orders her troops around on tourist runs; Frank
(Peter Boyle) grumbles amusingly; Debra (Emmy winner Patricia
Heaton) enjoys the exotic culture, while Ray (Ray Romano) is a
sad-sack grouse, particularly when it comes to Europe's vexing lack
of stand-up showers.
</P>
<P>
   Eternally mopey Robert (Brad Garrett), however, falls for a
pretty local, much to her father's and his mother's consternation.
``I've never seen him so happy,'' Marie marvels, ominously adding,
``I don't like it.'' &QL; 
---``EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND'' &QL; 
What: Hourlong season premiere of the sitcom, finding Ray, et al.,
in Italy. &QL; 
The stars: Ray Romano, Patricia Heaton, Doris Roberts, Peter Boyle,
Brad Garrett.  &QL; 
Where: CBS (Channel 2). &QL; 
When: 9 tonight. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR JONES, A DISAPPOINTMENT IN BRONZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sports of the Times)

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Fun is winning.
</P>
<P>
   Losing is no fun.
</P>
<P>
   Someone has to win; someone has to lose.
</P>
<P>
   At these Olympics, you get so many versions of winning and
losing. Five or six times a day, depending on the event, the
athlete, the expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones gave another variation Friday night when her quest
for a unique place in history ended where many thought it might _
in the long jump pit.
</P>
<P>
   Heike Drechsler of Germany won the event, in what has become a
typical Sydney Olympic performance: not record-breaking, not
especially beautiful. Tough, grueling. Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   Fiona May of Italy won her second consecutive silver, and Jones
won the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked Jones if, given all that has happened here,
she is having fun at her first Olympics, Jones said, ``Fun is
winning. That's what it comes down to.''
</P>
<P>
   She came to Sydney with a goal of becoming the first female
track and field athlete to win five gold medals in an Olympics. She
has had a pretty special Olympics: gold in the 100 meters, gold in
the 200, a bronze medal in the long jump. A bronze medal in her
part-time sport.
</P>
<P>
   Jones took six jumps and fouled on four of them. Her last jump
was the best of the competition. But she fouled. The red flag went
up, on the jump and on posterity.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the last jump, you have to lay it all on the line,'' Jones
said. ``This is what every athlete dreams of: coming back on your
last jump and jumping further than you ever have in your life. I
was very aggressive down the runway, very fast. Thought I took off
well, looked around and saw I was around that seven-meter mark;
unfortunately I turned around and saw the gentleman flip up that
red flag and kind of dashed all my hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones knew going into these games that the downside of setting
her goals so high was that her first Olympics might seem hollow if
she missed obtaining even one of her hoped-for five gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in myself,'' she said. ``I let myself down
today and overall I'll be able to look back on my Sydney experience
and smile and say it was a very good experience, especially if we
win two golds tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Jones won the bronze in the 100 meters or 200 meters you
could reasonably call it a sports failure _ a star who did not live
up to her potential when it mattered most. Not so in the long jump:
Jones didn't lose the gold. The 35-year-old Drechsler won it.
</P>
<P>
   May, Jones and Drechsler have chased each other relentlessly in
the long jump this year. In Brussels, Belgium, in August, Tatyana
Kotova of Russia won the competition. Drechsler finished second,
May third and Jones fifth. Earlier in August, in Zurich,
Switzerland, Jones won the event with a jump of 6.93 meters.
Drechsler finished third. In a meet in Rome last June Kotova won
the long jump, May was second and Jones was third.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Drechsler was right at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you separate yourself from the riveting narrative and
detour to a compelling character outside the narrative. Drechsler
is such a character. She has lived four Olympic lives, competed
through the evolution of a nation, once competing with a wall down
its spine, now a nation with no boundaries. She is a 35-year-old
single mother, the ancient mariner with a familiar story. Competing
in her fourth Games, Drechsler is the last of the old German
Democratic Republic athletes. The last from another era of great
performance and suspect methods.
</P>
<P>
   When someone brought up the old system, Drechsler was curt.
``Not going to talk about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Drechsler won her first world championship in 1983 at age 18.
She competed in her first Olympic Games in Seoul in 1988. In those
games Drechsler was out-dueled by the great Jackie Joyner Kersee
who set an Olympic record of 7.40 meters. The loss began a rivalry
with Kersee that would last more than 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Drechsler won the gold medal at the Barcelona Games, Kersee won
the bronze. Jones, 16 at the time, chose not to compete in the
Games. Drechsler missed the Atlanta Games. Joyner, hampered by a
right hamstring injury, leaped from seventh to bronze on her final
attempt. She wept; getting that bronze was like winning the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Drechsler spoke about the difference between winning
an Olympic gold in 1992, when her country was just beginning the
mending process of becoming one, and in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just 11 years ago and now, we're coming together,'' she said.
``The team is really a team and I don't feel like East or West. We
are a team. It's not so easy for the people,'' she added. ``East
and West have other history and it's not so easy pulling together.
This will be a generation problem, but I feel we have now distanced
ourselves and we are really a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Things end and stuff happens. Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco had
not lost at the men's 1,500 meters since the end of 1997. Friday he
was caught on the final stretch and defeated by Noah Ngeny of
Kenya. An amazing streak was over.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the eyes of a global audience, Marion Jones has gone
from spectacular and historic to merely tremendous. She goes from
possibly winning five golds to winning ``just four.'' She can take
heart in the fact that Wilma Rudolph _ one of the greatest female
sprinters of all time _ only won three Gold medals at the 1960
Games, and we still invoke her name.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones knows all this and knows that the further she goes
from Sydney, the more special her first Olympics will be. For now,
the bottom line is the bottom line. ``Fun is winning,'' Jones said
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just leave it at that.''

HONDA CIVIC: STILL LEADER OF THE PACK BUT THE WOLVES ARE NIPPING AT
ITS HEELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Oct. 1) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ After just three decades in the American auto market,
Honda is poised to sell a million cars and trucks in the United
States this year. And it was the Civic that built the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The first one arrived in 1973 as OPEC was shutting off the oil
spigot. The Civic, then a tiny, efficient subcompact, was the right
car in the right place at the right time. Now a substantial small
car, the Civic remains a leader in fuel economy and emissions, and
the redesigned 2001 model is arriving at a time of tight oil
supplies and high prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Civic is built in 12 countries and sold in 140. More than 10
million have been sold worldwide, and it is on track to be the
best-selling small car in America for the sixth straight year. The
Civic has won quality awards and engineering acclaim. The coupes
and hatchbacks have proved wildly popular among young car
customizers.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2001 model faces the toughest competition yet. Ford's
flashy Focus, introduced a year ago, is running not far behind the
Civic in sales and was the world's best-selling car in the first
half of this year. Nissan beefed up its 2000 Sentra and gave it
more power. Volkswagen's Jetta and New Beetle offer fresh,
driver-oriented alternatives to Japan's dependable but boring
transportation appliances. Meanwhile, improved cars from three
Korean automakers are winning budget-minded buyers.
</P>
<P>
   After a week in which I drove both a gold EX sedan and a
bright-red EX coupe, I would still put the Civic at the top of the
small-car class, but not by nearly the margin I've given it in the
past. If I were shopping for a small car, I'd surely take a serious
look at the much-improved competition.
</P>
<P>
   Honda is not a company that embraces radical change, so it
shouldn't be surprising that the look and feel of the latest,
seventh-generation Civic have changed only subtly. Why mess with a
winning formula? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford made a fashion statement with its Focus,
Volkswagen played cute with its Beetle and Chrysler went retro with
its PT Cruiser, Honda has followed a conservative styling path. It
did make the sedan, which was designed in Japan, and the coupe,
which was planned in the United States, more distinct from each
other _ the same course it took with the current two-door and
four-door Accords. The Civic sedan, which went on sale in
September, has crisper lines, and it reminded me of a classy,
well-tailored suit. Its nose is shorter and more sloping. The
coupe, which goes on sale in mid-October, has a lower roofline and
a sleeker look. Its windshield and rear pillar have a lower,
sportier rake than those of the sedan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Civic is now shorter, but larger in most other dimensions.
It looks and feels substantial for a small car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is noticeably roomier inside, too, thanks largely to a more
space-efficient suspension. As measured by the government, the
space for both passengers and cargo has increased. Indeed, the
Environmental Protection Agency has moved it up to the compact
class, from subcompact status.
</P>
<P>
   Rear passengers benefit most, because the more compact
suspension allows the floor to be completely flat. The center
tunnel is gone, thanks to a repackaging of the underbody parts. All
passengers get much more comfortable and supportive seats.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard is so clean and uncluttered that I thought
something was missing. I suspected that Honda had taken content out
of the car to trim costs, but when I ran through a checklist of the
test cars' equipment, everything was there _ except, perhaps, some
character. Is it possible for a design to be too efficient?
</P>
<P>
   The three-door hatchback, whose sales had been slipping, has
been dropped. Both the sedan and coupe are available as the base
DX, the midlevel LX and the top-of-the-line EX. The coupe also
comes as the fuel-efficient HX, which achieves about 40 mpg.
Another sedan, the GX, is powered by natural gas and is classified
as an ``super ultra low emission'' vehicle; Honda calls its
powerplant ``the cleanest internal-combustion engine in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the performance-oriented Si is missing, though Honda is
planning new one.
</P>
<P>
   A holdout on the use of side air bags in its vehicles, Honda has
finally relented. Side bags are now offered on all Civics for $250,
and they include a cutoff system that prevents them from deploying
if they could put a child or a small adult in danger. Antilock
brakes, previously limited to the most expensive models, are now
also available on all Civics for $250 extra. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are three-point safety belts for all five seating
positions, and pretensioners pull the front shoulder belts tightly
in a crash. Sensors determine how much force there should be in the
air bags' deployment, depending on the crash's severity and whether
the driver and passenger are buckled. There are tethers for
child-safety seat and an emergency release inside the trunk. While
the federal government has not yet crash-tested the 2001 Civic,
Honda says its tests indicate that the car will achieve the top,
five-star rating.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, the more rigid body structure will be partly
responsible. The stiffer body improves the already responsive
handling. In fact, the new chassis, which could certainly handle
more horsepower, cries out for a more potent powertrain.
</P>
<P>
   All Civics are equipped with 1.7-liter, four-cylinder engines,
up from 1.6 liters last year, that meet ultra-low-emission
standards in all 50 states. The DX and LX have a 115-horsepower
version, up from 106. The engine in the EX has variable valve
timing, which improves the torque, or getaway response, and raises
horsepower to 127. While that is respectable, it cannot match the
class-leading 145 of the Nissan Sentra SE.
</P>
<P>
   The Civic DX, LX and EX are available with a five-speed manual
or a four-speed automatic transmission. (The HX and GX are
available with a continuously variable transmission, an automatic
that shifts constantly instead of at fixed points.) The EX sedan
that I tested was equipped with the automatic; the coupe had the
five-speed manual. Both are silky smooth _ among the best
transmissions in any small car. The brakes are excellent, too,
bringing the cars to straight, quick stops in panic maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the Civic's quality seems impeccable. Gaps between
exterior body panels are impressively closer even than on previous
models, and they fit much closer than the pieces of small cars from
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Honda says that prices have gone up only slightly on comparably
equipped models, though fully equipped Civics now brush
uncomfortably close to $20,000 _ at the top of the class. Base
prices range from $13,200 to about $18,000. The tested EX sedan,
which received the most added equipment and largest price
increases, totaled $18,239.
</P>
<P>
   Civic buyers are among the industry's youngest and most loyal,
returning for a second or third Civic or moving up to an Accord or
Acura. They are also relatively affluent, and 55 percent are women.
These buyers may find the '01 model reassuringly competent. Still,
some may wonder, as I did, if the car has sacrificed a bit of its
distinctive style and personality in its quest for an ever-larger
market.
