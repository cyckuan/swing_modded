<HEADLINE> New Look for All-Star Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This year's All-Star game will have a decidedly  
new look. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three players will make their All-Star debuts next  
Tuesday, many taking the place of familiar names who have been 
slowed by injuries and ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	AL manager Joe Torre and NL manager Bruce Bochy picked their  
pitchers and reserves Wednesday, with Torre selecting four of his 
Yankees and seven newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy will bring Padres pitchers Andy Ashby and Trevor Hoffman  
with him to Fenway Park, along with 16 players who are used to 
getting three days off midway through the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens, Mo Vaughn, Alex Rodriguez, Greg Maddux, Barry  
Bonds and Kevin Brown will have a rare break before starting the 
second half. Bonds has been an All-Star seven straight years and 
Maddux has for the last five. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year, you're going to have one or two deserving guys  
out, and that's unfortunate,'' said Rodriguez, who was beaten out 
by New York's Derek Jeter and Cleveland's Omar Vizquel for the 
backup shortstop spots. ``I'm going to take those three days and 
rest my knee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the eight players who signed contracts worth more than  
$40 million this offseason -- Vaughn, Brown and Albert Belle -- won't 
be making the trip to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	In their place are a bunch of newcomers, like Baltimore's B.J.  
Surhoff, whose 855 RBIs in 13 seasons were the most by an active 
player not to make an All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a couple of opportunities before, but they didn't work  
out,'' Surhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Or Texas middle reliever Jeff Zimmerman, who sent faxes to all  
30 teams two winters ago just for the chance to try out. The 
Rangers were the only team to bite and Zimmerman has made the risk 
pay off, going 8-0 with an 0.89 ERA as a rare All-Star middle 
reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``His numbers are so great that it's really hard to ignore what  
he's done,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmerman is joined by three teammates, first baseman Rafael  
Palmeiro, closer John Wetteland and starting catcher Ivan 
Rodriguez. A fifth Ranger, Juan Gonzalez, said he wouldn't play if 
he wasn't a starter and the AL honored his request. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians, who lead the majors in wins, led both leagues with  
six All-Stars. Vizquel and right-hander Charles Nagy joined four 
starters: first baseman Jim Thome, second baseman Roberto Alomar 
and outfielders Kenny Lofton and Manny Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagy replaced Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, who turned down his  
bid to tend to personal business at home in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champion Yankees, snubbed by the voters for the  
second straight year, still have Jeter, outfielder Bernie Williams 
and pitcher David Cone. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year Diamondbacks also have four All-Stars, followed  
by Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia and San Diego with three each. 
The Padres' Tony Gwynn was elected by the fans but will miss the 
game with a calf injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Clemens nor Vaughn, two prominent former Red Sox who  
left Boston as free agents, were selected. The Red Sox should have 
two starters, shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, the fan's choice, and 
Pedro Martinez (15-2, 2.02 ERA), the likely starting pitcher. 
Second baseman Jose Offerman was selected as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised,'' Offerman said. ``It's a nice feeling,  
especially with it in Boston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the 30-man NL squad will make its All-Star  
debut next week, with 16 players suiting up for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the 11 pitchers are All-Star rookies: St. Louis' Kent  
Bottenfield, Philadelphia's Paul Byrd, Atlanta's Kevin Millwood and 
Houston's Jose Lima, Mike Hampton and Billy Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's every kids dream who grows up playing baseball to be an  
All-Star and certainly, I was one of those kids,'' said 
Bottenfield, who leads the NL with 13 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Randy Johnson and Philadelphia's Curt Schilling were  
also picked for the NL staff. San Francisco's Robb Nen was selected 
but will miss the game with a callous on his right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy said he will pick another reliever, with Los Angeles' Jeff  
Shaw, the Mets' Armando Benitez and Cincinnati's Scott Williamson 
as possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the NL reserves are catchers Mike Lieberthal of  
Philadelphia and catcher Dave Nilsson of Milwaukee; infielders Jeff 
Bagwell of Houston, Sean Casey of Cincinnati, Alex Gonzalez of 
Florida, Jeff Kent of San Francisco and Ed Sprague of Pittsburgh; 
and outfielders Jeromy Burnitz of Milwaukee, Luis Gonzalez of 
Arizona, Brian Jordan of Atlanta and Gary Sheffield of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the reserves, only Sheffield and Bagwell have been All-Stars  
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The other AL reserves are Detroit catcher Brad Ausmus;  
infielders Ron Coomer of Minnesota, Tony Fernandez of Toronto, and 
John Jaha of Oakland; and outfielders Shawn Green of Toronto and 
Magglio Ordonez of the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the pitchers are Kansas City's Jose Rosado, Tampa  
Bay's Roberto Hernandez, Baltimore's Mike Mussina and Anaheim's 
Troy Percival. 
</P>
<P>
	The other AL starters are Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr.,  
Tampa Bay DH Jose Canseco, and Baltimore third baseman Cal Ripken. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis' Mark McGwire and the Cubs' Sammy Sosa headline the NL  
starters. The lineup also includes Arizona's Matt Williams at third 
and Jay Bell at second, New York catcher Mike Piazza, Cincinnati 
shortstop Barry Larkin and Colorado outfielder Larry Walker.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Brazil Reach Steel Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Major U.S. steel producers aren't happy about  
a Clinton administration deal that will allow Brazil to avoid 
punitive tariffs on shipments of hot-rolled carbon steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Commerce Secretary William M. Daley described the  
agreements as ``good for the U.S. steel industry and 
steelworkers,'' the producers complained Wednesday that they would 
have been better off with tariffs of as much as 53 percent on the 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our rights have simply been taken away from us,'' five steel  
producers and the United Steelworkers of America said in a joint 
statement. ``Our companies ... will fully pursue our legal rights 
to have these agreements rescinded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreements announced Wednesday, the Brazilian steel  
industry will avoid punitive tariffs by voluntarily reducing 
hot-rolled steel shipments to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil and its producers also agreed to quotas on that product  
and to minimum prices set above those currently prevailing in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements between the U.S. and Brazilian governments,  
reached hours before a midnight Tuesday deadline, will suspend the 
U.S. industry's petitions for tariffs, which it sought to counter 
low-priced imports that it blames for thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the restrictions on Brazil would provide certainty in  
the market and eliminate the ability of Brazilian firms to sell 
steel in the United States at cut-rate prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller U.S. steel companies came in support of the agreements  
after changes were made to establish the minimum price. But 
Bethlehem Steel Corp., U.S. Steel Group, Ispat Inland Inc., LTV 
Steel Co. Inc. and National Steel Corp. denounced the deals as 
``contrary to applicable law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. International Trade Commission, in a 5-1  
ruling, approved tariffs of as much as 71 percent on one type of 
stainless steel from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South 
Korea, Taiwan and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The product, sold in flat sheets rolled up like carpet, is used  
in kitchen sinks, dishwashers and other appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also decided Wednesday to impose tariffs of 9  
percent to 40 percent on foreign lamb. U.S. producers complained 
their livelihoods were being threatened by imported lamb from New 
Zealand and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreements announced Wednesday, Brazil will reduce  
hot-rolled steel shipments by about 28 percent and accept 12-month 
quotas of 295,000 metric tons. No shipment will be allowed before 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilian producers also agreed to charge U.S. customers of that  
product at least $327 per metric ton, which is above the prevailing 
U.S. price of about $300. The Brazilian floor price would be 
adjusted quarterly if the U.S. market price increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department, in announcing the agreements, concluded  
that Brazil unlawfully subsidized its producers and that the 
producers unfairly dumped hot-rolled steel in the United States at 
prices below production costs and home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the agreements, Brazilian producers would have faced  
tariffs ranging from 48 percent to 53 percent.

</P>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Wallace E. Howell, a meteorologist known for  
his attempts to generate rain during a New York drought 50 years 
ago, died June 12. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Howell spent two decades seeding clouds with dry ice and silver  
iodide in efforts to make rain in Canada, Cuba, Peru, the 
Philippines and other parched countries. In the 1960s, he developed 
one of the first snow-making machines for ski resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Howell's fame came from his work in New York during the water  
shortage of 1949-50. He was hired by New York City in early 1950, 
earning $100 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain came, filling reservoirs to 99 percent of capacity.  
There was even a freak snowstorm in mid-April coined ``Howell's 
snow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howell was later head of the weather observatory on Mount  
Washington in New Hampshire and spent 15 years with the Federal 
Bureau of Reclamation.

</P>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Dr. C. Walton Lillehei, a pioneer who  
created many innovative open heart surgery techniques during the 
1950s, died Monday of cancer. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Lillehei was a surgery professor at the University of Minnesota  
and later chairman of the Department of Surgery at the Cornell 
Medical Center-New York Hospital for several years beginning in 
1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Lillehei wrote more than 700 clinical publications and trained  
more than 1,000 cardiac surgeons, including Dr. Christiaan Barnard, 
who performed the first human heart transplant in 1967, and other 
pioneers in heart transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, Lillehei led university researchers in developing a  
machine to oxygenate blood and pump it through the patient's body, 
making open-heart and ultimately heart transplant surgery possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Lillehei worked with Medtronic Inc. cofounder Earl Bakken in  
1957 to develop the first wearable pacemaker for the successful 
treatment of patients with chronic complete heart block. 
</P>
<P>
	He also contributed to the design of four prosthetic heart  
valves, including the widely-used St. Jude Medical Mechanical Heart 
Valve.

<P>
	SEBASTOPOL, Calif. (AP) -- Bob Lucas, a jazz pianist who played  
with greats such as Dave Brubeck and Dinah Shore, died Sunday of 
leukemia, two weeks after performing with Eddie Fisher. He was 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, a frail Lucas accompanied Fisher in a performance  
in San Francisco that was filmed by Dateline NBC for a piece on 
Fisher's attempted comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas discovered jazz when his father invited Louis Armstrong to  
stay at the family hotel because other hotels refused to rent a 
room to the black musician. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas passed up a scholarship at the New York Light Opera  
Company in favor of jazz. He came to California in 1968, playing at 
clubs in the San Francisco area. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1970s he took over the foundering Russian River Jazz  
Festival and brought it back to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas was well-known for his charity work, playing at events  
such as AIDS and cancer benefits, dropping by nursing homes or 
anywhere he could gather an audience.

	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Archbishop Mihail, the head of  
Macedonia's Orthodox Church, died Tuesday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	The archbishop became the head of Macedonia's Orthodox Church  
shortly after the former Yugoslav republic became an independent 
state in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The Macedonian Orthodox Church was established in 1967, during  
the Communist-run former Yugoslavia, as a splinter from the Serbian 
Orthodox Church, whose seat is in Belgrade.

	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Mark O'Brien, a writer who was the  
subject of an Academy Award-winning documentary about his life 
using an iron lung, died Sunday of complications from bronchitis. 
He was 49. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 film ``Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark  
O'Brien,'' described his struggle to live and work on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien was 6 years old when he contracted polio and was forced  
to begin using the iron lung. 
</P>
<P>
	He was first published in 1979, when Co-Evolution Quarterly used  
his essay on independent living. Sandy Close, executive editor of 
Pacific News Service, saw the article and hired O'Brien as a 
correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
	Close said O'Brien initially dictated his stories, then used a  
stick in his mouth to press the keys of a typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, O'Brien co-founded Lemonade Factory, a small press in  
Berkeley that publishes poetry by people with disabilities.

	GEM LAKE, Minn. (AP) -- Solly Robins, founder of the law firm  
that won a $6.6 billion settlement in the Minnesota tobacco trial, 
died Monday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last 20 years the Robins law firm has won a $38 million  
settlement for 199 women in the Dalkon Shield cases, $470 million 
representing the government of India against Union Carbide in the 
1984 Bhopal chemical disaster, and $6.6 billion in a 1998 
settlement against the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Joaquin Rodrigo, one of Spain's best known  
composers, died Tuesday. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodrigo was blinded by diphtheria at three, and as a child  
learned to play piano and violin with the help of Braille. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in Paris in 1939 that Rodrigo composed the ``Concierto de  
Aranjuez'' for guitar, shortly before returning to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The melodic piece, named after a town 30 miles southeast of  
Madrid dominated by a royal summer palace, was first performed in 
the northeastern city of Barcelona in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodrigo received several awards during his lifetime, including  
the Prince of Asturias prize for the arts in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Alcoa Earnings Rise in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alcoa reported its second-quarter earnings  
rose 15.9 percent, a gain the No. 1 aluminum maker attributed to 
productivity improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $240 million, or 64 cents a share, up from  
$207.1 million, or 62 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa's earnings were a penny over the expectations of analysts  
surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 12.4 percent to $4.03 billion from $3.58 billion a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said shipments of aluminum products in the second  
quarter were 1.1 million metric tons, up 28 percent from 866,000 
metric tons in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Alain Belda, the company's chairman and chief executive, said  
the company's earnings reflected productivity improvements in the 
United States and in overseas operations. 
</P>
<P>
	First-half earnings came to $461.1 million, or $1.25 a share, up  
from $417 million, or $1.25 a share, in the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	First-half sales rose to $8.02 billion from $7.03 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa shares fell nearly 4 percent, or $2.37 1/2, to close at  
$61.37 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Gov. Announces Drug Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Some Massachusetts seniors would pay a basic  
premium and get unlimited prescription drug coverage once their 
bills exceed $1,500, according to a proposal by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Paul Cellucci's plan calls for seniors who earn more than  
150 percent of the federal poverty line to pay $49 a month in 
premiums. After a $1,500 annual deductible, all prescription costs 
would be covered by the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal comes on the heels of President Clinton's proposed  
Medicare overhaul, which calls for universal coverage for 
prescription drugs for Medicare recipients and the elimination of 
patient co-payments for preventive services. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Cellucci's $50 million plan, elderly people who make below  
150 percent of the poverty line -- which comes to about $12,360 for 
an individual -- would pay no premiums and get unlimited coverage 
after paying a $750 annual deductible. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, outlined Tuesday, must compete with rival plans  
adopted in the state Legislature. A final budget is being forged in 
a conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The state now has a $30 million program that helps low-income  
elderly people pay for prescriptions, but officials acknowledge it 
is not adequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Moore, chairman of the Senate Health Care  
Committee, called the governor's proposal ``a good first step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becky Derby, a spokeswoman for Health Care for All, said her  
organization had qualms about the proposal, including Cellucci's 
description of it as only a temporary program.

<HEADLINE> Palmer Disses Cart Use in Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- If you want to get Arnold Palmer  
going, ask him about golf carts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 69-year-old is playing in the U.S. Senior Open, where golf  
carts are taboo. If he had his way, they'd be banned at all Senior 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so strong on not having golf carts in competitive golf,''  
Palmer said Wednesday. ``I am almost 70 years old and I tell you 
what. I'd rather drop dead out there before I get in a golf cart 
and I mean it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said part of the challenge of golf is the endurance  
required to play 18 holes day after day. Riding in a cart removes 
that part of the test, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Walking is part of the game,'' Palmer said. ``It is a physical  
thing and golf is physical. If you don't believe me, just look at 
Tiger Woods and David Duval. They are both physical specimens. They 
do a lot to stay that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys that do not do that and do not keep themselves in  
some kind of physical condition are not going to be as competitive 
as the guys that are in good physical condition. It is just like 
every other sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer isn't opposed to carts entirely. For the weekend golfer,  
they're just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that our golf clubs around the nation are surviving  
because we have golf carts and we have golf cart revenues and we 
have people that are playing golf on a day-to-day basis that are 
not physically able to play if they couldn't ride,'' Palmer said. 
``I think golf carts have lent a great deal to the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just not in tournaments.  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOT HALE:* Defending champion Hale Irwin's appearance at the  
Senior Open rekindled memories of his visits to Iowa as a defensive 
back at the University of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin played at Iowa State twice during those years, and  
Colorado won both times. The most memorable visit came in his 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of those miserably cold Midwestern afternoons with a  
biting wind blowing across the plains. The Iowa State players had 
charcoal heaters to keep them warm. The Colorado bench had no such 
accoutrements. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I am over there and make a tackle on the sideline,'' Irwin  
recalled. ``It's slick and then we just start sliding. Into the 
bench we go. I'm waiting for things to quit falling and Frank 
Bosch, who was a defensive tackle, comes over and with one hand, 
grabs me by the back of my shoulder pads and just picks me up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, what are you doing. He says, you're burning. All the  
coals had fallen on my neck and my jersey was smoldering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin also is on fire now, though in a different way. He has won  
three of his last five tournaments and finished sixth in another. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SMILING IRISH EYES:* Christy O'Connor is still savoring his  
victory in last week's State Farm Senior Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor said his daughter figured there had been 135 calls to  
their home in Ireland since Sunday and dozens of telegrams from 
well-wishers congratulating him on his first Senior Tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my locker, guys down here are joking that there were more  
stickers on my locker than they have ever seen in their lives,'' he 
said. ``So yes, it has been great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And O'Connor still gets warm feelings when he recalls the  
ovation he received walking up to the last hole on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't love that, you don't love golf,'' he said. ``When  
you come up to the 18th hole and you see people who have paid to 
come and watch you stand and applaud, I think that is the greatest 
feeling anybody could ever have.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	If Laoretti did win, it would be a rarity on the Senior Tour,  
where the younger players dominate. Of the 572 tournaments 
contested since the Senior Tour started in 1980, 87 percent have 
been won by golfers between the ages of 50 and 55. Thirty-seven 
percent have been won by players who were 50 or 51. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the law of the land,'' said Allen Doyle, 51, who has  
won three tournaments in his first full year on the Senior Tour. 
``The old can't play with the young.''

<HEADLINE> Champion Weight Thrower Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Champion weight thrower Bob Backus has died after  
several years of poor health. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	He died at Boston's Vencor Hospital June 30. His lawyer said he  
suffered a stroke in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Backus began lifting weights in 1948 to speed his recovery from  
spinal meningitis. At the time, he stood 6 feet, 5 inches and 
weighed 160 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army Air Forces pushed him out of its cadet program during  
World War II because he was so thin. 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually built himself up to 290 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	His weight throwing career began at Tufts, where he threw the  
16-pound hammer outdoors and the 35-pound weight indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	He set career bests of 45 feet, 2 inches in 1957 for the  
56-pound weight (no longer in use) and 66, 2 3/4 for the 35-pound 
weight in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	With no special shoes in those days for throwers, Backus wore  
ballet slippers. 
</P>
<P>
	He captured seven consecutive American titles for the 56-pound  
weight throw, from 1953 to 1959; titles seven out of eight years in 
the 35-pound throw, from 1954 to 1961; and one in the hammer throw 
in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1955 Pan American Games, he won a gold for the hammer  
throw. In 1982, he was voted best indoor weight thrower ever. 
</P>
<P>
	During the height of his career, he competed regularly in New  
York and Boston against Al Hall, Stewart Thomson and Tom Pagani, 
his teammates at the New York Athletic Club. From time to time, he 
would compete against Harold Connolly, Olympic hammer throw 
champion of 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	Backus owned a gym in Pembroke and worked as a fitness consulted  
for clients including the Yankees during 1983 spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 51, he came in second in the 35-pound weight throw of the  
national indoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``People overdo this age thing, but I guess you could say this  
was a victory for the Geritol set,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his ex-wife, Elsa Torikka, a former javelin  
thrower, a daughter, Lisa, of Skaneateles, N.Y.; and a son, Niles, 
of Honolulu.

<HEADLINE> Polish Filmmakers Adjust to Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LODZ, Poland (AP) -- A sprawling complex of decayed, concrete  
buildings in this sleepy town in central Poland hardly looks like 
the cradle of what was one of Soviet-dominated Europe's most 
vibrant film industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lodz (pronounced Woodge) Film Studio, nicknamed HollyLodz,  
produced classics of the intellectual genre that defined Polish 
cinema in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. Some of the biggest names, 
including Roman Polanski (``Chinatown,'' ``Rosemary's Baby'') and 
Krzysztof Kieslowski (``The Double Life of Veronique''), made early 
films there. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, much of the studio has been sold to keep it solvent, and  
an industry that used to turn out as many as 40 films a year on the 
state's bankroll makes about half that number, with the government 
covering 30 percent of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the rest of the nation, Polish filmmakers have been forced  
to adjust to political, economic and social changes since the end 
of communist rule in 1989. Artistic freedom that used to be 
expressed in hidden themes too elusive for government censors now 
depends on commercial viability. 
</P>
<P>
	The lesson seems to be learned.  
</P>
<P>
	Almost 7 million people in the nation of 39 million have seen  
``With Fire and Sword,'' an epic by director Jerzy Hoffman based on 
a beloved Polish novel set during the 17th-century war between 
Poland and the Ukraine. The film paid off its $5.14 million cost 
within weeks of opening in February and easily topped ``Kiler,'' a 
1997 action comedy by Juliusz Machulski that drew 2.5 million 
viewers and attracted attention in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman's success was attributed to an unprecedented publicity  
campaign and the source material by Henryk Sienkiewicz, winner of 
the 1905 Nobel prize for literature. Hoffman previously made two 
other honored and popular films from Sienkiewicz writings -- ``Pan 
Michael'' and ``The Deluge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is such large pressure of Western style and values ...  
that maybe this is a good time for Poles to immerse in their own 
culture and their own history,'' said Andrzej Wajda, whose ``Man of 
Iron,'' on the birth of the Solidarity labor movement, won the main 
prize at Cannes in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Wajda has his own historical project -- ``Mr. Tadeusz,'' based on  
a Romantic verse novel by 19th-century poet Adam Mickiewicz -- 
opening in September. He believes the success of Hoffman's film 
shows Poles will choose something with a personal link or more 
intellectual matter, like the political films they remember from 
the past, over the standard fare available at home on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is in attracting them to the cinema,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	That attitude differs from the old days, when commercial appeal  
hardly mattered. State-owned Lodz studio produced artistic fare 
that fetched international awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Wajda's 1974 ``Land of Promise'' won the main prize in Chicago  
in 1975 and the 1976 Academy Award nomination for best foreign 
film, while Polanski's debut, ``Knife in the Water,'' was made in 
Lodz in 1961. It was an Academy Award nominee for best foreign film 
in 1962 and took the critics award at Cannes. ``The Deluge'' by 
Hoffman was nominated for best foreign film at the 1975 Academy 
Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Kieslowski and Agnieszka Holland, who both gained international  
fame for films made abroad in later years, began their careers at 
Lodz. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Hollywood, the Lodz studio also attracted people simply  
wanting to be near the most prominent center of creative artistry 
in the repressive communist society. Jerzy Rezakiewicz, 64, told 
how he responded to an ad in 1962 offering jobs at the studio's 
stucco workshop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know what stucco was, but I wanted so much to work at  
the studio that I applied and got the job,'' smiled Rezakiewicz, 
now manager of the props warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	When communism ended a decade ago, Wajda and other directors  
lost some of their main themes, such as ridiculing the socialist 
system. They also lost most of their financing as the government 
reformed state enterprises in the transition to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Young directors churned out cheap imitations of Western-style  
action films, while prominent ones sought backing abroad. 
Kieslowski got money from French producer Marin Karmitz to make his 
globally successful three-color trilogy -- ``Blue,'' ``White'' and 
``Red,'' the latter earning him an Academy Award nomination in 1995 
for best director. 
</P>
<P>
	The trilogy -- with themes on defining the meaning of liberation,  
justice and equality -- helped restore the luster to modern Polish 
cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Lodz studio failed to adapt to the changing times,  
keeping its crew of 1,200 mostly administrative employees and high 
prices for its services. Debts mounted as filmmakers used smaller 
and cheaper private studios emerging under the economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Tadeusz Scibor-Rylski, head of the state Cinematography  
Committee that sponsors the film industry, called the Lodz facility 
an ``ill-managed, overgrown mammoth not fit for the new market 
reality.'' He ordered the recent sale of four of the complex's five 
studios to television and publicity companies that had been leasing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Film director Wojciech Wojcik praised the move, which he said  
saved the local film production industry to give ``financially 
weaker companies'' access to good equipment and expertise at lower 
costs than producing projects abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The technical excellence of Poland's industry has been  
recognized countless times, such as the Oscar wonon Stephen 
Spielberg's ``Schindler's List,'' which was filmed in Poland and 
which won seven Oscars altogether including best picture.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Focuses on American Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- Paying the first presidential visit to  
an Indian reservation in 60 years, President Clinton today declared 
that the United States can no longer afford to ignore poverty and 
unemployment among American Indians. ``That is wrong, and we're 
trying to fix it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting Oglala Sioux on the Pine Ridge Reservation, Clinton  
seemed almost disbelieving as Geraldine Blue Bird, stifling tears, 
explained her living situation in a house and a nearby trailer. 
``You have 11 living in here and 17 in the other place,'' the 
president repeated. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal President Howard Salway said Blue Bird's Igloo  
neighborhood -- a collection of foam-green shacks with crumbling 
porches -- is typical of housing conditions on the reservation. ``In 
the winter, the hardship it puts on our people increases tenfold,'' 
he told Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the Oglala Lakota Nation before a large beige tepee  
in a courtyard at the reservation's high school, Clinton said it is 
time for a more respectful, empowering relationship with tribal 
governments. He sought to strike a conciliatory note by speaking a 
phrase in Lakota: ``Mitakuye oyasin'' -- ``We are all related.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We know well the imperfect relationship that the United States  
and its government has enjoyed with the tribal nations,'' Clinton 
said. ``You have suffered from neglect and you know that doesn't 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Department of Agriculture would implement $16  
million in water projects throughout Indian lands, with two of 
those projects in Pine Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	``No community in America should be without safe running water  
and sewer systems,'' he said. ``That will also help you get jobs as 
well as improve the quality of life. ... These commitments we're 
making today are just the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Igloo neighborhood, Clinton saw a part of the  
reservation that has new housing secured with federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to find a way not only to fix the very difficult  
housing circumstances but also to get them jobs,'' he said, noting 
that while the national unemployment rate has been below 5 percent 
for two years, the jobless rate on the reservation is 75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his party were welcomed to Pine Ridge by Oglala  
leaders wearing traditional headdresses of eagle feathers. A group 
of Indians chanted and beat a large cowhide drum, and Millie Horn 
Cloud exchanged the 1868 treaty pipe with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Reciting the names of great Sioux leaders, including the  
legendary Crazy Horse, Salway characterized the visit as one 
between governments and reminded Clinton that there are 
``unresolved land issues with the federal government'' that must be 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am humbled by the leaders that have come before me, ... who  
have fought for our land,'' Salway said. ``I think these men would 
agree that this historic meeting with the United States president 
on our hallowed land will have a lasting impact for our people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton arrived, a demonstrator held up a sign: ``Stop Lakota  
ethnic cleansing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The visit was part of Clinton's four-day, cross-country tour to  
highlight the plight of some of the nation's poorest areas and the 
``untapped markets'' in America's inner cities and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's visit -- the first to a reservation by a president  
since Franklin D. Roosevelt visited a Cherokee reservation in North 
Carolina on Sept. 9, 1936 -- called attention to American Indians, 
who are so raked by grinding poverty that his advisers suggested he 
come up with special proposals geared specifically to the Indians' 
plight. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pine Ridge, a scrolling marquee at Big Bat's Texaco expressed  
both joy over Clinton's visit and wariness of all the official 
attention: ``Welcome President Clinton. Remember Our Treaties,'' 
the sign read. 
</P>
<P>
	According to statistics from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of  
Indian Affairs, there are 1.43 million Indians living on or near 
reservations. Roughly 33 percent of them are children younger than 
15, and 38 percent of Indian children aged 6 to 11 live in poverty, 
compared with 18 percent for U.S. children of all other races 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from that, only 63 percent of Indians are high school  
graduates. Twenty-nine percent are homeless, and 59 percent live in 
substandard housing. Twenty percent of Indian households on 
reservations do not have full access to plumbing, and the majority 
-- 53.4 percent -- do not have telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	The per capita income of Indians living on reservations is far  
below that of other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	To begin addressing the housing problem, Clinton was announcing  
a partnership among the Treasury Department, the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, tribal governments and mortgage 
companies to help 1,000 Indians become homeowners over the next 
three years -- a small number that nonetheless would double the 
number of government-insured home mortgages issued on tribal lands. 
Under the effort, ``one-stop mortgage centers'' would be opened at 
Pine Ridge and on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona to help 
streamline the mortgage lending process.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Strike Talks Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Air Canada presented its flight attendants with a  
revised contract offer Wednesday as a midnight strike deadline 
approached that could ground the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no guarantee the new proposals would produce a deal,  
but both sides -- and a federal mediator -- expressed hope that an 
agreement could be reached to avert a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side would discuss details of how the new offer might  
resolve the main outstanding dispute, over pension benefits. The 
5,100 flight attendants, members of the Canadian Union of Public 
Employees, say the pension plan they have is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada, which handles about 60,000 passengers a day on 660  
to 700 flights, says it will halt all its flights in the event of a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline was operating normally Wednesday, but has stopped  
taking reservations for flights from Thursday through July 14. It 
is offering refunds or exchanges, subject to availability, on all 
tickets already purchased for travel during that period. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada's regional carriers -- AirBC, Air Ontario, Air  
Alliance and Air Nova -- would continue to operate normally during a 
strike. Air Canada said customers traveling on codeshare flights 
operated by its partner airlines -- including United Airlines, 
Lufthansa, SAS, Air New Zealand, EVA Air and Royal Jordanian -- 
would not be affected by a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor dispute comes just as Canada's largest airline has  
just started to emerge from the effects of last September's pilots 
strike. That dispute shut down Air Canada for two weeks, alienating 
customers and burdening the airline with a big 1998 loss.

<HEADLINE> Voice Actor: I Am the Red M&AMP;M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``I am the red M&AMP;M,'' Billy West says  
proudly. He's not delusional. 
</P>
<P>
	West is the scarlet candy's TV commercial voice. He's also the  
reborn Woody Woodpecker and Fry in the prime-time animated series 
``Futurama.'' And he has given the gift of the gab to both Ren and 
Stimpy and to a variety of Nickelodeon's wee ones. 
</P>
<P>
	In a new golden age of animation, West is among the golden  
voices. Whether he's called on to revive smarty-pants Woody or 
breathe personality into a chocolate tidbit, the 47-year-old 
performer is an acoustic ace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'm really lucky because my voice goes all over the  
place,'' he said. ``I'm able to go to the basement and I'm also 
able to go up to the stratosphere. It's like having an instrument 
that's flexible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's artistry in the pipes, sure. But there's more at work  
here: How do you decide what an inanimate object like snack food 
might sound like? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you can make a mistake by trying to bring too much  
science to something like that,'' West replies. ``It's pure 
fantasy. ... It's your job to be unafraid and to try stuff and to 
let someone else be the judge of what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The M&AMP;M's voice, for instance, is kind of a ``wise guy me,''  
West says. Then he playfully demonstrates in booming tones: ``You 
have to imagine that I'm sort of a candy-coated Leonardo 
DiCaprio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Revisiting a classic character in ``The Woody Woodpecker Show''  
(part of Fox Kids' Saturday morning lineup) works different 
muscles. The rat-a-tat-tat delivery and laugh originated with Mel 
Blanc, one of animation's venerable voices and a West hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have some nuances that keep the character rooted  
in its original foundation,'' West said. He has license to play 
with the character's sound a bit, but he knows that such 
assignments are not the path to cartoon immortality. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be the next Mel Blanc by running around doing Mel  
Blanc's voices. You have to take every opportunity to attach your 
name to something you had a hand in fashioning,'' West said. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is not to say he has a star complex. In a decidedly  
anonymous line of acting -- ``Most people don't know what I look 
like, which is fine by me,'' he says -- West is simply eager to work 
steadily and to add to his credits, minor or major. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love things the way they are because it's exactly what I  
dreamed of doing when I was really small,'' he said. As a youngster 
in Detroit, he was intrigued by TV cartoons and the versatile 
actors behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd watch a Hanna-Barbera cartoon or a Warner Bros. cartoon  
and I'd hear upwards of 15 to 20 voices. And then I'd read the 
credits and under 'Voices' I'd see two names. That's it. And that 
signified to me that these were very weird, strange people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was something really cool about that, to be off the  
map.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other actor-comedians who played multiple roles also were ``huge  
influences,'' he said, rattling off the names of Jerry Lewis, Danny 
Kaye and ``Your Show of Shows'' star Sid Caesar. 
</P>
<P>
	Expecting radio to be his creative outlet, West began working at  
WBCN in Boston in 1980, with carte blanche to construct comedy bits 
and funny commercials. He moved to New York City and station WXRK 
in 1989, figuring he had reached the pinnacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he was relegated to promoting contests and endlessly  
reciting ``New York's home of classic rock 'n' roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the same mindless, Novocain, brain-numbing pieces of  
information over and over again, and I was losing my mind,'' West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he found an improbable savior.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right down the hall was Howard Stern, who was just beginning  
to bust the walls of conventional radio. ... He was some firebrand 
on the loose. I thought, 'This is nuts. This is great.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	West joined Stern's wayward team as a part-time ``utility  
infielder,'' doing off-the-wall characters and impressions of 
politicians and others who ventured into the shock jock's merciless 
sights. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern succeeded by breaking radio's musty rules, West said.  
``Howard's show was all unscripted, and he was the first person I 
ever met who didn't play records to hide behind music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After West tried unsuccessfully to join the show full-time, and  
at the urging of his wife, Violet, he decided on a change. He had 
already begun doing commercial and series work and gambled that 
more could be had in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, West came West and got a ``couple of series. Then it  
turned into 10 series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A single show can mean several voices. In ``Futurama,'' the  
30th-century satire from ``The Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening, 
West plays a 147-year-old mad scientist, an alien crustacean and a 
pompous star-ship captain as well as Fry, a young slacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Futurama'' and the rest of Fox's Tuesday night all-animated  
lineup reflect a craze for cartoonry that is keeping voice actors 
like West busy -- and optimistic that this is only the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm beginning to think all prime-time programming will become  
animated,'' he said. ``People just want different. I don't think 
they care that it's animated.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	SELENA'S SONG: Selena, the Tejana singer killed at age 23 as she  
crossed over to pop stardom, is remembered in ``Corpus: A Home 
Movie for Selena.'' The documentary by Lourdes Portillo, airing as 
part of PBS' ``P.O.V.'' series, features interviews with fans, 
family and observers who debate Selena's value as a role model. The 
film airs Tuesday, July 13 (check local listings), on PBS stations.

<HEADLINE> Danish Flights Grounded on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Scandinavian Airlines System ground  
crews at Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport staged a four-hour wildcat 
strike today to protest possible cost cutting measures. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 70 SAS flights from northern Europe's busiest airport  
were canceled to destinations including London, Frankfurt, 
Budapest, Vienna and Tel Aviv, Israel. The strike by check-in 
staff, baggage handlers and administrative staff also spilled over 
to other airlines using Kastrup Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 SAS employees joined the strike, which meant travel  
chaos for hundreds of people on summer vacation, business and other 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``We resume work because of customers. We don't want to  
disappoint them,'' ground personnel union spokesman Nicholas 
Fischer said after work resumed at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	SAS management efforts to bring down operating costs led to the  
strike. The strikers rejected plans to restructure the company and 
cut jobs among the 10,000 employees in the three Scandinavian 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Danish ground personnel sent a letter on Wednesday to the  
SAS management in Stockholm, Sweden, warning new strikes could take 
place if they don't put aside the restructuring plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier which is jointly owned by Denmark, Sweden and  
Norway, is looking into ways to reduce operating costs by $430 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kastrup Airport served 17 million passengers last year.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Focuses on American Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- Paying the first presidential visit to  
an Indian reservation in 60 years, President Clinton today declared 
that the United States can no longer afford to ignore poverty and 
unemployment among American Indians. ``That is wrong, and we're 
trying to fix it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting Oglala Sioux on the Pine Ridge Reservation, Clinton  
seemed almost disbelieving as Geraldine Blue Bird, stifling tears, 
explained her living situation in a house and a nearby trailer. 
``You have 11 living in here and 17 in the other place,'' the 
president repeated. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal President Howard Salway said Blue Bird's Igloo  
neighborhood -- a collection of foam-green shacks with crumbling 
porches -- is typical of housing conditions on the reservation. ``In 
the winter, the hardship it puts on our people increases tenfold,'' 
he told Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the Oglala Lakota Nation before a large beige tepee  
in a courtyard at the reservation's high school, Clinton said it is 
time for a more respectful, empowering relationship with tribal 
governments. He sought to strike a conciliatory note by speaking a 
phrase in Lakota: ``Mitakuye oyasin'' -- ``We are all related.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We know well the imperfect relationship that the United States  
and its government has enjoyed with the tribal nations,'' Clinton 
said. ``You have suffered from neglect and you know that doesn't 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Department of Agriculture would implement $16  
million in water projects throughout Indian lands, with two of 
those projects in Pine Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	``No community in America should be without safe running water  
and sewer systems,'' he said. ``That will also help you get jobs as 
well as improve the quality of life. ... These commitments we're 
making today are just the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Igloo neighborhood, Clinton saw a part of the  
reservation that has new housing secured with federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to find a way not only to fix the very difficult  
housing circumstances but also to get them jobs,'' he said, noting 
that while the national unemployment rate has been below 5 percent 
for two years, the jobless rate on the reservation is 75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his party were welcomed to Pine Ridge by Oglala  
leaders wearing traditional headdresses of eagle feathers. A group 
of Indians chanted and beat a large cowhide drum, and Millie Horn 
Cloud exchanged the 1868 treaty pipe with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Reciting the names of great Sioux leaders, including the  
legendary Crazy Horse, Salway characterized the visit as one 
between governments and reminded Clinton that there are 
``unresolved land issues with the federal government'' that must be 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am humbled by the leaders that have come before me, ... who  
have fought for our land,'' Salway said. ``I think these men would 
agree that this historic meeting with the United States president 
on our hallowed land will have a lasting impact for our people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton arrived, a demonstrator held up a sign: ``Stop Lakota  
ethnic cleansing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The visit was part of Clinton's four-day, cross-country tour to  
highlight the plight of some of the nation's poorest areas and the 
``untapped markets'' in America's inner cities and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's visit -- the first to a reservation by a president  
since Franklin D. Roosevelt visited a Cherokee reservation in North 
Carolina on Sept. 9, 1936 -- called attention to American Indians, 
who are so raked by grinding poverty that his advisers suggested he 
come up with special proposals geared specifically to the Indians' 
plight. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pine Ridge, a scrolling marquee at Big Bat's Texaco expressed  
both joy over Clinton's visit and wariness of all the official 
attention: ``Welcome President Clinton. Remember Our Treaties,'' 
the sign read. 
</P>
<P>
	According to statistics from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of  
Indian Affairs, there are 1.43 million Indians living on or near 
reservations. Roughly 33 percent of them are children younger than 
15, and 38 percent of Indian children aged 6 to 11 live in poverty, 
compared with 18 percent for U.S. children of all other races 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from that, only 63 percent of Indians are high school  
graduates. Twenty-nine percent are homeless, and 59 percent live in 
substandard housing. Twenty percent of Indian households on 
reservations do not have full access to plumbing, and the majority 
-- 53.4 percent -- do not have telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	The per capita income of Indians living on reservations is far  
below that of other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	To begin addressing the housing problem, Clinton was announcing  
a partnership among the Treasury Department, the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, tribal governments and mortgage 
companies to help 1,000 Indians become homeowners over the next 
three years -- a small number that nonetheless would double the 
number of government-insured home mortgages issued on tribal lands. 
Under the effort, ``one-stop mortgage centers'' would be opened at 
Pine Ridge and on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona to help 
streamline the mortgage lending process.

	THE COST OF RENTING: If you're moving to the suburbs of San  
Francisco or Honolulu and expect to rent an apartment when you get 
there, be prepared for a big case of sticker shock. The consulting 
firm Runzheimer International, which tracks living expenses in 
cities around the world, found that a three-room, one-bedroom 
apartment in a suburban community of San Francisco rented for 
$1,092 a month, while in suburban Honolulu, the cost was $1,010. 
Those rents were the highest Runzheimer found in its study, and 
they compare with the national average of $540. At the low end of 
the areas Runzheimer checked was the Dubuque, Iowa area, where an 
apartment went for $405.

	WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THE BUDGET SURPLUS: There's plenty of  
debate in Washington over what to do with a projected $2.9 trillion 
in federal budget surpluses over the next decade, but corporate 
executives also have ideas of their own. In a survey by the 
Financial Executives Institute and Duke University, 43 percent of 
the 321 chief financial officers queried said the money should go 
toward reducing the $5.54 trillion public debt. Thirty-seven 
percent said the surplus should be used to lower taxes, and 27 
percent said the money should be used to shore up Social Security. 
Many of the CFOs believed the money should be used for more than 
one purpose, so those figures add up to more than 100 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cavaliers Hire Wittman As New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers said they wanted a  
coach who would do away with the slow-paced game of Mike Fratello 
and give fans something exciting to watch. Randy Wittman promised 
to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs on Wednesday hired Wittman, a longtime Minnesota  
Timberwolves assistant with no head coaching experience, to fill 
the vacancy left when Fratello was fired June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of Indiana's 1981 NCAA championship team and a  
journeyman in his NBA playing days, Wittman, 39, takes over a team 
that needs to woo fans back to Gund Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman made it clear he understands.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we put an entertaining product on the floor, wins will  
come,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland hasn't made it past the first round of the playoffs  
since 1993 and attendance has sagged from 18,011 in 1994-95 to 
14,120 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello's teams were often injury-plagued, and he was credited  
with making the most of bad situations by installing a clock-eating 
offense and tough defense. But fans got tired of watching the 
grind-it-out style, even if it meant more wins than losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman, who played under Fratello in the 1980s in Atlanta,  
plans to loosen things up. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't have fun playing the game, you're not going to be  
worth a hoot,'' he said. ``I want them to have the freedom to play 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cavs center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, one of a few players who watched  
as Wittman was introduced during a news conference, liked what he 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting to see a new guy with new ideas come in here.  
He's got the whole team behind him,'' Ilgauskas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland general manager Jim Paxson, who headed the coaching  
search, said he recommended Wittman to Cavs owner Gordon Gund 
because ``he is the coach who will be most flexible and adaptable 
with respect to both players and the NBA game as it continues to 
evolve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Others with head coaching experience might be viewed by some  
as safer choices,'' he said. ``For us, Randy Wittman is the right 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson would not disclose the length of Wittman's contract or  
how much he'll be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs were secretive about their coaching search until  
Wittman was introduced. Despite plans to create some excitement 
surrounding the team, the Cavs refused to reveal the names of any 
potential coaching candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	When Wittman arrived in Cleveland on Wednesday, the Cavs sent a  
limousine to meet his plane, so he avoided reporters and fans at 
the flight gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Cowens, Del Harris and John MacLeod were the others known  
to have been interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring of Wittman is part of a continuing makeover of the  
Cavaliers organization in which well-known names are being replaced 
by a younger group. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the firing of Fratello, known as the ``Czar of  
Telestrator'' for his television commentary work, newly elected 
Hall of Famer Wayne Embry has stepped aside as general manager in 
favor of Paxson. 
</P>
<P>
	And last week's draft saw the Cavs make two other moves which  
could change their look on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to trade up in the first round to get Miami of Ohio's  
Wally Szczerbiak, Cleveland took Utah point Andre Miller and Duke 
guard Trajan Langdon -- a pair who could potentially challenge 
Brevin Knight and Derek Anderson for their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota wound up with Szczerbiak and the two players Wittman  
thought the Timberwolves would get in the first round -- Miller and 
Langdon -- went to the Cavs. Wittman said he's ``ecstatic'' with 
Cleveland's draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson was simultaneously preparing for the draft as he looked  
for a coach. He recommended Wittman to Gund just before the draft 
and the former assistant met with Gund last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gund said he was impressed with Wittman's straightforward manner  
and potential as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely, positively certain we ended up with the  
best choice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman is well-regarded in NBA coaching circles, and in five  
years with the Timberwolves gained a reputation as one of the 
league's brightest assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	Before going to Minnesota, he spent the 1993-94 season as an  
assistant with the Dallas Mavericks. He also worked a year in 
Indiana on Bob Hill's coaching staff with the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	A nine-year NBA veteran, Wittman was a first-round draft pick of  
the Washington Bullets but was traded to the Atlanta Hawks before 
the 1983-84 season. He finished his career averaging 7.4 points per 
game following playing stints in Atlanta, Sacramento and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to playing for Indiana's 1981 NCAA title team,  
Wittman was a two-time academic All-American with the Hoosiers. 
Indiana coach Bob Knight on Wednesday called Wittman one of the 
smartest players he ever coached. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a player, he had a rare understanding of just what it  
takes to win and how to go about it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Former Broker Sentenced to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite a prosecutor's plea for a more lenient  
punishment, a broker at a now-defunct investment firm that stole 
$75 million from clients was sentenced to nine years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``A substantial number of the crooks he was dealing with will  
soon be in prison,'' Assistant District Attorney John Moscow told 
the judge before sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	State Supreme Court Justice Edward McLaughlin imposed the  
sentence on Roman Okin, 31, of Manhattan, who had worked for A.R. 
Baron &AMP; Co. The firm was created solely to steal its customers' 
money, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Okin, jailed for the past 13 months, pleaded guilty in May 1998  
to enterprise corruption and began helping in the prosecution of 
co-defendants and the recovery of some of the stolen money. 
</P>
<P>
	Okin was among 14 Baron brokers charged in 1997 in a 174-count  
indictment that accused them of lying to investors, making 
unauthorized trades, forging documents, and manipulating stocks and 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow said 13 of the defendants have pleaded guilty and one,  
John McAndris, was convicted after trial. McLaughlin sentenced 
McAndris, 57, of Montvale, N.J., to five to 15 years in prison, the 
longest sentence imposed in the Baron case. 
</P>
<P>
	After explaining to McLaughlin that Okin's help prevented most  
of the other defendants from being able to stage a viable trial 
defense, Moscow suggested a sentence of one to three or two to six 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Expressing his regret, Okin said, ``I am very sorry for the  
crimes I committed. I am sorry for all the people I hurt. I wish I 
had not made those mistakes. Along the way, I lost my boundaries of 
right and wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLaughlin said that however sincere Okin's apology might be, he  
is sure that the defendant's guilty plea and expressions of 
contrition were, at the outset, ``self-centered,'' offered in hopes 
of leniency. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said sentences for co-called ``white-collar'' crimes  
rarely reflect ``the enormous illegality and the purposeful 
deceit'' that occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-year maximum sentence McLaughlin imposed means that  
Okin must serve at least three years in prison and that he will be 
eligible for parole in 23 months. The judge could have sentenced 
him to 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Baron opened in July 1991 and closed in July 1996 after years of  
complaints. When the indictments were handed up, District Attorney 
Robert Morgenthau estimated that Baron had stolen $75 million from 
8,000 clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney said then that Baron was a place where  
``every conceivable form of dishonesty was used,'' and which ``was 
created and existed for no other reason than to line the pockets of 
its executives and employees at the expense of unsuspecting members 
of the public.''

<HEADLINE> Mercedes-Benz, Lexus Score High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Mercedes-Benz and Lexus rated highest in the  
latest crash tests of midsize sport utility vehicles performed by 
the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The group gave its ``best pick'' rating to the 1999  
Mercedes-Benz M-class and Lexus RX300, based on its frontal offset 
crash test in which the vehicles were driven at 40 mph into a 
deformable barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest test, six 1999 SUVs with new designs were rated.  
The worst performer was the Mitsubishi Montero Sport, which was 
rated poor for a major collapse of the driver-passenger 
compartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a huge difference between the best and worst  
performers,'' Brian O'Neill, institute president, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other models tested were the popular Jeep Grand Cherokee, which  
was rated marginal, and the Dodge Durango and Land Rover Discovery 
II, which were rated acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute's tests are particularly demanding because just  
the driver's side of a vehicle strikes the barrier, forcing a 
relatively small portion of the vehicle to absorb the crash energy. 
The federal government's crash tests involve driving vehicles into 
a rigid barrier with the full width of the front end making 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill said the Mercedes' frame held up particularly well,  
keeping the occupant compartment intact with little or no 
intrusion. By contrast, the instrument panel in the Montero Sport 
was pushed toward the driver dummy, reducing the space available 
for the safety belt and air bag to prevent injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, intrusion into the foot well contributed to the  
likelihood of serious leg injuries in the Montero Sport, O'Neill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi spokesman Kim Custer said the Montero Sport meets or  
exceeds federal safety standards. The government does not use a 
frontal offset crash test, but Custer said the institute's results 
showed that vital areas of the body -- the head, neck and chest -- 
were protected in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has not yet tested the '99 Montero Sport.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill said vehicle designs are being improved to provide  
stronger protection for the occupant compartment as a result of 
crash tests performed in the United States and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two best performers are among the newest designs in the  
vehicle group we tested,'' O'Neill noted. ``This likely had a lot 
to do with their good performances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest test results, combined with earlier tests for nine  
other models with still-current designs, provide ratings for the 
most popular midsize SUVs on the market. Among the models tested 
earlier, only the Toyota 4Runner earned the same good overall 
rating as the Mercedes and Lexus SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute notes that the energy a vehicle must absorb in a  
crash test increases with the vehicle's weight, so its tests are 
more demanding of heavier vehicles such as SUVs. But occupants of 
SUVs and other heavier vehicles in real-world, two-vehicle crashes 
typically fare better than people in cars. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------

	The institute's test results are available on the World Wide Web  
at www.highwaysafety.org. NHTSA's test results are available at

<HEADLINE> Bush Salutes Air Force Pilot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush saluted an Air  
Force pilot shot down over Bosnia in 1995 and asked him Wednesday 
to spread the word ``there's a new commander-in-chief on the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also spoke to a crowd of about 300 after meeting with  
governors of six western states. Earlier, he met Air Force pilot 
Scott O'Grady, who spent several days behind enemy lines while 
badly injured and without food and water after being shot down. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's own military record was called into question last week  
when reports surfaced he might have received preferential treatment 
when he was accepted into an Air Force National Guard training 
program during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, Bush promised ``a season of hope after years of  
cynicism'' and vowed to restore ``dignity and honor'' to the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	He also questioned the Clinton administration's responsibility  
for the economic boom of the 1990s, tweaking Vice President Al 
Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, 
in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you listen to those back there in Washington, D.C., they  
sound like they created prosperity,'' Bush said. ``They no more 
created prosperity than they invented the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne said the hour-long, closed-door  
meeting with the Republicans governors provided an opportunity for 
them to ``roll up the shirt sleeves and talk about the issues that 
are important to the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those discussed were public land and growth management,  
water and grazing rights, timber and mining claims, and nuclear 
waste storage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was one fundamental theme, it is the aspect of  
states' rights and the fact that we don't need the command and 
control from Washington, D.C.,'' said Kempthorne. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just believes firmly in states rights,'' Montana Gov. Marc  
Racicot said of Bush. ``He begins with a presumption of trust in 
the good sense and honest purpose of human beings and as a result, 
when you begin that way, you tend to delegate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt introduced Bush to the crowd of about 300  
supporters as a candidate who understands western issues. ``The 
West is his home. Not just a place he flies over on his way to 
somewhere else,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told the crowd education would be his top priority but said  
it should be up to local governments to chart the best course to 
teach students. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not the role of the federal government to tell states  
how to run their welfare programs and education,'' Bush said. 

</P>
<P>
	Bill Owens, the Colorado governor thrust into the national  
spotlight following the Columbine shooting, said the issue of gun 
control came up briefly, but specifics weren't discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, was greeted at the airport Tuesday night by Leavitt and  
his family bearing a Texas-shaped birthday cake and Utah belt 
buckle for Bush's 53rd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to run well out here. I try to remind people I'm from  
west Texas,'' Bush said Tuesday. ``I understand how people think 
out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said the first-ever Western Presidential Primary was  
important in luring Bush to the state, despite the disappointing 
participation in it. 
</P>
<P>
	The March 10, 2000, primary was initially expected to include  
eight western states, but it crumbled to just three -- Utah, Wyoming 
and Colorado -- with an estimated 75 delegates up for grabs instead 
of a projected 183.

<HEADLINE> Crippled Senator Allows Photographs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a stark display of his Vietnam War wounds,  
Sen. Max Cleland allowed a magazine photographer into his home to 
chronicle the three-hour routine he has endured each morning since 
losing both legs and an arm to a grenade explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was done to inspire other people, in very stark and very  
real terms,'' the Georgia Democrat said in an interview Monday. 
``There was nothing glossed over there, that's for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland's daily routine begins with meditation and prayer,  
followed by an exercise regimen that includes stretches, sit-ups, 
push-ups and 32 laps around his living-room, walking on his stumps 
across cushions spread over the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	In one photograph accompanying the article in the August issue  
of Esquire magazine, an unclothed Cleland is pictured using his 
good left arm to stretch his right stump across his body. Another 
picture shows him in shorts and tee-shirt walking on his stumps. 
</P>
<P>
	David Granger, Esquire's editor-in-chief, said there was no  
debate inside the magazine about using the unclothed picture of the 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to use the strongest picture we had that showed the  
reality of a man's life who happens to be a U.S. senator and also 
happens to have one arm and no legs,'' he said. ``This man is a 
miracle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland said he doesn't anticipate any political fallout in  
Georgia as a result of the article. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't done for politics,'' he said. ``It was done to  
inspire other people''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Imposes Tariffs on Lamb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton Administration is imposing penalty  
tariffs on foreign lamb in an effort to protect U.S. producers 
threatened by imports from New Zealand and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next week, a border tax of 9 percent will be imposed  
on the first 31,851 metric tons, the amount of lamb imported last 
year. Shipments above that will carry a 40 percent tariff, the 
White announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This package has been carefully designed to help achieve  
sustained competitiveness for the U.S. industry and is fully 
consistent with our international trade obligations,'' the White 
House said in a statement released in South Dakota, where President 
Clinton was visiting an Indian reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	American ranchers had complained that current tariffs of less  
than 1 percent were too low to protect them from foreign 
competitors flooding the U.S. market with their exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia and New Zealand account for 95 percent of the lamb  
imported into the United States. Importers have contended that 
higher tariffs would violate World Trade Organization rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who is scheduled to visit  
the United States next week, said in Canberra that ``there is no 
rational foundation for the American decision.'' He said the U.S. 
action ``strikes at the credibility of its rhetoric'' in support of 
free trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. industry hailed the announcement, which included an  
adminstration offer to spend $100 million over the next three years 
to help U.S. sheep producers become more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the adjustment package is provided as intended we will be  
in a much better position to compete at the end of the relief 
period,'' said Cathy Cummins, an official with the American Sheep 
Industry Association, headquartered in Denver, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. Craig Thomas of Wyoming, a leading lamb  
producing state, said he was pleased Clinton decided to protect the 
domestic industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always want more and want it sooner, but this is a  
critical decision that could make the difference for family 
ranchers and small communities throughout the West,'' Thomas said 
in a statement. ``Placing a sufficient level of trade restrictions 
on Australia and New Zealand will hopefully help bring our U.S. 
lamb industry back from the brink.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton acted after the U.S. International Trade Commission  
ruled in a trade case filed by the American Sheep Industry 
Association and other industry groups that U.S. producers were 
being harmed by a surge in lamb imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has also moved to impose higher tariffs on  
various types of foreign steel after U.S. steel companies 
complained that cheaper imports were causing thousands of layoffs 
and had forced three companies into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Several domestic industries are seeking similar relief as the  
U.S. trade deficit this year heads significantly higher than the 
record $169 billion in 1998. While the overall U.S. economy has 
withstood shocks from the global financial crisis, American 
manufacturers and farmers have been battered by lost export markets 
and cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The tariffs on imported lamb will drop to 6 percent in the  
second year and 3 percent in the third and final year. And the 
31,851 metric ton quota level -- roughly 70 million pounds -- will 
rise by 857 metric tons in the second year and another 857 metric 
tons in the third years, the administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamb imports above those levels will face a 40 percent tariff  
the first year, a 32 percent tariff the second year and a 24 
percent tariff the third year. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 10 sheep-producing states in order of production are  
Texas, California, Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota, Utah, Montana, 
Idaho and Iowa, according to the Agriculture Department. It said 
there are 74,700 sheep producers in the country.

	Smokers Score Major Win vs. Tobacco  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tobacco companies were dealt a major setback today  
as a jury found that cigarette makers produced a defective product 
that causes emphysema, lung cancer and other illnesses in a ruling 
that could expose the industry to billions of dollars in damages. 
The verdict affects as many as half a million Florida smokers and 
the heirs of those who died. The jury's decision could prove to be 
the industry's most dire courtroom loss yet, since the plaintiffs 
are seeking at least $200 billion.

	First Lady Defends Senate Bid  
</P>
<P>
	WEST DAVENPORT, N.Y. (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton  
defended her bid to run for a Senate seat from New York by 
declaring that it is not as important as where she is from but what 
she stands for. Mrs. Clinton said New Yorkers had some questions 
about what she believes in and the skills and interests that she 
would bring to the job. And she said she would address them. 
Advisers don't expect her to formally declare her candidacy until 
September, at the earliest.

	Clinton Meets American Indians  
</P>
<P>
	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- President Clinton today declared that  
the United States can no longer afford to ignore poverty and 
unemployment among American Indians. Visiting Oglala Sioux on the 
Pine Ridge Reservation, Clinton seemed almost disbelieving as 
Geraldine Blue Bird explained her living situation in a house and a 
nearby trailer. The tribe's president said Blue Bird's Igloo 
neighborhood is typical of housing conditions on the reservation.

	Nichols Seeks New Bombing Trial  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Terry Nichols' lawyers today asked for a new trial  
in the Oklahoma bombing, arguing that the government withheld FBI 
documents that could have helped his defense. Defense attorney 
Michael Tigar said there are 43,000 documents still hidden in FBI 
files. Prosecutors countered that they turned over 12,000 pertinent 
FBI files and that the others wouldn't have changed the verdict. 
Nichols, 44, is serving a life sentence for the 1995 bombing of a 
federal building that killed 168 people.

	Cool Front Breaks Heat Wave  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three days of broiling heat that killed 21  
people in the East and Midwest gave way to cooler weather today, 
bringing relief to hundreds of thousands of New York City residents 
who spent the night in a blackout. Consolidated Edison, the city's 
power utility, blamed the huge outage on massive use of air 
conditioners and fans. Most people had power restored by this 
afternoon. The heat spell brought wilting humidity and record 
temperatures over 100 degrees to many urban areas.

	Feds Want Mercury Out of Vaccines  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is about to ask manufacturers  
to remove from vaccines a type of mercury used as a preservative 
since the 1940s, citing concern that small infants now need so many 
immunizations that they may get too much of the chemical. Parents 
should not worry because the move concerning the preservative 
thimerosal is strictly a precaution, vaccine experts said. 

</P>
<P>
	Congo Cease-Fire Plan Approved  
</P>
<P>
	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- African foreign and defense ministers  
signed a draft cease-fire plan today to end the 11-month-old civil 
war in Congo, a conflict that has drawn in soldiers from five 
countries and threatened stability in Central Africa. The agreement 
goes into effect 24 hours after it is signed, possibly next week, 
by heads of the six nations involved in the war, leaders of the 
three Congolese rebel groups and other regional and organizational 
leaders.

	Yahoo! Posts Profit Increase  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. reported second-quarter profits  
and revenues that easily beat Wall Street expectations today, 
helped by a sharp increase in visitors to its leading network of 
Web sites. Excluding the cost of buying Internet companies such as 
GeoCities, Yahoo! said it earned $28.3 million, or 11 cents a 
share, in the quarter ended June 30. Revenues soared 156 percent to 
$115.2 million from $45 million.

Jones industrial average closed up 52.24 at 11,187.36. Declining 
issues on the New York Stock Exchange led advancers 1,693-1,279. 
The Nasdaq was up 6.31 to 2,743.09, also a record.

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Soybeans Up; Corn Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and soybean futures prices edged higher  
early today on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn futures were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices opened mixed as investors consolidated their  
positions following sharp losses a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans were expected to face continued pressure today  
from perceptions farmers will harvest bumper crops this fall 
following near-ideal growing weather. Those perceptions were 
reinforced by U.S. Agriculture Department weekly crop reports that 
showed more than 70 percent of both the corn and soybean crops 
nationwide were in good to excellent condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices now are hovering at 27-year lows, while corn  
prices have slipped to their lowest in nearly 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were facing pressure from perceptions winter wheat  
harvest is picking up after weeks of rain-caused delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 3/4 cents to $2.63 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.04 1/4 a bushel; December oats rose 1/2 
cent to $1.08 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1 cent to $4.22 1/2 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork bellies futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .42 cent to 62.45 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .33 cent to 77.02 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose .35 cent to 44.85 cents a pound; August pork bellies fell 
.82 cent to 34.90 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Neighbors Chase Down Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A group of neighbors formed a human  
shield to try to stop a suspect in a fatal hit-and-run, then chased 
him in their cars and held him until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the car driven by Gerald Weirton, 36, allegedly  
struck 13-year-old Gabriel Allen Swenor as he was playing Sunday 
with friends on a dead-end street. The boy was thrown 20 to 30 feet 
and died. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Weirton circled back to exit the street, a crowd of  
about 30 neighbors had formed a human shield, but the driver pushed 
his way through. One man who reached into the truck was dragged 
about two blocks before he fell from the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors hopped in their cars and followed the suspect. They  
finally surrounded him at a convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
	``He tried to run, but they grab him,'' police Lt. John Kane  
said. ``They sit on him and try to hold him there until police 
arrive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weirton was jailed on suspicion of hit-and-run, drunken driving  
and other offenses.

<HEADLINE> Elite Pros Skipping Milwaukee Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- This weekend, the PGA Tour's elite players  
won't be at Brown Deer Park, the public course on which the Greater 
Milwaukee Open has been played since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, David Duval and golf's other stars will be resting  
and preparing for next week's British Open. Instead, the GMO will 
feature an eclectic field of mid-level tour stars, local favorites 
and loyal yearly visitors to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have players who are very loyal to us,'' tournament  
director Dan Croak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the city in which it is played, the Greater Milwaukee Open  
is working-class and relatively unglamorous -- and the 
working-class, unglamorous golfers in its field like it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain golfers on tour wouldn't miss Milwaukee. Mark  
Calcavecchia has played in the past 18 GMOs, while Loren Roberts -- 
who plays so well in the tournament, fellow pro Skip Kendall once 
called it ``the Loren Roberts annuity'' -- has been here each year 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Jeff Sluman will return, but the galleries'  
sentimental favorite again likely will be Steve Stricker, a 
Madison, Wis., native who was the runner-up to Sluman last year and 
finished fifth at last month's U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Stricker's caddie will be his wife, Nicki. Last year, she was  
too busy to tote her husband's bag; she was giving birth to their 
first child. 
</P>
<P>
	Through schedule changes, venue changes and a yearly struggle to  
attract a top-flight field, the event has survived and thrived. 
Croak said ticket sales are better than last year, and the purse is 
a record $2.3 million, with the winner getting $414,000. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the event was bumped from its traditional Labor Day  
weekend slot to mid-July on the tour schedule, to follow the 
Western Open in suburban Chicago during the tour's summer sweep of 
the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great time to have a golf tournament in Wisconsin,''  
Croak said. ``We were very pleased with the adjustment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, next week's event is the British Open, one of golf's  
four majors. Many pros like to take the week off, or travel to the 
British Isles early to combat jet-lag and work on their games. 
</P>
<P>
	The GMO doesn't see the scheduling move as a setback. Croak  
noted that the tournament's results now count in the Ryder Cup 
points standings, which determine the field for the biennial 
showdown of the world's top golfers. Previously, Ryder Cup teams 
already were chosen before the tournament was played. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our field is better this year than it was last year, and I  
think it's partly due to the fact the tournament is more important 
to golfers now,'' Croak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several prominent golfers have played Brown Deer. Woods made his  
professional debut here in 1996, and John Daly and Vijay Singh both 
have played in Milwaukee recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest name in the 1999 field is Tom Lehman, who is ranked  
25th in the world but hasn't won in the United State since 1996. 
Only two players who have won on tour this year, Carlos Franco and 
Duffy Waldorf, are entered. 
</P>
<P>
	John Maginnes will play in the GMO a week after his caddie,  
Garland Dempsey, collapsed during the third round of the Western 
Open. Dempsey is still hospitalized, and tournament officials 
weren't sure who would carry Maginnes' bag.

<HEADLINE> Barnesandnoble.com Selling Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a race to keep pace with online rival  
Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com launched a music superstore today, 
including thousands of titles from artists ranging from pop 
sensation Ricky Martin to jazz legend Duke Ellington. 
</P>
<P>
	The music store will be part of barnesandnoble.com's newly  
redesigned bookselling Web site, which was also launched on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new music store, shoppers can choose from all types of  
music, including some harder to find categories, such as retro 
swing or Brazilian jazz. The store will also have a tremendous 
selection of classical music. 
</P>
<P>
	The store will contain more than 20,000 artist biographies, more  
than 50,000 music reviews and album ratings, as well as editorial 
suggestions on artists with similar music styles. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnesandnoble.com's move into music comes more than a year  
after Amazon.com added a vast music selection to its site and 
quickly became the leading music retailer on the Internet, toppling 
CDNow. 
</P>
<P>
	It also faces competition from Borders.com, which also sells  
music and books on its site, and traditional music retailers, such 
as Tower Records, which are moving into cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnesandnoble.com did sell a small selection of music on its  
site before, but the new music store greatly expands its offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not the first,'' said Jonathan Bulkeley, chief  
executive at barnesandnoble.com. ``But we aren't too late. This 
party will go on for the next 30 or 40 years ... if not longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many of its competitors, barnesandnoble.com will make songs  
available for downloading to home computers, although this will not 
be an important part of the site at first. This week, 
barnesandnoble.com will offer a previously unreleased live 
recording from Jewel for digital download to promote its new site. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers at the music store will also be able to find  
music-related books, sheet music, videos and magazines.

<HEADLINE> Football DT's Gift Made Into Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Daniel Huffman watches on the sidelines of a high  
school football field as movie stars film a scene in ``The Daniel 
Huffman Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too strange,'' the Florida State student says.  
</P>
<P>
	Not many 20-year-olds have movies made about them. But not many  
did what Huffman did -- give up his football career by donating a 
kidney to his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffman's act of love occurred three years ago. That was the  
summer before his senior year at high school in Rossville, Ill., 
the small town where his grandparents raised him following his 
parents' divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	His grandmother, Shirlee, badly needed a kidney transplant.  
There were fears she might die while waiting, perhaps more than a 
year for a suitable donated kidney. 
</P>
<P>
	So Daniel decided to make the donation himself, even though  
losing one of his two kidneys meant he would have to give up 
football and other contact sports forever. He was a starting 
defensive tackle on the Rossville team, and had to shelve plans to 
play in college. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, there's been a lot of good news for Huffman. His  
grandmother is now healthy, and he got a full scholarship to 
Florida State as a student trainer with the football team. That 
deal came thanks to Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden, who first heard 
Huffman's story when each of them was honored at a football awards 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Huffman is the subject of a movie being filmed in Toronto:  
``A Gift of Love: The Daniel Huffman Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is to be televised on the Showtime cable network this fall,  
although producer Daniel Paulson said it also might be released in 
movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulson said he immediately envisioned a film after reading  
about Huffman's saga. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is worried these days about young people and drugs  
and sex and violence, and President Clinton says Hollywood is not 
doing its part,'' Paulson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a movie that really goes against that grain -- it's a  
true profile in courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huffman is played by Elden Henson, one of the stars of the  
``Mighty Ducks'' movies. The grandmother is played by Debbie 
Reynolds, whose preparations included a visit to the Huffman home 
in Rossville that set the small town agog. 
</P>
<P>
	``My grandma was just completely thrilled,'' Huffman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Huffman was invited to the Toronto set this week, and has had a  
chance to meet Henson, Reynolds and others involved in the 
production. He and his fiance even were allowed to be extras in a 
scene showing fans watching a Rossville football game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a great time,'' Huffman said. ``Talking to the  
actors portraying your life -- it's unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He praised Henson's performance, offering just one  
tongue-in-cheek suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he should make the hits harder -- make me look mean.''  
</P>
<P>
	Also on hand was Bowden, who plays himself in the movie. He  
almost turned down the role to preserve his family's summer 
vacation, but decided he owed it to Huffman and to the school to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a kid -- he probably had a future in football, and he  
gave up his kidney for his grandmother,'' Bowden said. ``You don't 
see young people doing things like that -- I just never heard of 
anything more valiant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huffman, who will be a junior this fall, said he enjoys his work  
with the Florida State team, which enables him to travel with the 
squad on road games. Bowden suggested Huffman might have a future 
as a professional sports trainer, but Huffman said he is enjoying 
being an English major and might have a try as a sports publicist. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the movie, Huffman hopes it moves those who see it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it will make people think more about organ donation,''  
he said. ``They'll become more educated about it and sign organ 
donor cards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He insists his act was not as heroic as his admirers contend.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you love someone and you can help them, any way you can,  
you're going to do it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Cos. Liable in Fla. Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A landmark lawsuit by smokers yielded a verdict  
Wednesday that could cost the tobacco industry billions in damages, 
as a jury held the companies liable for making a defective product 
that causes emphysema, lung cancer and other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury, which deliberated over a complicated 10-question  
verdict form for seven days, will return in the next phase to 
determine damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Their decision could prove to be the industry's most dire  
courtroom loss yet, since the plaintiffs are seeking at least $200 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only five  
times -- three were overturned on appeal and the two others are 
being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	This case, the first class-action lawsuit by smokers to go to  
trial, was filed in 1994 on behalf of as many as 500,000 sick 
Florida smokers and the heirs of those who died. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs and family members wept and hugged each other as the  
verdict was read. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Marlboro Man just fell off his high horse into quicksand  
and it will be years until the tobacco industry even gets him 
halfway out,'' said Ahron Leichtman, executive director of Citizens 
for a Tobacco-Free Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris Inc., the nation's largest cigarette maker, said  
it remained under a court-imposed gag order and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry claimed there is no scientific proof that smoking  
causes any illness and that the public is well aware that smoking 
is risky. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury agreed with the smokers on all counts, including  
their claims that the industry deceived them about the dangers of 
smoking, hid research results, stopped scientific work that 
promised to produce safer cigarettes and advertised to children. 
The jury also found that the industry ``engaged in extreme and 
outrageous conduct ... with the intent to inflict severe emotional 
distress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $206 billion national settlement reached with the tobacco  
industry in November bars states from suing to recoup the costs of 
treating sick smokers, but it does not prohibit lawsuits by 
individuals such as this one. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the industry has been found liable, the jury will  
decide what damages should be awarded to the lawsuit's nine 
plaintiffs. Once their cases are concluded, the half-million other 
members of the class will be free to file their claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors heard eight months of testimony and were exposed to  
thousands of documents from decades of tobacco litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Former surgeons general, ex-tobacco industry scientists and  
doctors testified about the havoc smoking can wreak on the body, 
the difficulty in trying to quit and the manufacturers' refusal to 
cooperate with health officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were the nation's five biggest cigarette makers  
and two industry groups: Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett 
Group Inc., the Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the five smoking-liability cases in which juries have  
awarded damages have come this year. In March, a jury in Portland, 
Ore., awarded $81 million to the family of a smoker who died of 
lung cancer. The month before, a woman with inoperable lung cancer 
won $51 million in San Francisco. Both awards were reduced by 
judges and are being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the industry has had other recent victories -- it won another  
Oregon case as well as lawsuits on behalf of trade unions in Ohio, 
three dead smokers in Tennessee and one in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco stock prices fell after the verdict in after-hours  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris lost $2.62 1/2, or 6 percent, to close at $37.87 1/2 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. R.J. Reynolds fell $1.18 3/4, or nearly 4 
percent, to close at $30.87 1/2. Loew's Corp., parent of Lorillard, 
lost 81 1/4 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $79.06 1/4.	   Even so, some tobacco analysts said the news wasn't all bad for 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	David Adelman, a tobacco analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,  
said he expects that the case will be decertified as a class action 
on appeal, greatly reducing the potential damage award. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pointed out that the industry will also be allowed to  
use defenses in the next phase of the case that it wasn't able to 
raise in this one, such as the claim that smokers should bear 
responsibility for their decision to smoke.

<HEADLINE> Oakland Port Shut Down By Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Dock workers virtually closed down the  
Port of Oakland for a second day Wednesday, forcing cargo-laden 
ships to slow down across the Pacific Ocean or wait at anchor in 
San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Tractor-trailers also backed up for half a mile outside the  
port, which handles 33 shipping lines and 12 percent of West Coast 
shipping, as 1,400 dock workers stayed off the job over what they 
termed a safety issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The work stoppage delayed deliveries of everything from cotton  
and refrigerated fruit from California's farm regions to computer 
components from Silicon Valley to automobile parts from factories 
in the Midwest, a port spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 11 ships that aren't being loaded or unloaded,'' port  
spokeswoman Roberta Bradley said Wednesday. At least four more lay 
at anchor in the bay, unable to unload cargo from Asia, Hawaii and 
the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The port has been able to unload trucks onto the docks, so  
perishable cargo in refrigerated trucking containers was being 
hooked up to generators to prevent spoiling, Ms. Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The work stoppage was spontaneous and not directed by union  
leaders negotiating a new West Coast contract with the Pacific 
Maritime Association, according to Steve Stallone, a spokesman for 
Local 10 of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. But 
the union isn't about to tell its rank-and-file to return to the 
docks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not telling people to just go back to work, not 'til the  
dispute is settled,'' Stallone said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Longshore workers quit working Tuesday morning after the  
association refused their request to hire a second ``signalman'' to 
keep watch as the port's 12 massive cranes transfer trucking 
containers between tractor-trailers and the huge cargo vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	By all accounts, the work stoppage was limited to the Port of  
Oakland, although Stallone said longshore workers in Los Angeles 
and Long Beach were refusing to work overtime or during lunch in 
sympathy with the Oakland dock workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dock work continued normally in San Diego, Seattle and Portland,  
Ore., said association spokesman Phil Resch. 
</P>
<P>
	A walkout could have a huge economic impact if it does spread,  
according to the PMA, which represents management at all West Coast 
ports. 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis by the Berkeley Roundtable on the International  
Economy concluded that a five-day shutdown of all West Coast ports 
would cost the national economy an estimated $3.9 billion and 
result in the loss of nearly 12,000 jobs. West Coast ports handle 
more than half of the containerized cargo moving in and out of the 
United States every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Resch said he thought the walkout would be limited to Oakland,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	That's bad enough news for the local economy, Ms. Bradley said.  
``We're hoping that ships are not diverted from the Port of 
Oakland, because the port is a major economic engine for the whole 
Bay area,'' she said. ``We need those ships to get in here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contract talks ended July 1 for the Fourth of July holiday, with  
an understanding they would resume this week. Resch said the 
association hasn't heard from the union since, but Stallone said 
union negotiators are studying the latest management offer. 
</P>
<P>
	That proposal includes a 32 percent boost in pension benefits to  
future retirees and a 15 percent raise for those currently retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Pay in 1998 averaged $99,000 for dock workers, $117,617 for  
clerks and $156,251 for foremen, according to the association. 
Stallone said these figures represent total employer costs, 
including taxes and benefits. He said actual salaries are far 
lower.

<HEADLINE> Fleet Meeting Draws Hundreds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Five years ago, Lunita Mustafa's neighborhood was  
plagued by crime, a problem she said was partly fueled by a lack of 
low-income mortages and homeowners taking stake in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, those memories came back as Mustafa burst into  
tears as she spoke of her fear that the acquisition of BankBoston 
by Fleet would result in a megabank uninterested in providing 
services to people in low-income neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five years ago there was a wild beast in our community and it  
was devouring our children,'' said Mustafa, of the city's Mattapan 
section. ``Today, I hear they're going to unleash that beast 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rarely does a discussion of banking inspire such emotion, but  
Mustafa worries a decline in low-income mortgages would cut the 
number of homeowners working to keep her neighborhood safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustafa joined hundreds of homeowners, politicians and activists  
who expressed their concerns to the Federal Reserve Board about the 
possible repercussions of the proposed merger between Fleet 
Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp., which would create the 
nation's eighth-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the most vocal critics of the merger accused Fleet, in  
particular, of having a lackluster track record of lending in 
low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut Treasurer Denise L. Nappier said that in the wake of  
Fleet's 1995 acquisition of Shawmut National Corp., loans to low- 
and moderate-income borrowers in her state have been halved. 
</P>
<P>
	She also noted that many of the branches the banks plan to sell  
off to meet antitrust requirements are in poor neighborhoods, and 
she worried that some could be closed down. 
</P>
<P>
	And the attorneys general of Massachusetts and Connecticut told  
the board they were concerned the combined company, to be known as 
Fleet Boston, would stifle competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``This proposed merger would create a behemoth,'' said  
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who spoke of the 
deal's ``enormous peril and threat to competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bank executives said the $16 billion deal was prompted by a  
desire to maintain a New England-controlled bank in a rapidly 
consolidating industry. They said combining the two banks would 
reduce costs and lead to better service. 
</P>
<P>
	``By increasing in size, banks achieve the economies of scale  
that allow us to invest more in technology and people, so that we 
can develop superior products and services,'' said Terry Murray, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Fleet Financial Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank officials also pointed to a program they say will put $14.6  
billion into neighborhoods over five years, mostly through small 
business lending, affordable housing and community development 
lending programs in the seven states where the combined bank would 
do business. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks currently have a total of 1,625 branches in  
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire, New 
York and New Jersey. The two banks plan to sell 292 New England 
branches to comply with federal antitrust requirements.

<HEADLINE> Critic Says IOC Ready To Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee ``seems  
committed to the process of reform'' after its worst scandal, a 
leading critic of the committee's operations said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Duberstein, a former White House chief of staff and  
vice-chairman of an ethics inquiry that blasted IOC actions, said 
he came away from a recent meeting with committee leaders convinced 
of their intent to make meaningful changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt reasonably comfortable, having listened to their words  
and looked into their eyes, that they were serious,'' he said in a 
telephone interview from his Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	Duberstein's comments were the strongest so far in support of  
IOC reform measures from those who had criticized the committee in 
the wake of the million-dollar vote-buying scheme involved in Salt 
Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on the scandal in April,  
Duberstein said the IOC's reaction to the Mitchell commission was 
``to say the least disappointing'' and ``raises serious doubts 
about the commitment to reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, after initially repelling outside suggestions on ways of  
eliminating corrupt practices, the IOC appeared to now accept the 
seriousness of the problem and the need for independent help to fix 
the process and ``burnish their reputation,'' Duberstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duberstein and George Mitchell, the former Senate majority  
leader who headed the inquiry that found the IOC fostered a 
``culture of improper gift giving'' and blamed it for the scandal, 
met in London for 1 1/2 hours last weekend with the committee's top 
two leaders -- president Juan Antonio Samaranch and director general 
Francois Carrard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a meeting I think they sought,'' Duberstein said,  
noting that he and Mitchell were in the area on other business 
while the IOC officials were in London for the Wimbledon finals. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the IOC described the meeting -- the first between  
the two factions -- as ``most constructive and very encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also said that all of the Mitchell commission's  
recommendations, from selection of members to term limits to 
including more athletes, had been ``integrated into the reform 
process'' by IOC 2000, an 80-member commission due to recommend a 
new structure and code for the international committee by the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he agreed with the IOC's characterization, Duberstein  
said that Samaranch and Carrard had taken pains to go over the 
Mitchell report ``recommendation by recommendation, point by 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The senator and I came away encouraged that they are taking  
the need for reform seriously,'' he said. ``I really do think and 
the senator really does think that they seem committed to the 
process of reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``We encouraged them to keep on the path and to have the  
programs ready in the autumn. ... What we need to focus on is what 
the IOC does in the long run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC 2000, whose members include former Secretary of State Henry  
Kissinger, is to make preliminary recommendations in September or 
October, with the full IOC acting on the proposed changes in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell has convinced congressional leaders to delay any action  
on measures to tie up the IOC's billion-dollar income from U.S. TV 
networks and sponsors until the IOC votes. Duberstein said that he 
could informally brief Sens. John McCain and Ted Stevens, the IOC's 
harshest critics on Capitol Hill, when Congress returns from a 
Fourth of July recess.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters OK Pact With Car Haulers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Teamsters union announced late Wednesday that  
it has overwhelmingly ratified a four-year contract with trucking 
companies that haul new cars to showrooms across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was ratified by a 4-to-1 margin, the union said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Today, Teamster carhaulers have sent a very powerful message  
to management across the country -- united we win,'' declared 
Teamsters president James P. Hoffa. ``We have established a new 
pattern for the Teamsters -- we will no longer stand by and watch 
management step on the hard-working men and women of this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract dispute was the first test at the bargaining table  
for Hoffa since he was sworn in in March as head of the union once 
led by his late father, James R. Hoffa. Hoffa's election followed a 
campaign finance scandal that had fractured the union, and he has 
pledged to restore unity. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached June 2, averting a threatened strike  
that could have sharply slowed car sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters contract with 17 trucking companies that hauled  
more than 15 million cars from assembly plants, ports and rail 
yards to dealerships last year covers about 12,800 drivers, 
mechanics and yard and office workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms, drivers who choose to retire after 25 years of  
work would get better pension benefits, including health insurance 
for those age 55 and older. Also, retirees over age 65 would get 
new prescription drug benefits to supplement government Medicare 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, additional full-time mechanics hired by the trucking  
companies could be scheduled to work flexible shifts to help cover 
weekend hours -- for example, four 10-hour days rather than five 
8-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the union traded a raise for drivers this year for a  
one-time $1,500 bonus. In each subsequent year of the contract, 
wages will rise by 50 cents per hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Union haulers currently earn about $68,000 a year in wages and  
benefits, with salaries of $55,000.

<HEADLINE>  Tom Steels Wins Tour de France Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAVAL, France (AP) -- Travel along the route of the Tour de  
France and you're certain to see a banner or two railing against 
doping in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But a year after the crisis stained the tour, many fans don't  
really want to talk about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, doping is a problem, they say. But they are highly  
skeptical that it can truly be eradicated. And in the meantime, 
they don't want to spoil the unique atmosphere of the world's 
greatest cycling event. 
</P>
<P>
	So for every anti-doping banner unfurled during the tour -- ``Say  
no to EPO'' is a popular one -- there are others expressing 
solidarity with Richard Virenque, a French cycling hero who is 
under formal investigation on doping charges. He denies taking 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Richard, we forgive you,'' the signs say. Or: ``Richard, if  
you are here, we are here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young fans along the route during Tuesday's third stage, won by  
Belgian sprinter Tom Steels, were well aware of the scandal. But 
most didn't believe doping would ever be fully eradicated from the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish student Jose Luiz Catala was enjoying a folk concert in  
Nantes, in Brittany, before the riders came through. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all the players are doped,'' said the 17-year-old  
Catala. ``You know why? Because you can't win on a plate of 
spaghetti. You need more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His friend, Joan Albert Lairon, sporting red-and-yellow paint on  
his cheeks, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doping is fair if they all do it,'' he said. ``The problem  
comes when only some do. That's why it's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a bit dangerous -- no more than smoking cigarettes,''  
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the race goes on. A day after a dramatic crash during  
an ocean crossing, the third stage unfolded on dry ground and in 
classic style. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolling into the countryside of Brittany, with black-and-white  
Breton flags fluttering along the route, the stage began with an 
early breakaway and ended in a furious, shoulder-to-shoulder 
sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, Steels won the stage, timing his  
attack perfectly and surging through his rivals across the finish 
line, arms outstretched. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaan Kirsipuu of Estonia managed to keep the winner's yellow  
jersey and Steels moved into second place overall, followed by 
Spain's Abraham Olano and American Lance Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's teammate on a strong U.S. Postal Service team,  
George Hincapie, is in sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, making a stunning comeback after fighting testicular  
cancer, is waiting for Sunday's time trial and then the mountain 
stages to mount his challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	But this week, in the early, flat stages, it is the sprinters  
who excel. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's 121.6-mile route stretched through picturesque  
northern countryside from the city of Nantes, which straddles the 
Loire River, to the town of Laval. 
</P>
<P>
	Two riders, Frederic Guesdon and Massimo Giunti, broke away  
early and maintained their lead for 75.6 miles, but were caught by 
the pack late in the race, making way for the sprinting 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	The pack maintained a swift pace -- an average of 27 mph for the  
day -- and the final sprint came at a blistering 42 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Steels, with a winning time of four hours, 29 minutes, 27  
seconds, was followed by Germany's Erik Zabel, Stuart O'Grady of 
Australia, Nicola Minali of Italy and, in fifth place, Hincapie. 
Armstrong finished 24th. 
</P>
<P>
	Cycling's governing body announced Tuesday that 16 cyclists have  
been certified to race with a hematocrit level that exceeds the 50 
percent limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The hematocrit level measures the proportion of red blood cells  
in a blood sample -- one sign of doping, since the substances 
increase red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Cycling Union noted that 3 percent of the  
global population has a hematocrit level higher than 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how many, if any, of the riders issued those  
certificates are racing in this year's tour. U.S. racer Jonathan 
Vaughters has one, but he was injured in Monday's crash on an ocean 
causeway and forced to abandon the race.

<HEADLINE> Cos. Can Advertise Health Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Starting Thursday, manufacturers of cereals  
and breads rich in whole grains can advertise that those foods help 
fight heart disease and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cereal maker General Mills asked the government to allow  
Cheerios, Total, Wheaties and other qualifying foods to advertise, 
on the food's package, that eating a diet high in whole-grain foods 
-- that also is low in fat -- may reduce the risk of heart disease 
and certain cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	Foods rich in dietary fiber already can make certain  
disease-fighting health claims. But General Mills cited a 1989 
conclusion by the National Academy of Sciences that whole grains 
mix other important nutrients with fiber to be disease-fighting, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration accepted that conclusion, so  
beginning Thursday General Mills and any other maker of a whole 
grain-rich food can start advertising the benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify, a food must contain 51 percent or more whole grain  
ingredients by weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, only 7 percent of Americans eat the three servings of  
whole grain a day recommended for optimal nutrition, General Mills 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company cited a recent survey showing consumer confusion  
over just what constitutes whole grain, and cautioned that just 
because a bread looks dark doesn't mean it qualifies. Check the 
label -- the first ingredient listed should be a whole grain, such 
as ``whole grain oats,'' ``whole grain wheat'' or ``whole wheat.''

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two Massachusetts politicians teamed up to send  
their best wishes to a fellow Red Sox fan -- Stephen King. 
</P>
<P>
	King, recovering from injuries he suffered after being struck by  
a van last month, won't be able to make it to Fenway Park for the 
All-Star Game on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	So Gov. Paul Cellucci and Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino on  
Tuesday signed a giant get-well card for King, a season ticket 
holder, at the Boston Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
	King is a rabid Red Sox fan who combined his two interests in  
his latest scary story, ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,'' a 
reference to the baseball team's ace relief pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all love Tom Gordon,'' Menino wrote on the giant Styrofoam  
card, which will remain at the library for members of the public to 
sign for at least a few more weeks.

	Cycling's governing body announced Tuesday that 16 cyclists have  
been certified to race with a hematocrit level that exceeds the 50 
percent limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The hematocrit level measures the proportion of red blood cells  
in a blood sample -- one sign of doping, since the substances 
increase red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Cycling Union noted that 3 percent of the  
global population has a hematocrit level higher than 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how many, if any, of the riders issued those  
certificates are racing in this year's tour. U.S. racer Jonathan 
Vaughters has one, but he was injured in Monday's crash on an ocean 
causeway and forced to abandon the race.

<HEADLINE> Former NBA Player Gets Trial Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An Aug. 16 trial date was set for former  
NBA and Mississippi State basketball player Dontae' Jones on 
charges stemming from a nightclub shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who led Mississippi State to the NCAA Final Four in 1996,  
faces up to 14 years in prison if convicted on all charges in 
Davidson County General Sessions Court. He is accused of simple 
assault with bodily injury, reckless endangerment and felony 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting took place April 25 outside a nightclub called the  
Players Draft House after an argument between a Memphis rap group 
and an entertainment promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	Players Draft House security guard Darryl L. Tyce told  
authorities he saw Jones and another man firing handguns in his 
direction. Tyce was wounded in the stomach and his car was damaged. 
The assault charge stems from a separate altercation inside the 
nightclub between Jones and a woman, said assistant district 
attorney George Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was the junior college player of the year after averaging  
28.7 points and 13.3 rebounds for Northeast Mississippi Community 
College during the 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He played one season at Mississippi State, averaging 14.7  
points. He was the MVP of the Southeastern Conference tournament 
after Mississippi State upset Kentucky, and led the Bulldogs to the 
Final Four, where they lost to Syracuse in the national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones left college after his junior year and was a first-round  
draft pick of the New York Knicks. He had foot surgery shortly 
after the draft and did not play that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Traded to Boston, Jones played in 15 games for the Celtics in  
the 1998 season, averaging 2.9 points. He was waived by the Celtics 
before the start of the 1999 season.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Become an Increasing Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kevin Kelleher arrived for work at 8 a.m. one  
day to find a disturbingly familiar high-tech headache for the 
federal government: Hackers had vandalized the national weather 
Internet site he manages in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The hackers replaced important information about storms and  
tornadoes threatening the Midwest with a smirky taunt for Kelleher 
addressed to ``mister admin person nice guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, victims of these types of high-profile electronic  
assaults have included government agencies, the military and large 
companies on the Web. In a flurry of activity, hackers in recent 
weeks struck the White House, FBI, U.S. Senate (twice) and the 
Army's main Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	And experts warn of an emerging threat to consumers from the  
next generation of technology: new high-speed connections to the 
Internet over cable TV or new digital phone lines that are 
permanently logged on. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher speeds carry higher risks: Hackers even thousands of  
miles away could anonymously probe household computers over the 
Internet and rummage through private e-mail, documents and bank 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	``It vastly and immediately multiplies the amount of poorly  
protected computers on the Internet ripe for the picking,'' said 
Lucas Graves, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, a research 
company in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Using these continuous Internet connections and ``server''  
software included free on most new computers, families can publish 
up-to-the-minute photo albums online or retrieve computer files 
while traveling. Server software allows computers to ``serve up'' 
Web pages requested by other users. 
</P>
<P>
	But they may not realize the risks of leaving their digital  
doors unlocked. A Web site that tracks hackers, Attrition.Org, has 
recorded more than 1,465 cases of vandalism this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you get these machines in people's homes that are always on  
with a server, with pictures of their cat for grandma to see, that 
could be an issue,'' said Cormac Foster, another Jupiter analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Culp, Microsoft Corp.'s security manager for its Windows  
NT Server software, agreed the industry needs to ``educate 
consumers ... and make sure they understand the risks associated 
with having a direct connection to the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hackers already victimized Danny Sun of Walnut Creek, Calif.,  
when they raided one of his continuously connected computers in 
May. They vandalized a Web site he runs as a hobby, but they also 
stumbled across -- then published on the Internet -- personal 
financial information that included his account number and 
balances. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun later determined that hackers exploited a flaw in Internet  
software from the Allaire Corp. of Cambridge, Mass. The company 
warned customers about the problem months earlier on its Web site 
and in e-mail that Sun admits he ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get lots of mails from these manufacturers,'' Sun said.  
``Sometimes, I don't bother to read it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Army apparently left the same vulnerability unrepaired --  
also despite warnings from the same software vendor -- about its Web 
site, which a hacker vandalized last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very, very easy and takes very little time,'' a person  
who acknowledged being the hacker said in an online interview with 
The Associated Press. ``Under five minutes if you don't poke 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe it. I was just going through to check  
vulnerabilities and was like, wow!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Army spokesman Jim Stueve said only that a criminal  
investigation was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts argue whether to blame software companies for designing  
vulnerable products or victims who aren't diligent about installing 
patches and upgrades. Kelleher blamed his weather site's 
vulnerability on a faulty patch from a software maker. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is getting so complex,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The dilemma for software makers, who usually send customers  
e-mail when they discover flaws, is made worse by hackers 
monitoring the warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is what we look over and try and exploit,'' the person  
who acknowledged vandalizing the Storm Predication Center in 
Oklahoma said in an online interview with the AP. ``We're just 
average Schmoes testing vulnerabilities on big systems and 
exploiting them to our advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts predict software of the future will periodically check  
with its manufacturer, using the Internet for important upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	That type of technology could be a remedy for victims like  
Kelleher. It took 52 hours, with only brief periods for sleep and 
food, to restore the government's weather site. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ranks on the high-annoyance scale,'' Kelleher said after  
last week's repairs. ``There's a lot of people spending a lot of 
energy trying to hack these systems. It's difficult to spend an 
equal amount of energy to protect them.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Touring New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DAVENPORT, N.Y. (AP) -- Greeted by competing sides telling  
her to ``go home Hillary'' or ``you go girl,'' prospective Senate 
candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton began her first full-scale 
campaign tour into New York today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has been to New York a dozen times this year as the  
nation's first lady, but today's trip was her first since formally 
declaring that she is considering making the Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	For her first official campaign appearance, Mrs. Clinton chose  
the homestead of the man she hopes to succeed, Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan. It is the first stop on what aides describe as a 
summerlong ``listening tour'' of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	At her arrival at the Binghamton Airport, Mrs. Clinton was  
greeted by about 50 supporters, including state Democratic 
Chairwoman Judith Hope and former state Democratic Chairman John 
Burns. Outside the airport, about three dozen supporters waved 
placards while farther along the road a tractor-trailer carried a 
sign that read ``go home Hillary'' in large letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Her aides said Mrs. Clinton, the first-ever first lady to seek  
public office, hopes to blunt charges she is a political 
carpetbagger, having never lived or worked in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Witno fanfare, Mrs. Clinton's campaign on Tuesday filed a single  
page with the Federal Election Commission in Washington, declaring 
that she had formed a committee to explore a Senate race. That 
enables her to raise and spend money for political travel, polling 
and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan's decision to retire after 24 years in the Senate  
cleared the way for her Senate bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The race to replace Moynihan is being eyed on the Republican  
side by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and two congressmen 
from Long Island, Rick Lazio and Peter King. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani formed a Senate exploratory committee in April.  
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the Clinton administration and Moynihan have  
not always been warm. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Moynihan became the first Senate Democrat to call for  
appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate President 
and Mrs. Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater real estate 
venture. Two years later, while criticizing the president's backing 
of welfare reform legislation, the senator said ``the current batch 
in the White House ... have only the flimsiest grasp of social 
reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's decision to visit the Moynihan homestead brought  
a flurry of activity to the normally placid place. Workmen 
constructed an outdoor platform to hold the more than 200 reporters 
and television crews, some from as far away as Asia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we're cleaning out the barn in case it rains tomorrow  
... It's full of pigeon guano,'' the senator's wife, Liz, said on 
the eve of Mrs. Clinton's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be better on Thursday,'' she added wearily.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's four-day swing through eastern and central New  
York, a traditional GOP stronghold, has generated enthusiasm from 
many Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were poking fun.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the `I'm-not-a-carpetbagger tour,''' veteran New York GOP  
strategist Jay Severin proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent independent polls, showing Mrs. Clinton either trailing  
or tied with Giuliani, indicate her political team has its work cut 
out for it. 
</P>
<P>
	A June poll from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute found  
that 53 percent of registered voters statewide do not believe Mrs. 
Clinton understands the issues and problems facing New York, up 
from 43 percent in a March poll from the Hamden, Conn.-based 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, including Giuliani, have been making much of the  
fact that Mrs. Clinton is an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
	State Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman, a Syracuse-area  
Democrat helping arrange Mrs. Clinton's four-day New York trip this 
week, said he has told her that it will be a very difficult race in 
large part because of the carpetbagger issue.

<HEADLINE> Member of Supremes Loses Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An original member of The Supremes has lost  
an appeal of her trademark suit against three women who perform as 
Former Ladies of the Supremes. 
</P>
<P>
	The rights to the group's name are owned by Motown, and not by  
former members such as Mary Wilson, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said Motown had allowed Former Ladies of the Supremes  
-- and another spin-off group, Sounds of the Supremes -- to keep 
their names, and there was nothing Wilson could do about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's suit claimed the groups were misleading members of the  
public into believing they were the authentic Supremes. The court's 
response wasn't surprising, said Walter Allan, lawyer for Former 
Ladies of the Supremes -- Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne and Jean 
Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
	``She really didn't have a case and she shouldn't really have  
taken an appeal,'' Allan said. Wilson's lawyer, Allen Hyman, 
declined comment, saying he hadn't seen the ruling.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Dealer Sold Killer His Gun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Benjamin Smith wanted a gun and he did what  
everyone is supposed to do: He got a gun owner ID card, filled out 
an application at an Illinois gun shop and returned three days 
later to pick up his weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd been rejected -- a background check showed that an  
ex-girlfriend had taken out a protection order against him because 
of abuse -- so he hit the streets and in just three days had two 
handguns from an illegal dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after that, authorities say, the white supremacist  
started the rampage that killed two people and wounded nine others 
-- all of them black, Jewish or of Asian descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's experience and the devastation he wrought has renewed  
the debate over gun control just weeks after Congress considered -- 
but did not agree on -- new restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This unfortunately hits home the point that we have to start  
regulating the secondary market as well,'' including gun shows, 
unlicensed gun dealers and sales over the Internet, said Lisa Morel 
Las, the director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The arguments echo those in the wake of the April massacre at  
Columbine High School in Colorado and the recent debate in 
Congress: Gun control activists say the case demonstrates the 
inadequacy of the nation's gun laws, while the gun lobby says the 
problem is lax enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Dave Sanders, a spokesman for the Illinois State Police,  
said the state issued Smith the gun owner's ID card on June 18 
because of errors in the protection order, which -- among other 
things -- listed Smith's middle initial as ``A.'' His eye color and 
weight also didn't match. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith tried to buy two 9 mm handguns and a shotgun on June 23 at  
Heights Gun and Hunter Supplies in Peoria Heights, said Jerry 
Singer, an agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	After being turned down, Smith bought a Bryco .380-caliber  
semiautomatic handgun on June 26 and .22-caliber pistol on June 29 
from an illegal dealer who already was being investigated by the 
ATF, Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both guns were found with Smith's body after he killed himself  
Sunday near the southern Illinois town of Salem. Tests showed that 
weapons of those calibers were used in the spree. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association argues the system broke down even  
before Smith stepped out of the store and into the world of illegal 
gun dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's ex-girlfriend, Elizabeth Sahr, had secured the  
protection order, saying he had physically and mentally abused her 
and that she was ``hiding and in fear for my life.'' It took effect 
in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits convicted felons and anyone under such an  
order from purchasing a firearm. Smith's application was denied at 
the gun shop, and the NRA says he should also have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system failed,'' said James Baker, the chief lobbyist for  
the NRA. ``Why did it fail? Because there is too little enforcement 
of existing federal gun laws, and that's the real tragedy here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities say it's not that simple.  
</P>
<P>
	``The system worked in this case by not allowing firearms to be  
sold to Mr. Smith,'' Singer said. He said that while a denial can 
trigger an investigation, authorities simply do not have enough 
information to make an immediate arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The name of the unlicensed dealer who sold Smith the guns has  
been turned over to federal prosecutors for possible charges, 
Singer said. The dealer's name was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 21, a member of a white supremacist group called the  
World Church of the Creator, distributed hate literature while he 
was a student at the University of Illinois and Indiana University 
in Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say his holiday rampage included shootings in  
Chicago, two of its suburbs, three other Illinois cities and 
Bloomington. Killed were former Northwestern University basketball 
coach Ricky Byrdsong and Won-Joon Yoon, a South Korean doctoral 
student at Indiana University. 
</P>
<P>
	``What (is) America, which is known as the world model country,  
doing while the American flag, a symbol of freedom, equality and 
justice, is being torn apart by the gun spree?'' Yoon's father, 
Shin-Ho Yoon, asked Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are trying to determine Smith's motive and if he had  
any outside assistance. FBI agent Doug Garrison said Matt Hale, the 
supremacist group's leader, would not be implicated in the spree 
simply for his beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if we expect that a person's planned activities or  
activities violate federal or state law, that's obviously a concern 
for law enforcement,'' Garrison said.

<HEADLINE> Praegitzer Industries To Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUALATIN, Ore. (AP) -- Praegitzer Industries said Tuesday it has  
cut 158 jobs -- 50 of them in Oregon -- and sued the former owner of 
an Alabama plant that the company had to close in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those let go were sales people, designers and  
administrators. The circuit board manufacturer has about 1,700 
employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're really doing is cleaning house and shrinking  
themselves,'' said securities analyst Thomas Moro of Advest Inc. in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Praegitzer has been on an acquisition binge to  
keep up in a consolidating industry led by companies with a billion 
or more in annual sales. With its cutbacks, the company is geared 
for sales in the $200 million to $250 million range. 
</P>
<P>
	Praegitzer said it will now focus on boosting the profitability  
of its existing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent restructuring aims to undo a mistake Praegitzer  
said it made in acquiring Intergraph Corp.'s circuit board 
manufacturing plant in Huntsville, Ala., last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The factory proved to be expensive for Praegitzer, and accounted  
for 9 cents of the company's 64 cent per share loss in its fiscal 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Praegitzer said Tuesday that it is seeking $25 million in  
damages from Intergraph in a suit filed in U.S. District Court in 
Portland.

<HEADLINE> Delta Wants To Polish Reputation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In other places, folks complain about the  
weather. In Atlanta, if it's not about traffic, the griping is 
probably about Delta Air Lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The hometown carrier, Georgia's largest private employer with  
nearly 31,000 employees, has been trying to reverse a plummet in 
its reputation for customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	But Delta-bashing is a popular sport, and area newspapers  
frequently have columns and letters harping on the latest affronts. 
</P>
<P>
	``From most of what I hear,'' said Christopher McGinnis, who  
produces a newsletter for frequent travelers and writes a weekly 
column for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ``that as much as the 
upper echelon of Delta would like to think that things are getting 
better, the rank-and-file travelers think it's just as bad, if not 
worse, than before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perception of airline service overall has been declining  
steadily in the United States. Department of Transportation 
statistics show air travel complaints have risen the past three 
years, up 28 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong economy means more people are flying, which also means  
longer lines and more crowding. And Delta, which dominates 
Atlanta's busy Hartsfield International Airport with more than 600 
flights daily, has the added burden of an early 1990s cost-cutting 
wave that submerged its image of friendly efficiency and Southern 
hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for a company like Delta or Coca-Cola or a few other  
companies that are part of the fabric of the community, the 
expectations are very, very high,'' said Vicki Escarra, named last 
year to the newly created Delta position of executive vice 
president for customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of our customers are remembering what we were like,''  
said Ms. Escarra, a native Atlantan who joined Delta as a flight 
attendant 25 years ago. ``So we're going to have to work four times 
as hard to regain their confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leo F. Mullin, a Chicago utilities executive who became the  
first Delta chief executive officer from outside the airline, told 
shareholders at his first annual meeting in 1997 that rekindling 
employee morale and ``correction of shortcomings'' in customer 
service would be priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	He has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new  
technology and refurbishing, while reshaping Delta's management. 
He's brought in executives from other airlines and even other 
industries -- and he put Delta veteran Escarra in charge of 
improving all stages of customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was involved when Delta was great as far as service, so I  
know what that was like,'' she said. ``And I went through the tough 
times. I'm very passionate about seeing it get turned around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delta, the nation's largest carrier in terms of passengers, was  
in June awarded Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine's award 
as the ``Best-Managed Major Airline'' for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But regular fliers quickly cite continued misfires -- a change  
last year making it harder to get upgrades; cutting out free 
sandwiches on many flights; a short-lived $2 surcharge on tickets 
not booked at Delta's Web site, and another short-lived move to 
charge ``popular prices'' for drinks in airport Crown Rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly Atlanta Business Chronicle in May ran a cartoon with  
a message board showing ``customer service-delayed...customer 
relations-canceled'' and a passenger saying: ``This must be the 
Delta counter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Escarra agreed that perception continues to be a problem and  
that ``we need to do a better job of telling our story: Yes, we did 
have problems, but here's where we are currently, and let us tell 
you what we have planned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you have gaffes that will happen,'' said Andy Deane,  
a Delta captain and spokesman for the pilots' union, which has been 
critical of Delta management. ``I think overall, Mullin's team has 
done a pretty good job of addressing customer satisfaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal figures released on July 6 showed that Delta ranked  
fourth among U.S. carriers in each of three categories; on-time 
arrivals, fewest mishandled bags, and fewest customer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, however, was the worst among major carriers when it  
came to bumping passengers involuntarily from overbooked flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta spokesman Bill Berry said a pilot sickout at American  
Airlines in February may have led to the increased bumpings as 
Delta tried to take stranded travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Escarra said that fliers will see a series of changes, large  
and small, over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta is beginning to roll out technology to speed check-in and  
boarding, including software that will provide information to both 
Delta agents and customers with a card swipe, as well as enable 
agents to manage seat inventories with a few keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital message boards and television monitors in key airports  
will provide faster, more complete information on the status of 
flights, Delta says, and check-in kiosks and two-stage security 
checks will reduce lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta also plans to post ticket agents at some Atlanta mass  
transit stations, provide close airport parking for regular fliers, 
and even offer a limousine service. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ms. Escarra said, with the new technology will come a series  
of small, but important improvements, ranging from breakfasts for 
morning travelers, free drinks or discounts for customers who had 
service problems, and making sure employees smile, greet customers 
by name, and thank them for their business -- ``the things we used 
to do day in and day out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delta has even produced its own, critic-free newspaper, called  
``The Atlanta Journey-Destination.'' It tells the story of how 
Delta became ``the greatest airline in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's dated July 22, 2001.

<HEADLINE> Uninsured Issue Takes On New Focus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The uninsured are suddenly a hot topic again  
in Washington, as business and insurance groups that helped defeat 
a plan for universal health care now champion those without 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The business and insurance groups are trying to beat back the  
politically popular ``patients' bill of rights,'' which will be 
debated in the Senate next week. They are running $750,000 worth of 
ads this week aimed at swaying potentially wayward GOP senators. 
</P>
<P>
	They argue that the legislation would raise the cost of  
insurance and force some employers to drop coverage for their 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitch gains potency as the number of uninsured Americans  
grows. Despite prosperous economic times, it stood at 43.4 million 
in 1997 -- up by nearly 4 million since President Clinton proposed 
his universal health insurance plan in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	But that only partially explains business and insurance  
interests' new focus on the uninsured, said Robert Blendon, who 
studies health policy and public opinion at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the middle of the debate over the patients' bill of rights,  
a lot of groups rediscovered the uninsured,'' he said. ``They said, 
`Let's stop talking about the patients' bill of rights; let's start 
talking about the uninsured.''' 
</P>
<P>
	They are the same groups, along with Republican allies in  
Congress, who helped defeat universal health care five years ago. 
In that debate, a central argument against Clinton's plan to help 
the uninsured was that the insured would lose their ability to 
choose their own doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the debate is about the limited choice of doctors and  
other complaints involving HMOs, the argument is that new rules 
will result in more people without insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the uninsured -- mostly consumer groups -- are  
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden the people who gave us the fire -- the  
arsonists -- are going to come up with a solution,'' said Dr. 
Quentin Young of Physicians for a National Health Program. ``It's 
disingenuous, if not dishonest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new interest in the uninsured also shows up in GOP proposals  
to change the tax code and in a pitch by the insurance association 
for the government to create a $60 billion annual subsidy. Both 
would help people without insurance buy coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the July Fourth holiday, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, promised that his 
tax plan would include new incentives -- credits or deductions -- to 
buy coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties' strategy on health care can be traced to the 1994  
health debate, said GOP pollster Frank Luntz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It forced the Democrats to scale back,'' he said. ``And it  
forced the Republicans to offer proposals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But HMOs are now front and center. The radio and television ads  
are running in five states where Republican senators up for 
re-election next year. The goal is to ward off temptations for the 
five to vote for some of the more popular Democratic amendments 
that will be offered in the Senate debate on the issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pay more or lose our insurance? Doesn't Congress care what  
happens to us?'' a man complains in one of the TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads are targeted at GOP Sens. Spencer Abraham of Michigan,  
Mike DeWine of Ohio, Slade Gorton of Washington, Rod Grams of 
Minnesota and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar arguments are expected in the Senate next week. Sen. Don  
Nickles, R-Okla., who has led the opposition to new HMO rules, 
mentions the uninsured just about every time he talks about the 
issue. But he acknowledges the politically risky position he and 
other Republicans are taking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a wonderful idea. We are going to guarantee everybody  
all this assortment of benefits,'' he said on the Senate floor. 
``But they do have a cost. If we make insurance unaffordable and 
move a million and a half people from the insured category to the 
uninsured category, I think we are making a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocate Ron Pollack, president of Families USA, said  
the true test of interest in the uninsured will come after the HMO 
debate is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have plenty of opportunity to see which of the  
organizations that are talking about health coverage really mean 
it,'' he said. ``I'm hopeful, but past history tells us that 
there's room for cynicism.''

<HEADLINE> Tour Reunites Original Bad Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When the original members of Bad Company got  
together last fall at Black Barn Studios in Surrey, England, they 
didn't know what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to get on anybody's toes,'' said  
guitarist-songwriter Mick Ralphs. ``We were dying to cut loose. 
Then we launched into an old song.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, the chemistry was still there.  
</P>
<P>
	``We went into `I Can't Get Enough of Your Love,''' said  
musician-singer-songwriter Paul Rodgers. ``It was like putting an 
old pair of Levi's on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bad Company's original members -- Ralphs, Rodgers, Simon Kirke  
and Boz Burrell -- are on tour this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Their last tour was 20 years ago, when the band broke up. Bad  
Company continued with other breakups and lineups. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the original members stayed in music, soaking up  
different influences and working with other musicians. ``Now, it'll 
be interesting to see what we all can contribute,'' Rodgers said. 
``When you play with different people, different things come out of 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The band is optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we weren't able to rock, we wouldn't have done the tour. It  
has to be happening now, not just in people's memories,'' Rodgers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Ralphs: ``We never came to dislike each other at all. It's  
remarkable, really. I don't worry it's going to be different now. I 
don't feel pressure. It feels easy. It feels good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bad Company was formed in England in 1973 as a rock supergroup.  
The band included Rodgers and drummer Kirke from Free, Ralphs from 
Mott the Hoople and bassist Burrell from King Crimson. Influenced 
by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and to a certain extent, the Beatles, Bad 
Company produced a string of hit records from 1974 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Their new 33-song, two-CD set, ``The `Original' Bad Company  
Anthology'' (Elektra Records), presents the band's songs in 
chronological order. ``Can't Get Enough,'' a No. 5 single in 1974, 
is the first song on the new CD, followed by ``Rock Steady'' and 
the No. 1 hit ``Ready for Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people say it's the soundtrack of their lives, certainly  
of their youth,'' Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although touring has its ups and downs, ``This tour isn't going  
to be long enough to get to the downhill part,'' Ralphs said. 
``When it ends, I think we'll still be cruising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What about extending the tour beyond its original 30 dates?  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll keep it open-ended, see how it all feels, whether we  
want to do more or not,'' said Ralphs. ``Hopefully, it'll go well 
and we'll want to continue. We have to have that option to make it 
comfortable for everybody. We can be honest with each other and 
make a decision that feels right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers was the first to leave, saying he wanted to spend more  
time with his two young children. Those children, now 27 and 29, 
have bands of their own. (``And doesn't time fly,'' Rodgers said.) 
</P>
<P>
	He built a home studio and recorded a solo album, ``Cut Loose,''  
which was released in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``By 1985 I was back on the road with Jimmy Page in the Firm,''  
he said. ``I got a lot out of my system, having left the band and 
done various things. My tribute to the blues (``Muddy Waters 
Blues'' in 1993) particularly was very exciting and interesting for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His new album is ``Now'' (Velvel).  
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers, Ralphs and Burrell live in England. Kirke lives in New  
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing solo work for a number of years; I want to  
continue with that,'' Rodgers said. ``I might be able to do both. 
It's nice for me to do this, setting the record straight as to who 
is the original Bad Company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The original band members were brought back together at the  
funeral of their manager Peter Grant two and one-half years ago. 
``Led Zeppelin were there, too, a lot of faces we used to know in 
the old days,'' Rodgers said. ``We talked old times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We all felt the chemistry,'' Ralphs said. ``Here we were all  
together again. I think the whole reunion was indirectly because of 
that. We've got Peter Grant to thank again, in a roundabout way.''

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A strike by tens of thousands of  
truckers entered its third day Wednesday, snaring traffic on key 
highways across Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Government security forces helped working truckers circumvent  
the job action by more than 200,000 unionized truck drivers, who 
are protesting a new tax on automobiles, boats and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Striking truckers idled their vehicles in long columns alongside  
national highways. Although the trucks did not block those routes, 
Interior Minister Carlos Corach complained that the strikers were 
slowing traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Truckers complain that the new tax -- to raise $700 million for  
much-needed increases in teachers' salaries -- amounts to thousands 
of dollars in added levies on their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Truckers have said the strike, originally scheduled to end late  
Wednesday, could go on until the tax was lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	In Buenos Aires, the government's national security council met  
on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, ruling party lawmakers in the lower house of  
congress debated proposals for drastically cutting back the new tax 
or finding an exemption for the truckers.

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil has softened its opposition to a  
two-year coffee export plan aimed at keeping prices up, producers 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil agreed to discuss the two-year program with other members  
of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries, which is meeting 
in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the plan were not released. Earlier, Brazil had  
pushed to maintain one-year export targets. The plan can hardly 
work without Brazil, the world's No. 1 producer and exporter of 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1998-99 coffee year that ended in June, members agreed to  
limit coffee exports to 51 million 132-pound bags, with Brazil 
exporting 15 million. But with a bumper harvest of 34.6 million 
bags, Brazil actually shipped a record 21 million bags. 
</P>
<P>
	For the current year, Brazil's share of exports is expected to  
remain at 15 million bags, even though its harvest shrank to 24.8 
million bags.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's governing party has put $6.1 million  
spending limit on the four candidates for its first-ever 
presidential primary -- but will not punish candidates who violate 
the limits, Mexican media reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission overseeing the primary process for the  
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, set limits of $4.7 
million in monetary contributions and 13 million pesos $1.4 million 
for other donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The party won't limit the amount an individual can contribute,  
but will require that the candidates report the information. 
</P>
<P>
	The PRI, which has governed Mexico for its entire 70-year  
history, will select its nominee for the 2000 presidential election 
in a November primary. Previously, PRI candidates were selected by 
the outgoing president. 
</P>

spending limits in the 1994 presidential election.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A hospital in southeastern Brazil said  
Wednesday it may have erroneously informed more than 100 people 
that they had AIDS after it discovered that five of them were not 
infected with the deadly HIV virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hospital das Clinicas in Belo Horizonte, 340 miles northeast  
of Sao Paulo, said of the 540 people that tested positive between 
August 1998 and May 1999, 120 may not be infected at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinical director, Dr. Henrique Gama Torres said the results of  
the other 420 who tested positive in earlier tests at the hospital 
or in independent labs, ``were reconfirmed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torres said HIV positive and healthy blood samples may have been  
mixed together in the lab due to human error.

	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A Dallas man has abandoned his  
second attempt to make a 3,100-mile trip to Hawaii on a wooden 
raft, after the raft was unable to withstand bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-man crew led by John Haslett of Dallas left Friday night  
from Costa Rica's Pacific coast in an attempt to trace a route 
believed to have been used by a pre-Columbian tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a night of heavy storms, the raft was forced onto a  
rocky reef and was destroyed,'' Haslett's wife, Annie, told The 
Associated Press in an e-mail message Tuesday. ``With no finances 
and time left in the schedules of the crew, the expedition has been 
called off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 46-foot raft, named ``La Endurancia'', was made of balsa  
wood, bamboo, hemp strands and two canvas sails. It was a close 
replica to that used by the Mantenos, a little-known tribe dating 
back to 500 B.C. that lived in what is now Ecuador. Some scholars 
believe that the Mantenos had a maritime empire that traded with 
the Aztecs in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Haslett was inspired by Thor Heyerdahl, the Norwegian  
ethnographer who described his 1947 raft crossing from Peru to 
Polynesia in the book ``Kon Tiki.''

<HEADLINE> Fleet Meeting Draws Hundreds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Lunita Mustafa burst into tears as she spoke of  
her fear that the acquisition of BankBoston by Fleet would result 
in a megabank uninterested in providing services to people in 
low-income neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Rarely does a discussion of banking inspire such emotion, but  
Mustafa worries a decline in low-income mortgages would cut the 
number of homeowners working to keep her neighborhood safe and 
vibrant. Crime and violence can plague neighborhoods of renters who 
don't live in one place long enough to take pride in it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five years ago there was a wild beast in our community and it  
was devouring our children,'' said Mustafa, of Boston's Mattapan 
neighborhood. ``Today, I hear they're going to unleash that beast 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mustafa joined hundreds of homeowners, politicians and activists  
Wednesday who expressed their concerns to the Federal Reserve Board 
about the possible repercussions of the proposed merger between 
Fleet Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp., which would create 
the nation's eighth-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the most vocal critics of the merger accused Fleet, in  
particular, of having a lackluster track record of lending in 
low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut Treasurer Denise L. Nappier said that in the wake of  
Fleet's 1995 acquisition of Shawmut National Corp., loans to low- 
and moderate-income borrowers in her state have been halved. 
</P>
<P>
	She also noted that many of the branches the banks plan to sell  
off to meet antitrust requirements are in poor neighborhoods, and 
she worried that some could be closed down. 
</P>
<P>
	And the attorneys general of Massachusetts and Connecticut told  
the board they were concerned the combined company, to be known as 
Fleet Boston, would stifle competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``This proposed merger would create a behemoth,'' said  
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who spoke of the 
deal's ``enormous peril and threat to competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bank executives said the $16 billion deal was prompted by a  
desire to maintain a New England-controlled bank in a rapidly 
consolidating industry. They said combining the two banks would 
reduce costs and lead to better service. 
</P>
<P>
	``By increasing in size, banks achieve the economies of scale  
that allow us to invest more in technology and people, so that we 
can develop superior products and services,'' said Terry Murray, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Fleet Financial Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank officials also pointed to a program they say will put $14.6  
billion into neighborhoods over five years, mostly through small 
business lending, affordable housing and community development 
lending programs in the seven states where the combined bank would 
do business. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks currently have a total of 1,625 branches in  
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire, New 
York and New Jersey. The two banks plan to sell 292 New England 
branches to comply with federal antitrust requirements.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Returns to the Ring Oct. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson's calendar has been finalized for  
the rest of the year. Now he needs to line up a few opponents for 
his latest comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will return to the ring Oct. 2 in Las Vegas for his first  
fight since stopping Francois Botha in the fifth round Jan. 17, his 
manager said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well in that bout, manager Shelly Finkel told The  
Associated Press that Tyson would fight again Dec. 11 on a 
pay-per-view card. Both fights would be held at the MGM Grand 
hotel-casino in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	No opponents have been selected for either fight, but possible  
opponents for Oct. 2 include Zeljko Mavrovic of Croatia or Axel 
Schulz of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the MGM Grand confirmed that the Oct. 2 date was  
``the next available date we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first fight would be televised on the Showtime cable  
network. It would be Tyson's first non pay-per-view fight since he 
stopped Buster Mathis Jr. on the Fox network on Dec. 16, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming Tyson wins, he is scheduled to fight a pay-per-view  
fight Dec. 11, with an upgraded opponent along the lines of Andrew 
Golota or Shannon Briggs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old former heavyweight champion has fought only once  
-- against Botha -- since his infamous biting of Evander Holyfield's 
ears ended their fight in the third round June 28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The most feared heavyweight of his time in the late 1980s, Tyson  
has fought only 12 times in the last decade. He is 9-3 in those 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has been in Phoenix since last month, shedding pounds to  
get ready for the boxing portion of his training that will begin 
sometime in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson weighed the heaviest of his career when he fought Botha,  
223 pounds, and reportedly weighed 275 pounds when he was released 
from a Maryland prison May 24 after his latest jailing for 
attacking two men following a traffic altercation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Finkel said Tyson will continue to be promoted by  
Denver-based America Presents, which promoted his comeback fight 
against Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who split with promoter Don King after accusing him of  
taking more than $100 million in his earnings, had a two-fight deal 
with America Presents that was signed after he got his boxing 
license back in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Finkel said a new contract expected to be signed this week ties  
the former champion to America Presents for another four fights.

<HEADLINE> More Air Passengers Getting 'Bumped' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline passengers buy their tickets with the  
expectation they're assured seats on the flights they want, but, 
more and more, airlines are ``bumping'' them because of 
overbooking. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first three months of this year, Delta Air Lines led the  
way, with 8,144 passengers knocked off their expected flight -- 
nearly as many as the other nine major carriers combined, according 
to new Transportation Department statistics. United Air Lines had 
the second highest total, with 2,142 passengers bumped, and 
Southwest Airlines was third, with 1,938 passengers bumped. 
</P>
<P>
	During the same period in 1998, Delta again had the worst  
record, but with only 2,736 passengers involuntarily bumped. 
</P>
<P>
	Involuntary bumpings occur when an airline oversells seats on a  
flight to guard against passengers who don't show up, but then 
can't find enough volunteers to give up their seats and take a 
later flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines contend the longstanding practice benefits the  
consumer, because overbooking allows them to keep flights full and 
airfares down. An average of 10-15 percent of the passengers 
holding a ticket for a flight never show up at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	On occasions when most everyone does, passengers often volunteer  
to get off because carriers offer inducements such as a first-class 
upgrade on another flight or a voucher for free travel in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overbooking allows us to utilize and offer seats that  
would otherwise be perishable,'' said Tim Smith, a spokesman for 
American Airlines, which has one of the lowest rates of involuntary 
bumpings. ``Once that seat leaves the gate empty, it can never be 
sold again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delta acknowledged Wednesday that it has had problems correctly  
forecasting its passenger loads. The airline has put a high-level 
management team on the issue. It has also ordered new passenger 
forecasting software and created a team to identify problematic 
flights each day and then minimize involuntary bumpings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fully intend to significantly reduce involuntary bookings  
to an acceptable level. That is a corporate goal,'' said airline 
spokesman John Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Kennedy noted that the overall number of passengers  
affected is small and that Delta has improved significantly in 
other areas important to travelers, such as on-time performance and 
baggage handling. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Transportation Department policy, airlines can't  
deny a passenger a seat without first asking for volunteers to get 
off a flight that is overbooked. The department also outlines a 
compensation plan for those who end up being involuntarily bumped. 
</P>
<P>
	If the passenger is placed on another flight and arrives within  
an hour of his original arrival time, there is no compensation 
required. If the passenger arrives between one and two hours late, 
the airline must pay the passenger a penalty equal to the cost of 
his ticket, up to a maximum of $200. If the passenger arrives more 
than two hours late, the penalty is double the price of the ticket, 
up to a maximum of $400. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines have different ways of deciding who gets bumped. Most  
accommodate passengers on a first-come, first-served basis, but 
some will seat their first- and business-class customers before 
taking care of those with a coach ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in overbookings comes at a time when passenger  
complaints are on the rise. According to the same statistics, the 
major airlines averaged 2.47 complaints per 100,000 passengers in 
May, up from 1.15 complaints in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	American led the way in that category, with 3.70 complaints per  
100,000 passengers. Delta had the second-best record, with 1.82 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the American spokesman, said the carrier was plagued by  
air traffic control problems at its hubs in Dallas and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mean to minimize those who complain, ... but you have  
to put this in perspective,'' Smith said. ``The headline reads 
`doubled' or `tripled' the number of complaints, but you can get a 
very impressive level of change when you're dealing with a small 
number to start with.''

<HEADLINE> Cool Front Breaks Heat Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three days of broiling heat that killed 23  
people in the East and Midwest gave way to cooler weather 
Wednesday, bringing relief to hundreds of thousands of New York 
City residents who spent the night in a blackout. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated Edison, the city's power utility, blamed the huge  
outage on massive use of air conditioners and fans. Most people had 
power restored by Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day heat spell, beginning Sunday, brought wilting  
humidity and record temperatures over 100 degrees to many urban 
areas. A cold front finally brought lower temperatures to much of 
the region. Temperatures in Concord, N.H., dropped 19 degrees in 
just four minutes when the front arrived there. 
</P>
<P>
	The front reached New York during the night, reducing the city's  
high on Wednesday afternoon to 91 degrees with 27 percent humidity. 
The day before, the thermometer hit a record 101 and nearly double 
the humidity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten deaths in New York City were blamed on the weather.  
Pennsylvania listed seven heat-related deaths, New Jersey four, and 
Illinois two. 
</P>
<P>
	As utilities reported scattered blackouts in the East, Con Ed  
shut off the power to upper Manhattan late Tuesday after 
high-voltage cables burned out and a small fire damaged a 
substation. The move plunged the area in darkness and robbed people 
of their ability to keep cool. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani jumped on Con Ed, accusing it of not  
being prepared for the emergency and threatening to sue for the 
cost of the 500 police officers sent to patrol against looting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in an age of high technology. We're a city that has  
predictably high usage of electricity in warm weather,'' Giuliani 
said. ``I mean everybody can figure that out, right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people slept outside, on fire escapes and sidewalks,  
because their apartments were too hot. 
</P>
<P>
	Police reported just nine arrests and only a handful of stores  
broken into, in contrast to the widespread looting and arson during 
the citywide blackout in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Many stores in the area blacked out Tuesday night were unable to  
open Wednesday, and many lost perishable merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	At a grocery called La Mundial, chickens thawed quickly as the  
temperature topped 70 degrees in the basement freezer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to lose all the meat,'' said Reso Infante, manager  
of La Mundial. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers also saw big losses.  
</P>
<P>
	At Seaford, Del., Allen Family Foods Inc. lost 33,000 chickens  
from Saturday through Monday, said Tom David, director of live 
operations. The company has more than 20 million birds in the field 
at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
	Salisbury, Md.,-based Perdue Farms Inc., which bills itself as  
the nation's third-largest poultry producer, said it had not 
tallied its losses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the area's growers produced more than 600 million birds  
last year and it would take a loss of millions of birds to affect 
the price of poultry, said Bill Satterfield, executive director of 
the Delmarva Poultry Industry Inc in Georgetown, Del.

<HEADLINE> Lott Holds Up Holbrooke Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott himself is  
among three senators now blocking the long-delayed nomination of 
Richard Holbrooke to be U.N. ambassador, congressional and 
administration officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are doing it secretly,  
said the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Sen. 
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, is the third, but he announced his 
``hold'' on the veteran diplomat's nomination late last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., and McConnell are using the delaying technique to  
apply pressure on the White House to nominate an Ohio law professor 
for a position on the Federal Election Commission, said the 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The professor, Bradley A. Smith of Capital University in  
Columbus, had been recommended by Republican Senate leaders for a 
Republican vacancy on the commission, which is evenly divided 
between Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, their recommendation likely would be accepted.  
But Common Cause and other public-interest groups have waged a 
campaign to persuade President Clinton not to make the nomination, 
saying Smith's writings demonstrate hostility to campaign-finance 
laws he would be sworn to uphold. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell is chairman of the Senate GOP committee that helps  
elect Republicans to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for neither Lott nor McConnell could be reached today  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said last week said that Holbrooke's nomination ``has some  
problems right now,'' and his spokesman, John Czwartacki, cited 
``irreconcilable holds'' on the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	However, until now, only the identity of Grassley had been known  
among those blocking the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	By Senate tradition, any senator can block a nomination, at  
least temporarily, by putting a ``hold'' on it, which can be 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, who has sought to overhaul that practice by requiring  
senators to announce such holds publicly, is blocking the 
nomination for a different reason. He contends that a government 
official who worked at the U.N. mission in New York was demoted and 
transferred to a lesser job in Washington in retaliation for her 
telling members of Congress about waste and inefficiency at the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has said that the official, Linda Shenwick,  
was reassigned because of unsatisfactory job performance, not 
because she was a whistle-blower. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Grassley, Jill Kozeny, said today that  
``nothing has changed'' and that the Grassley hold remains. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``holds'' are just the latest obstacles in the course of  
Holbrooke's more than yearlong effort to win confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of that delay was caused by the administration's own ethics  
background investigations into Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was approved last week by the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Heart Surgeon Lillehei Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Dr. C. Walton Lillehei, who was regarded  
as the father of open heart surgery and trained hundreds of other 
surgeons including Dr. Christiaan Barnard, has died of cancer. He 
was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Lillehei, who died Monday, created many innovative heart surgery  
techniques during the 1950s while a surgery professor at the 
University of Minnesota. He also served several years beginning in 
1967 as chairman of the Department of Surgery at the Cornell 
Medical Center-New York Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 2, 1952, Lillehei and 5-year-old Jackie Johnson, who  
suffered from a life-threatening heart defect, made medical history 
when the little girl became the first person to successfully 
undergo open-heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Before then, repairs were impossible because doctors lacked the  
ability to stop circulation safely so they could work inside the 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons took 19 hours to lower her body temperature 17 degrees,  
wrapping her in rubber blankets that conducted a cold alcohol 
solution. They cut off all blood flow in her body for 5 1/2 minutes 
while they worked inside the heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year 500,000 open-heart operations were done worldwide,''  
Lillehei said at a 1987 reunion with his patient, by then known as 
Jackie Johnson Weeks. ``That's about 2,000 a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not only a doctor, he was just the nicest person,''  
said Pam Stacherski of Andover, who underwent similar heart-repair 
surgery at age 4 in 1954. She will turn 50 on Friday. ``Without 
him, I wouldn't have lasted probably six more months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, Lillehei led researchers in developing a machine to  
oxygenate blood and pump it through the patient's body, making 
open-heart surgery easier and ultimately making heart-transplant 
surgery possible. 
</P>
<P>
	His pupil Barnard gained worldwide fame when he performed the  
first human heart transplant in 1967, in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris generously admits that I taught him everything he knows  
about cardiac surgery,'' Lillehei once quipped. ``I have to remind 
him periodically that I haven't taught him everything I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, Lillehei worked with Medtronic Inc. cofounder Earl  
Bakken to develop the first wearable pacemaker for patients with 
chronic complete heart block. He also contributed to the design of 
four artificial heart valves, including the widely used St. Jude 
Medical Mechanical Heart Valve. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world doesn't have enough heroes today, and I hope in his  
death people recognize him that way,'' said Medtronic Vice Chairman 
Glen Nelson, another former student of Lillehei's. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, Lillehei's image was tarnished when he was found guilty  
of tax evasion. He was fined $50,000 and ordered to serve six 
months of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, at age 55, Lillehei had to give up surgery  
when he developed cataracts, losing the keen eyesight needed for 
such meticulous work. He turned to writing and administration, 
continuing to lecture on open heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Lillehei is survived by his wife, Kaye, and three children.

<HEADLINE> Hard Sell Is On at Steelcase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- With a half-dozen employees of  
BlueCross BlueShield of Alabama visiting Steelcase Inc. 
headquarters in search of desks, chairs and cubicles, the hard sell 
was on. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest office furniture maker had flown the group  
in on a Steelcase corporate jet for a day of tours and a lunch 
featuring dishes such as pear and duck salad and mussels and 
mushroom fettuccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lunch, amenities ... are a way of saying thank you to the  
customer for investing the time to come,'' says Steelcase sales 
consultant Jeff Schutte. ``We want them to see our products are 
superb ... and our services are outstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high-class treatment is routine for big customers. But these  
days, in a time of uncertainty for the office furniture industry, 
each order from those big customers is especially important. 
</P>
<P>
	After seven years of strong growth, sales in the $12 billion  
domestically produced office furniture industry have softened. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dilbert may think that every employee works in a cubicle,  
it's clear that the industry is changing. There is a 
diversification in business demographics, and fiercer competition 
from cheaper refurbished furniture and ready-to-assemble furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Olson, a Grand Rapids investor and writer who works out of  
his home, says he looked at Steelcase but ended up buying his 
office furniture from Office Depot. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the low prices, lack of sales pressure and the quality  
of the ready-to-assemble furniture, as well as its immediate 
availability, convinced him. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a home office it always seems like my needs are  
changing,'' he says. ``It's easier to think about pitching a $500 
desk than a $3,000 desk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steelcase makes 20 percent of the desks, chairs and other office  
furniture sold in the United States. It employs about 19,000 people 
worldwide, but nearly 200 workers voluntarily took several weeks 
off with pay earlier this year as part of a cost-cutting measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest sales figures show the company may be back on track.  
It saw sales reach $691.8 million for the quarter that ended in 
late May, an increase of 2.9 percent in comparison to a year ago. 
It was also an improvement from the quarter that ended Feb. 26, 
when sales were $678.6 million, down 3 percent from the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, no one is certain whether the rebound will last.  
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Herman Miller Inc. of Zeeland, Mich., had poorer results.  
Net sales for the quarter were $432.4 million compared with $465.3 
million a year earlier. New orders for the quarter were $447.6 
million compared with $460.8 million for the same quarter of last 
year. The company employs about 8,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately held Haworth Inc. of Holland, Mich., at No. 3, has  
also reported a slackening in sales. It employs 10,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelcase chief executive Jim Hackett primarily blames the  
uncertainty on the mega-mergers of 1998 and believes the big 
companies are waiting until the dust settles before making any 
major commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelcase last year unveiled Pathways, a high-tech office  
furniture system designed to aesthetically and ergonomically 
integrate furniture and architecture with the computers cables and 
other equipment found in today's offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem: The Fortune 500 companies that can appreciate and  
afford Pathways aren't buying much of anything right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say Pathways has been hurt. But it hasn't probably  
taken off at the level it could have, had the Fortune 500 companies 
not been in their funk,'' Schutte says. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Steelcase has continued efforts to broaden its  
customer base. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Steelcase unveiled a Web site designed to make it  
easier for its network of dealers to sell furniture. Haworth's 
Internet site is similar, while Herman Miller uses its Web site to 
sell furniture directly to the public, with an emphasis on home 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a part of the market our industry has never served,''  
says Mark Schurman, a Herman Miller spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also emphasis at Steelcase on Revest, the refurbished  
furniture business Steelcase acquired 10 years ago. Haworth and 
Herman Miller also have refurbished furniture programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Revest's) customers would be smaller businesses who want to  
grow their business but want to use their cash for products and 
service, not necessarily their furniture,'' says Steelcase 
spokesman Peter Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts believe that after record sales growth of 14  
percent in 1997, an industry slowdown was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Still, it's a little perplexing ... overall economic signs are  
still very strong, very positive ... in essence the economy is 
booming,'' says Tom Reardon, executive director of BIFMA, the 
Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association. 
</P>
<P>
	BIFMA predicts the industry will grow between 1 percent and 3  
percent this year and between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to keep this in perspective -- the sky is not  
falling in, it's not the end of the world,'' Reardon says. 
</P>
<P>
	And some believe leaner companies may eventually work to the  
industry's advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies have to find ways to gain efficiency and to increase  
worker morale,'' says Jerry Johanneson, Haworth's president and 
CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend I've seen ... is they're rearranging the work area  
... using technology to improve work space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States continues ... to see more people working in  
white-collar jobs,'' says David Manthey, an analyst with Robert W. 
Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. ``Everyone needs a place to sit, so 
office furniture will continue to grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steelcase's stock is selling for about $20 per share on the New  
York Stock Exchange. It had dropped to $12.75 per share after 
fetching more than $35 after its initial public offering last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman Miller has also seen a resurgence in its stock, which in  
the past year has fluctuated from about $16 to $30.75. It now 
trades at about $24 a share on the Nasdaq exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the office furniture companies' growth likely will  
depend on their ability to develop new business while maintaining 
more traditional clients, like BlueCross BlueShield of Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurer already uses Steelcase products, but manager Jim  
Wright says the company will also consider the price and quality of 
furniture made by Herman Miller, Haworth and others before making a 
final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of the Steelcase visit was to find what new  
products are out there furniture-wise,'' Wright said. ``This was a 
fact-finding mission.''

<HEADLINE> Case Against Gay Journalist Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A judge has dismissed the case against  
a gay journalist accused of using the Internet to solicit sex from 
a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Rudolph Loncke on Wednesday dismissed the charge that  
Bruce Mirken attempted to perform a lewd and lascivious act on a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge agreed with the defense that there was insufficient  
evidence against Mirken, 42, who would have faced up to four years 
in prison if convicted. The journalist argued that he was merely 
doing research for a story. 
</P>
<P>
	``This prosecutor's case was a fraud from day one,'' Mirken  
said. ``They knew they didn't have a case and yet they put it on 
anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirken later cursed at the prosecutor, who did not respond to  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely disappointed and saddened that this court would  
take this matter out of the sound judgment of the jury,'' 
prosecutor Perry Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police started investigating Mirken after he answered an  
electronic message they posted in a chat room, posing as a boy 
named Anthony. Anthony's message said he was looking for an adult 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirken was arrested last July in a Sacramento park where he went  
to meet who he thought would be the 13-year-old Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
	He was instead met by an undercover police officer taking part  
in a sting operation that had tracked Mirken's e-mail and telephone 
conversations with investigators masquerading as the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirken, whose stories about gay and lesbian culture have  
appeared in publications across the country, contends he 
corresponded with the boy hoping to write an investigative story 
about troubled gay youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said, however, that recorded conversations and  
e-mail records between Mirken -- who used the screen name 
``Luvboys343'' -- and the boy were sexually charged and filled with 
flirtatious questions such as, ``Do you skinny-dip?'' and ``Does 
your mother come home during lunch?''

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Two sergeants are charged with having sex  
with four female students at Brooks Air Force Base, with one 
accused of giving advance copies of tests to two women. 
</P>
<P>
	Master Sgt. Mark E. Gibson and Tech. Sgt. Apolinar Paul Bernal  
have been accused of ``unprofessional relationships'' with a total 
of seven women, all recent basic training graduates from Lackland 
Air Force Base, Brooks spokeswoman Maj. Erin Campbell said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernal, a Gulf War veteran with 17 years in the Air Force, is

<HEADLINE> Trash Hauler's Stock Tumbles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Stock of Waste Management Inc. plunged today  
after the nation's largest trash hauler disclosed it anticipates 
second quarter and annual earnings to be at least 10 percent lower 
than Wall Steet expects. 
</P>
<P>
	At noontime, Waste Management stock was off 36.6 percent from  
Tuesday's close, falling $19.62 1/2 to $33.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced Tuesday after the stock market closed it  
expects a $250 million shortfall in its solid waste operations 
projects and said that will produce second quarter earnings of 
between 67 cents and 70 cents per share, well shy of the 78 cents 
expected by analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Waste Management expects earnings to be in the  
$2.65 to $2.70 per share range, short of analysts' $3.02 
expectation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, both totals will mark increases from last year, when  
Waste Management earned 41 cents for the second quarter and $1.82 
for the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we are disappointed with the revised projections, we  
remain proud of our accomplishments over the past 12 months,'' 
Waste Management chief executive Rodney Proto said in a prepared 
release. ``And the fact that the new full-year 1999 earnings 
expectation still represents a minimum of 46 percent improvement 
over comparable 1998 results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company is investigating why business has slacked off and  
will provide more details when earnings are formally reported Aug. 
3, Proto said. Revenues weakened toward the end of the quarter and 
the shortfall will ``similarly impact'' future quarters, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management had $12.7 billion in revenues last year.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Houston-based USA Waste Services and Oak Brook,  
Ill.-based Waste Management Inc. combined in a $13.5 billion 
merger, which created largest U.S. trash hauler. The new company is 
based in Houston.

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Soybeans Up; Corn Mostly Off / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and soybean futures advanced Wednesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn futures finished mostly 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat and soybeans bounced higher, recovering from sharp losses  
a day earlier, as investors consolidated their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans are expected to face continued downward pressure in  
coming days, however, from expectations for a bumper crop. The 
government already is predicting this year's production will set a 
new record, but some agronomists are predicting the near-ideal 
growing weather will boost that figure even more. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures saw light buying despite continued harvesting of  
the winter wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures succumbed, however, after the U.S. Agriculture  
Department reported 77 percent of the nation's crop was in good to 
excellent condition as of last week. That's up from the 66 percent 
reported at this time a year ago, which helped reinforce 
perceptions that fall production will be larger than originally 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers also were reporting phenomenal growth and few pest  
problems in Illinois and Iowa, the two largest corn-growing states. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for September delivery rose 2 cents to $2.49 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.04 1/4 a bushel; December oats rose 1 
cent to $1.09 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1 cent to $4.22 1/2 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .52 cent to 62.35 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .53 cent to 76.82 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose 2 cents to 46.50 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose 
1.25 cents to 36.97 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Posts Profit Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. reported second-quarter profits  
and revenues that easily beat Wall Street expectations on 
Wednesday, helped by a sharp increase in visitors to its leading 
network of Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the cost of buying Internet companies such as  
GeoCities, Yahoo! said it earned $28.3 million, or 11 cents a 
share, in the quarter ended June 30. That was up from a profit of 
$1.5 million, or 1 cent a share, in the second quarter of 1998, 
also excluding one-time charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues soared 156 percent to $115.2 million from $45 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The results easily beat the 8-cents-a-share profit and $103  
million revenue forecast by Wall Street analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the expense of acquisitions, the Santa Clara,  
Calif.-based Yahoo! lost $15 million, up slightly from the $14.3 
million it lost in the same period the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were pleasantly surprised,'' said Tim Koogle, company chief  
executive officer. His explanation was simple: ``We've got a big 
audience and they're consuming a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But few investors seemed to care about red ink at Yahoo!, whose  
market cap totals $34.1 billion. In after-hours trading, Yahoo!'s 
stock rose to $172.75, up from $167.08 1/4 at the close of the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. Yahoo! stock had fallen $8.06 1/4, or 5 percent, in 
profit-taking ahead of the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo's earnings reflected exponential growth at the company.  
Excluding one-time charges, net income for the first six months of 
1999 was $48.2 million, or 18 cents a share, up from $1 million, or 
zero cents a share, for the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, more than 80 million people visited the Yahoo! network  
of Web sites. Combined traffic on Yahoo!'s network increased to an 
average of 310 million page views per day, up from 235 million in 
March 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, whose network of sites is the most frequently visited,  
features everything from chat rooms to news and search services.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Brazil Reach Steel Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Brazilian steel industry will avoid  
punitive tariffs by voluntarily reducing shipments to the United 
States of a core product, U.S. officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil and its producers also agreed to quotas on hot-rolled  
carbon steel and to minimum prices set above those currently 
prevailing in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements between the U.S. and Brazilian governments,  
reached hours before a midnight Tuesday deadline, would suspend the 
U.S. industry's tariff petitions. Commerce Secretary William M. 
Daley called the agreement ``good for the U.S. steel industry and 
steelworkers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the restrictions on Brazil would provide certainty in  
the market and eliminate the ability of Brazilian firms to sell 
steel in the United States at cut-rate prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The domestic steel industry sought tariffs against Brazil and  
other countries to combat a flood of low-priced imports, which the 
industry blames for thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. International Trade Commission, in a 5-1  
ruling, approved tariffs of as much as 71 percent on one type of 
stainless steel from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South 
Korea, Taiwan and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The product, sold in flat sheets rolled up like carpet, is used  
in kitchen sinks, dishwashers and other appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreements announced Wednesday, Brazil will reduce  
hot-rolled shipments by about 28 percent and accept 12-month quotas 
of 295,000 metric tons. No shipment will be allowed before Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilian producers also agreed to charge U.S. customers of that  
product at least $327 per metric ton, which is above the prevailing 
U.S. price of about $300. The Brazilian floor price would be 
adjusted quarterly if the U.S. market price increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Some U.S. industry officials have complained their legal rights  
to seek tariffs are compromised through such deals, and major steel 
companies and the United Steelworkers of America threatened legal 
challenges Wednesday to the agreements. Other companies supported 
the agreements after changes were made to establish the minimum 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department, in announcing the agreements, concluded  
that Brazil unlawfully subsidized its producers and that the 
producers unfairly dumped hot-rolled steel in the United States at 
prices below production costs and home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the agreements, Brazilian producers would have faced  
tariffs ranging from 48 percent to 53 percent.

<HEADLINE> Oil Producers Raise Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Independent oil man Ted Collins says you can tell  
that oil prices are rising just by walking down the street in 
Midland, an oil town in West Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see a better mood and a smile on a few people's faces,''  
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past seven months, the price of oil has nearly doubled  
and is now flirting with $20 per barrel for the first time in 19 
months. After a year of belt-tightening, consolidations and layoffs 
-- 14,200 in Texas alone since May 1998, according to state labor 
officials -- energy companies are beginning to spend more freely on 
exploration. 
</P>
<P>
	But they are being cautious before reversing thousands of  
layoffs. Michael Mayer, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co., said many 
jobs lost due to mergers will never be replaced. The biggest 
mergers joined Exxon with Mobil and British Petroleum with Amoco. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller companies, such as Fort Worth-based Cross Timbers Oil  
Co. are increasing development budgets in light of the recovery in 
oil prices. Spending plans for the year were raised from $60 
million to a range of $70 million to $90 million, said chief 
financial officer Louis Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an inventory of projects that go out three or four  
years. With improved prices, we're going to execute more of those 
than we had planned this year,'' Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Enron Oil &AMP; Gas Co. in Houston said that if cash flow improves,  
its exploration spending will be at the higher end of its budget 
range of $575 million to $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry giants, however, have not announced increases in  
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon Corp., which increased its exploration spending from $8.8  
billion to $10 billion last year, has said it will not increase 
spending this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil has been trading at 19-month highs on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange and briefly shot above $20 a barrel on Tuesday. 
In trading Wednesday, the contract for August delivery of light, 
sweet crude oil was little changed, dipping 1 cent to close at 
$19.77 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices sank to a 12-year low in December 1998, dropping as far  
as $10.65 a barrel on the Nymex, as markets were awash with oil and 
demand was reduced because of economic crises spreading from Asia. 
The recovery in oil prices has come as the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers adopted 
substantial cuts in output and apparently stuck to them, and as 
Asian economies began to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas oil producers remain skeptical about the recovery in  
prices after a prolonged slump. Many worry openly about the central 
role of OPEC, which until recently has failed to enforce oil-output 
limits on members. 
</P>
<P>
	Exploration activity, meantime, remains far below levels of  
oil's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry had a record 4,530 drilling rigs in use nationwide  
in December 1981. That plunged to an all-time low of 498 in April 
before recovering somewhat to 580 last week, according to Baker 
Hughes, which has been keeping count of active oil-drilling rigs 
since 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not seeing any new drilling yet, and that's where the  
jobs are,'' said Morris Burns, executive vice president of the 
Permian Basin Petroleum Association in Midland. He said most 
activity this summer in West Texas has consisted of workovers -- 
resuming production in old wells.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Announces 6.1 Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's economy grew by 6.1 percent during the  
first half of 1999, a top Cuban official reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The island nation has been struggling for economic  
self-sufficiency after losing Soviet aid and trade in the early 
1990s with the fall of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually all of the productive sectors have grown, which  
confirms and reaffirms that the economy recovery started in at the 
beginning of 1995,'' Vice President Carlos Lage said in comments 
published in the Communist Party daily Granma. ``It puts us in a 
situation to more than fulfill the growth of 2.5 percent that we 
have proposed for the present year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism, which in recent years has become one of Cuba's most  
important sources of hard currency, has benefited by a 23 percent 
increase in visitors this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sugar industry, for centuries the island nation's most  
important export, is slowly recovering after several years of 
painfully small harvests, he said. The sugar industry grew 23.4 
percent during the first six months of 1999, Lage reported. 
</P>
<P>
	During the same period, the government created 12,000 new jobs,  
he said.

<HEADLINE> China Soccer Star Has Many Talents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- Many fathers in China would frown on  
the idea of their daughter romping around a field kicking a ball. 
Sun Wen's dad, Sun Zhong Gao, thought differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most fathers in China cannot accept girls playing soccer. It's  
the culture,'' Sun Wen said. ``Girls are supposed to be shy and 
steady and not so active. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father was a real soccer fan, a former player, and he  
encouraged me to play. I started to play when I was 10 and started 
regular training when I was 13.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, who grew up to be a magician with a soccer ball at her  
feet, has become one of the finest players in the world. She tops 
this year's World Cup scoring with seven goals and will lead China 
into Saturday's championship game at the Rose Bowl against the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father is very proud now,'' Sun, 26, said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fact that not many young girls were encouraged to  
take up the game, China has built an extremely good team. To reach 
the final, they routed defending World Cup champion Norway 5-0 in 
the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, speaking through an interpreter, said the women's team has  
sparked great interest in China, with all its World Cup games 
televised there. 
</P>
<P>
	She believes the attitude that girls shouldn't play the game is  
changing, and a World Cup championship could make a dramatic 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very, very important that we win now, for ourselves and  
for China,'' she said Tuesday after the Chinese squad held a brief 
workout at Pomona-Pitzer college. 
</P>
<P>
	China was host of the first Women's World Cup, in 1991, but the  
fans' interest there waned dramatically when the home team lost in 
the quarterfinals of the tournament won by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun has been impressed by the World Cup crowds this year, which  
have included many Chinese fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we felt like we were the home team,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rose Bowl will have a sellout crowd approaching 90,000 for  
the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing,'' Sun said. ``This is a very good place for  
women's soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sun would consider playing in the United States if plans to  
begin a women's professional league in 2001 materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best soccer can be played on a professional level,'' she  
said. ``The best environment for soccer now is in the U.S. So, 
yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, quick to smile and laugh, is a university student in her  
hometown of Shanghai. She writes poetry and loves to grab a mike 
and sing ``Candle in the Wind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of her poetry has been published in newspapers, she said,  
and she enjoys karaoke, listing ``Can You Feel the Love Tonight'' 
and ``My Heart Will Go On'' also among her favorite songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sing them in English,'' she said. The interpreter added,  
``She is a very, very good singer in English.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those talents aside, U.S. coach Tony DiCicco is most concerned  
with Sun's skill with a soccer ball. He's considering marking her 
for the game, meaning he may assign one defender solely to stay on 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's an all-around great player,'' DiCicco said. ``She has  
such good vision, can find the open spots and get the ball to her 
teammates. And now she's really finishing, scoring a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's the focal point of their offense, and she's at the top  
of her game.''

<HEADLINE> Committee Proposes $113M in Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Olympic host city won't be dressed up  
with banners, and athletes won't have a game room after $113 
million in budget cuts to be proposed Thursday by the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	President Mitt Romney and chief operating officer Fraser Bullock  
said they'll ask the board's management committee to whack nearly 8 
percent from the $1.43 billion budget for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	It would mean that a $300 million shortfall in funding, made  
worse by this year's Olympic scandal, would be trimmed to $187 
million. ``We believe it's achievable,'' Bullock told the SLOC 
finance committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic organizers are going after corporate sponsors as well as  
donors to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts will be proposed in a management committee meeting  
Thursday but not voted on until September. The new budget would be 
$1.34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident we're not going to be leaving unpaid bills for  
taxpayers or anyone else,'' Romney said during a press conference 
Wednesday. ``We're back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed cuts -- more drastic than $84 million in cuts Romney  
proposed after just a few weeks on the job last spring -- stem from 
a dollar-by-dollar analysis of the budget, Bullock said. He joined 
the SLOC in April and also is chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea, Bullock said, was to slice everything out of the  
budget not necessary to putting on great games for the athletes and 
leaving a legacy for Utah's youth. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC's managers actually are proposing $169 million in cuts, but  
$56 million of those are offset by added costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of that was mistakes in the original budget written last  
year, but it also includes unforeseen expenses like $5 million in 
legal expenses because of the U.S. Justice Department's 
investigation of Salt Lake's bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives of the bid committee, the predecessor to the SLOC,  
have been accused of spending lavishly on International Olympic 
Committee members during the city's quest for the games, sparking 
scandal and now reform in the Olympic world. The Justice Department 
has been investigating for more than seven months but has brought 
no criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives also have tagged $72 million of the $113 million  
in proposed cuts as expenses they'd like to restore if the money 
can be found. The budget keeps a $136 million contingency in case 
expenses are higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed cutbacks are diverse.  
</P>
<P>
	There would be no information booths for spectators unless some  
group in the community steps forward, and the SLOC would spend $5 
million less on opening, closing and other ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC would cut $2.3 million out of its budget for housing  
games officials, including a portion of IOC members' rooms, and 
$300,000 out of the opening IOC session before the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Although an uproar from athletes caused Romney to back off from  
his earlier suggestion that the Utah Winter Sports Park be closed 
at long stretches before the Olympics, the park will skip building 
renovations and equipment purchases to save more than $3 million. 
The committee is scheduled to buy the park from the state July 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC will make only what publications are required under the  
host city contract, and those will be in black and white, Bullock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of test events -- athletic contests that give staffers  
a chance to practice -- will be cut from 56 to 52, and the full 
staff, including volunteers, will work at only 17 of those, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee hopes to save marketing costs by selling tickets  
via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Only those employees who really need to learn from the 2002  
Sydney, Australia games will attend, and when members of the 
Olympic community come to Utah, they can expect fewer dinners. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said the budget analysis has been good for pinpointing  
ways money doesn't need to be spent. For example, $5.4 million is 
proposed to be cut from the telecommunications budget, in part 
because a sponsor donated excess cellular phones that bus drivers 
can use rather than radios. 
</P>
<P>
	An expensive and sophisticated software program for tracking  
personnel, which has failed at two prior games, can be replaced 
with off-the-shelf business software, Bullock said. ``I said, 
`simplify, simplify, simplify.''' 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the cuts are proposed in two areas: getting  
rid of $38 million worth of inflation cushion and saving $30 
million in staff expenses, essentially 18 percent of what was 
budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said the committee hasn't yet put a number on the  
proposed staff size, since volunteers -- many of them executives on 
loan -- will replace workers and some of the savings comes in hiring 
people later than planned. The SLOC had expected to employ 750 when 
the games opened. 
</P>
<P>
	On the revenue side, Bullock said staff is considering selling  
more tickets. At present, 55 percent of the 1.6 million event 
tickets will be up for sale after the world's Olympic community and 
media use 45 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Though opening ceremony tickets will be steeply priced, 70  
percent of the tickets will be $100 or less, Bullock said. 
</P>
<P>
	And each night, the medals ceremony will be free.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we looked at the budget, we said, `Let's make sure we  
allow the citizens of Utah to participate,''' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cox To Buy AT&AMP;T Cable Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Cox Communications Inc. has agreed to swap its  
AT&AMP;T stock valued at $2.8 billion for AT&AMP;T-owned cable television 
systems in seven southern and western states. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced today, Cox also will receive $750  
million in other consideration, including cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on 50.3 million shares of AT&AMP;T stock, Cox will receive  
AT&AMP;T cable systems that serve 316,000 customers in Tulsa, Okla., 
and Baton Rouge, La.; AT&AMP;T's 20 percent stake in a partnership with 
TCA Cable that serves 62,000 customers in Texas, Louisiana and New 
Mexico; and Peak Cablevision, which has 117,000 customers in 
Oklahoma, Arkansas, Utah and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of cable assets is the second in a week for AT&AMP;T, which  
just sold its 50 percent stake in Bresnan Communications, a cable 
company with 690,000 customers in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan 
and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	The asset sales follow a busy year of purchases that have made  
AT&AMP;T the nation's biggest cable company and additional cable 
partnerships designed to fill in holes in a planned national 
telephone work using mostly cable TV wires. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Tuesday's closing price of $56 per share of AT&AMP;T stock,  
the transaction is valued at about $2.8 billion, or $4,230 per 
subscriber. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has been approved by both companies' boards but is  
subject to government and regulatory approvals. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Robbins, president and chief executive officer of  
Atlanta-based Cox, said the deal will allow Cox to pick up markets 
not covered by its $3.3 billion purchase of Texas-based TCA in May. 
</P>
<P>
	If both deals are approved, Cox said it will have about 5.5  
million customers nationwide, making it the nation's fifth largest 
cable provider.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Focuses on American Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- Paying the first presidential visit to  
an Indian reservation in 60 years, President Clinton today declared 
that the United States can no longer afford to ignore poverty and 
unemployment among American Indians. ``That is wrong, and we're 
trying to fix it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting Oglala Sioux on the Pine Ridge Reservation, Clinton  
seemed almost disbelieving as Geraldine Blue Bird, stifling tears, 
explained her living situation in a house and a nearby trailer. 
``You have 11 living in here and 17 in the other place,'' the 
president repeated. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal President Howard Salway said Blue Bird's Igloo  
neighborhood -- a collection of foam-green shacks with crumbling 
porches -- is typical of housing conditions on the reservation. ``In 
the winter, the hardship it puts on our people increases tenfold,'' 
he told Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the Oglala Lakota Nation before a large beige tepee  
in a courtyard at the reservation's high school, Clinton said it is 
time for a more respectful, empowering relationship with tribal 
governments. He sought to strike a conciliatory note by greeting 
the crowd by speaking a phrase in Lakota: ``Mita oyasni'' -- ``we 
are all related.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We know well the imperfect relationship that the United States  
and its government has enjoyed with the tribal nations,'' Clinton 
said. ``You have suffered from neglect and you know that doesn't 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Department of Agriculture would implement $16  
million in water projects throughout Indian lands, with two of 
those projects in Pine Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	``No community in America should be without safe running water  
and sewer systems,'' he said. ``That will also help you get jobs as 
well as improve the quality of life. ... These commitments we're 
making today are just the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Igloo neighborhood, Clinton saw a part of the  
reservation that has new housing secured with federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to find a way not only to fix the very difficult  
housing circumstances but also to get them jobs,'' he said, noting 
that while the national unemployment rate has been below 5 percent 
for two years, the jobless rate on the reservation is 75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his party were welcomed to Pine Ridge by Oglala  
leaders wearing traditional headdresses of eagle feathers. A group 
of Indians chanted and beat a large cowhide drum, and Millie Horn 
Cloud exchanged the 1868 treaty pipe with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Reciting the names of great Sioux leaders, including the  
legendary Crazy Horse, Salway characterized the visit as one 
between governments and reminded Clinton that there are 
``unresolved land issues with the federal government'' that must be 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am humbled by the leaders that have come before me, ... who  
have fought for our land,'' Salway said. ``I think these men would 
agree that this historic meeting with the United States president 
on our hallowed land will have a lasting impact for our people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The visit was part of Clinton's four-day, cross-country tour to  
highlight the plight of some of the nation's poorest areas and the 
``untapped markets'' in America's inner cities and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's visit -- the first to a reservation by a president  
since Franklin D. Roosevelt visited a Cherokee reservation in North 
Carolina on Sept. 9, 1936 -- called attention to American Indians, 
who are so raked by grinding poverty that his advisers suggested he 
come up with special proposals geared specifically to the Indians' 
plight. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pine Ridge, a scrolling marquee at Big Bat's Texaco expressed  
both joy over Clinton's visit and wariness of all the official 
attention: ``Welcome President Clinton. Remember Our Treaties,'' 
the sign read. 
</P>
<P>
	According to statistics from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of  
Indian Affairs, there are 1.43 million Indians living on or near 
reservations. Roughly 33 percent of them are children younger than 
15, and 38 percent of Indian children aged 6 to 11 live in poverty, 
compared with 18 percent for U.S. children of all other races 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from that, only 63 percent of Indians are high school  
graduates. Twenty-nine percent are homeless, and 59 percent live in 
substandard housing. Twenty percent of Indian households on 
reservations do not have full access to plumbing, and the majority 
-- 53.4 percent -- do not have telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	The per capita income of Indians living on reservations is far  
below that of other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	To begin addressing the housing problem, Clinton was announcing  
a partnership between the Treasury Department, the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, tribal governments and mortgage 
companies to help 1,000 Indians become homeowners over the next 
three years -- a small number that nonetheless would double the 
number of government-insured home mortgages issued on tribal lands. 
Under the effort, ``one-stop mortgage centers'' would be opened at 
Pine Ridge and on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona to help 
streamline the mortgage lending process. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban development, said  
special steps are needed to help Indians create and own houses 
because the nature of the land on which they live effectively shuts 
them out of conventional home loan processes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The land is held in trust. The bank doesn't want to take it as  
collateral because it's in trust,'' Cuomo said. ``So the main asset 
on the reservation -- the land -- can't even be used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, two of the country's largest municipal securities  
underwriters, Banc One Capital Markets and George K. Baum &AMP; Co., 
were committing to underwriting $300 million in bonds annually for 
five years to create a market for reservation mortgages. Those 
bonds would help raise $1.5 billion that could then be lent to 
tribes, tribal housing authorities and individuals for buying 
homes.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Catastrophe Claims Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. property/casualty insurers will pay about  
$3.25 billion to homeowners and businesses for property losses from 
13 catastrophic events in the second quarter of 1999, down from 
$4.5 billion for 16 catastrophic events in the same period a year 
ago, an industry group reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the industry's catastrophic losses in the second quarter  
stemmed from deadly tornadoes and tropical storms that moved 
through Oklahoma and 17 other states in early May, said Insurance 
Services Office Inc.'s Property Claims Services unit. Those storms 
cost $1.5 billion in property damage. Oklahoma sustained the 
biggest loss -- about $955 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of 1999, the insurance industry has paid  
about $5.1 billion on about 2.1 million claims for 18 catastrophic 
events, according to Insurance Services. That's about $460 million 
less than the $5.5 billion in losses in the first half of 1998.

<HEADLINE> N. American BMW Head Joining Ford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Victor Doolan, president of BMW of North America  
Inc., will resign at month's end to join a former BMW AG colleague 
who's overseeing Ford Motor Co.'s new luxury car group. 
</P>
<P>
	Doolan, 58, has been in charge of the German automaker's sales,  
distribution and marketing activities in the United States since 
1993. He announced his resignation Wednesday and Ford confirmed a 
short time later that he would join the world's No. 2 automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hired away by Wolfgang Reitzle, the former product  
development chief at BMW AG who joined Ford to run its premier 
automotive group in March. The unit is in charge of Ford's luxury 
brands: Lincoln, Jaguar, Volvo and Aston Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said Doolan's title will be executive director of North  
American marketing and distribution strategy. Spokesman John 
Spelich said he did not know where Doolan would be based. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW of North America said in a brief statement that Tom Purves,  
chairman and chief executive of BMW US Holding Corp., will serve as 
interim president until a successor is named for Doolan. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of high-performance sports and luxury cars has seen  
its U.S. sales double since Doolan was named president. Last week 
it reported its best first half ever, with sales up 17 percent over 
the first six months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle left BMW earlier this year in a management shakeup that  
also resulted in then-chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder's ouster. 
Reitzle had been considered Pischetsrieder's heir apparent at the 
German automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford president Jac Nasser has been bringing in more outside  
executive talent to Ford as it tries to strengthen its No. 2 
position worldwide and challenge the leadership of General Motors 
Corp. Like the other U.S.-based auto companies, Ford traditionally 
had promoted from within.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Better, But Doesn't Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Barry Bonds' injured groin was better Wednesday  
but the San Francisco Giants star did not start against the San 
Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds took batting practice and said he'd be available for  
emergency pinch-hitting duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bother me hitting,'' said Bonds, who pulled his  
right groin running out a grounder in the third inning of Tuesday 
night's 10-9 victory. ``It would have to be in a situation where I 
don't have to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds ran on a treadmill for about five minutes and went through  
other exercises before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine,'' Bonds said. ``I've never pulled a groin in my  
life. It's a joke. I can't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants are off Thursday before beginning a three-game home  
series against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds missed 47 games earlier this season after undergoing  
surgery on his left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants said closer Robb Nen will undergo an MRI Thursday on  
his right elbow to determine the treatment he'll receive during the 
All-Star break. Nen aggravated his elbow when a callous on his 
right thumb made him change his grip. Nen was named to the All-Star 
team but won't play because of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thing is to get it right,'' said Nen, tied for the NL lead  
with 21 saves. ``I'm gearing up for the second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Dusty Baker said Nen wouldn't be available Wednesday  
night.

<HEADLINE> Polish Filmmakers Adjust to Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LODZ, Poland (AP) -- A sprawling complex of decayed, concrete  
buildings in this sleepy town in central Poland hardly looks like 
the cradle of what was one of Soviet-dominated Europe's most 
vibrant film industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lodz (pronounced Woodge) Film Studio, nicknamed HollyLodz,  
produced classics of the intellectual genre that defined Polish 
cinema in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. Some of the biggest names, 
including Roman Polanski (``Chinatown,'' ``Rosemary's Baby'') and 
Krzysztof Kieslowski (``The Double Life of Veronique''), made early 
films there. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, much of the studio has been sold to keep it solvent, and  
an industry that used to turn out as many as 40 films a year on the 
state's bankroll makes about half that number, with the government 
covering 30 percent of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the rest of the nation, Polish filmmakers have been forced  
to adjust to political, economic and social changes since the end 
of communist rule in 1989. Artistic freedom that used to be 
expressed in hidden themes too elusive for government censors now 
depends on commercial viability. 
</P>
<P>
	The lesson seems to be learned.  
</P>
<P>
	Almost 7 million people in the nation of 39 million have seen  
``With Fire and Sword,'' an epic by director Jerzy Hoffman based on 
a beloved Polish novel set during the 17th-century war between 
Poland and the Ukraine. The film paid off its $5.14 million cost 
within weeks of opening in February and easily topped ``Kiler,'' a 
1997 action comedy by Juliusz Machulski that drew 2.5 million 
viewers and attracted attention in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman's success was attributed to an unprecedented publicity  
campaign and the source material by Henryk Sienkiewicz, winner of 
the 1905 Nobel prize for literature. Hoffman previously made two 
other honored and popular films from Sienkiewicz writings -- ``Pan 
Michael'' and ``The Deluge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is such large pressure of Western style and values ...  
that maybe this is a good time for Poles to immerse in their own 
culture and their own history,'' said Andrzej Wajda, whose ``Man of 
Iron,'' on the birth of the Solidarity labor movement, won the main 
prize at Cannes in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Wajda has his own historical project -- ``Mr. Tadeusz,'' based on  
a Romantic verse novel by 19th-century poet Adam Mickiewicz -- 
opening in September. He believes the success of Hoffman's film 
shows Poles will choose something with a personal link or more 
intellectual matter, like the political films they remember from 
the past, over the standard fare available at home on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is in attracting them to the cinema,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	That attitude differs from the old days, when commercial appeal  
hardly mattered. State-owned Lodz studio produced artistic fare 
that fetched international awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Wajda's 1974 ``Land of Promise'' won the main prize in Chicago  
in 1975 and the 1976 Academy Award nomination for best foreign 
film, while Polanski's debut, ``Knife in the Water,'' was made in 
Lodz in 1961. It was an Academy Award nominee for best foreign film 
in 1962 and took the critics award at Cannes. ``The Deluge'' by 
Hoffman was nominated for best foreign film at the 1975 Academy 
Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Kieslowski and Agnieszka Holland, who both gained international  
fame for films made abroad in later years, began their careers at 
Lodz. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Hollywood, the Lodz studio also attracted people simply  
wanting to be near the most prominent center of creative artistry 
in the repressive communist society. Jerzy Rezakiewicz, 64, told 
how he responded to an ad in 1962 offering jobs at the studio's 
stucco workshop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know what stucco was, but I wanted so much to work at  
the studio that I applied and got the job,'' smiled Rezakiewicz, 
now manager of the props warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	When communism ended a decade ago, Wajda and other directors  
lost some of their main themes, such as ridiculing the socialist 
system. They also lost most of their financing as the government 
reformed state enterprises in the transition to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Young directors churned out cheap imitations of Western-style  
action films, while prominent ones sought backing abroad. 
Kieslowski got money from French producer Marin Karmitz to make his 
globally successful three-color trilogy -- ``Blue,'' ``White'' and 
``Red,'' the latter earning him an Academy Award nomination in 1995 
for best director. 
</P>
<P>
	The trilogy -- with themes on defining the meaning of liberation,  
justice and equality -- helped restore the luster to modern Polish 
cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Lodz studio failed to adapt to the changing times,  
keeping its crew of 1,200 mostly administrative employees and high 
prices for its services. Debts mounted as filmmakers used smaller 
and cheaper private studios emerging under the economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Tadeusz Scibor-Rylski, head of the state Cinematography  
Committee that sponsors the film industry, called the Lodz facility 
an ``ill-managed, overgrown mammoth not fit for the new market 
reality.'' He ordered the recent sale of four of the complex's five 
studios to television and publicity companies that had been leasing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Film director Wojciech Wojcik praised the move, which he said  
saved the local film production industry to give ``financially 
weaker companies'' access to good equipment and expertise at lower 
costs than producing projects abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The technical excellence of Poland's industry has been  
recognized countless times, such as the Oscar wonon Stephen 
Spielberg's ``Schindler's List,'' which was filmed in Poland and 
which won seven Oscars altogether including best picture.

<HEADLINE> Study Raises Alzheimer's Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists today reported the development of a vaccine that in  
mice appears to ward off and even reduce the brain-clogging 
deposits that are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	It is uncertain whether the treatment will work in humans, but  
the San Francisco pharmaceutical company behind the research wants 
to test it on people soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Deposits in the brain of a sticky protein called amyloid are one  
of the characteristics of Alzheimer's. The vaccine appears to 
prevent the formation of these so-called plaques in mice that were 
genetically engineered to overproduce amyloid. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Zaven Khachaturian, senior medical adviser to the  
Alzheimer's Association, called the study a landmark. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one can repeat the same phenomenon in humans, it will have  
a very important impact,'' he said. Even if it fails to produce a 
treatment, it introduces the idea of using a vaccination against 
protein deposits, which are associated with a variety of diseases, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no known cure for Alzheimer's, which is believed to  
affect more than 4 million Americans. The patients, most of them 
older than 60, progress from forgetfulness to dementia and usually 
die five to 10 years after diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, published in today's issue of the journal Nature,  
a team of researchers led by Dale Schenk at Elan Corp. tried to 
trick the immune system of the mice to recognize amyloid as a 
foreign substance that should be attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers injected nine 6-week-old mice with amyloid  
combined with substances that excite the immune system. Seventeen 
other mice of the same age did not get the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	When the mouse brains were dissected after a year, the  
researchers were surprised to find no or very small plaques in the 
injected mice; the unvaccinated mice had extensive deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers then tried a more ambitious experiment:  
injecting the vaccine into 24 year-old mice that already had 
plaques. Twenty-four similar mice did not get the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw that it completely stopped the further progression of  
the disease,'' Schenk said. ``It looks like it might have actually 
diminished the plaques.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elan wants to start trials with people later this year. Schenk  
said researchers hope to submit a vaccine to the Food and Drug 
Administration for approval in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are a number of reasons the method may not prevent or  
halt Alzheimer's in humans. Most important, the amyloid plaques may 
be a symptom of the disease, rather than the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Alzheimer's patients have other changes in the brain that  
the mice do not fully exhibit, such as tangles of protein inside 
nerve cells, said Dr. Blas Frangione, head of the Alzheimer's 
research unit at the New York University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	If the vaccine does work, scientists will face another  
challenge: determining who needs it. While detectable genetic flaws 
cause some Alzheimer's cases, most patients have no such telltale 
markers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are going to have the maximal effect of this, we need to  
find out who has the disease, who is at risk, much earlier,'' 
Khachaturian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neurobiologist Peter St. George-Hyslop at the University of  
Toronto said the study raises the prospect of using immunization to 
treat or prevent other diseases associated with protein deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the fatal human brain disorder  
thought to be related to mad cow disease, would be a candidate. So 
would Parkinson's disease and myeloma, a form of cancer that 
overproduces protein in bone marrow.

<HEADLINE>  Champion Weight Thrower Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Champion weight thrower Bob Backus has died after  
several years of poor health. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	He died at Boston's Vencor Hospital June 30. His lawyer said he  
suffered a stroke in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Backus began lifting weights in 1948 to speed his recovery from  
spinal meningitis. At the time, he stood 6 feet, 5 inches and 
weighed 160 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army Air Forces pushed him out of its cadet program during  
World War II because he was so thin. 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually built himself up to 290 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	His weight throwing career began at Tufts, where he threw the  
16-pound hammer outdoors and the 35-pound weight indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	He set career bests of 45 feet, 2 inches in 1957 for the  
56-pound weight (no longer in use) and 66, 2 3/4 for the 35-pound 
weight in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	With no special shoes in those days for throwers, Backus wore  
ballet slippers. 
</P>
<P>
	He captured seven consecutive American titles for the 56-pound  
weight throw, from 1953 to 1959; titles seven out of eight years in 
the 35-pound throw, from 1954 to 1961; and one in the hammer throw 
in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1955 Pan American Games, he won a gold for the hammer  
throw. In 1982, he was voted best indoor weight thrower ever. 
</P>
<P>
	During the height of his career, he competed regularly in New  
York and Boston against Al Hall, Stewart Thomson and Tom Pagani, 
his teammates at the New York Athletic Club. From time to time, he 
would compete against Harold Connolly, Olympic hammer throw 
champion of 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	Backus owned a gym in Pembroke and worked as a fitness consulted  
for clients including the Yankees during 1983 spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 51, he came in second in the 35-pound weight throw of the  
national indoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``People overdo this age thing, but I guess you could say this  
was a victory for the Geritol set,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his ex-wife, Elsa Torikka, a former javelin  
thrower, a daughter, Lisa, of Skaneateles, N.Y.; and a son, Niles, 
of Honolulu.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Lawmakers Plan Budget Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and congressional leaders  
plan to meet at the White House next week to discuss their dueling 
proposals for what to do with the $2.9 trillion in 10-year budget 
surpluses that both sides now project. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials have issued an invitation for Monday. But  
the timing may change to accommodate lawmakers out of town for the 
July Fourth recess, said White House and top Capitol Hill aides. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said the discussions will focus on revamping Medicare  
and Social Security for the baby boomers' retirement and on 
Clinton's proposal to create a new, voluntary prescription drug 
benefit for the disabled and those 65 and over. Also on the table 
will be both sides' proposals for tax cuts and domestic and defense 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears unlikely that the meeting would lead to early,  
full-blown budget negotiations between the two sides. Clinton will 
have leverage over Republicans this fall, when spending bills that 
will keep huge federal agencies open arrive at his desk, and there 
seems little reason for him to give ground beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides say they want to use the $1.9 trillion portion of the  
projected surplus that comes from Social Security to reduce the 
accumulated national debt. That would indirectly help Social 
Security by reducing federal interest payments and strengthening 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans want to use the bulk of the rest for a tax cut.  
Clinton wants to use the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare, 
other domestic programs, debt reduction and a modest tax cut.

<P>
	TOPSHAM, Maine (AP) -- A Missouri man who came to Maine to pursue  
a relationship with a woman he had met over the Internet died after 
cutting his neck with a chain saw on her front lawn to prove his 
love. 
</P>
<P>
	James Dinardi, 44, of Columbia, Mo., died at a hospital Monday.  
Police said he had moved to the area on June 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``The distraught individual had met the individual lady on the  
Internet, started up a romance,'' Police Chief Paul J. Lessard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the woman apparently wanted to end the relationship, so  
Dinardi drove up to her home, pulled a chain saw from the trunk and 
cut part of his neck off to show her how much he cared for her, 
Lessard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police withheld the woman's name.

<HEADLINE> Discount Airline Winair Shuts Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Winair Airlines of Salt Lake City has shut  
down after operating as a discount airline for eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, which had its hub at Long Beach, Calif., ceased  
operations Tuesday after a deal to raise additional money from an 
investor group fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran out of financial fuel,'' said Richard Winwood, the  
airline's founder and a co-founder of what is now Franklin Covey 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Winwood said Winair lost more than $15 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Winair started as a charter airline. It began offering  
commercial flights in November. At its peak, it employed 500 people 
and offered 14 flights a day from the Long Beach Airport, including 
flights to Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Oakland, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline now employs about 360 people.  
</P>
<P>
	Customers with paid reservations will receive refunds.  
</P>
<P>
	For customers still on the road, Winair is talking with other  
airlines to see if they will help passengers with their return 
trips, said Larry Gelwix, Winair's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Winair hoped to draw passengers through a combination of low  
fares and the convenient location and small size of the Long Beach 
Airport. It had been drawing more passengers in recent months, 
Winwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that is most disappointing to me is that we really  
have proved that a small airline can operate out of the Long Beach 
Airport,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The startup costs were significantly higher than expected, said  
Winwood.

<HEADLINE> D.C. United 2, Columbus 1, SO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Jeff Agoos and Brian Kamler scored for  
D.C. United in a shootout Wednesday night, giving the Major League 
Soccer Eastern Conference leaders a 2-1 victory over the Columbus 
Crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus was scoreless in four shootout attempts.  
</P>
<P>
	The victory gave United 30 points for the season and extended  
its lead over the second-place Crew to seven points. United has won 
all three of its games against Columbus this year, all by one goal. 
</P>
<P>
	A.J. Wood opened the scoring for United in the 27th minute on  
assists by Geoff Aunger and Roy Lassiter. It appeared to some fans 
that Wood had used his left arm to control the ball, and the signal 
that the goal counted was greeted with scattered booing. 
</P>
<P>
	A header by Stern John in the 56th minute tied the score 1-1 on  
assists by Brian Maisonneuve and Jason Farrell. The shot appeared 
to catch United goalkeeper Tom Presthus off guard by bouncing in an 
unexpected direction. 
</P>
<P>
	John has scored in four straight games, with six goals in that  
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a rough game, with 34 fouls called, 20 against United.  
Carlos Llamosa of United was ejected in the 75th minute for 
tackling from behind, and seven players received yellow cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus led 14-7 in shots and 6-3 in shots on goal.

<HEADLINE> Rivera Passes Up All-Star Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- New York Yankees reliever Mariano Rivera, who was  
picked by manager Joe Torre for the American League All-Star game, 
took himself off the squad for undisclosed personal reasons 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said Cleveland right-hander Charles Nagy would take  
Rivera's place on the AL roster. 
</P>
<P>
	During a brief news conference in the visitors' clubhouse at  
Tiger Stadium, Rivera said he had been planning for some time to 
fly home to Panama to tend to personal business. He declined to 
elaborate, but said it didn't involve his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor for me to be taken on the All-Star team,'' said  
Rivera, who is fourth in the AL with 24 saves. ``But, I've got to 
take care of this problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts, because I wanted to be there (July 13 in Boston).  
But, I spoke to Joe and he understands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre confirmed that he had known of Rivera's decision for more  
than 24 hours. He said he called the right-hander into his office 
before Tuesday night's 9-8 victory over Detroit in 10 innings. 
Rivera told him then that he couldn't accept, yet his name was 
released with the rest of the squad anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was troubled that he had to do this,'' Torre said. ``But we  
cleared it with the American League office. He'd been needing to 
take care of this, and there as no other time he could do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera, who will leave for Panama after the Yankees game with  
the Mets on Sunday, said he would return in time for the resumption 
of the regular season July 15 when the Yankees play the Atlanta 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that I have to go there,'' Rivera said. ``I need to  
go there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera made his 32nd appearance of the season Tuesday night,  
suffering only his second blown save in 23 opportunities before 
getting credit for the win. Bobby Higginson tied it at 8 with two 
outs in the ninth with a solo homer, the first yielded by Rivera 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said Nagy, who is 10-4, had been close to making the AL  
squad all along. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was right there in the voting,'' Torre said. ``I pretty  
much went with the manager's sheets, right down the line.''

<HEADLINE> Islanders Sign Two Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Islanders signed free agent  
defenseman Jamie Heward and center Chris Ferraro on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Heward, who played for the Nashville Predators last season,  
finished with six goals and 12 assists in 63 games. Four of his six 
goals came on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a terrific shot and will see some power play time,''  
Islanders general manager Mike Milbury said. ``He'll be a nice 
complement to our defensive unit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heward played 25 games for Toronto (1-4-5), and was in the  
Philadelphia Flyers' farm system when he was chosen by the 
Predators in the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferraro, who grew up on Long Island, played for Edmonton's farm  
team in Hamilton, Ontario, last season and led the team in goals 
(35), points (76) and game-winning goals (nine). The 26-year-old 
also played two games with Edmonton and scored a goal. Previously, 
Ferraro played for the New York Rangers and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deals were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I feel like the luckiest person alive,'' Ferraro, a  
draft pick of the Rangers in 1991, said. ``I was an Islander fan 
growing up, watching the Mike Bossys, the Bryan Trottiers, the 
Billy Smiths, the Denis Potvins ... and the Butch Gorings, too.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Plunges Into N.Y. Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DAVENPORT, N.Y. (AP) -- Plunging into her race for the  
Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton brushed aside criticism Wednesday 
that she is a carpetbagger in New York. ``What I am for is maybe as 
important, if not more important, than where I am from,'' the first 
lady said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said New Yorkers had some ``very legitimate  
questions'' about what she believes in and the skills and interests 
she would bring to the job. And she said she would address them. 
</P>
<P>
	She pledged that she would be a ``strong and effective advocate  
on behalf of the people of New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the first question she was asked about a specifically New  
York issue -- a trade-related query about a new bridge between New 
York and Canada -- she deferred to retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, her host for the campaign kickoff and the man she hopes 
to succeed. ``Well, I'm going to let the expert speak on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He answered briefly that the issue was being reviewed.  
</P>
<P>
	While Moynihan has often been at odds with the Clinton  
administration, he wholeheartedly endorsed Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope she will go all the way,'' he said, after giving the  
first lady a tour of the schoolhouse office on his family farm. ``I 
mean to go all the way with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton created an exploratory committee on Tuesday that  
allows her to raise and spend money for a campaign for the 
Democratic Senate nomination in New York. Advisers don't expect her 
to formally declare her candidacy until September, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is expected to be unopposed in her quest for the  
Democratic nomination. On the Republican side, the Senate seat is 
being eyed by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and two 
congressmen from Long Island, Rick Lazio and Peter King. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls show Mrs. Clinton tied with or trailing Giuliani.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked to respond to Mrs. Clinton's remarks, the mayor said, ``It  
doesn't make sense for me to respond to someone exploring and 
listening and announcing that they're going to explain to us at 
some point in the future what they're for. When she explains what 
she's for and if I'm running against her then I will respond to 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``Everybody in the city and state knows what I'm  
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is the first first lady to seek elected office. Her  
exploratory committee will pay for her campaign travel, including 
reimbursing the federal government for use of aircraft. However, 
Mrs. Clinton will continue to get taxpayer-funded Secret Service 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how she could run for office and fulfill her duties as  
first lady, she said, ``It is not so dissimilar from someone, for 
example, being in Congress and running for the Senate, or being a 
governor and running for another office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three senators, one House member and one governor are running  
for president this time. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, on a poverty tour, called the first lady  
after her news conference to ask about her campaign debut and to 
wish her well, her aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a 1 1/2-hour education event at the State University of New York  
at Oneonta, Mrs. Clinton called for civility in politics. ``When 
people are debating issues where the pressure is to scream and 
insult that is a real turn-off for most citizens,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she's off to a great start,'' said Sheila Simon, an  
employee at SUNY-Oneonta who was carrying a sign reading 'New York 
needs a first lady.' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrat Jennifer Chase of Oneonta said she wouldn't vote for  
Mrs. Clinton. ``I don't think she should be senator from a state 
she's never lived in. She should go back to Arkansas and maybe run 
for senator there,'' she said. ``She obviously has family problems 
and ought to take care of those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Mrs. Clinton's arrival at the Binghamton airport Wednesday  
through a host of stops, she felt firsthand the strong emotions her 
candidacy is generating in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Binghamton airport, about three dozen supporters  
waved placards. Spotting them and, emulating her husband's campaign 
style, she stopped her eight-vehicle motorcade to wade into the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	At her campaign stops, some demonstrators carried signs or  
chanted, ``Go home, Hillary.'' Supporters yelled, ``Run, Hillary, 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton appeared relaxed and at ease.  
</P>
<P>
	She said she thought the carpetbagger question, raised by  
Republicans including Giuliani because she has never lived or 
worked in New York, was a fair one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have some real work to do to get out and listen and  
learn from the people of New York and demonstrate that what I'm for 
is maybe as important, if not more important, than where I'm 
from,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she planned to spend the next months listening to New  
Yorkers to learn more about the issues important to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them, she said, were providing ``good quality'' education  
and health care and ``making sure the economy is built in a way 
that creates good jobs in every region in the state of New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A June poll from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute found  
that 53 percent of registered voters statewide do not believe Mrs. 
Clinton understands the issues and problems facing New York, up 
from 43 percent in a March poll from the Hamden, Conn.-based 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan and Mrs. Clinton delivered their remarks to more than  
200 reporters and cameramen gathered at his farm. More than 30 
television crews recorded the event staged amid the rolling hills 
outside Oneonta. 
</P>
<P>
	She was questioned about some of the investigations that have  
plagued the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	On Whitewater, she said, ``I think that New Yorkers will make  
their own judgments about that. I think we've moved beyond all of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She sidestepped a question, however, about whether she sees  
herself as a victim of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and whether she 
would benefit from a sympathy vote. ``I'm looking forward to 
meeting with New Yorkers, and I think they'll have a lot to tell me 
about what they think about me and the positions that I have.''

<HEADLINE> Cool Front Breaks Heat Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More than half a day after the lights went out  
and air conditioners quit, 200,000 Manhattan residents waited today 
for the end of a blackout that struck during a record heat wave 
blamed for more than a dozen deaths around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though a cold front had brought relief from the sweaty  
misery across the Midwest and Northeast, other New York City 
neighborhoods were in danger of blackouts today, Consolidated 
Edison warned. Police headquarters had to briefly use backup 
generators. 
</P>
<P>
	Record high temperatures and power demands were set again  
Tuesday in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast as utilities scrambled to 
keep electricity flowing around flaming transformers and melting 
power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like somebody's thrown buckets of hot water in your  
face,'' said Pat Renaghan, an elevator operator in a subway station 
at 168th Street in New York City. ``Sometimes when you take the 
elevator down, the air feels so thick you feel like you could chew 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For today, highs only in the 70s and 80s were forecast in much  
of New England and in the 90s farther south. Con Ed reported an 
all-time record demand for power in the New York City area on 
Tuesday at 11,850 megawatts. 
</P>
<P>
	People slept outside in the streets in parts of upper Manhattan  
because a widespread blackout left them with no way to ventilate 
their apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	``People stayed outside until dawn,'' said resident Winton  
Nunez, 35. ``It was impossible to stay indoors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That blackout affected about 68,000 business and residential  
customers above 155th Street in Manhattan -- an area of about 250 
blocks with some 200,000 residents, Con Edison spokesman Joe Petta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, damaged feeder cables meant that three other  
sections of the city, including Manhattan's Lower East Side and 
parts of Queens and Brooklyn, were in danger of losing power, Con 
Ed president J. Michael Evans warned today. 
</P>
<P>
	At New York Police Department headquarters, on the edge of the  
Lower East Side, most elevators were shut down briefly to conserve 
electricity and emergency generators were briefly put into 
operation. Nearby City Hall and the Wall Street area were not 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Other outages affected hundreds of thousands of customers across  
the Northeast and mid Atlantic regions. A generator failure at a 
Dagsboro, Del., power plant belonging to Conectiv forced that 
utility to impose rolling blackouts -- shifting, 20-minute shutdowns 
-- on 400,000 of the utility's 1 million customers in New Jersey, 
Delaware and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	In Manhattan, a line of mattresses and sofa cushions lined the  
sidewalk along 188th Street where Juan Lora, his wife, another 
couple and six children had slept outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no other option,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't stay inside. I had sweat dripping down my face,''  
said Berki Cepeda, who also slept outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The police department sent 500 officers to patrol the  
neighborhoods and direct traffic off streets where signal lights 
didn't work. Police reported a handful of attempted store break-ins 
and nine arrests, a sharp difference from the 1977 blackout that 
affected the whole city and led to widespread looting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani accused Con Ed of not being prepared.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're in an age of high technology. We're a city that has  
predictably high usage of electricity in warm weather. I mean 
everybody can figure that out, right?'' the frustrated mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Ed's president refused to respond to the criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	The intense heat had contributed to at least 18 deaths: seven in  
Pennsylvania, three in New York City, four in New Jersey, two in 
Massachusetts and two in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The emergency room of South Ocean County Hospital in Manahawkin,  
N.J., treated more than 400 victims of heat stroke and heat 
exhaustion in three days. 
</P>
<P>
	The welcome cold front bringing slightly cooler and markedly  
drier air from the Midwest arrived in deadly fashion Tuesday, 
triggering violent storms in upstate New York and New England. 
Falling trees killed three people in upstate New York, New 
Hampshire and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature dropped from 91 to 70 in just four minutes  
Tuesday afternoon in Concord, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms caused still more power outages that affected  
thousands of utility customers, including 75,000 in upstate New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, high temperature records fell before the sun even  
reached its peak as Atlantic City, N.J., hit 98 before noon, with 
humidity of about 40 percent. The mercury hit record highs of 102 
at Newark, N.J.; 101 in New York; 102 in Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; and 
103 at Washington's Reagan National Airport.

<HEADLINE>  Packers' Shareholders Sound Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers can remain  
financially competitive at Lambeau Field for four more years, team 
president Bob Harlan told more than 7,000 shareholders gathered 
today for the team's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Harlan said the Packers either must build a new  
stadium or make more than $75 million in renovations to Lambeau 
Field in order to keep up with the spiraling salaries and signing 
bonuses of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make no threats, we have no leverage,'' Harlan said. ``But  
we must find a way to remain competitive in the NFL's changing 
financial situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers' second outdoor shareholders meeting at Lambeau  
attracted fans representing over 56 percent of the shares in the 
league's only publicly held franchise. The 90-minute session 
featured a detailed overview of the upcoming season and reports 
from several team departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers officials called it the largest annual corporate meeting  
in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The shareholders also were invited to ask questions from the  
stands. Hot topics ranged from the stadium situation to the 
possibility of allowing Wisconsin residents to contribute part of 
their tax refund to their favorite team. 
</P>
<P>
	Team treasurer John Underwood assessed the team's financial  
state and called 1999 ``a dramatic reality check.'' The team 
disclosed last month in its annual report that despite record 
earnings, the Packers experienced a small negative cash flow that 
would have been much larger if not for the Cleveland Browns' $16 
million one-time expansion fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Packers have sold out every game at Lambeau Field  
since 1960, the aging stadium has neither the amenities nor the 
seating capacities to allow the team to keep pace in a league in 
which 21 of the 31 teams have new or renovated home fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I listen to the people and the fans who contact me and  
write me, their preference is to stay in Lambeau Field,'' Harlan 
said. ``... But we also recognize that changes will have to be 
made, and we have some decisions to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers and the NFL have determined the team's revenue from  
playing at Lambeau Field will only keep pace with the rest of the 
league for four more years, Harlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay leases its private boxes for about half of the  
league's average price, and Lambeau Field's infrastructure is well 
behind that in other stadiums. In particular, the team said it 
needs to make more money from concessions, seat licenses and club 
seating. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders repeatedly asked Harlan why the team couldn't  
simply add a second deck to Lambeau Field, allowing most of the 
40,000 people on the team's season-ticket waiting list to generate 
revenue by buying the new seats. Harlan explained that the NFL's 
revenue-sharing policy gives 40 percent of ticket sales money to 
the visiting team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really in an education mode right now,'' Harlan said.  
``You try to tell them, but I'm not sure they got the message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's second annual meeting has already become a favorite  
event among the team's faithful fans, who traveled from all corners 
of the country to Green Bay. Many wore T-shirts or hats with the 
word ``Shareholder'' printed boldly across the front. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Ron Wolf also gave a detailed assessment of the  
team's roster. He said negotiations with top wide receiver Antonio 
Freeman were ongoing, and he denied reports the Packers were 
considering trading the All-Pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing everything in our power to make sure he signs with  
us and we don't have a Dorsey situation,'' Wolf said, referring to 
running back Dorsey Levens' holdout last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kick returner Desmond Howard, the Packers' 1997 Super Bowl MVP  
who re-signed with the team last month after two years in Oakland, 
received an ovation each time his name was mentioned by Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	The first shareholders meeting, held last year, attracted 18,707  
of the more than 100,000 Packers shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Teens Charged With Throwing Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN PARK, Mich. (AP) -- Two 13-year-old boys were charged  
with making a bomb that injured 5-year-old twin girls. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls were playing Friday in the yard of their baby sitter  
when the boys rode up on bicycles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the boys asked, ``Do you want some pop?'' and rolled what  
looked like a bottle of soda toward the girls. One of the girls 
picked up the bottle but was startled by its fizzing. She dropped 
it and both sisters turned to run when it exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls were struck by aluminum, plastic and chemical debris  
from the blast that sent shrapnel as far as 30 feet away, according 
to the police report. They were treated at a hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb was made from ingredients that included drain cleaner  
and aluminum foil, police said. The boys reportedly told police 
they got the bomb recipe from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys were charged with assault with intent to do great  
bodily harm and placing an explosive device with intent to injure.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Supremacist Gun Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- A man was charged Wednesday with illegally  
selling guns, including the weapons used by Benjamin Nathaniel 
Smith during his racist killing spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents raided Donald R. Fiessinger's apartment on July  
1, one day before Smith set out on a three-day shooting rampage 
targeting blacks, Jews and Asians that ended with his apparent 
suicide Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is believed to have bought two handguns from Fiessinger  
days earlier. Two people were killed and nine injured in Smith's 
spree. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we could have been there a week before,'' Assistant U.S  
Attorney Tate Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiessinger, 64, was not arrested immediately after the raid on  
his apartment in the central Illinois town of Pekin, 12 miles south 
of Peoria. After reading about Smith's weekend killings, he called 
authorities Tuesday to tell them he sold Smith the handguns, 
according to an affidavit by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms agent Daniel Volk. Records found in Fiessinger's apartment 
included the sales to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiessinger said Smith told him he was going to use the guns for  
hunting. He also said he didn't know of Smith's white supremacist 
beliefs or potential for violence, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiessinger is being held in jail and is due to return to federal  
court Thursday to face charges of selling firearms without a 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Wertz, appointed as Fiessinger's lawyer, refused comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors asked for an additional day to comb over the records  
seized from his apartment. Chambers said he wants to know whether 
Fiessinger sold weapons to anyone else associated with Smith or 
with extremist groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have established the defendant supplied the guns used by  
Benjamin Smith. That gives us a lot of concern,'' Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF began investigating Fiessinger on June 21, according to  
Volk's affidavit. Smith, who was renting an office space in nearby 
Morton, allegedly bought the two guns from Fiessinger on June 26 
and June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Volk said Fiessinger advertised weapons in the classified  
section of a local newspaper. Based on those ads, two undercover 
ATF agents arranged to buy weapons from Fiessinger last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A search by the ATF later that day turned up 27 firearms, $330  
in cash and records of firearms sales. Those records included the 
sales to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents were tipped off to Fiessinger's alleged street  
dealing by records showing he had bought 65 handguns legally from 
one store, the Old Prairie Trading Post, over a two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had tried to purchase a gun from a licensed dealer in  
Peoria Heights shortly before he went to Fiessinger, authorities 
said. But that dealer turned him away after a background check 
found an ex-girlfriend had secured a protective order against 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	A Bryco .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and a .22-caliber  
handgun were found with Smith's body after he apparently shot 
himself following a police chase in the Southern Illinois town of 
Salem. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say his Fourth of July weekend rampage included  
shootings in Chicago, two of its suburbs, three other Illinois 
cities and Bloomington, Ind. Killed were former Northwestern 
University basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong and Won-Joon Yoon, a 
South Korean doctoral student at Indiana University.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Moves To Protect Dead Celebs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With sophisticated technology raising a host  
of dead icons for encore performances to pitch products, aging 
stars and surviving family members are taking steps to make sure 
these digital resurrections come with their blessing. 
</P>
<P>
	Television commercials that feature Fred Astaire dancing with a  
vacuum cleaner, Humphrey Bogart hustling jewelry and John Wayne 
hawking Coors beer can be powerful sales tools. 
</P>
<P>
	Although these ads were authorized by relatives, every so often  
advertisers will simply pirate a celebrity's likeness to move a 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, where Hollywood has clout, a bill is working its  
way through the state legislature that would provide protection for 
dead icons. Among the key proponents are actress Janet Leigh and 
Astaire's widow Robyn. 
</P>
<P>
	``Celebrities have control over their images when they're alive  
and we ought to give them that same control when they are dead,'' 
said state Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, author of the 
California bill. 
</P>
<P>
	As Leigh put it: ``My image is my product, my franchise, my  
commodity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no federal legislation to protect dead celebrities and  
their heirs, state Senate Bill 209 guards against unauthorized 
commercial exploitation of a celebrity's name and likeness, 
particularly in instances where that likeness is altered digitally. 
</P>
<P>
	Heirs have been dealing with different legislation from state to  
state. New York, for instance, doesn't recognize a decendant's 
right to control publicity at all; Indiana, meanwhile, is the 
toughest by offering 100 years of protection after death. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a need for federal legislation. There is a move  
toward it and it continues to build, but we're simply not there 
yet,'' said Scott Whiteleather, vice president of the 
Indianapolis-based CMG Worldwide Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	CMG, which licenses the rights to use celebrity images, is the  
leader in protecting and marketing the names and images of deceased 
personalities such as Bogart, Marilyn Monroe, Babe Ruth, James 
Dean, Ingrid Bergman and Bette Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't surprising that the majority of the body of law for  
this exists in California. This is where the majority of 
celebrities live,'' Whiteleather said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Screen Actors Guild and other Hollywood organizations  
endorse the Burton legislation, while the studios tend to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sometimes surprised that they are,'' said Whiteleather.  
``The concern they voice is they would not be able to make films 
like `Forrest Gump,' which inserted Elvis Presley and other dead 
notables into scenes with star Tom Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing could be further from the truth.''  
</P>
<P>
	Current California law requires someone who wants to use a dead  
celebrity's name, voice, likeness or signature for commercial 
purposes to get permission from the person's survivors. But there 
are potential loopholes -- like for an artistic product that may 
feature the subject but is owned by others. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton's bill would eliminate the exceptions and force those  
sued by heirs to prove that the use of a dead celebrity's name, 
voice, likeness or signature was of a journalistic nature and 
covered by the First Amendment. The bill also increases 
California's protection period from 50 years to 70 years after 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Some estates handled by CMG are interested in using the images  
in tasteful ways, but other clients are more interested in 
protection than making money. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are celebrities and families who might not want their  
name associated with any product. We have clients who come to us to 
make sure there is no use of their relative,'' said Whiteleather, 
refusing to identify those clients. 
</P>
<P>
	CMG's aggressive posture on behalf of clients has been compared  
to Walt Disney Co.'s militant protection of its Mickey Mouse and 
other copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are often referred to as being a bit Disneyesque,''  
Whiteleather laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it comes to movies or professional sports, don't movie  
producers or sports leagues have rights to use the images? 
</P>
<P>
	No, said Whiteleather.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the case of James Dean, while Warner Bros. owns the  
copyright to his films, along with specific images from the films, 
they don't own James Dean. That's owned by the family. Warner Bros. 
doesn't have the right to take the image of James Dean and put it 
on a product,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the case of a jeweler now using Humphrey Bogart in a  
commercial, they purchased the copyright for the film clip from the 
studio and they acquired the right to publicity from the Bogart 
family.''

<HEADLINE> Japan's Cabinet OKs Extra Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Cabinet on Thursday approved a  
supplementary budget totaling $4.25 billion (520 billion yen) aimed 
at bolstering the nation's ailing labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget will finance the government's plan to create about  
720,000 jobs through measures such as subsidies to companies and 
nonprofit organizations for hiring displaced workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget, which entails no additional issuance of bonds, will  
now be submitted to Parliament for deliberation with approval to 
come as early as July 19, according to a Finance Ministry official. 
</P>
<P>
	The compilation of the extra budget reflects the government's  
desire to stem deterioration in the labor market as companies shed 
workers through drastic restructuring plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's jobless rate recently hit an all-time high of 4.8  
percent in March and April before easing to 4.6 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been fighting its longest recession since World War  
II. Some good news came last month, though, when the government 
announced that the economy grew at an annualized rate of 7.9 
percent in the first quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of that growth came from generous government spending  
packages introduced last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians and business leaders now worry, however, that  
further supplementary budgets will be needed to keep the economy 
from slipping back into recession next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the money set aside in the new budget, $1.68 billion will be  
for an ``emergency'' employment plan involving financial incentives 
to companies and nonprofit organizations that hire displaced 
workers, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another $1.63 billion will go to help regional governments deal  
with costs related to the growing number of elderly people, as well 
as $736 million to promote the creation of new businesses, it said.

<HEADLINE> Managed Care Plans To Be Evaluated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less-structured managed care plans that have  
come to dominate the health insurance market soon will face the 
same sort of evaluations that HMOs have come to expect. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the National Committee on Quality Assurance, the  
leading group evaluating the quality of HMOs, will begin to 
evaluate preferred provider organizations, known as PPOs. 
</P>
<P>
	PPOs, which serve more than 89 million Americans, encourage  
patients to use doctors and hospitals that are part of their 
networks, but they allow members to use others if they are willing 
to pay an extra fee. 
</P>
<P>
	``In health care today, the only entity that's truly being held  
accountable is the HMO. That's wrong,'' said Margaret E. O'Kane, 
president of the committee, which has been accrediting HMO plans 
since 1991. The group sells reports on these plans to employers, 
who use them to choose insurance companies to serve their workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Late this year, the group will release consumer evaluations of  
their PPOs. A more comprehensive assessment will begin next year, 
including a look at how well appeals procedures work and whether 
there are obstacles to getting needed care. 
</P>
<P>
	The health plans will be judged by the work of doctors and  
hospitals that are inside the network, not those who patients seek 
out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's annual assessment of health maintenance  
organizations is set for release in late July. HMOs are less 
flexible and usually cheaper than PPOs because they restrict 
patients to a fixed network of doctors and hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Brooke Shields Tours Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- It wasn't just the big things like the Nile  
or the pyramids that impressed Brooke Shields during a tour of 
Cairo. There were also the little ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was beyond moved by the children themselves,'' the American  
actress said Tuesday. ``I was amazed at how none of them were 
willing to be negative about their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shields and other celebrities are part of the worldwide LISTEN  
project, which aims to raise $99 million for children in developing 
countries at the start of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't matter that I didn't speak their language,'' Shields  
said of the children. ``They just saw a kind face and someone who 
was willing to listen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her eyes filled with tears as Egyptians translated.  
</P>
<P>
	``When my mother comes home things will be better,'' one child  
said. Said another: ``When my father is in the house there is 
music, there is taste again; when he is not there nothing has 
taste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To me as an Egyptian it was an experience never to forget,''  
said sculptor Mohamad Abla, who accompanied Shields on her visit.

<HEADLINE> Pregnant Woman Awakens From Coma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nobody expected Maria Lydia Hernandez Lopez  
to awaken from her coma, and her doctors held little hope that the 
twin girls she had been carrying for nearly six months would be 
born alive. 
</P>
<P>
	But a month after Mrs. Lopez slipped into her coma -- after her  
family agreed to remove her life support and a priest had 
administered last rites -- the 25-year-old woman awoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Mrs. Lopez is conscious and recovering and her twins are  
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been pretty remarkable ride,'' said her neurosurgeon,  
John Frazee of the University of California, Los Angeles Medical 
Center. ``It's something that I have never seen happen in 17 years 
-- someone waking up who I thought was going to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Mrs. Lopez's began complaining of headaches. Doctors  
blamed them on her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 24 she had trouble breathing and slipped into the coma  
in an ambulance on the way to the hospital. It turned out that a 
blood vessel had popped inside her brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lopez has a condition called arteriovenous malformation, in  
which people are born with malformed or tangled arteries or veins 
in the brain. Over time, the vessels can pressure neural tissue or 
rupture. Her pregnancy did not contribute to the rupture, Frazee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At UCLA, she underwent embolization, in which doctors inject a  
glue-like substance to cut the blood flow to the tangled vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	``For three weeks she didn't get any better,'' Frazee said. ``I  
was having discussions with her family about the chances of her 
recovering. I didn't think she would wake up to take care of 
herself, let alone take care of her children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then in mid-May, the family was about to remove life support. As  
a priest was giving last rites, Mrs. Lopez sputtered, coughed and 
lurched in her bed. Doctors said it was an involuntary reflex, but 
the family saw it as a sign from God. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw that, I knew she was not gone. That was a sign for  
me,'' sister Adela Hernandez said. ``That's where my faith came 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intensive care continued, including a procedure to drain fluid  
from her brain in early June, just before she slowly began to 
regain consciousness and respond to simple commands. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, on June 9, she awoke. Six days later, she delivered  
twins, Arizandy Leann and Brianna Angel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lopez, who underwent further brain surgery last week, is  
slowly recovering and can communicate by wiggling her fingers, 
Frazee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were there from the beginning to now, it's just very  
awesome,'' Ms. Hernandez said Wednesday. ``It is a miracle. We just 
thank God.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Looking for an Upset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- In a state that loves to humble  
presidential front-runners, Bill Bradley is seeking an upset. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator and professional basketball player  
is walking New Hampshire's main streets and strolling around its 
beach communities, engaging in traditional retail politics as he 
battles Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you run for office, where you begin is in somebody's  
living room,'' Bradley said. ``They look at you and they take your 
measure. Now you're running for president, and you begin in the 
same place. You begin in living rooms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has more money, more endorsements and the power and  
prestige of the White House, led by resident fund-raiser 
extraordinaire Bill Clinton. He leads Bradley in opinion polls. A 
late June CNN-Gallup-USA Today survey gave the vice president a 64 
percent to 28 percent lead with a margin of error of plus or minus 
5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you ask Democrats who they feel is the person who can  
best lead them into the next century, who had the leadership and 
the values and the vision to take them into the next millennium, 
overwhelmingly it's Al Gore,'' Gore campaign spokesman Roger 
Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley can't be counted out. It's the former New York Knick  
playing a game of one-on-one, and making enough of his shots to 
remain in competition. Indeed, Bradley calls it the first 
one-on-one, 11-month primary in history. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore raised more than $18 million through June 30, Bradley  
took in more than $11 million, giving him enough to wage a 
competitive campaign. His fund-raising efforts have been helped by 
many prominent sports figures he befriended while playing 
basketball, and has raised much of his money from lawyers and 
investment bankers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has most of the Democratic establishment behind him, but  
Bradley has plenty of supporters as well. In Concord last month, 
standing in front of the State House during their lunch break for 
one of those made-for-television press opportunities, 18 Democratic 
state lawmakers endorsed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want someone to be our next president who is not only  
intelligent but somebody who can identify with all people, someone 
who doesn't have glitz but someone who seems real,'' said one of 
the 18, state Rep. Marilyn Fraser, who represents Concord. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley talks about his background at every stop. Meeting with  
officials of a Concord community development group, he mentioned 
his father the banker, whose proudest achievement was that he 
didn't foreclose on anyone during the Depression. At a nearby music 
school, Bradley talked about how he joined the Air Force marching 
band because it meant he didn't have to clean latrines. 
</P>
<P>
	What he hasn't done so far is talk about many issues. Despite  
his 18 years in the Senate, Bradley is better known as a former 
professional basketball player, and he has refused to offer 
specifics until this fall on anything but gun control -- he 
responded to the Littleton, Colo., shootings by calling for 
licensing handguns like automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor is he willing to talk about Gore.  
</P>
<P>
	``The premise of my campaign is not to look at the other guy.  
The premise of my campaign is to look at the future,'' Bradley 
said. ``What all Democrats want is somebody who can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Democrats say Bradley's apparent strength is nothing more  
than an indication that Gore, despite all his years in politics, is 
having problems getting his campaign under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be a general feeling that Gore just hasn't  
gotten his political act together,'' said Mark Grossman, a New York 
Democratic political consultant. ``It's a perception among 
Democrats. It's a concern among Gore supporters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with the  
Clinton administration remains among Democrats, and Gore is paying 
the price. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate to the vice president, but there is a general  
feeling that because he's been part of the Clinton administration, 
some of the Clinton scandals are falling on Gore,'' said Rep. James 
Curran, who has endorsed Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, voters here pride themselves on their independence,  
and aren't about to anoint Gore so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to take our time and make up our own minds,'' said  
one undecided Democrat, lobbyist Jim Monahan. ``I don't think it's 
disrespect to look beyond incumbency. There's a tradition of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Grossman expected Gore to right his campaign long before  
the first delegates are selected. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this business, the primaries are light years away,''  
Grossman said. ``This is going to be looked at really as just a 
glitch on the radar screen, and an insignificant glitch at that, 
once people really begin to focus on the 2000 race.''

<HEADLINE> Williams Sisters Make Fed Cup Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Sisters Venus and Serena Williams will  
make their Fed Cup debut when the United States plays Italy in a 
second-round match later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Fed Cup Captain Billie Jean King on Wednesday selected the  
Williams sisters along with Monica Seles and Mary Joe Fernandez to 
face the Italians on July 24-25 in Ancona, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Venus and Serena Williams had been invited to play Fed Cup  
previously, but had declined the offer until now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to have a team composed of veterans and rookies.  
... I couldn't ask for better rookies than Venus and Serena, and I 
am glad that they are playing Fed Cup for the United States,'' King 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has won the Fed Cup 15 times, more than any  
other country, since the event began in 1963. The Americans have a 
7-0 record against Italy, which has never won the Fed Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus Williams is ranked No. 4 in the world, while Serena is  
ranked 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles, ranked fifth, is undefeated in Fed Cup play with a 10-0  
singles mark and a 1-0 doubles record. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez made her Fed Cup debut in 1991 and has a 12-8 record  
in singles and 4-2 in doubles. She is currently ranked 33rd in the 
world.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lady Becomes Candidate Hillary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- At the Baseball Hall of Fame, the  
transformation of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton into candidate 
Hillary Rodham Clinton was much in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	She autographed the baseballs handed to her, she hugged the  
babies and she worked the crowds Wednesday as she began her first 
full-scale political trip into New York since forming her Senate 
exploratory committee on Tuesday. Even her advisers noticed the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``She seems to be enjoying it,'' state Democratic Chairwoman  
Judith Hope said. ``I think her political instincts are extremely 
fine. She seems to know when to give you a hug or kneel down and 
talk to a baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friend Mandy Grunwald, a media consultant who worked on  
President Clinton's campaigns and is now advising Mrs. Clinton, 
said, ``You can talk about it and plan it, but until you actually 
get out and do it, you never are quite sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Mrs. Clinton, Wednesday was a day packed with a half-dozen  
events spread across 10 hours, not including the impromptu visit to 
the Unadilla rest stop along Interstate 88 between Binghamton and 
Oneonta. It was there that the first lady ran into Melinda Filidei 
from Galveston, Texas, and her two young daughters, Heather and 
Haileigh. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got H-names, I've got an H-name,'' Mrs. Clinton told  
the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowds were everywhere along the route. Several dozen  
sign-waving supporters stood outside the Binghamton airport. Mrs. 
Clinton halted her motorcade and, taking a page out of her 
husband's campaign notebook, waded into the group. As they chanted 
``Run, Hillary, Run,'' she told them, ``Thank you all, so much.'' 
One carried a sign saying: ``You go, girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there were also plenty of not-so-friendly signs along the  
way. A tractor trailer, ferried to Binghamton by an Albany-area 
Republican, carried the message ``Go Home, Hillary'' on its side. 
</P>
<P>
	It was clear evidence of the extreme emotions her Senate  
candidacy in New York has generated. ``Carpetbagger'' signs greeted 
the woman who has never lived or worked in New York and now wants 
to replace fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the Senate. 
He is retiring at the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at Moynihan's family farm near Oneonta that Mrs. Clinton  
made it clear on Wednesday that she understood a transformation was 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's new for me is being on this side of the microphone and  
talking for myself,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also answered the carpetbagger charge at Moynihan's farm.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I am for is maybe as important, if not more important,  
than where I am from,'' she said, pledging to be a ``strong and 
effective advocate on behalf of the people of New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Moynihan has often been at odds with the Clinton  
administration, he wholeheartedly endorsed Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope she will go all the way,'' he said, after giving the  
first lady a tour of the schoolhouse office on his farm. ``I mean 
to go all the way with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan and Mrs. Clinton, the first wife of a president to run  
for public office, delivered their remarks to more than 200 
reporters and photographers gathered at his farm. More than 30 
television crews recorded the event staged in the rolling hills 
outside Oneonta. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is expected to be unopposed in her quest for the  
Democratic nomination. On the Republican side, the Senate seat is 
being eyed by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and two 
congressmen from Long Island, Rick Lazio and Peter King. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls show Mrs. Clinton tied with or trailing Giuliani.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked to respond to Mrs. Clinton's remarks, the mayor said, ``It  
doesn't make sense for me to respond to someone exploring and 
listening and announcing that they're going to explain to us at 
some point in the future what they're for. When she explains what 
she's for and if I'm running against her, then I will respond to 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Launches N.Y. Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DAVENPORT, N.Y. (AP) -- Launching her historic campaign for  
the Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton pledged today to be a ``strong 
and effective advocate on behalf of the people of New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was immediately asked to address criticism that she is a  
``carpetbagger'' for choosing to seek election from a state where 
she has never lived or worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I am for is maybe as important, if not more important  
than where I am from,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was introduced by the man she hopes to succeed,  
retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. ``I hope she will go all the 
way,'' he said, after giving the first lady a tour of his farm. ``I 
mean to go all the way with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan and Mrs. Clinton delivered their remarks to more than  
200 reporters and cameramen gathered at the farm. More than 30 
television crews recorded the event staged amid the rolling hills 
outside of Oneonta. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's exploratory committee will pay for her New York  
trip, including reimbursing the federal government for use of 
aircraft. However, Mrs. Clinton will continue to get 
taxpayer-funded Secret Service protection during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving the Moynihan farm, Mrs. Clinton stopped at Brooks'  
House of Bar-B-Que in Oneonta for lunch. Just inside the door 
several people yelled, ``Go home, Hillary.'' A larger number told 
the protesters, ``You go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, appearing eased and relaxed, described her  
campaign tour of New York as a ``listening tour'' that will bring 
her in touch with ordinary New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be listening very hard,'' she said. ``I'm going  
to be learning a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I care deeply about the issues that are important in this  
state that I've already been learning about and hearing about,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them, she said, were providing ``good quality'' education  
and health care and ``making sure the economy is built in a way 
that creates good jobs in every region in the state of New York.'' 
She criticized the Republican Congress over welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The only first lady to run for public office, Mrs. Clinton  
pledged to make sure that New York gets its fair share from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	On a New York-specific question about trade with Canada, she  
deferred to Moynihan, saying, ``Well, I'm going to let the expert 
speak on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time the first lady announced her candidacy, President  
Clinton was aboard a helicopter, on his way to an Indian 
reservation in Pine Ridge, S.D. as part of his national poverty 
tour. After her news conference, he called his wife to find out how 
her campaign debut had gone and to wish her well, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	At her arrival at the Binghamton Airport, Mrs. Clinton was  
greeted by about 50 supporters, including state Democratic 
chairwoman Judith Hope and former state Democratic chairman John 
Burns. Outside the airport, about three dozen supporters waved 
placards while further along the road a tractor-trailer carried a 
sign that read ``Go home Hillary'' in large letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton spotted the supporters and, emulating her husband's  
campaign style, stopped her eight-vehicle motorcade to visit 
briefly with the group. 
</P>
<P>
	As the supporters shouted ``Run Hillary, Run,'' Mrs. Clinton  
said, ``Thank you all, so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton formed a committee Tuesday to explore a run for the  
Senate. That allows her to raise and spend money for political 
purposes, like a full-fledged candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I run, I would be a strong and effective advocate on behalf  
of the people of New York,'' she said today. 
</P>
<P>
	She is not expected to face any opposition for the Democratic  
nomination. On the Republican side, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
and Reps. Rick Lazio and Peter King are considering Senate races. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls show Mrs. Clinton either tied or trailing Giuliani.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Mrs. Clinton has incredible name recognition by virtue  
of her position as first lady, some of the Clinton administration's 
baggage followed her as she launched her Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the Whitewater investigation, Mrs. Clinton said, ``I  
think that New Yorkers will make their own judgments about that. I 
think we've moved beyond all of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On fulfilling her duties as first lady while running a Senate  
campaign, she said, ``You know, it is not so dissimilar from 
someone, for example, being in the Congress and running for the 
Senate, or being a governor and running for another office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A June poll from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute found  
that 53 percent of registered voters statewide do not believe Mrs. 
Clinton understands the issues and problems facing New York, up 
from 43 percent in a March poll from the Hamden, Conn.-based 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, including Giuliani, have been making much of the  
fact that Mrs. Clinton is an outsider.

<HEADLINE> Delta Wants To Polish Reputation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In other places, folks complain about the  
weather. In Atlanta, if it's not about traffic, the griping is 
probably about Delta Air Lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The hometown carrier, Georgia's largest private employer with  
nearly 31,000 employees, has been trying to reverse a plummet in 
its reputation for customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	But Delta-bashing is a popular sport, and area newspapers  
frequently have columns and letters harping on the latest affronts. 
</P>
<P>
	``From most of what I hear,'' said Christopher McGinnis, who  
produces a newsletter for frequent travelers and writes a weekly 
column for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ``that as much as the 
upper echelon of Delta would like to think that things are getting 
better, the rank-and-file travelers think it's just as bad, if not 
worse, than before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perception of airline service overall has been declining  
steadily in the United States. Department of Transportation 
statistics show air travel complaints have risen the past three 
years, up 28 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong economy means more people are flying, which also means  
longer lines and more crowding. And Delta, which dominates 
Atlanta's busy Hartsfield International Airport with more than 600 
flights daily, has the added burden of an early 1990s cost-cutting 
wave that submerged its image of friendly efficiency and Southern 
hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for a company like Delta or Coca-Cola or a few other  
companies that are part of the fabric of the community, the 
expectations are very, very high,'' said Vicki Escarra, named last 
year to the newly created Delta position of executive vice 
president for customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of our customers are remembering what we were like,''  
said Ms. Escarra, a native Atlantan who joined Delta as a flight 
attendant 25 years ago. ``So we're going to have to work four times 
as hard to regain their confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leo F. Mullin, a Chicago utilities executive who became the  
first Delta chief executive officer from outside the airline, told 
shareholders at his first annual meeting in 1997 that rekindling 
employee morale and ``correction of shortcomings'' in customer 
service would be priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	He has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new  
technology and refurbishing, while reshaping Delta's management. 
He's brought in executives from other airlines and even other 
industries -- and he put Delta veteran Escarra in charge of 
improving all stages of customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was involved when Delta was great as far as service, so I  
know what that was like,'' she said. ``And I went through the tough 
times. I'm very passionate about seeing it get turned around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delta, the nation's largest carrier in terms of passengers, was  
in June awarded Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine's award 
as the ``Best-Managed Major Airline'' for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But regular fliers quickly cite continued misfires -- a change  
last year making it harder to get upgrades; cutting out free 
sandwiches on many flights; a short-lived $2 surcharge on tickets 
not booked at Delta's Web site, and another short-lived move to 
charge ``popular prices'' for drinks in airport Crown Rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly Atlanta Business Chronicle in May ran a cartoon with  
a message board showing ``customer service-delayed...customer 
relations-canceled'' and a passenger saying: ``This must be the 
Delta counter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Escarra agreed that perception continues to be a problem and  
that ``we need to do a better job of telling our story: Yes, we did 
have problems, but here's where we are currently, and let us tell 
you what we have planned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you have gaffes that will happen,'' said Andy Deane,  
a Delta captain and spokesman for the pilots' union, which has been 
critical of Delta management. ``I think overall, Mullin's team has 
done a pretty good job of addressing customer satisfaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal figures released on July 6 showed that Delta ranked  
fourth among U.S. carriers in each of three categories; on-time 
arrivals, fewest mishandled bags, and fewest customer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Escarra said from that base of improvement, fliers will see  
a series of changes, large and small, over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta is beginning to roll out technology to speed check-in and  
boarding, including software that will provide information to both 
Delta agents and customers with a card swipe, as well as enable 
agents to manage seat inventories with a few keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital message boards and television monitors in key airports  
will provide faster, more complete information on the status of 
flights, Delta says, and check-in kiosks and two-stage security 
checks will reduce lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta also plans to post ticket agents at some Atlanta mass  
transit stations, provide close airport parking for regular fliers, 
and even offer a limousine service. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ms. Escarra said, with the new technology will come a series  
of small, but important improvements, ranging from breakfasts for 
morning travelers, free drinks or discounts for customers who had 
service problems, and making sure employees smile, greet customers 
by name, and thank them for their business -- ``the things we used 
to do day in and day out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delta has even produced its own, critic-free newspaper, called  
``The Atlanta Journey-Destination.'' It tells the story of how 
Delta became ``the greatest airline in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's dated July 22, 2001.

<HEADLINE> Reputed Mob Associate Get 8 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A reputed associate of the Bonanno crime family  
who used mob clout to force Wall Street brokers to promote the 
stock of an Arizona company has been sentenced to eight years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Lombardo, 47, apologized Tuesday for his role in a 1997  
conspiracy that made participants more than $1.3 million in illicit 
profits. The case was the largest ever to involve mobsters trying 
to manipulate stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to apologize to the courts and my family for putting  
them through all of this,'' said Lombardo, one of four men who 
admitted attempting to manipulate the price of HealthTech 
International Inc., of Mesa, Ariz., owner of health and fitness 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardo also was ordered to pay $200,000 in restitution and was  
told to avoid organized crime members. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the company's stock rose after the participants  
made a deal with the company's chairman and then brokers convinced 
unwitting buyers that the stock was worth eight times more than it 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a federal jury convicted HealthTech chairman Gordon  
Hall, 45, of racketeering, securities fraud and wire fraud. He 
awaits sentencing.

<HEADLINE> World Cup To Be Soccer Showcase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An expected sellout crowd of 90,000,  
including President Clinton, watching the United States and China 
play for the Women's World Cup title in the historic Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't set it up any better,'' forward Cindy Parlow said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The pageantry, the raucous fans and the world's two best teams  
make Saturday's final at the Pasadena stadium a showcase event for 
women's soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's talked about this World Cup as history in the  
making and it's because of all those things,'' forward Tiffany 
Milbrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point I like is there were 80,000 people watching the  
men's World Cup final. There's going to 90,000 watching the women's 
World Cup final,'' she said. ``All those things knock the boots off 
everybody because they weren't expecting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1994 men's World Cup final, Brazil defeated Italy on  
penalty kicks after regulation ended in a scoreless tie in front of 
a sellout crowd at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still remember the fabulous atmosphere, but the game still  
lagged behind,'' FIFA communications director Keith Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ask most people what they thought of the final of 1994,  
they'll say disappointed because there were no goals and they 
finished on penalties. The game's got to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parlow predicted a low-scoring final because the United States  
and China play well-organized defense. But that doesn't mean 
viewers will be yawning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams love to attack, love to take chances going forward  
and that's very exciting for the fans,'' she said. ``Both teams 
will attack at all costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United States coach Tony DiCicco said a lot of goals aren't  
necessary to create a memorable game. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as there's attacking soccer and teams trying to score  
goals and plays by the goalkeepers and near-misses, it doesn't have 
to be a lot of goals,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be two teams that are fit, that are ready, that  
are going to go out to win this game and they're not going to hold 
anything back,'' he said. ``They're going to play attractive 
soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because many of the Americans and Chinese have worked years to  
reach this level, Milbrett said, ``We don't have to make sure we're 
reminding each other to play high level, it's just going to be 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, it always comes down to the game,''  
FIFA's Cooper said. ``I'm pretty confident that Saturday's going to 
be a good day.''

<HEADLINE> Sony To Exit US Mobile Phone Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese electronics giant Sony Corp. plans to stop  
selling mobile phones in North America, the company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony will withdraw from the American market to concentrate its  
resources on development of next-generation digital mobile phones, 
the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony was a latecomer to the American mobile phone market,  
starting there in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will try to find jobs at other U.S. subsidiaries for  
the 200 employees now working in the mobile phone unit, it said.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Fuels Girls' Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Lisa White jumps in the air and heads the soccer ball, making  
her brown braid slap wildly. Around her, teammates practice their 
dribbling and long kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa, an 11-year-old from Gardena, Calif., already has her  
soccer future mapped out: She wants to be on her high school team, 
win an athletic scholarship to UCLA and then play professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like that a lot,'' she said, grinning.  
</P>
<P>
	So would many in a new generation of young, female soccer fans  
whose passion for the game has been heightened by the Women's World 
Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
	TV ratings for World Cup soccer have exceeded those for NHL  
playoff games, and the successful U.S. team is regularly drawing 
sellout crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when the Americans aren't playing, more than 22,000 people,  
mostly girls and women, have turned out for matches. Hair dyed red, 
white and blue and faces painted with American flags are de rigueur 
in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has become so popular with mainstream America, not  
just the soccer fans,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said. ``They're 
such a wonderful group of women that once people got to know them, 
it's just steamrolled. It's awesome to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a drastic change from 1991, when the American women won the  
World Cup in China. That victory barely registered a blip in U.S. 
newspapers or on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years later, the United States is in a position to win the  
World Cup again. This time, millions will be watching. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States plays China for the championship Saturday at  
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. A sellout crowd of more than 
88,000 is expected, which would top the record of 78,972 for a 
women's sporting event, set June 19 at the World Cup opener in 
Giants Stadium in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be a soccer player after watching the tournament. It  
has inspired me,'' said 11-year-old Ye Pei of Devon, Pa. ``My 
favorite player is the Chinese goalie, because she is so 
athletic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More girls are playing soccer since the 1996 Olympics, when the  
U.S. women won a gold medal, said Mike Nelson, a regional 
coordinator and coach of American Youth Soccer Organization teams 
in Torrance, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``The girls are seeing there's an opportunity,'' said Nelson, a  
father of four girls. ``My youngest knows the girl players by name 
now. Where she was big on Ken Griffey Jr., it's Mia Hamm now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 8.6 million soccer players in the United States, 2.5  
million are girls, according to AYSO. About 635,000 boys and girls, 
ages 5 to 18, play in AYSO's 1,000 leagues nationwide. Forty 
percent are female. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson is projecting an enrollment of 44 percent girls in his  
region's leagues this fall, up from 38 percent five years ago. The 
first female players allowed in AYSO in 1971 now are mothers, and 
he credits them with enrolling their daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Brittany Stevens, 12, of Torrance was introduced to soccer by  
her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said it would be good for me because I like to kick  
things,'' Brittany said. ``You're in the game to have fun and not 
just for competition. It's fun to be aggressive, roll in the mud 
and slide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said the numbers of female players in the under-6,  
under-8 and under-10 divisions are on the rise. He expects six of 
seven divisions in his region to set records this fall for 
participation by girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Alyssa Baydar, 10, comes from a soccer-crazy family. Her father  
introduced her to the sport when she was 5, and her 13-year-old 
sister plays, too. The Torrance family watches World Cup matches 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	``They teach me if I make a mistake how to correct it and what I  
can do better in the next game,'' she said, referring to Hamm and 
Brazilian sensation Sissi. 
</P>
<P>
	Girls tend to stick with soccer for years, while boys often skip  
from football to basketball to baseball, Nelson said. He said the 
girls play better, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The girls play a more teamwork-based game. The girls don't get  
on each other when a mistake is made. They kind of band together,'' 
Nelson said. ``The boys' game is sometimes a little faster, but 
it's also a little more out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. midfielder Julie Foudy believes kids accustomed to  
following individual sports such as figure skating and gymnastics 
enjoy seeing a team of Americans succeeding together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team is a special group because we've been playing  
together for so long and there's a bond there that people notice. 
That's an attraction to the kids,'' she said. ``We have fun when we 
play, we have fun when we're together, so I think they're attracted 
to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a World Cup quarterfinal between Norway and Sweden,  
11-year-old girls Jamie Loney and Laura Adams of Pleasanton, 
Calif., wore painted American flags on their faces and chanted: 
``Girls rule! Boys drool! Soccer's cool!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's unusual for girls our age to be so into sports,''  
Jamie said, ``but when I look at the players, I just know it's 
something I want to do when I get older.''

<HEADLINE> Clashes in Iraq After Executions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Tribesmen in southern Iraq have clashed with  
army soldiers and militiamen of the ruling Baath Party after three 
clan members were executed, two Iraqi opposition groups said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based Iraqi Communist Party and the Iran-based  
Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq said the tribesmen 
killed several party members, including two senior security 
officials, in a retaliatory attack Sunday against their offices in 
the town of Rumaitha. 
</P>
<P>
	The following day, army units from President Saddam Hussein's  
forces were sent to attack residential areas where members of Albu 
Hassan tribe live, the two groups said in separate statements faxed 
to The Associated Press in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy battles ensued and the defenders were able to repulse the  
army attack, inflicting heavy losses among the soldiers, they said, 
adding that more Iraqi troops were being sent from neighboring 
provinces. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the clashes erupted after the execution of the three  
tribesmen men on alleged charges of drug trafficking. The tribesmen 
denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions in southern Iraq have been high since the Feb. 19  
assassination of the Muslim Shiite leader Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq 
al-Sader. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi dissidents have reported clashes since al-Sader's death in  
several parts of the country, including the capital, Baghdad. The 
government admitted that there have been disturbances but blamed 
them on Iran-based opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumaitha, 150 miles south of Baghdad, is in the heartland of the  
mainly Shiite Muslim southern Iraq and is a hotbed for opposition 
to Saddam's Sunni Muslim government.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A lawyer who helped make former Gov.  
Jim Guy Tucker a multimillionaire in a bankruptcy scam had his 
community service sentence cut in half Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Haley, a former co-defendant with Tucker in a tax-avoidance  
case, had also requested that his travel restrictions be eased, but 
the judge reserved judgment on that issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley pleaded guilty in February 1998 to a misdemeanor for his  
role as Tucker's lawyer in a $13 million cable television deal in 
the 1980s. Government prosecutors claimed Tucker, Haley and a third 
person set up a sham bankruptcy to avoid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley was sentenced to three years' probation, during which he  
is to perform eight hours of community service work per week -- a 
total of more than 1,200 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley's attorney said Haley had already served 590 hours at  
Arkansas Children's Hospital.

<HEADLINE> Nikkei Rises in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen early  
Thursday amid further weakness in the euro. Japan's key stock index 
rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.34 yen in early trading, up 0.38 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
122.23 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 32.44  
points, or 0.18 percent, to 17,991.34 in the first one hour of 
trading. On Wednesday, the average closed up 91.83 points, or 0.51 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's advance against the yen  
derived from its continued strength against the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants were yet to grasp where the euro's floor  
might be, as the European currency fell to another new low against 
the dollar early in the Asian session. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0186 in early trading, down from  
$1.0243 late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Japanese currency, the euro was quoted at 124.56

	On the stock market, prices opened lower on profit-taking but  
settled down somewhat after Japan's Cabinet approved a

	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the

	HOUSTON (AP) -- Sheryl Swoopes, the leading vote-getter for the  
WNBA All-Star Game, and Western Conference starters Cynthia Cooper 
and Tina Thompson combined for 50 points Tuesday night as Houston 
beat the Minnesota Lynx 80-54. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper had 21 points and nine assists, one shy of her career  
high; Swoopes added 15 points; and Thompson, who didn't get on the

<HEADLINE>  McGwire, Sosa To Start All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Big Mac and Sammy, the stars of last season,  
will be starting together in the All-Star game for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire, who hit a record 70 home runs last year, was  
elected Tuesday for his seventh start and 11th appearance. Sammy 
Sosa, who leads with 32 this season, will be making his first start 
and third appearance when the All-Stars come out at Boston's Fenway 
Park next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say thank you to all the people who voted for me. I  
feel pretty proud of myself,'' said Sosa, whose first career home 
run came at Fenway against Roger Clemens on June 21, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year Arizona Diamondbacks were the only team to place  
two players in the starting lineup for next Tuesday night's game: 
Matt Williams won at third base and Jay Bell overtook Houston's 
Craig Biggio in the final week to win at second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely, extremely surprised,'' Bell said. ``Craig has  
been the fair-haired second baseman in the National League. He's 
deserved it. He's been a great player over the years. For me to be 
elected over him is a great honor and truly unexpected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza of the New York Mets will start at catcher for the  
sixth straight season and make his seventh appearance overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never get tired of going there,'' Piazza said. ``As long as  
I am elected or selected, I will feel honored to go. It is probably 
the most fun you can have as a player, hanging out with the rest of 
the guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's Barry Larkin held off the Mets' Rey Ordonez at  
shortstop, and Colorado's Larry Walker and San Diego's Tony Gwynn 
were elected to join Sosa in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, elected to his 15th All-Star game and 11th starting spot,  
won't play because of a calf injury that has put him on the 
disabled list for the second time this season. But he will make the 
trip to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted a chance to play in Fenway, but being on the  
DL, I can't,'' he said. ``It's not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, one of the few bright spots in the Chicago Cubs' dismal  
season, was the NL's leading vote-getter with 2,315,204, finishing 
third overall in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. (2,918,055) led all players  
for the fourth straight year and fifth time overall and was 
followed by Cleveland second baseman Roberto Alomar (2,793,891). 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, second in the NL with 27 homers, received the  
second-highest NL vote total, leading first basemen with 1,669,066. 
</P>
<P>
	He wishes the All-Star break was longer than three days.  
</P>
<P>
	``All the other sports have four to five days off,'' he said,  
``and I've never understood why baseball doesn't give the guys that 
play in the All-Star Game and extra day off just to get back to the 
cities they're going to play their games in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who trailed Biggio 697,326 to 658,407 in totals announced  
last week, finished with 1,203,902, about 32,000 ahead of his 
Houston rival, who wound up at 1,171,574. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this week, none of the votes cast on the Internet had  
been included in the weekly totals, and Bell benefited from 
Arizona's promotional push. Fans were allowed to vote up to 22 
times on the Internet -- the average number of home games for each 
team during the balloting. Sosa gained nearly 1 million votes in 
the final week of counting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for him and I hope he goes up there and plays  
well,'' Biggio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, who led Ordonez by fewer than 10,000 votes last week,  
won by a wide margin, 858,203 to 799,858. Larkin will be making his 
10th All-Star appearance, his fourth as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker will be making his fourth appearance, his third straight  
as a starter. Williams, a five-time All-Star, returns to the game 
for the first time since 1996 and will make his fourth start. For 
Bell, it's his second appearance and first start. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some satisfaction for me because I got to see  
firsthand what they went through last year,'' Diamondbacks manager 
Buck Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, Gwynn, McGwire, Piazza and Williams get $50,000 bonuses,  
and Walker gets $25,000. Griffey, who earned a $100,000 bonus for 
getting elected and leading the AL voting, gets an additional 
$25,000 for getting the most votes in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	AL starters were announced Monday. In addition to Griffey and  
Alomar, the lineup includes Cleveland's Jim Thome at first, and 
Manny Ramirez and Kenny Lofton in the outfield. They will be joined 
by Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez, Boston shortstop Nomar 
Garciaparra, Baltimore third baseman Cal Ripken and Tampa Bay 
designated hitter Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers and reserves for both leagues will be picked today.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks bobbed and weaved into record territory  
today as the beginning of the second-quarter earnings-report season 
injected uncertainty into the market. After trading in a narrow

previous record of 11,139.24, set last Friday. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 and Nasdaq composite index also set records, posting 
modest gains after shifting in and out of positive territory 
throughout the session. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 7.74 to

	Fla. Jury Finds Tobacco Cos. Liable  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The jury in the first class-action lawsuit by  
smokers ever to go to trial found today that cigarette makers 
produced a defective product that causes emphysema, lung cancer and 
other illnesses -- a ruling that could expose the industry to 
billions in damages. The jury, which deliberated over a complicated 
10-question verdict form for eight days, will return in the next 
phase to determine damages. Their decision could prove to be the 
industry's most dire courtroom loss yet, since the plaintiffs are 
seeking at least $200 billion. The lawsuit was filed in 1994 on 
behalf of as many as 500,000 sick Florida smokers and the heirs of 
those who died.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer hacker victims in recentl weeks have

main Web site, but experts warn of an emerging threat to consumers 
from the next generation of technology. This technology includes 
new high-speed connections to the Internet over cable TV or and new 
digital phone lines that are permanently logged on. Higher speeds 
carry higher risks: Hackers even thousands of miles away could 
anonymously probe household computers over the Internet and rummage 
through private e-mail, documents and bank records. ``It vastly and 
immediately multiplies the amount of poorly protected computers on 
the Internet ripe for the picking,'' said Lucas Graves, an analyst

<HEADLINE> Excess Military Property Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Every year, the military marks more than $20  
billion worth of excess property for transfer to other agencies or 
sale, but some of it just disappears from Pentagon records. 
</P>
<P>
	Items costing $2.7 billion, including sensitive weapons parts  
and equipment that might be pilfered, were sent for disposal but 
never recorded as received by any disposal offices in fiscal 1998, 
according to congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon acknowledges the problem but says it's more  
clerical than criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	A General Accounting Office report cites only one incident where  
military personnel determined a likely theft -- the disappearance of 
a $424 camera lens. Most of the discrepancies are due to faulty 
record-keeping, problems with data entry into computers or other 
clerical failures, it concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Items that should have received special military handling such  
as communications equipment, aircraft components and gun parts, or 
items that could easily have been pilfered constituted about half 
the property that disposal offices listed as not received, the GAO 
said in reporting on its examination of in-transit records. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was the third in a series of congressional inquiries  
into problems with disposal of surplus military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	A report last year found that some of the $22 billion worth of  
equipment sold in fiscal 1997 may have caused the leaking of 
sensitive military technology to U.S. and foreign buyers. A year 
earlier, a GAO report found billions of dollars worth of property 
was being destroyed that might have been sold for civilian use 
without compromising security or flight safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Pentagon efforts to reform its complex system for  
disposing of surplus property, problems persist, the new report 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Management controls over excess property being shipped to  
disposal are not working effectively, leaving the property 
vulnerable to loss or undetected theft,'' said the report, sent to 
Rep. Floyd Spence, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. 
Copies also went to Defense Secretary William Cohen and to the 
heads of the armed services. 
</P>
<P>
	The report included a response from Defense Deputy  
Undersecretary Roger W. Kallock, who said the department concurs 
with its conclusions and is addressing its recommendations for 
closer control of excess military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon ``believes the property is not being lost and that  
most record discrepancies are due to administrative errors,'' the 
report notes, but it adds that the administrative problems are 
``systemic and widespread.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Are Mixed; Dow Up 3.49 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today as the market  
awaited second-quarter corporate earnings reports. Rising bond 
yields also pushed stocks down. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 3.49 at 11,138.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed, having shifted in and out  
of positive territory throughout the session. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500 index was up 2.30 at 1,390.42, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was down 4.57 at 2,732.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts expect mostly robust earnings reports from  
U.S. companies, whose profits continue to grow along with the 
nation's economy. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. expect 
earnings for the companies on the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 list to 
rise 11.4 percent for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But with market indexes near record levels, analysts say  
investors may punish any companies that miss or merely meet 
published estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is waiting to sink its teeth into some solid  
numbers,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock 
&AMP; Co. ``Having moved up sharply last week, the market is just 
marking time until we see exactly what these second-quarter numbers 
look like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts believe last week's stunning gains, which produced  
records for most major indexes and a 586.68-point gain in the Dow, 
were fed by the expectation of strong earnings. This week, as the 
first few reports hit the market, there may be little room to 
extend gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Waste Management plunged 19 3/8 to 34 3/16 after saying it  
expects to miss Wall Street estimates by as much as 12 cents per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa, meanwhile, proved that good news isn't always enough,  
falling 2 3/16 to 60 15/16 after reporting earnings of 64 cents per 
share, a penny ahead of expectations. Alcoa, considered a cyclical 
stock that thrives in times of economic growth, has been the 
strongest gainer among Dow components so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! fell 9 1/16 to 166 1/16, continuing a slide that began  
Tuesday afternoon. The Internet search engine provider was to 
report earnings after the market closed today, and while Wall 
Street has called for earnings of 8 cents per share, traders said 
Yahoo! might be hurt if it missed the ``whisper number'' of 9 cents 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Whisper numbers are unofficial forecasts circulated among  
traders and on Internet trading sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial public offering of Musicmaker.com benefited from  
renewed interest in new Internet stocks. The Web-based company, 
which lets customers create customized compact discs, was priced at 
14 and rose to 23 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising bond yields held stocks lower. This afternoon, the yield  
on the 30-year Treasury bond was at 6.07, up from 6.03 percent late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 614.41 million 
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 0.25 at 654.52, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was off 2.41 at 802.48. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000, which measures the performance of smaller  
companies, fell 4.54 to 452.01.

	The deal represents the first step in Log On America's plan to  
buy Internet and local telephone companies nationwide so it can 
bundle together a variety of telecommunications services. 
</P>
<P>
	CyberTours, which will become the Northeast operations center  
for Log On America, needed a partnership with a bigger company to 
take its network to the next level technologically, said President 
Stephen Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
	Log On America shipped equipment to Portland Tuesday that will  
allow the delivery of high-speed Internet connections -- better than 
a megabit per second -- over ordinary telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Employment in Kennebunk is likely to double from its current  
level of 75 over the next few years as the company aggressively 
adds subscribers to its 25,000-user base, Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Log On America also plans to file an application with the Maine  
Public Utilities Commission to become a local phone carrier, said 
David Paolo, chairman and chief executive officer of Log On 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	It already is a competitive local phone carrier in Massachusetts  
and Rhode Island, has an application for that status pending in 
Connecticut, and plans to file papers in Vermont and New Hampshire 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Log On American has the capability of providing cable television  
programming through its high-speed connections and is negotiating 
with programmers to make that service available, Paolo said.

<HEADLINE>  McGwire, Sosa To Start All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Big Mac and Sammy, the stars of last season,  
will be starting together in the All-Star game for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire, who hit a record 70 home runs last year, was  
elected Tuesday for his seventh start and 11th appearance. Sammy 
Sosa, who leads with 32 this season, will be making his first start 
and third appearance when the All-Stars come out at Boston's Fenway 
Park next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say thank you to all the people who voted for me. I  
feel pretty proud of myself,'' said Sosa, whose first career home 
run came at Fenway against Roger Clemens on June 21, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year Arizona Diamondbacks were the only team to place  
two players in the starting lineup for next Tuesday night's game: 
Matt Williams won at third base and Jay Bell overtook Houston's 
Craig Biggio in the final week to win at second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely, extremely surprised,'' Bell said. ``Craig has  
been the fair-haired second baseman in the National League. He's 
deserved it. He's been a great player over the years. For me to be 
elected over him is a great honor and truly unexpected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza of the New York Mets will start at catcher for the  
sixth straight season and make his seventh appearance overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never get tired of going there,'' Piazza said. ``As long as  
I am elected or selected, I will feel honored to go. It is probably 
the most fun you can have as a player, hanging out with the rest of 
the guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's Barry Larkin held off the Mets' Rey Ordonez at  
shortstop, and Colorado's Larry Walker and San Diego's Tony Gwynn 
were elected to join Sosa in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, elected to his 15th All-Star game and 11th starting spot,  
won't play because of a calf injury that has put him on the 
disabled list for the second time this season. But he will make the 
trip to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted a chance to play in Fenway, but being on the  
DL, I can't,'' he said. ``It's not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, one of the few bright spots in the Chicago Cubs' dismal  
season, was the NL's leading vote-getter with 2,315,204, finishing 
third overall in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. (2,918,055) led all players  
for the fourth straight year and fifth time overall and was 
followed by Cleveland second baseman Roberto Alomar (2,793,891). 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, second in the NL with 27 homers, received the  
second-highest NL vote total, leading first basemen with 1,669,066. 
</P>
<P>
	He wishes the All-Star break was longer than three days.  
</P>
<P>
	``All the other sports have four to five days off,'' he said,  
``and I've never understood why baseball doesn't give the guys that 
play in the All-Star Game and extra day off just to get back to the 
cities they're going to play their games in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who trailed Biggio 697,326 to 658,407 in totals announced  
last week, finished with 1,203,902, about 32,000 ahead of his 
Houston rival, who wound up at 1,171,574. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this week, none of the votes cast on the Internet had  
been included in the weekly totals, and Bell benefited from 
Arizona's promotional push. Fans were allowed to vote up to 22 
times on the Internet -- the average number of home games for each 
team during the balloting. Sosa gained nearly 1 million votes in 
the final week of counting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for him and I hope he goes up there and plays  
well,'' Biggio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, who led Ordonez by fewer than 10,000 votes last week,  
won by a wide margin, 858,203 to 799,858. Larkin will be making his 
10th All-Star appearance, his fourth as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker will be making his fourth appearance, his third straight  
as a starter. Williams, a five-time All-Star, returns to the game 
for the first time since 1996 and will make his fourth start. For 
Bell, it's his second appearance and first start. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some satisfaction for me because I got to see  
firsthand what they went through last year,'' Diamondbacks manager 
Buck Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, Gwynn, McGwire, Piazza and Williams get $50,000 bonuses,  
and Walker gets $25,000. Griffey, who earned a $100,000 bonus for 
getting elected and leading the AL voting, gets an additional 
$25,000 for getting the most votes in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	AL starters were announced Monday. In addition to Griffey and  
Alomar, the lineup includes Cleveland's Jim Thome at first, and 
Manny Ramirez and Kenny Lofton in the outfield. They will be joined 
by Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez, Boston shortstop Nomar 
Garciaparra, Baltimore third baseman Cal Ripken and Tampa Bay 
designated hitter Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers and reserves for both leagues will be picked today.

<HEADLINE> Collapsed Caddie in Fair Condition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYWOOD, Ill. (AP) -- A caddie who collapsed during the third  
round of the Western Open over the weekend has been transferred to 
a veterans' hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Garland Dempsey, 51, was moved to Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital  
near Maywood yesterday after being upgraded to fair condition at 
Palos Community Hospital in Palos Heights, Michele Mills, a 
spokeswoman at Palos, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hines spokeswoman Pam Surges said today that Dempsey was in  
stable condition. She declined to release any further information. 
</P>
<P>
	It is still not clear why, Dempsey, John Maginnes' longtime  
caddie, collapsed as he walked off the 15th tee Saturday. The 
temperature was in the 90s, with the humidity making it feel like 
more than 100 degrees at the Cog Hill Golf and Country Club in 
Lemont. 
</P>
<P>
	Maginnes and Dempsey had just left the 15th tee when Maginnes  
said he heard Dempsey make a noise and the golf bag drop. Matt 
Moore, an ABC employee, performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
until paramedics arrived. Paramedics used a defibrillator to 
restore Dempsey's pulse, then took him by ambulance to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Maginnes continued playing and finished in sixth place.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Driver Atwood Becoming Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- At 18 years old, Casey Atwood already  
has some of the habits of a veteran NASCAR driver, both on the 
track and in the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibit A: After 76 laps on the tail of leader Jeff Green in  
Sunday's Diehard 250 Busch Series race in Milwaukee, Atwood bumped 
him out of the way on the last lap to win. Green called it a cheap 
shot. Atwood called it racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibit B: After becoming the youngest winner in Busch Series  
history, Atwood played it cool without an exuberant celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't want to get on top of my car and jump up and  
down like an idiot,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I was excited. Probably the most excited I've ever been in  
racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood won't turn 19 until Aug. 25. Before Sunday's victory he  
was already the youngest driver ever to win a Busch Series pole, 
that coming last season when he was 17. He also won the Diehard 250 
from the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big thrill to win that first one,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Green, who is third in the Busch Series points standings, said  
the last-lap bump from Atwood was unwarranted and vowed never to 
forget it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just part of it,'' Atwood said. ``Jeff would have done  
the same thing to me if he'd been in my place. I've seen him do it 
to other drivers lots of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory gives Atwood $269,930 in winnings for the season.  
He's been in 17 of the 18 Busch Series races, with four finishes in 
the top five. He's ranked 10th in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood isn't satisfied.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some bad luck and I've torn up some cars,'' he told  
The Tennessean. ``We've had to spend a lot of time fixing them. 
Hopefully I can keep from wrecking so much, and that will give the 
crew more time to work on other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood ran 13 Busch races last year, so he isn't officially a  
rookie. Still, he's seeing some tracks for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still learning, which makes it all the more amazing that  
he's been able to do so well,'' said Clarence Brewer, owner of the 
Brewco Motorsports team that Atwood races for. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just think what he'll be capable of once he gets some  
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Brewer said, Atwood's relative success does not change  
the timetable for graduating him to Winston Cup racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to stick with our plan, which is to concentrate on  
the Busch Series this season,'' Brewer said. ``Next year if things 
go right we might try a Cup race or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a whole new game on that level. ... When Casey moves up,  
we want to do it right.''

<HEADLINE>  U.S. To Suggest Mideast Peace Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his Mideast mediators  
are likely to move in quickly with their own peace proposals now 
that Israel's new prime minister, Ehud Barak, has formed a 
government and put peacemaking with the Arabs at the top of his 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	At Clinton's invitation, Barak will come here for talks at the  
White House July 15 and July 19, planning also to meet with 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Secretary of Defense 
William Cohen, as well as key members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has declared Israel's key to security is peace with all  
its neighbors -- a formula Barak says has his highest priority. 
</P>
<P>
	In a gesture of urgency, Clinton said he would outline his views  
right after talking to Barak, and then went on to touch on two of 
them: support for Palestinian aspirations for a homeland and for 
Palestinian refugees living wherever they like. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak rejected Clinton's statement on refugees as unacceptable  
and called for clarification. The president has not reopened the 
red-hot subject, but administration officials in a damage-control 
operation told Israel privately that the refugee problem could be 
decided only through negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also called on Israel to carry out the land-for-security  
accord he helped reach in October at the Wye River talks in 
Maryland between Benjamin Netanyahu, then Israel's prime minister, 
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wye River accord calls for Israel to relinquish an  
additional 13.1 percent of the West Bank. Netanyahu halted after 
giving up 2 percent, saying Arafat had failed to hold up his end of 
the bargain when he didn't root out terrorist cells on land already 
under the Palestinian Authority's control. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton and other U.S. policy-makers habitually say all  
land-for-peace decisions are up to the parties and the United 
States would not presume to impose terms on them, a private push or 
even a nudge in one direction or another can be telling. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak spoke briefly to Clinton by telephone Monday night,  
telling him he intended to meet first with Arafat, Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak and King Abdullah of Jordan before visiting 
Washington. Today, Barak's office issued a statement that he would 
be in Washington late next week to confer with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In public, Barak is asserting a determination to pursue peace  
accords. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we have thousands of problems on the public agenda,''  
he said, ``Nothing is more important in my view than that supreme 
mission ... putting an end to the 100-year conflict in the Middle 
East.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He appears willing to negotiate with Syria as well as with the  
Palestinians. And, like Netanyahu, Barak would like to find a way 
to close down the Israeli security zone inside southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	At a minimum, Syria wants to get back all of the Golan Heights,  
the strategic plateau along Israel's northern border that it lost 
in the 1967 Six-Day war. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, as military chief of staff, proposed retaining at least  
some of the land as a security barrier. But later, he served as 
foreign minister in the government led by Shimon Peres that advised 
Syria in U.S.-mediated talks it could have the Golan Heights for 
the right terms. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear where Barak stands now on that contested  
enclave, nor how much of the West Bank he would give to the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said he wanted to resume the stalemated negotiations, but  
also that he was unwilling to share sovereignty over Jerusalem or 
uproot all the Jewish settlements on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat is aiming for a state with its capital in Jerusalem.  
Clinton has come within a whisker of endorsing Palestinian 
statehood and has blocked transfer of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem 
from Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
	In selecting his Cabinet, the new prime minister has made moves  
that suggest he may not be as conciliatory to the Arabs as the 
Clinton administration might wish. 
</P>
<P>
	Peres, the former prime minister who played a key role in  
land-for-peace deals, was denied his bid to oversee negotiations 
and given a minor post as head of a new regional development 
ministry. Yossi Beilin, an architect of the landmark Oslo accords 
with the Palestinians, did not get the plum assignment he was 
looking for, either. 
</P>
<P>
	David Levy, foreign minister in two Likud-led governments, will  
be Barak's foreign minister. Levy is inclined to take a tougher 
line than either Peres or Beilin did in reaching out to the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Peres stepped forward Tuesday with a declaration that  
Barak would resume talks quickly with all Arab parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barak is a man of his word, and what he has said, he will  
do,'' Peres told reporters at a conference in Cairo. ``It will not 
take too long before we shall see the renewal of the peace 
process.''

<HEADLINE> Texas, Oklahoma Execute Killers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man whose nickname for himself was  
``Evil'' was executed by injection Wednesday for killing a woman 
during a burglary of her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Fuller, 35, was convicted of killing a 26-year-old woman  
who was stabbed 44 times, beaten, whipped with an electrical cord 
and raped. 
</P>
<P>
	A pathologist determined she likely lived for several hours  
after the 1988 attack but couldn't scream for help because one of 
the stab wounds severed her vocal chords. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the attack, Fuller was on parole for his second  
burglary conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Fuller's accomplices received a life prison term in a  
plea bargain. Charges against a third man were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please do not mourn my death or my life. I hold no bitterness  
toward no one,'' Fuller said in his final statement. ``Just 
remember the light. I'm going to let this light shine. Remember to 
let the light shine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma early Thursday, a man convicted of killing a Tulsa  
taxi driver in 1984 during a robbery was executed by injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Lee Newsted, 45, shot Larry Buckley after the cabbie  
picked him up at the airport for a trip to his sister's home. 
Buckley, who had taken the second job to support his family, was 
dumped into a creek. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Buckley's survivors said they hoped the  
execution would bring closure to 15 years of pain, anger and grief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry will always be in our prayers and hearts and only now  
will he rest in peace,'' the family said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsted claimed he shot Buckley because the cabbie tried to rob  
him.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Sign No. 1 Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- There will be no J.D. Drew fiasco for the  
Phillies this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Myers, a 6-foot-4 right-hander likened by scouts to Curt  
Schilling, signed a minor league contract with Philadelphia on 
Wednesday. The 18-year-old from Jacksonville, Fla., got a $2.05 
million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big day,'' said Phillies manager Terry Francona, who  
stood by helplessly two years ago when negotiations broke down with 
Drew. ``Other than that, he's a high school kid. There's going to 
be some time before we see him in the big leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myers, the 12th overall pick in June's amateur draft, had 131  
strikeouts in 78 innings with an 8-2 record and a 0.80 ERA as a 
senior at Englewood High School. He will arrive in Philadelphia on 
Friday to work out before reporting to the Phillies' rookie league 
team in Clearwater, Fla., next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to have Brett in the fold,'' said scouting  
director Mike Arbuckle, who never looks forward to contract 
negotiations after Drew got away in 1997. ``We look forward to 
watching his progress. I compare him to Curt Schilling. He's got a 
strong, powerful body and is a real competitor on the mound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a flurry of moves, the Phillies also acquired veteran  
infielder Domingo Cedeno from Seattle for infielder Jose Flores. 
Cedeno, 30, gives the Phillies depth at shortstop while Desi 
Relaford recovers from a wrist injury. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Cedeno on the 25-man roster, right-hander Cliff  
Politte was optioned to Double-A Reading and Joel Bennett, a 
soft-throwing right-hander who failed as the Phillies' No. 5 
starter, was designated for assignment. The Phillies have 10 days 
to trade or release Bennett or send him outright to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope we get through this process and he accepts his  
assignment,'' general manager Ed Wade said. ``Baltimore asked 
waivers on him last year, and he opted for free agency. We'd love 
to have him back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cedeno, a switch-hitter, was released by Oakland after going to  
spring training as a non-roster player. He was signed with the 
Mariners and made 13 starts at shortstop -- while Alex Rodriguez was 
injured -- and was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma on May 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Relaford went down with a torn ligament in his right wrist  
on June 23, Alex Arias has been the Phillies' starting shortstop 
with Dave Doster as his backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't change Alex or Dave's role,'' Wade said. ``This  
gives us some measure of depth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a busy day that saw pitchers Paul Byrd, Schilling and catcher  
Mike Lieberthal selected for the NL All-Star team, the Phillies 
could breath easier with the signing of Myers. The Phillies made 
Drew the second pick in the 1997 draft, but he refused to sign for 
less than $10 million, became a free agent and ended up with the 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies chose infielder Pat Burrell with the first overall  
pick in 1998 and signed him to an $8 million, five-year contract 
that included a $3.15 million signing bonus. Burrell is batting 
.347 with 15 homers at Double-A this season, and the Phillies are 
considering moving him to the outfield.

<HEADLINE>  Spain Cops Seize 10 Tons of Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Police have confiscated an estimated 10  
tons of cocaine aboard a sailboat near Spain's Canary Islands and 
have arrested 54 people in what they say is the biggest single 
seizure of cocaine so far in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The seizure and arrest of 16 Russian crew members occurred  
Sunday, Javier Hernandez of the National Drug Control Agency said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-eight people have since been arrested in Spain in  
connection with the case, including a Colombian suspected of 
setting up the shipment, said National Police Chief Juan Contino. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat, flying a Caribbean flag, was sailing in international  
waters at the time and was scheduled to dock in Las Palmas, Canary 
Islands, on Friday. It is believed to have set out from an 
unspecified South American country, according to the El Pais 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotino told a press conference in Madrid that one of the boat's  
crew members died of a suspected heart attack suffered during 
Sunday's raid. He said the operation remained open and did not 
discount further arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation, the result of months of investigations, was  
carried out by drug enforcement and customs agents and supervised 
by National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotino said the arrested Colombian, identified as Alfonso Leon,  
was the link between Colombian drug cartels and Spanish drug gangs 
based in the northwestern region of Galicia. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian traffickers have begun using Spanish gangs to channel  
drugs through the country to destinations elsewhere in Europe, 
Cotino said. The Spanish gangs are paid with a portion of the 
shipments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said connections with gangs in Britain led authorities  
to suspect that part of the shipment was destined for England. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest cocaine seizure in Europe prior to this one was a  
six-ton shipment in Naples in 1995, according to Italian 
authorities.

<HEADLINE> Shipyard, Union Resume Bargaining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Va. (AP) -- Newport News Shipbuilding and its striking  
steelworkers resumed federally mediated contract talks Wednesday, 
with the nation's only builder of aircraft carriers prepared to 
sweeten its pension offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be pushing both parties hard'' to try to end  
the three-month strike, said Fred Reebals, a mediator with the 
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, which called the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully something can happen. No guarantees,'' Reebals said  
as he headed into the meeting at a Hampton hotel. ``It's a 
difficult negotiation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local 8888 of the United Steelworkers of America began its  
walkout April 5 over wages, pension and benefits. The union 
represents the shipyard's 9,200 hourly production and maintenance 
workers-- about half the total work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The last round of mediated talks broke down June 3.  
</P>
<P>
	At the company's annual shareholders meeting June 25, Chairman  
William Fricks indicated the company would be willing to modify its 
pension proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	That remained the case Wednesday, shipyard spokesman Mike  
Hatfield said, although he declined to discuss specifics. He would 
not say whether the company also would be willing to adjust its 
wage proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We come here with an open mind,'' Hatfield said. ``We are  
absolutely determined we will get a settlement sooner or later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local 8888 President Arnold Outlaw said that to reach a  
settlement, the shipyard will have to budge on wages and health 
care as well as pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a whole package we're trying to put together,''  
Outlaw said. ``I always try to be optimistic, but the company 
hasn't given us a whole lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strikers on the picket lines at the shipyard agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's more to it than just the pension,'' said Jimmy Hall,  
40, of Newport News, a 20-year shipyard worker who tests fuel and 
water tanks. Health insurance and wages are just as important, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall and others said they didn't think the new round of talks  
would amount to much. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he (Fricks) gives something, he will take something, and  
we'll be back right where we started,'' said Quentin Rainey, 44, of 
Norfolk, a machinist with 21 years at the shipyard. ``There will be 
no real gain when he's finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The yard had proposed a $589 monthly pension for a 30-year  
employee, up from $506, while the union wanted $900. 
</P>
<P>
	On wages, the yard offered raises over 47 months, depending on  
pay grade, that it said would boost the average employee's hourly 
wage of $13.50 by $2.49. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants across-the-board raises of $3.70 an hour over 36  
months. 
</P>
<P>
	With about 18,000 workers, Newport News Shipbuilding is the  
largest industrial employer in Virginia. The company is using 
workers who cross the picket lines, salaried employees and contract 
workers to keep running. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike was in its 94th day Wednesday. The last strike at the  
shipyard, in 1979, lasted 80 days. That dispute was over the 
shipyard's refusal to recognize the Steelworkers as the workers' 
union of choice.

<HEADLINE> Cell-Phone Charges Start With 'Send' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For those who thought a telephone call starts  
with ``hello,'' here's a wireless wake-up call that starts with 
``send.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cell phone users are not only charged for talking, but for  
ringing. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, most of the nation's big wireless calling  
companies time their customers from the moment they press the 
``send'' button on a mobile phone to the moment they hit ``end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since most companies charge for a full minute even when less  
than a minute is used, those seconds when the phone is ringing can 
really add up -- especially if a person pays extra for peak-hour 
usage, long-distance or calls made far away from home that trigger 
``roaming'' charges of 60 cents or more a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	There's generally no fee levied for unanswered calls or busy  
signals. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``send-to-end'' billing policies are spelled out in the  
contracts signed by today's 76 million cell phone users, even some 
experts and careful shoppers never imagined that the basic rules of 
telephone calls might not ring true in the wireless world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea, and I would consider myself as astute on my  
telephone charges as anybody,'' said Rex G. Mitchell, a 
telecommunications industry analyst with Banc of America Securities 
in San Francisco and a former executive with the regional phone 
company U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	``Occasionally, when I'm out of town, I will make a call and  
look at the second hand on my watch to keep it under a minute 
because I'm paying long-distance or roaming charges,'' said 
Mitchell. ``But I've been timing it from `hello' instead of from 
`send.' I won't make that mistake now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of first-minute billing policies caught the public eye  
in recent weeks after Cellular One tried to reduce the free 
``ringing time'' it gives its New England customers to 15 seconds 
from 30. The carrier was bombarded by customer complaints, and 
quickly scrapped the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the million or more people signing up for wireless  
service each month focus less on when the call begins and more on 
how many minutes are included in their monthly calling plan or the 
fees for long-distance and peak-hour calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's rationale in treating mobile phones differently  
from regular phones is that every wireless call uses the airwaves 
regardless of whether the call is successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, regular calls also use resources such as space on a  
fiber-optic cable. But the companies argue that they have far 
greater capacity in their cables than their wireless channels, and 
that the demands of carrying a regular phone signal are negligible 
compared with a wireless signal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're occupying a channel. So when you make a connection, you  
get charged from the inception of when you seize that channel,'' 
explained Jeff Battcher, a BellSouth spokesman. ``For the most 
part, it's always been that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the major companies that start the meter running from  
``send,'' not ``hello,'' are AT&AMP;T Wireless, AirTouch, Sprint PCS, 
Bell Atlantic Mobile, BellSouth Mobility and Nextel Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, since many calling plans come with hundreds of  
minutes to burn each month, a lot of mobile phone users rarely 
reach their limit and don't need to pay additional charges for 
calls that don't go through. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Litwinski, 26, an independent film maker from New York,  
pays $100 a month for a Sprint PCS plan with 1,000 minutes of air 
time so he won't have to worry about how long he talks or how many 
calls he makes. ``I never go over,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for those who frequently exceed their monthly allowance or  
sign up for cheaper plans with smaller time allotments, those 
first-minute charges can be substantial since the average user 
racks up 100 minutes a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Adkins, spokeswoman for the Council of Better Business  
Bureaus and a Cellular One customer, was also surprised to hear 
about ``send-to-end'' charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't tell you these things. I read my bill. I read all  
the flyers. It goes to show, you really have to read your 
contract.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: George Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Beating the odds one more time, George  
Jones is back from the dead and working the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest living country music singer is trying to drum up  
support for his new album, ``Cold Hard Truth,'' by talking up a 
roomful of radio programmers, who for years have refused to play 
his new music. As always, his silver hair is shellacked into place, 
and loyal wife Nancy is by his side. He gamely grins and greets the 
radio guys as though they were long-lost cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	A session of interviews at a recording studio is being held to  
take advantage of the disc jockeys' presence in town for the 
International Country Music Fan Fair, an annual festival that 
brings thousands of fans to Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, is his own best salesman as he poses for photos.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're big ol' boys, ain't you,'' he observes cheerfully, arms  
thrown around two hearty deejays, while waiting for the camera to 
click. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men are truly large, and they serve as a sharp contrast  
to the thin and frail Jones, who almost died in March after he 
crashed his Lexus into a concrete bridge near his home. An open 
pint of vodka was found in the wreckage, and he later pleaded 
guilty to driving while impaired and violating Tennessee's open 
container law. He was fined $550 and ordered to seek treatment for 
alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I died twice,'' Jones said. ``My heart stopped twice going to  
the hospital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His liver was severely lacerated, a lung collapsed and he later  
developed pneumonia. But he pulled through and appears on the way 
to a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to believe there's something to it,'' Jones said. God  
has kept him here for a reason, ``For one more job or something. So 
I'm gonna search my soul for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has spent much of his life a slave to drugs and alcohol,  
but for more than a decade before the crash he says he limited 
himself to an occasional glass of wine with dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not sure why he was drinking the day of the accident,  
though he says he had had a very hard year, overshadowed by the 
death of his former wife and partner, Tammy Wynette. He also left 
longtime record label MCA and helped his current wife with a 
serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he drank less than a half-a-pint of vodka the day of the  
accident. ``Of course, it didn't take much to get me impaired, 
because I hadn't drank in so long,'' he says. ``I was on the phone 
talking to my daughter and reaching over trying to rewind the 
(cassette) tape ... and just for a second I took my eye off the 
road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even while a heavy drinker and drug abuser, Jones was a great  
artist. Many consider him the finest country music singer of all 
time, based on more than 150 hits like ``He Stopped Loving Her 
Today,'' ``A Good Year for the Roses'' and ``If Drinkin' Don't Kill 
Me (Her Memory Will).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was born in a log cabin in Saratoga, Texas. As a child, he  
sang for money on the streets of Beaumont, Texas. He was a devotee 
of Hank Williams, Roy Acuff and Lefty Frizzell, and his early 
records sounded much like Williams'. 
</P>
<P>
	His hit, ``Why Baby Why,'' got him signed to Mercury Records in  
Nashville. Later, he began specializing in honky-tonk ballads like 
``She Thinks I Still Care'' and his famous ``A Good Year for the 
Roses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, he married Wynette and they became a hit duo. The  
teaming of two of country music's most popular singers on songs 
that seemed to mirror their private lives couldn't miss. ``We're 
Not the Jet Set,'' they sang, but fans nicknamed them ``The 
President and First Lady of Country Music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jones became increasingly lost in a fog of drugs and alcohol  
-- one tale has him driving his lawn mower to the liquor store 
because Wynette hid all his car keys so he couldn't get any booze. 
The marriage fell apart and Jones and Wynette divorced in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1980s, while continuing to abuse alcohol and drugs,  
his career still flourished. In 1980, he recorded his latter-day 
signature song, ``He Stopped Loving Her Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The turning point in his personal life came in 1983 when Jones  
wed Nancy Sepulvado, who gradually got him off drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	To the surprise of many, the support of radio stations gave out  
on him before his health. By the late '80s, Jones and many of his 
peers had been replaced by a new generation of stars like Garth 
Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones left MCA in 1998 after a string of poor-selling albums.  
Then Wynette, with whom he had renewed a friendship and worked with 
again after years of acrimony, died after battling various 
illnesses for much of her life. 
</P>
<P>
	The same year, Nancy Jones started experiencing excruciating  
headaches and it took some time for doctors to find the proper 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	While all this was going on, Jones was working on ``Cold Hard  
Truth.'' He considered it his best album in years, but wondered if 
radio stations would pass him by again. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident may have helped Jones get more attention from the  
country music radio stations that had ignored him for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``The realization that George Jones could have died has had a  
powerful impact with radio,'' said Evelyn Shriver, president of 
Jones' new record label, Asylum. ``But it wouldn't have mattered if 
this weren't such a brilliant album.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Cold Hard Truth'' is full of heartache in classic Jones  
fashion, reminiscent of his 1970s work with producer Billy 
Sherrill. The single ``Choices'' is currently rising on the charts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This album is not about trying to make George Jones seem  
hip,'' producer Keith Stegall said. ``It's just about making a 
classic George Jones album.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was recorded before the accident, the apparent  
references to it are spooky. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you weren't drinking, the music on this album might lead  
you back to it,'' Nancy Jones said jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Choices,'' is about living with the consequences of one's  
actions. ``Sinners &AMP; Saints'' rebukes people who are too 
judgmental. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only one difference between sinners and saints,''  
Jones sings. ``One is forgiving and the other one ain't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones loves it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the stuff that I've been doing before just wasn't up to  
par,'' he said. ``It's hard to get a hit song from a writer if they 
know already they're not going to get any radio play. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's all radio was looking for, for George Jones to  
come back with some good stuff and today's sound. And I just want 
to thank them for giving the old man another chance.''

<HEADLINE> Lott Holds Up Holbrooke Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate confirmation continues to look like a  
receding target for Richard Holbrooke in his long quest to be U.N. 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Four senators, including Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
are now known to have placed ``holds'' on the veteran diplomat's 
nomination, putting off a floor vote for an indeterminate period. 
And more naysayers may be waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, an investment banker and veteran diplomat, was  
announced for the post in June 1998. When the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee approved the nomination late last month, a full 
year later, it finally looked like clear sailing. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was not to be.  
</P>
<P>
	Two senators -- Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and George Voinovich,  
R-Ohio -- have made their positions on the nomination public. Two 
others, Lott and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., took their delaying 
actions without public comment. 
</P>
<P>
	And, according to several Senate Republican aides, at least two  
more senators are working behind the scenes in an effort to block 
or further delay the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The holds basically are unrelated to Holbrooke's qualifications  
for the job. Lott and McConnell are trying to apply pressure on the 
White House to nominate an Ohio law professor for a ``Republican'' 
position on the Federal Election Commission, congressional and 
administration sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The professor, Bradley A. Smith of Capital University in  
Columbus, had been recommended by Republican leaders for the 
vacancy on the commission, which is divided between two Democrats 
and two Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott spokesman John Czwartacki declined to comment on the holds.  
By tradition, any senator can block, at least for a time, any 
nomination, anonymously if he or she chooses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, on the subject of the FEC vacancy, Czwartacki said  
presidents traditionally give leaders of the other party the 
prerogative of picking their party's FEC representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a White House that tried to pick the other  
party's nominees,'' Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Voinovich is seeking to delay the nomination for other reasons.  
</P>
<P>
	Not only does Voinovich want to make sure there is a recorded  
vote on the nomination, but ``he has concerns about Holbrooke's 
nomination for policy reasons,'' said Mike Dawson, a spokesman for 
Voinovich. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley publicly put a hold on Holbrooke to protest what he  
contends is State Department retribution against a government 
employee at the U.N. mission in New York for telling members of 
Congress about waste and inefficiency at the international 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats said they hoped the delays would be  
short-lived, and characterized the new holds as an attempt by GOP 
leaders to exert leverage over the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, a former ambassador to Germany and assistant  
secretary of state, is the architect of the 1995 Bosnia peace 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Barry Toiv called Holbrooke  
``supremely qualified'' for the position. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential to our national interest that he be put in  
place and the Senate ought to vote on his nomination as soon as 
possible,'' Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	Czwartacki, the Lott spokesman, said last week that there seemed  
to be ``irreconcilable holds'' on Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, he was a little more upbeat. ``I never cease  
to be amazed at how log jams can be broken around here,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Billions For Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday  
approved a $4.12 billion loan for Mexico that is part of a larger 
package of credits. It is designed to help the country avert 
economic turmoil during and after next year's presidential 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF spokesman said the loan, to be disbursed in seven  
installments, will be available to Mexico over 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican officials said last month they had obtained $23.7  
billion in international credits and refinancing to protect the 
country when it holds presidential elections in July 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the country's economy has suffered during  
presidential transition periods -- a tendency blamed on the collapse 
of short-term strategies to prop up the economy during a campaign 
and investor wariness about a new government. 
</P>
<P>
	The package includes $6.8 billion in credits from the United  
States and Canada, Mexico's partners in the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. The World Bank is expected to provide $5.2 billion 
and the Inter-American Development Bank $3.5 billion. Mexico will 
also receive $4 billion from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The assistance package put together in Washington in mid-June is  
designed to help the Mexican government meet $8 billion in debts 
owed to foreign lenders over the next two years, including $6 
billion to the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican financial officials have said they would turn to  
official sources for funding to meet these debts because 
international capital markets have been demanding a high risk 
premium on any Mexican debt. 
</P>
<P>
	President Ernesto Zedillo's administration has vowed to try to  
prevent a recurrence of election-related economic unrest. Three 
weeks after Zedillo took over in December 1994, Mexico's peso 
plunged sharply, causing a financial crisis from which the country 
is still trying to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mexico's economy is generally considered to be less  
vulnerable than it was in 1994, the political situation is more 
volatile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has  
governed Mexico since 1929, faces unprecedented competition and is 
planning its first-ever national primary to choose a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Some polls show an opposition party candidate, Guanajuato Gov.  
Vicente Fox, leading in the race for the presidency. But the PRI 
won a crucial electoral battle Monday in the country's most 
populous state that will bolster its chances in the presidential 
voting.

<HEADLINE> Jack Klugman Sued Over Ranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMECULA, Calif. (AP) -- Jack Klugman is being sued over a horse  
ranch he sold two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ennio and Darlene Racinelli paid $3 million for the ranch. They  
filed suit last year, claiming the actor and a real estate agent 
failed to disclose more than 30 problems that will cost more than 
$100,000 to repair. 
</P>
<P>
	The Racinellis said flaws included leaks in the roof and pool,  
damaged floors, plumbing and septic problems, and broken faucets, 
refrigerator and spa. 
</P>
<P>
	Klugman's attorney, Michael Hesse, said Klugman did nothing  
wrong. A real estate agent who helped close the deal said he did 
not know of any of defects before the 40-acre property changed 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	State law requires a seller to notify the buyer of such defects  
before purchase -- if the seller is aware of them.

<HEADLINE> Report: VW Entering Luxury Car Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Volkswagen AG, Europe's biggest  
automaker, plans to build two luxury sedans to compete with 
DaimlerChrysler AG's Mercedes-Benz and grab a share of the high-end 
market by selling them for less, a trade magazine said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The biweekly Auto Zeitung said the development names for the two  
new cars are D1 and Passat Plus. Volkswagen declined to comment on 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, the D1, to be built in Dresden, will be  
powered by a 12-cylinder engine. It is to be available in late 2000 
and cost less than the $77,000 for a comparable Mercedes S500. 
</P>
<P>
	The somewhat smaller Passat Plus is planned for a mid-2000  
debut. The sedan will have a more powerful engine and a wheelbase 
about 5 inches longer than the current Passat, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Passat Plus is to cost less than the $35,020 of comparable  
Mercedes E-class models with V6 engines, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	In another move, VW plans to present expanded engine options for  
its New Beetle models at the Frankfurt auto show in the fall, the 
report said. And it said the New Beetle convertibles, which VW has 
said it is thinking about building, would go on sale in late 2001.

</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, shares surged for a third straight day as funds

better than expected half-year corporate results all boosted the 
market to a four-year high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 16.55 points, or 1.7  
percent, to 1,005.98, its highest level since Oct. 18, 1995, when 
it closed at 1,006.70. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar slipped against the  
Japanese yen as foreigner investors sold dollars for yen to buy 
Japanese stocks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.96 yen in late trading in Tokyo, down 0.12  
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 122.02 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares plummeted 2.3 percent, as political  
uncertainty triggered across-the-board selling by local and foreign 
investors.

</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Prices closed slightly higher as investors funneled cash

15.58 points, or 0.18 percent, at 8,470.07. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares closed higher, underpinned by  
gains in market leaders Carter Holt Harvey Ltd. and Telecom Corp. 
of New Zealand Ltd. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 10.33 
points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,171.03. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks closed lower as investors continued to  
cash in on recent blue chip gains. The 30-company Philippine Stock 
Exchange Index closed down 12.04 points, or 0.5 percent, at 
2,598.32. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower on negative  
sentiment in the gold sector after gold auctioned Tuesday by the 
Bank of England fetched disappointing prices. The All Ordinaries

</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian stocks closed lower, with investors

<HEADLINE> Wrestler Lawler Runs for Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Jerry ``The King'' Lawler, who once  
slapped Andy Kaufman on television, is running for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawler, now a World Wrestling Federation commentator, said  
Tuesday ``literally thousands of people in Memphis'' have urged him 
to run in the Oct. 7 race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're looking at me as someone who's certainly not a  
politician but a lifelong resident of Memphis and as someone who 
has a love of this city,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawler, 49, gained national notoriety in 1982 by slapping  
comedian Kaufman on ``Late Night With David Letterman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His opponents include Mayor Willie Herenton, the city's first  
elected black mayor, and City Councilman Joe Ford, brother of

<HEADLINE> Rock Beat: Apocalyptica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURKU, Finland (AP) -- For heavy metal fans who thrive on bands  
that are rude, lewd and outrageous, a recent Apocalyptica show may 
have been the ultimate outrage: It was civil. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans didn't thrash or spray beer on each other, but instead  
sat quietly, listened attentively and applauded politely. They 
acted more like churchgoers than moshers, and the show indeed was 
in a church -- Tuomiokirkko, the main shrine of Finland's state 
Lutheran church. 
</P>
<P>
	And when fans left the show, their ears weren't ringing from  
shrieking guitars and thundering drums, because Apocalyptica did 
not have those instruments. Instead, there were just four cellos. 
</P>
<P>
	It sounds like a joke: four promising young cellists from  
Finland's top training ground for classical musicians, the Sibelius 
Academy, take up the music of Metallica, Faith No More and other 
heavy-metal miscreants. In fact, it was a joke, thought up during 
the tedium of a long bus ride to a music camp in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't thinking that anyone would want to hear us,'' group  
member Eicca Toppinen said before a recent show. ``We dressed up 
silly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Apocalyptica quickly went from a joke to a modest worldwide  
success. Its two albums have sold more than 550,000 copies 
altogether and shows on their current tour are drawing crowds of 
3,000 people a night -- many of them middle-agers whose usual 
response to heavy metal is to holler, ``Turn that down!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apocalyptica achieves something that surprises adults: It finds  
dignity and intelligence in music usually dismissed as the theme 
songs of glue-sniffing morons. 
</P>
<P>
	This is partly because of the instrumentation. The warm, woody  
tones of a cello can change a riff that sounds shrill and ugly on 
an electric guitar into something yearning and lovely. The group's 
signature piece, a cover of Metallica's ``Enter Sandman,'' isn't 
confrontational and desperate, but filled with a sort of brave 
melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the same mood as Shostakovich,'' said member Max Lilja,  
citing one of the group's favorite composers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike real rockers, Apocalyptica doesn't improvise. Both their  
cover versions and their original tunes are carefully scored, as 
they have to be to replicate drum parts, Toppinen said. The result 
is to bring an unexpected formality and deliberation to songs that 
in their original versions were barbaric yawps. 
</P>
<P>
	In Apocalyptica's hands, heavy metal leaves the torture chamber  
and becomes chamber music. The band brings the music a measure of 
respectability, rather to its own surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have any kind of mission to do it,'' Toppinen said.  
They just wanted to play the music they grew up on. 
</P>
<P>
	As a teen, ``even though I played cello, I didn't like classical  
music. But I understood heavy metal,'' Toppinen said. ``After that, 
I found Shostakovich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making heavy metal formal doesn't make it tame. The sound  
Apocalyptica derives from the cello -- wrenching eerie wails, 
scrapes and growls -- can be hair-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to show that the cello is not some boring  
instrument,'' Lilja said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toppinen added, ``People think the cello is something you hear  
only at your grandmother's funeral!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The discordant sounds are augmented by visual dissonance. You  
expect heavy metal to be played by crotch-thrusting 
instrument-wreckers, but Apocalyptica's only stage business is to 
bow politely and like all cello players to embrace their 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	The shorter members hold the cellos in the posture of gentle  
lovers, while the strapping Lilja hovers over his like a bear 
protecting its young. 
</P>
<P>
	And if they don't act like rockers on stage, they aren't  
inclined to act that way offstage either. All hold down various 
classical gigs ranging from chamber ensembles to spots with the 
orchestra at the Finnish National Opera. Member Pavo Lojtenen also 
directs a youth orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people think heavy metal should be a lifestyle, Toppinen  
said. ``That's not very interesting.''

<HEADLINE>  Italy's Cipollini Wins Tour Leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOIS, France (AP) -- In a stage featuring a Tour de France speed  
record, Italy's Mario Cipollini surged past Germany's Erik Zabel in 
a photo finish today to win the fourth leg of cycling's showcase 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Helped by a tail wind, cool weather and wide, flat roads, the  
record speed was an average 31.47 mph. The previous record was 
30.885 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In third place was Australia's Stuart O'Grady. Fourth was Tom  
Steels of Belgium, the winner of the last two stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Still holding the overall leader's yellow jersey was Estonia's  
Jaan Kirsipuu, who came in fifth today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour de France is still unable to shake itself of the drug  
scandal that overshadowed last summer's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Young fans along the route during Tuesday's third stage were  
well aware of the scandal but most didn't think drugs would ever be 
fully eradicated from the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish student Jose Luiz Catala was enjoying a folk concert in  
Nantes, in Brittany, before the riders came through. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all the players are doped,'' said the 17-year-old  
Catala. ``You know why? Because you can't win on a plate of 
spaghetti. You need more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His friend, Joan Albert Lairon, sporting red-and-yellow paint on  
his cheeks, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doping is fair if they all do it,'' he said. ``The problem  
comes when only some do. That's why it's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a bit dangerous -- no more than smoking cigarettes,''  
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the race goes on. On Monday, there was a dramatic  
crash during an ocean crossing. But the next day the third stage 
unfolded on dry ground and in classic style. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolling into the countryside of Brittany, with black-and-white  
Breton flags fluttering along the route, the stage began with an 
early breakaway and ended in a furious, shoulder-to-shoulder 
sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, Steels won the stage, timing his  
attack perfectly and surging through his rivals across the finish 
line, arms outstretched. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaan Kirsipuu of Estonia kept the leader's yellow jersey and  
Steels moved into second place overall, followed by Spain's Abraham 
Olano and American Lance Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's teammate on a strong U.S. Postal Service team,  
George Hincapie, is in sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, making a stunning comeback after fighting testicular  
cancer, is waiting for Sunday's time trial and then the mountain 
stages to mount his challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	But this week, in the early, flat stages, it is the sprinters  
who excel. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's 122-mile route stretched through picturesque northern  
countryside from the city of Nantes, which straddles the Loire 
River, to the town of Laval. 
</P>
<P>
	Two riders, Frederic Guesdon and Massimo Giunti, broke away  
early and maintained their lead for 76 miles, but were caught by 
the pack late in the race, making way for the sprinting 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	The pack maintained a swift pace -- an average of 27 mph for the  
day -- and the final sprint came at a blistering 42 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Steels, with a winning time of 4 hours, 29 minutes, 27 seconds,  
was followed by Germany's Erik Zabel, Stuart O'Grady of Australia, 
Nicola Minali of Italy and, in fifth place, Hincapie. Armstrong 
finished 24th. 
</P>
<P>
	Cycling's governing body announced Tuesday that 16 cyclists have  
been certified to race with a hematocrit level that exceeds the 50 
percent limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The hematocrit level measures the proportion of red blood cells  
in a blood sample -- one sign of drug use since the substances 
increase red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Cycling Union noted that 3 percent of the  
global population has a hematocrit level higher than 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how many, if any, of the riders issued those  
certificates are racing in this year's tour. U.S. racer Jonathan 
Vaughters has one, but he was injured in Monday's crash and forced 
to abandon the race.

<HEADLINE> Washington Tourists Take the Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cory Van Dam plopped to the floor of the U.S.  
Capitol on Tuesday, pressing his bare legs against the eternally 
cool stone. His red-faced brother Andrew wilted on a bench nearby 
while their father reviewed what the family has learned about the 
United States on their long-planned trip to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boise is as far east as we're ever going to live,'' declared  
Bill Van Dam, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	Heat and humidity, after all, are as much a part of the history  
of Washington as the monuments and government buildings that the 
Van Dams and thousands of other tourists devotedly visited in the 
three-digit heat. In the shade, it hit 102. 
</P>
<P>
	The city tried to help with fire hydrants equipped to shower  
water on anyone wanting to get soaked. One sprayed coolness at the 
base of Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no sanctuary quite like the marble-and-stone halls  
of the Capitol, which has been air-conditioned since 1929. A statue 
in the building's Statuary Hall honors the father of interior 
coolness, Dr. John Gorrie of Florida, who invented ``mechanical 
refrigeration'' in 1851. 
</P>
<P>
	Shielded by the stately dome from what felt like 110-degree heat  
Tuesday, the Van Dams wondered what it was like back home in Idaho. 
Answer: A blissful 83 degrees, with a light, dry wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad we came, because the alternative would have been  
not coming, and there's a lot here that we wanted to see,'' Van Dam 
said. ``But, man! It's hotter than I ever could have imagined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Van Dams' day began with an 8 a.m. tour of the White House  
as the temperature edged merely into the 80s. Then it was on to the 
Rayburn House Office Building, where they received a guided tour 
mostly of the inside of Capitol Hill, courtesy of a heat-conscious 
friend who works for Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Azevedo family of San Diego, Calif., had the full  
Washington experience. As the temperature back home hovered just 
below 70 degrees, the Azevedos walked at least a half-mile up 
Independence Avenue to the Capitol, stopping along the way to dunk 
each other's heads under public water fountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they stood in line to get inside the Capitol. It was noon  
before the family of five was ushered across the sizzling blacktop 
of Capitol Plaza and up 36 stairs to the Rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosalie Azevedo dropped onto a bench a few feet from the Van  
Dams and fanned herself with a piece of paper. Her three children 
and husband Paul wandered around, gazing at the paintings nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're off to the Air and Space Museum next,'' she said --  
another hike down Independence Avenue. But the family had a 
strategy. ``This time, we know where to walk under the big trees.''

<HEADLINE> ATP Spurns Olympic Drug Testers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) -- The ATP prevented the Swiss Olympic  
Committee from making an unannounced drug test on Swiss players at 
the Swiss Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's tennis tour and tournament organizers argued they have  
their own testing system and the Swiss committee had no rights over 
such an event. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said, `No, we have our own program,''' said Gerry  
Armstrong, the ATP tournament supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation occurred Tuesday night when SOC tester Karl  
Knubel arrived and wanted to test two of the four Swiss players 
there -- 1992 Olympic champion Marc Rosset, Lorenzo Manta, Roger 
Federer and George Bastl. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATP said the SOC might be allowed to conduct such tests in  
the future if they asked permission. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been nice if they'd had the professional  
courtesy to ask our people before,'' tournament director Jacques 
Hermenjat said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't inform our players when we plan to conduct our  
tests,'' Hermenjat added. ``We inform the organizers but the 
players don't know it's happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The power struggle has embittered the SOC, which calls the  
position of the ATP ``legally and ... politically incorrect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission and the SOC will have to examine the situation  
and take appropriate measures for the future,'' the SOC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermenjat said the ATP was worried about the competence of the  
testers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a gentleman and a bag,'' Hermenjat said. ``When we  
conduct tests we have a whole team and a lot of equipment. It is 
done professionally and properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hermenjat hinted the proposed drug test might be tied to the  
Tour de France, which is trying to free itself from last summer's 
drug scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now every sport is trying to put the attention on the  
others when it comes to doping,'' Hermenjat said. ``They definitely 
wanted to get some other sports involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``These tests are the same week as the Tour de France. It's  
probably the thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament director also objected to tests being limited to  
Swiss players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is discrimination just to choose two Swiss players for  
testing,'' Hermenjat said. ``In the ATP we test players who are 
drawn at random.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ATP drug rules stipulate all players must be treated equally at  
tournaments. The ATP also contends recent tests already had been 
done, and there was no need for this one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know who it would benefit,'' Hermenjat said. ``We've  
had a lot of tests this year and tennis is a very clean sport.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decries Reservation Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- Geraldine Blue Bird's lip trembled as  
she spoke to President Clinton on her weatherworn front porch. She 
told him about the 11 relatives who lived inside, and the 17 who 
slept in the trailer out back. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as she looked out on her neighborhood strewn with  
abandoned cars, better housing wasn't foremost on her mind. Jobs 
were. Jobs to buy clothes and food. Jobs to get off welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	The national unemployment rate is below 5 percent, the lowest in  
three decades, but it's about 75 percent on the Pine Ridge Indian 
Reservation, the poorest region of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to find a way not only to fix the very difficult  
housing circumstances, but to get them jobs,'' the president said 
after leaving Blue Bird's house. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's visit to the Oglala Sioux nation was the first to an  
Indian reservation by a president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
passed through Cherokee country on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of neglect were everywhere.  
</P>
<P>
	Boys in dusty clothes shot baskets on a tilting rim as Clinton,  
accompanied by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew 
Cuomo, Fannie Mae chief Franklin Raines and South Dakota's two 
senators, visited the Igloo neighborhood -- a collection of 
foam-green shacks with splintering stoops that spoke to the despair 
of the people who lived inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Salway, president of the Oglala Sioux, said that Igloo  
was typical of housing on the vast reservation that had been the 
site of the Wounded Knee massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the wintertime, the hardships put on our people are  
increased tenfold,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made an impromptu visit to Robert Red Shirt's home,  
where five used tires were stacked beneath a broken window. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get my house fixed. It's falling apart,'' Red  
Shirt said after Clinton left. 
</P>
<P>
	A reserved 47-year-old with stooped shoulders, Red Shirt said he  
didn't speak to the president and couldn't say how Clinton might 
help. ``I wouldn't know how, sir,'' he said. ``Somehow, anyway. Any 
way he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alighting from his helicopter, Clinton, wearing a gray  
pinstriped suit and cowboy boots, was greeted by a dozen tribal 
leaders wearing ceremonial headdresses of feathers from the 
American bald eagle. A knot of musicians beat a cowhide drum and 
chanted a song. 
</P>
<P>
	After a ceremony officially designating the reservation as a  
federal empowerment zone, Clinton addressed more than 800 people 
under a scorching sun at the local high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask you today, even as we remember the past, to think more  
about the future. We know well what the failings of the present and 
the past are,'' the president said. ``We know well the imperfect 
relationship that the United States and its governments have 
enjoyed with the tribal nations. But I have seen today not only 
poverty, but promise. And I have seen enormous courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The visit to Pine Ridge was one of the most dramatic of  
Clinton's tour, a campaign from Appalachia to inner-city Los 
Angeles aimed at encouraging investment in communities that haven't 
shared in the nation's good economic times. 
</P>
<P>
	After Igloo, Clinton toured part of the reservation where new  
houses were being built with loans secured by HUD and announced 
several public and private initiatives to begin building basic 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	With infrastructure, he said, the reservation could try to build  
a tourism industry around visitors to Wounded Knee and Mount 
Rushmore each year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Indian Affairs,  
1.43 million Indians live on or near reservations. Roughly 33 
percent of them are children younger than 15, and 38 percent of 
Indian children aged 6 to 11 live in poverty, compared with 18 
percent for U.S. children nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 63 percent of Indians are high school graduates.  
Twenty-nine percent are homeless, and 59 percent live in 
substandard housing. Twenty percent of Indian households on 
reservations do not have full access to plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Indians had heard enough ``pretty words'' from  
U.S. leaders in the past and so he was bringing some concrete 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced a partnership among HUD, the Treasury Department,  
tribal governments and mortgage companies to help 1,000 Indians 
become homeowners over the next three years -- a small number that 
nonetheless would double the number of government-insured home 
mortgages issued on tribal lands. Under the effort, ``one-stop 
mortgage centers'' would be opened at Pine Ridge and on the Navajo 
Reservation in Arizona to help streamline the mortgage lending 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	The president flew to Arizona later in the day, where he toured  
the facilities of La Canasta, a successful food producer, to 
highlight the needs of the Latino community in South Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country has been really blessed by these good economic  
times,'' Clinton said. ``But we know, as blessed as America has 
been, not every American has been blessed by this recovery. All you 
have to do is drive down the streets of South Phoenix to see 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Body Found in Sea World Whale Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The nude body of a SeaWorld visitor was  
found in the killer whale pool, where he had apparently gone 
swimming with one of the huge animals after the park had closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old man's body was found early Tuesday, draped over  
a killer whale named Tillikum in 50-degree water. His swimming suit 
was found in the tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The man's identity was not immediately released, and autopsy  
results were pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no obvious signs of trauma,'' sheriff's spokesman  
Jim Solomons said. ``He was not chewed up. He could have been 
pulled under by the whale's vortex, or the whale may have 
considered him a toy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tillikum is the largest killer whale in captivity at 11,000  
pounds and is considered dangerous. A trainer in Canada was killed 
in 1991 after falling into a pool with Tillikum and two other 
killer whales and being dragged under water. 
</P>
<P>
	Tillikum is not trained to interact with humans and is used in  
shows to splash water on park guests, said Victor Abbey, SeaWorld 
executive vice president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 35-year history of SeaWorld, this has never happened  
before,'' Abbey said. 
</P>
<P>
	SeaWorld workers have told deputies they saw the man hanging  
around the whale tanks Monday. Abbey said the man apparently hid in 
the park and evaded the 24-hour security around the whale tanks. 
The park closed at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	A killer whale show was canceled Tuesday morning, but shows  
resumed in the afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Kendall Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates catcher Jason Kendall was  
released from Allegheny General Hospital on Wednesday, three days 
after undergoing surgery on his badly dislocated right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	His whole take on the first serious and very scary injury of his  
career: Frustrating. Very frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time All-Star catcher must spend six weeks in a walking  
cast and at least six weeks of rehabilitation before he can think 
of playing again. The Pirates are shooting for a full recovery by 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Kendall is still in pain, he did not visit the clubhouse  
Wednesday and probably won't show up Thursday. But he is expected 
when the Pirates return from the All-Star break next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still pretty much down. I'm obviously in a lot of pain,''  
Kendall said. ``The one thing that has definitely kept me going has 
been my teammates and the fans in Pittsburgh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates' Web site has logged about 2,000 get-well wishes for  
Kendall from around the country, and the team also has begin 
receiving tons of greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not an emotional-type person, and I've definitely been  
emotional the last three days. It's been something that touched me. 
It meant a lot,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous Pirates visited Kendall, including catcher Keith Osik,  
who was nearly on an around-the-clock watch for the first few days 
following Kendall's gruesome accident Sunday against Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	As Kendall tried to beat out a bunt, his right foot jammed  
awkwardly against the first base bag, causing his ankle to bend at 
nearly a 90-degree angle and part of a leg bone to ram through his 
uniform pants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be frustrating until I can get back on the  
field,'' Kendall said. ``But it's part of the game. It happens. 
It's a freak accident. I'll be back.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Uninsured Issue Takes On New Focus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The uninsured are suddenly a hot topic again  
in Washington, as business and insurance groups that helped defeat 
a plan for universal health care now champion those without 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The business and insurance groups are trying to beat back the  
politically popular ``patients' bill of rights,'' which will be 
debated in the Senate next week. They are running $750,000 worth of 
ads this week aimed at swaying potentially wayward GOP senators. 
</P>
<P>
	They argue that the legislation would raise the cost of  
insurance and force some employers to drop coverage for their 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitch gains potency as the number of uninsured Americans  
grows. Despite prosperous economic times, it stood at 43.4 million 
in 1997 -- up by nearly 4 million since President Clinton proposed 
his universal health insurance plan in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	But that only partially explains business and insurance  
interests' new focus on the uninsured, said Robert Blendon, who 
studies health policy and public opinion at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the middle of the debate over the patients' bill of rights,  
a lot of groups rediscovered the uninsured,'' he said. ``They said, 
`Let's stop talking about the patients' bill of rights; let's start 
talking about the uninsured.''' 
</P>
<P>
	They are the same groups, along with Republican allies in  
Congress, who helped defeat universal health care five years ago. 
In that debate, a central argument against Clinton's plan to help 
the uninsured was that the insured would lose their ability to 
choose their own doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the debate is about the limited choice of doctors and  
other complaints involving HMOs, the argument is that new rules 
will result in more people without insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the uninsured -- mostly consumer groups -- are  
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden the people who gave us the fire -- the  
arsonists -- are going to come up with a solution,'' said Dr. 
Quentin Young of Physicians for a National Health Program. ``It's 
disingenuous, if not dishonest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new interest in the uninsured also shows up in GOP proposals  
to change the tax code and in a pitch by the insurance association 
for the government to create a $60 billion annual subsidy. Both 
would help people without insurance buy coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the July Fourth holiday, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, promised that his 
tax plan would include new incentives -- credits or deductions -- to 
buy coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties' strategy on health care can be traced to the 1994  
health debate, said GOP pollster Frank Luntz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It forced the Democrats to scale back,'' he said. ``And it  
forced the Republicans to offer proposals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But HMOs are now front and center. The radio and television ads  
are running in five states where Republican senators up for 
re-election next year. The goal is to ward off temptations for the 
five to vote for some of the more popular Democratic amendments 
that will be offered in the Senate debate on the issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pay more or lose our insurance? Doesn't Congress care what  
happens to us?'' a man complains in one of the TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads are targeted at GOP Sens. Spencer Abraham of Michigan,  
Mike DeWine of Ohio, Slade Gorton of Washington, Rod Grams of 
Minnesota and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar arguments are expected in the Senate next week. Sen. Don  
Nickles, R-Okla., who has led the opposition to new HMO rules, 
mentions the uninsured just about every time he talks about the 
issue. But he acknowledges the politically risky position he and 
other Republicans are taking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a wonderful idea. We are going to guarantee everybody  
all this assortment of benefits,'' he said on the Senate floor. 
``But they do have a cost. If we make insurance unaffordable and 
move a million and a half people from the insured category to the 
uninsured category, I think we are making a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocate Ron Pollack, president of Families USA, said  
the true test of interest in the uninsured will come after the HMO 
debate is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have plenty of opportunity to see which of the  
organizations that are talking about health coverage really mean 
it,'' he said. ``I'm hopeful, but past history tells us that 
there's room for cynicism.''

<HEADLINE> Rock Beat: Apocalyptica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURKU, Finland (AP) -- For heavy metal fans who thrive on bands  
that are rude, lewd and outrageous, a recent Apocalyptica show may 
have been the ultimate outrage: It was civil. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans didn't thrash or spray beer on each other, but instead  
sat quietly, listened attentively and applauded politely. They 
acted more like churchgoers than moshers, and the show indeed was 
in a church -- Tuomiokirkko, the main shrine of Finland's state 
Lutheran church. 
</P>
<P>
	And when fans left the show, their ears weren't ringing from  
shrieking guitars and thundering drums, because Apocalyptica did 
not have those instruments. Instead, there were just four cellos. 
</P>
<P>
	It sounds like a joke: four promising young cellists from  
Finland's top training ground for classical musicians, the Sibelius 
Academy, take up the music of Metallica, Faith No More and other 
heavy-metal miscreants. In fact, it was a joke, thought up during 
the tedium of a long bus ride to a music camp in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't thinking that anyone would want to hear us,'' group  
member Eicca Toppinen said before a recent show. ``We dressed up 
silly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Apocalyptica quickly went from a joke to a modest worldwide  
success. Its two albums have sold more than 550,000 copies 
altogether and shows on their current tour are drawing crowds of 
3,000 people a night -- many of them middle-agers whose usual 
response to heavy metal is to holler, ``Turn that down!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apocalyptica achieves something that surprises adults: It finds  
dignity and intelligence in music usually dismissed as the theme 
songs of glue-sniffing morons. 
</P>
<P>
	This is partly because of the instrumentation. The warm, woody  
tones of a cello can change a riff that sounds shrill and ugly on 
an electric guitar into something yearning and lovely. The group's 
signature piece, a cover of Metallica's ``Enter Sandman,'' isn't 
confrontational and desperate, but filled with a sort of brave 
melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the same mood as Shostakovich,'' said member Max Lilja,  
citing one of the group's favorite composers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike real rockers, Apocalyptica doesn't improvise. Both their  
cover versions and their original tunes are carefully scored, as 
they have to be to replicate drum parts, Toppinen said. The result 
is to bring an unexpected formality and deliberation to songs that 
in their original versions were barbaric yawps. 
</P>
<P>
	In Apocalyptica's hands, heavy metal leaves the torture chamber  
and becomes chamber music. The band brings the music a measure of 
respectability, rather to its own surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have any kind of mission to do it,'' Toppinen said.  
They just wanted to play the music they grew up on. 
</P>
<P>
	As a teen, ``even though I played cello, I didn't like classical  
music. But I understood heavy metal,'' Toppinen said. ``After that, 
I found Shostakovich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making heavy metal formal doesn't make it tame. The sound  
Apocalyptica derives from the cello -- wrenching eerie wails, 
scrapes and growls -- can be hair-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to show that the cello is not some boring  
instrument,'' Lilja said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toppinen added, ``People think the cello is something you hear  
only at your grandmother's funeral!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The discordant sounds are augmented by visual dissonance. You  
expect heavy metal to be played by crotch-thrusting 
instrument-wreckers, but Apocalyptica's only stage business is to 
bow politely and like all cello players to embrace their 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	The shorter members hold the cellos in the posture of gentle  
lovers, while the strapping Lilja hovers over his like a bear 
protecting its young. 
</P>
<P>
	And if they don't act like rockers on stage, they aren't  
inclined to act that way offstage either. All hold down various 
classical gigs ranging from chamber ensembles to spots with the 
orchestra at the Finnish National Opera. Member Pavo Lojtenen also 
directs a youth orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people think heavy metal should be a lifestyle, Toppinen  
said. ``That's not very interesting.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Equestrians Deny Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Japanese Equestrian Federation today denied  
bribery was involved in the $29,000 an Olympic rider gave to three 
of its officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Federation head Shozo Hara acknowledged the money presented a  
``serious problem.'' He said the federation will decide on any 
penalties, including possible expulsion, at a meeting next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hara said the money from Yoshinaga Sakurai was intended as a  
gift, payments to set up a training camp for Sakurai and a loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakurai also denied the cash was intended to get him a berth on  
the Japanese team for the Barcelona Olympics. Hara said the 
payments did not influence selection of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no wrongdoing. It was carried out fairly,'' Hara  
said. ``But the fact that money was involved is extremely serious. 
It was a thoughtless act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federation carried out an in-house investigation after the  
national Mainichi newspaper reported this week that Sakurai had 
paid the federation officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said expulsion was the only way the federation has to  
punish its members, but other ways may have to be created as new 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The federation denied another Mainichi report that the parents  
of an equestrian rider gave $6,500 to an official to help with 
their son's bid to compete in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The official denied receiving the money and the parents of the  
unidentified athlete also denied giving the money, according to the 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have these reports that are incredible and when we  
investigate, the facts turn out to be different. The reports have 
hurt the reputation of the federation,'' Hara said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials denied that cash gifts were common in the federation.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the IOC asked for an investigation into gifts  
that Nagano city officials gave committee members who were 
selecting a host city for the 1998 Winter Games. Nagano officials 
found no wrongdoing in the city's successful bid.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Lawmakers Plan Budget Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and congressional leaders  
plan to meet at the White House next week to discuss their dueling 
proposals for what to do with the $2.9 trillion in 10-year budget 
surpluses that both sides now project. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials have issued an invitation for Monday. But  
the timing may change to accommodate lawmakers out of town for the 
July Fourth recess, said White House and top Capitol Hill aides. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said the discussions will focus on revamping Medicare  
and Social Security for the baby boomers' retirement and on 
Clinton's proposal to create a new, voluntary prescription drug 
benefit for the disabled and those 65 and over. Also on the table 
will be both sides' proposals for tax cuts and domestic and defense 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears unlikely that the meeting would lead to early,  
full-blown budget negotiations btween the two sides. Clinton will 
have leverage over Republicans this fall, when spending bills that 
will keep huge federal agencies open arrive at his desk, and there 
seems little reason for him to give ground beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides say they want to use the $1.9 trillion portion of the  
projected surplus to reduce the accumulated national debt, which 
would indirectly help Social Security by reducing federal interest 
payments and strengthening the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans want to use the bulk of the rest for a tax cut.  
Clinton wants to use the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare, 
other domestic programs, debt reduction and a modest tax cut.

<HEADLINE> Mexico To Increase Duty-Free Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Businesses along the Texas-Mexico border  
from El Paso to Brownsville could benefit from a change in Mexican 
customs charges, but just around Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican government announced Tuesday that it will raise its  
duty-free limit on U.S. goods to $300 during the Christmas 
holidays, but only for Mexican nationals who live more than 100 
miles from the border. Everyone else will be kept to the $50 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The new duty-free limit will be in effect from Dec. 1 to Jan.  
10, one of the border's biggest shopping periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was greeted here with enthusiasm, some business  
owners said it falls short of what they had hoped for because of 
the distance restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	Alonso Flores, spokesman for the Central Business Association,  
told the El Paso Times that anything to improve duty-free shopping 
was appreciated. He added, however, that ``we have a free trade 
agreement with Mexico, and we need to remove all the barriers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Mexico allows just $50 worth of U.S. goods duty-free  
per person per trip, with a limit of $400 a month. The United 
States has a duty-free limit on merchandise from Mexico of $400 per 
person per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect  
in 1994, the $50 limit has been a sore point between the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Mexico refused to raise the limit, arguing that to do  
so would give U.S. businesses an unfair advantage over their 
Mexican counterparts.

	``50-Odd Dollars'' (Razor &AMP; Tie) -- Fred Eaglesmith  

</P>
<P>
	Fred Eaglesmith can do sensitive as well as most anybody when  
he's so inclined, but lately many of his tales of lives on the 
fringe and loves gone bad have been enveloped in a loud, frenzied, 
hard-country, surf guitar-meets-bluegrass. And then he hangs out 
with the Clash style that has been known to blow the roof off small 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	That said, ``50-Odd Dollars'' is mostly a rock 'n' roll album  
and might offend some of the folk fans who have accepted Eaglesmith 
as one of their own. And it's the kind that demands you turn your 
stereo up all the way. But lyrically, it covers much of the same 
territory as earlier albums, with Eaglesmith spinning his tales in 
an economical style that says more with fewer words. ``I walk 
around in shoes,'' moans the brokenhearted country boy in ``Rodeo 
Boy,'' and those five words capture his plight perfectly.

	``Press On'' (Risk/Small Hairy Dog) -- June Carter Cash  

</P>
<P>
	While the relaxed, homespun feel might put some off, June Carter  
Cash and a small group of outstanding musicians have made a 
wonderful album, full of the sort of hilarity, hard truth and rough 
beauty country radio is so allergic to but which country music at 
its finest does so well. Cash mixes spiritual numbers with a goofy 
tale of life in New York City and a funny piece of advice to a 
granddaughter who wants to be an actress. She also recaptures 
``Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' from sing-along territory. ``Press 
On'' is highly recommended for fans of real country and folk.

	``Simple Gearle'' (Gearle Records) -- Stacey Earle  

</P>
<P>
	The many pleasures of ``Simple Gearle'' unfold slowly, growing  
richer as the songs take on familiarity with repeated listening. 
There's nothing flashy about the arrangements, playing or singing -- 
just heartfelt words from a singer with a plainspoken voice and 
simple musical arrangements. ``Simple Gearle'' is a charming album 
that stakes out a spot where folk and country meet. It is sure to 
appeal to fans of early Nanci Griffith or Iris Dement. And yes, 
Stacey Earle is Steve Earle's sister.

	``Milk'' (Curve) -- Swoon  

</P>
<P>
	``Milk'' is not about songs so much as it is about mood. And in  
a genre in which different artists increasingly sound alike, Swoon 
is able to stand apart with ``Milk,'' a spooky, ethereal journey 
through the best electronic instrumental music trip-hop has to 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio consists of a computer programmer/keyboardist who calls  
himself Flanj, a guitarist who goes by the name hood and a drummer 
named mr. b. They make a nice transition from the piano-dominated 
``Slouch,'' which opens the disc and sets the tone of laid-back 
angst, to the nervy ``Pepsi, cigarettes, and all that,'' which 
starts off sounding like just another movie track, but becomes 
addictive with its sinuous beat. 
</P>

<P>
	It would only figure that one of the driving forces behind  
Lilith Fair, one of the most successful concert tour concepts ever, 
would release a live album of her own. But the surprising thing is 
that Sarah McLachlan's ``Mirrorball'' isn't the Canadian singer's 
vocal range and power. Rather the way the songs themselves stand up 
to live treatment is the delight of the record. The opening 
``Building a Mystery'' turns into a fiery anthem; the sweetly sung 
ballad ``I Love You'' is given an added dimension by the live 
arrangement; and ``Sweet Surrender,'' one of McLachlan's best-known 
songs, is turned into a stripped-down rocker that still retains its 
sophistication. Lilith Fair proved that women can be live rock 
attractions, and ``Mirrorball'' shows why McLachlan was the best 
person to carry the message.

	``Come by Me'' (Columbia) -- Harry Connick Jr.  

</P>
<P>
	On his latest collection of vocal jazz, Harry Connick Jr. adds a  
little something else, namely himself. After his failed electric 
jazz-funk-fusion experiment, ``She,'' Connick has refocused himself 
on what he does best, taking almost full control of this project 
and his 16-piece big band and a full orchestra. And he doesn't miss 
a step, whether it be a cover of the Henry Mancini standard, 
``Charade'' (which features some of the most confident vocal 
phrasing of Connick's career), or his cute rhyming on ``Nowhere 
With Love.'' The music itself may not be original -- a takeoff on 
what Frank Sinatra perfected halfway through the century. But by 
taking it -- and himself further -- Connick has made himself into an 
American original.

	``14:59'' (Lava/Atlantic) -- Sugar Ray  

</P>
<P>
	Sugar Ray is one of those bands that you love to hate. Or you  
hate to love, depending on your perspective. Two years ago, it was 
the can't-get-it-out-of-your-head summertime single ``Fly.'' Now, 
the California quintet is back with more on ``14:59,'' which has 
already produced three mindlessly catchy songs in ``Every 
Morning,'' ``Falls Apart'' and ``Someday'' that radio can't seem to 
get enough of, and therefore, neither can listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sugar Ray can't be faulted for being able to come up with  
great hooks that include light power chords mixed in with some rap 
bravado. And the band does stretch out on the punky ``Aim for Me'' 
and the Brian-Wilson influenced ``Ode to the Lonely Hearted.'' With 
an album such as this, it would be easy to dismiss Sugar Ray as 
nothing but ear candy. But they've now produced three top-selling 
albums. 
</P>
<P>
	It's time to look forward to 2001 -- or brace for it.

<HEADLINE> Dukakis Takes on London Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- In a city accustomed to bravura performances from  
theatrical Dames like Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, London can add 
an American showstopper to its ranks in the stooped, graying form 
of Olympia Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
	Offstage, there's nothing remotely hunched about Dukakis, a  
vigorous actress now in her 60s (she won't give her exact age) who 
remains best known for her Academy Award-winning role 12 years ago 
as Cher's voluble Italian mama in ``Moonstruck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as the title -- and only -- character of Martin Sherman's new  
play ``Rose,'' Dukakis must hold both the stage and an audience for 
more than two hours as she unfolds a sprawling, personal narrative 
that also touches on the collective experience of European Jewry 
throughout the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rose,'' which opened June 24 in the Cottesloe, the smallest of  
the National's three playhouses, will run in repertory at the 
complex until September. 
</P>
<P>
	When we first see her on stage, taking her seat on a bench that  
she won't leave during either of two substantial acts, Rose looks 
back reluctantly on a life in which, as she recalls dryly, she 
experienced her first period and her first pogrom the same month. 
</P>
<P>
	Husbands come and go, as do cities and countries that she has  
either fled or feared. Somehow, through it all, Rose survives to 
become an 80-year-old Miami grandmother who finds herself sitting 
shiva -- the Jewish ritual of mourning -- for a 9-year-old girl who 
was shot in the head. (To give the girl's identity would spoil a 
major surprise of the play.) 
</P>
<P>
	``Rose'' is the first play in three years by Sherman, the  
expatriate American dramatist of ``When She Danced,'' ``Some Sunny 
Day'' and ``A Madhouse in Goa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime resident of west London's Notting Hill neighborhood,  
the Philadelphia-born Sherman previously dealt with the Holocaust 
in what remains his best-known play, ``Bent,'' about the 
persecution of homosexuals in the World War II death camps. 
</P>
<P>
	At least superficially, ``Rose'' is a lighter piece that often  
wears its humor on its sleeve (``I like to be au courant,'' Rose 
says of her fondness for Ben and Jerry's peanut butter vanilla ice 
cream). But behind the levity is a requiem for an identifiably 
Jewish compassion and empathy that, Sherman suggests, may not last 
into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	Or as her son, Abbie, angrily tells her, ``Your shadows will  
choke us to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dukakis' films include ``Steel Magnolias'' and the ``Look Who's  
Talking'' series. On TV, she was the pot-smoking earth mother, Mrs. 
Madrigal, in the two ``Tales of the City'' sagas. She is also first 
cousin to Michael Dukakis, the failed presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	For Dukakis, who talked about her work early one evening during  
previews of the play, ``Rose'' marks a new career challenge at a 
time when many performers of a certain age find it ever-harder to 
get roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The part is wonderful; the challenge is awesome,'' she says.  
``Martin (Sherman) wanted the play done here, and that was fine. 
It's an honor to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The honor brought its own headaches, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, `I can't do this. I don't know how to do this.' I'm  
still not sure I know how, but it's slowly beginning to happen. The 
play's beginning to evolve,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Half an hour into one of the May preview shows, Dukakis left the  
stage rattled by the demands of the text. She returned after 
several minutes and completed the play to a rousing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lest she lose her way, she wears an earpiece for prompts.  
</P>
<P>
	``You want to feel on top of the material,'' she explains,  
giving a shrug one senses that Rose would enjoy, ``and yet you're 
playing someone who's not on top of the material of the moments in 
her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The play, she says, is ``like milk on a table; it's moving  
around. I'd never done a one-woman show before, and certainly not 
one that requires this degree of emotional commitment and variety 
and range. This is really extraordinary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The London critics agree, at least as regards her performance,  
which received a rare standing ovation on opening night in a city 
famously chary of such displays. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some reviewers faulted the writing, they praised what  
The Independent On Sunday called ``a stunning debut'' achieved 
``through sheer stamina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dukakis doesn't steal the show. She makes it,'' said The  
Evening Standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Dukakis is of Greek extraction. But she said a life lived as a  
self-described ``ethnic'' enabled her to identify with a 
Ukrainian-American Jew, just as she did with the feisty mother in 
``Moonstruck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She says she shares with Rose a sense of not belonging. ``It's  
very lively in me. It's not something that is cast away because I'm 
first generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At school in the Boston suburbs, Dukakis felt marginalized --  
``absolutely because of the name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The interesting thing is that all the other kids were from  
some other country, but in my mind they were all Americans,'' she 
says. ``Irish, French, Armenians, Germans -- these are the people we 
fought on the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, Dukakis has had to face the separate sidelining  
that comes with not being part of the New York theater mainstream, 
despite running The Whole Theater across the Hudson River in New 
Jersey for almost 20 years. (She relinquished that position in 
1990, at which time the theater closed.) 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had not too friendly a time in New York, I would say,''  
says Dukakis, who later this year is moving back to the city from 
New Jersey to take an apartment with Louis Zorich, her 
actor-husband of 38 years, with whom she has three children. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem to prefer to import British things,'' she says of  
New York tastes, aware that, with this London debut, she now is 
exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe,'' she says, her hazel eyes widening in anticipation,  
``they'll import me.''

<HEADLINE> Minimum Age Debated at NBPA Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- The NBA's wealth was spread a little more  
evenly in the abbreviated season that followed the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of NBA players making between $1 million and $2  
million went up more than 50 percent during the 1999 season, and 
the average salary increased to $2.64 million from $2.37 million, 
the union said Tuesday on the first day of its annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern going into the lockout was to elevate the salaries  
of the lower class and increase the size of the middle class, and 
we've accomplished that,'' union director Billy Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid talk of salaries, salary caps, the lockout and other  
mundane business, it was the subject of the league's youngest 
players -- and how young is too young -- that really piqued the 
players' interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner David Stern has proposed establishing a minimum  
age, perhaps 20, for playing in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a restriction would have to be agreed upon by the players.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's ears perked up, and you saw genuine concerns for  
these young men, many of whose careers are being ruined,'' said 
Mitchell Butler, player representative for the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
``Their friends, high school coaches and AAU coaches are telling 
them they'll be superstars, but in most cases the chances of that 
actually happening are slim and none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter appointed a six-man committee -- Alonzo Mourning of Miami,  
Brent Barry of Chicago, Juwan Howard of Washington, Jerome Williams 
of Detroit, Dikembe Mutombo of Atlanta and Butler -- to discuss the 
issue and make recommendations Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The league and the union are expected to open negotiations on  
the issue sometime in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides are awaiting a report from the NCAA on whether it  
would be feasible to provide the best college players with 
low-interest loans of up to $20,000 to entice them to stay in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is that we don't want the NBA or the NCAA  
dictating what the resolution is. It's got to be something the 
players agree wholeheartedly on,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	This three-day meeting is the union's first chance to review the  
impact of the nearly seven-month long lockout that threatened the 
cancellation of the entire 1998-99 season. 
</P>
<P>
	In a slide show presentation to about 50 players, Hunter  
reviewed the financial outcome and impact of the new collective 
bargaining agreement and made the following points: 
</P>
<P>
	--The players' share of basketball-related income increased from  
57 percent in 1997-98 to 59 percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	--Salaries increased 17 percent as a whole.  
</P>
<P>
	--The number of players earning $1 million or more increased from  
61 percent to 71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of players earning between $1 million and $4 million  
annually rose from 44 percent to 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Fifteen players signed contracts under the new middle-class  
exception, which allows teams to exceed the salary cap to sign free 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	--Aside from the 10 players going into the final year of their  
rookie scale contracts who signed six-year, $71 million extensions, 
only two players, Rik Smits of Indiana and Jayson Williams of New 
Jersey, received the maximum allowable salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter also pointed out that players like Allen Iverson and Ray  
Allen, who signed six-year extensions, can still expect to earn 
upwards of $200 million over their careers if they maintain their 
level of excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	Players have been leaving college early or making themselves  
eligible for the draft out of high school at an increasing rate 
during the past several years, their hopes boosted by the 
commercial and financial success Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett had 
in going directly from the preps to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	During last week's NBA draft in Washington, high schooler  
Jonathan Bender of Picayune, Miss., was drafted fifth overall, 
ahead of players like Wally Szczerbiak, Richard Hamilton and Trajan 
Langdon, who established themselves at the college level before 
becoming lottery picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Another high schooler, Leon Smith of Martin Luther King High in  
Chicago, was selected 29th overall -- the final pick of the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the same argument with the owners during the lockout  
over whether they should exert fiscal self-control,'' Hunter said. 
``If they don't want them in the league, they shouldn't draft 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one player wondered aloud why such a fuss was being  
made over the age issue in basketball -- a sport whose athlete 
population is dominated by young, black men -- when it hasn't been 
similarly discussed in sports like baseball, which has a larger 
percentage of white and Hispanic players. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter said it seemed curious to him that the issue moved into  
the spotlight this year as Duke, which had never lost an 
underclassman to the NBA draft, had three non-seniors leave the 
team to enter the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter also said that high schoolers who jump straight to the  
pros should not be blamed for the dropoff in the quality of NBA 
basketball because most of them spend their first season getting 
very little playing time.

<HEADLINE> Villeneuve Looking To British GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SILVERSTONE, England (AP) -- Jacques Villeneuve won the British  
Grand Prix twice in the past three years. This year, though, he'd 
settle for just finishing the race in his first season driving for 
the new British American Racing team. 
</P>
<P>
	Villeneuve left the successful Williams team for his current  
team and says he's one frustrated driver as the championship 
reaches the halfway mark this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going to be a difficult start for a new team,  
but I did think that we would have achieved some better results by 
now,'' Villeneuve said. 
</P>
<P>
	The British-based team burst onto the F1 scene with a big budget  
and big ambitions, predicting a win in its opening race. But its 
best finish has been a seventh-place achieved by Mika Salo at the 
San Marino Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is easy for people to forget that we are a first-year team  
and that we are quicker than first-year teams have ever been,'' 
Villeneuve said. ``But we are way below our own expectations, and 
that's why it is frustrating. We came in as a big team so we are 
not seen or judged as a new team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian driver said technical problems had hindered his  
progress but he was expecting the situation to improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been OK at Silverstone in the past and I am happy to go  
there,'' he said. ``Our car seems better in high-speed corners than 
slow ones, so we could be good at Silverstone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team chief Craig Pollock said the team had performed below  
expectations but learned from every race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've covered a huge amount of ground very quickly and that  
may be one of the reasons we haven't yet achieved the results we 
want,'' he said. ``We are now confident that we have cars that can 
get to the finish. We have progressed competitively, but we are 
fully aware that the other teams have, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, after overhauling Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher's  
early lead in the drivers' championship, McLaren's defending world 
champion Mika Hakkinen says he has the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher took an early lead in the standings after  
back-to-back wins at San Marino and Monaco, but since then Hakkinen 
won in Spain and Canada to reclaim the No. 1 spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Finn also finished second behind Jordan's  
Heinz-Harald Frentzen in the French GP 10 days ago after lining up 
14th on the grid, while Schumacher finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at our results it looks as though the balance of  
power is shifting our way,'' Hakkinen said. ``We have won a couple 
of races in a row and Magny-Cours (French GP) was also brilliant. I 
was only able to do that because the car the team gave me was 
great. But it is still very close with Ferrari all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen, who edged Schumacher for the championship in the final  
race last season, said anything could happen in the next nine 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	``The championship is tough at the moment and of course Michael  
is just eight points behind,'' he said. ``But I feel confident, 
quite comfortable at the moment.''

<HEADLINE> House Republicans Propose Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With stock ownership at an all-time high,  
House Republicans proposed Wednesday to cut the top tax rate on 
capital gains from 20 percent to 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House immediately criticized the idea as a favor for  
wealthy investors, but GOP leaders point to recent research 
estimating that 84 million people now own stock or participate in 
mutual funds -- an increase of 170 percent from 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	``Capital gains are no longer just for Wall Street brokers and  
high rollers,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the 
House Ways and Means Committee. ``Today, a stake in America's 
private sector often pays for college or a more secure 
retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP proposal would slash the top individual capital-gains  
rate on stocks and most other investments held longer than one year 
from 20 percent to 15 percent, effective retroactively to July 1. 
For people who pay income taxes in the 15 percent rate, the 
capital-gains tax would drop from 10 percent to 7.5 percent, also 
retroactive to July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock ownership in America is rising. Using the most recent New  
York Stock Exchange data, the nonpartisan Congressional Research 
Service reported that in 1995, 26 percent of the U.S. population 
either owned shares directly or through a mutual fund or pension 
plan. That's up from 20 percent in 1985 and 12 percent in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there is a vast difference in the value of these investments  
based on income. Internal Revenue Service statistics show that 
people earning below $50,000 a year in 1997 reported $31.2 billion 
in combined capital gains, compared with $276.2 billion for people 
earning $100,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a risky, costly scheme and the benefits would be  
skewed away from the average taxpayer and toward the wealthiest in 
our society,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	Cost of the cuts over 10 years is unofficially estimated at $50  
billion. They will be part of an $850 billion, 10-year tax package 
expected to emerge from the Ways and Means Committee next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also is likely to include broad-based cuts in income  
taxes, relief from the ``marriage penalty'' paid by millions of 
two-income couples and breaks for health care and education and 
cuts in inheritance taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has expressed a willingness to negotiate tax  
relief with Republicans, but not before projected budget surpluses 
are used to shore up Social Security and Medicare and to pay down 
the national debt. The White House and many Democrats on Capitol 
Hill also want some of the surplus used for additional spending in 
areas such as education. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has proposed a series of targeted tax cuts that  
are aimed at child care, education, long-term care and the 
environment,'' Toiv said. ``We continue to believe that the 
president's tax cuts make the most sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton plans to meet next week at the White House with  
congressional leaders to discuss what to do with the surplus, now 
projected at $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years. Both sides say 
they want to set aside $1.9 trillion for Social Security, but there 
is little agreement on what to do with the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	If the capital-gains cut were to become law, it would mark the  
second major reduction since 1997, when top long-term rates dropped 
from 28 percent to 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released last week by Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a research  
firm based in Lexington, Mass., said the 1997 cut reduced the net 
cost of capital for new investment by 3 percent and will push 
average U.S. household income $309 higher each year over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of tax relief benefits all Americans,'' said Sen.  
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``We need to continue pushing for tax policies 
to promote savings and investment.''

<HEADLINE> More Air Passengers Getting 'Bumped' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The airlines' practice of overbooking flights  
to ensure they have full planes is coming back to bite some 
would-be passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first three months of this year, Delta Air Lines  
``involuntarily denied'' boarding to 8,144 passengers -- nearly as 
many as the other nine major carriers combined, according to new 
Transportation Department statistics. United Air Lines had the 
second highest total, with 2,142 passengers bumped, and Southwest 
Airlines was third, with 1,938 passengers bumped. 
</P>
<P>
	During the same period in 1998, Delta also had the worst record,  
but only 2,736 passengers were involuntarily bumped. 
</P>
<P>
	Involuntary bumpings occur when an airline oversells seats on a  
flight to guard against passengers who don't show up, but then 
can't find enough volunteers to give up their seats and take a 
later flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines contend the long-standing practice benefits the  
consumer, because overbooking allows them to keep flights full and 
airfares down. An average of 10 percent to 15 percent of the 
passengers holding tickets for a flight never show up at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	On occasions when almost everyone does, passengers often  
volunteer to get off because carriers offer inducements such as a 
first-class upgrade on another flight or a voucher for free travel 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overbooking allows us to utilize and offer seats that  
would otherwise be perishable,'' said Tim Smith, a spokesman for 
American Airlines, which has one of the lowest rates of involuntary 
bumpings. ``Once that seat leaves the gate empty, it can never be 
sold again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delta acknowledged Wednesday that it has had problems correctly  
forecasting its passenger loads. The airline has a high-level 
management team studying the issue. It has also ordered new 
passenger forecasting software and created a team to identify 
problematic flights each day and then minimize involuntary 
bumpings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fully intend to significantly reduce involuntary bookings  
to an acceptable level. That is a corporate goal,'' said airline 
spokesman John Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Kennedy noted that the overall number of passengers  
affected is small and that Delta has improved significantly in 
other areas important to travelers, such as on-time performance and 
baggage handling. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Transportation Department policy, airlines can't  
deny a passenger a seat without first asking for volunteers to get 
off a flight that is overbooked. The department also outlines a 
compensation plan for those who end up being involuntarily bumped. 
</P>
<P>
	If the passenger is placed on another flight and arrives within  
an hour of his original arrival time, no compensation is required. 
If the passenger arrives between one and two hours late, the 
airline must pay the passenger a penalty equal to the cost of his 
ticket for that flight, up to a maximum of $200. If the passenger 
arrives more than two hours late, the penalty is double the price 
of the ticket, up to a maximum of $400. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines have different ways of deciding who gets bumped. Most  
accommodate passengers on a first-come, first-served basis, but 
some will seat their first- and business-class customers before 
taking care of those with coach tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in overbookings comes at a time when passenger  
complaints are on the rise. According to the same statistics, the 
major airlines averaged 2.47 complaints per 100,000 passengers in 
May, up from 1.15 complaints in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	American led the way in that category, with 3.70 complaints per  
100,000 passengers. Delta had the second-best record, with 1.82 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the American spokesman, said the carrier was plagued by  
air traffic control problems at its hubs in Dallas and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mean to minimize those who complain, ... but you have  
to put this in perspective,'' Smith said. ``The headline reads 
`doubled' or `tripled' the number of complaints, but you can get a 
very impressive level of change when you're dealing with a small 
number to start with.''

<HEADLINE> Kanaan's CART Boss Making Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Much was expected this season from Tony Kanaan, CART's top  
rookie of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those with the highest hopes was Steve Horne, who runs  
Kanaan's team, one Horne sold before this season to Gerald 
Forsythe. The sale brought major sponsorship from McDonald's, 
opening the door to a full-blown testing program. 
</P>
<P>
	Horne and technical director Diane Holl thought that would help  
a young team move up faster. 
</P>
<P>
	But it hasn't happened.  
</P>
<P>
	So, Horne is back in the garage and out in the pits as more than  
the team president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traditionally, I've been very hands-on with setups,  
adjustments and so forth,'' said Horne, chief mechanic when Bobby 
Rahal won the 1986 Indianapolis 500. ``This year, I tried to step 
back a bit -- not all the way, but somewhat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Holl, who called most of the shots as Kanaan finished ninth  
in the standings last year, took on the responsibility of 
overseeing the testing program. 
</P>
<P>
	She did so in conjunction with the young engineers, and Horne  
says they were very successful in testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in the heat of battle -- a 30- or 40-minute qualifying  
session or a race itself -- there were times when someone needed to 
get into Tony's face more, and we weren't doing that,'' Horne said 
``So, I've taken it upon myself to step back into that role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holl says young engineers sometimes have trouble when they move  
from testing to racing, where decisions must be made very quickly, 
often solely on instinct.

	``Our young engineers got into a few problems where they got a  
little lost,'' she said. ``So we decided to go one step back to 
where Steve and I do the basic engineering, as we did last year, 
and the younger engineers do the testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kanaan is 15th in the points entering the Texaco-Havoline 200 on  
Sunday in Elkhart Lake, Wis., the 10th of 20 events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't figure out what our problem is, maybe because it  
isn't one specific problem,'' the 24-year-old Brazilian said. ``One 
race it's a crash, the next race it's mechanical. There just hasn't 
been one day when everything has gone right. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not for lack of trying. We're working as hard as we can,  
but so is everybody else. And with the series as competitive it is, 
you can't afford to have an off-day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horne realizes that, so before the Cleveland race two weekends  
ago, he crossed what he calls a fine line between having experience 
and allowing people to gain it. 
</P>
<P>
	As a young engineer, his education in the sport often gave way  
to expediency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told, 'Shut up and get on with it. We're too busy to  
explain why right now,' and I learned the reasons later,'' Horne 
said . ``Now I'm playing the same role with our younger staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Horne leading the way, Kanaan was impressive in Cleveland,  
one of his best efforts since winning the pole three months ago in 
Long Beach, Calif. He dominated the first half of the Long Beach 
race, but crashed while leading and finished 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cleveland, he was among the leaders, but his vision was  
obscured in a torrential downpour, forcing him to take one more lap 
before replacing slicks with rain tires. Saying a bicycle could 
have outrun him, Kanaan nonetheless slid off one of the flat turns 
at Burke Lakefront Airport, and again wound up 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
	Another wasted effort? Horne doesn't think so.  
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the finish in Cleveland, the changes we made worked  
out well,'' he said. ``We passed nine cars in the race, and I felt 
we would have finished at least in the top six. Then the rains 
came.''

<HEADLINE> Log On America To Buy cyberTours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A Rhode Island company is buying Maine's  
largest Internet service provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Log On America, a publicly traded company with headquarters in  
Providence, announced Tuesday an agreement to buy cyberTours Inc. 
of Kennebunk, which was created in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal represents the first step in Log On America's plan to  
buy Internet and local telephone companies nationwide so it can 
bundle together a variety of telecommunications services. 
</P>
<P>
	CyberTours, which will become the Northeast operations center  
for Log On America, needed a partnership with a bigger company to 
take its network to the next level technologically, said President 
Stephen Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
	Log On America shipped equipment to Portland Tuesday that will  
allow the delivery of high-speed Internet connections -- better than 
a megabit per second -- over ordinary telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Employment in Kennebunk is likely to double from its current  
level of 75 over the next few years as the company aggressively 
adds subscribers to its 25,000-user base, Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Log On America also plans to file an application with the Maine  
Public Utilities Commission to become a local phone carrier, said 
David Paolo, chairman and chief executive officer of Log On 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	It already is a competitive local phone carrier in Massachusetts  
and Rhode Island, has an application for that status pending in 
Connecticut, and plans to file papers in Vermont and New Hampshire 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Log On American has the capability of providing cable television  
programming through its high-speed connections and is negotiating 
with programmers to make that service available, Paolo said.

<HEADLINE> Unity Conference To Formally Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *BY KAREN GAUDETTE   	
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Newspapers and broadcasters risk losing  
credibility if their staffs don't reflect the diversity of the 
communities they cover, panelists at a minority journalists 
conference said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the people who cover the news and make the decision  
about what gets covered are still overwhelmingly white and male,'' 
Catalina Camia, president of Unity: Journalists of Color Inc., said 
Tuesday. ``It's time for editors to rethink the issue of diversity, 
because the credibility of your news product is at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 6,000 minority journalists from around the country were  
expected to attend the Unity conference, which was to formally open 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're saying, in effect, is that communities of color,  
communities that are not white, need to be treated in the same way 
as upper middle-class white communities in terms of coverage. 
That's revolutionary,'' said Ellis Cose, a contributing editor at 
Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a survey of minority journalists released today found  
grim prospects for retaining minorities in newsrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of more than 450 minority print journalists at U.S.  
daily newspapers of 25,000-plus circulation found more than half 
expected to leave the newspaper business within the next five 
years. Most cited low pay, poor hours and lack of opportunities for 
professional development. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 percent gave their newspapers a ``C'' grade or  
lower in their coverage of minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, conducted by the Freedom Forum's Media Studies  
Center in New York, also found that 61 percent liked their current 
jobs ``very much,'' and that 81 percent would choose journalism as 
a career if they had it to do over again. 
</P>
<P>
	Minorities currently account for 26 percent of the U.S.  
population, according to Census Bureau figures. In its 1998 survey 
of newsroom employment, the American Society of Newspaper Editors 
found that black, Asian, Hispanic and American Indian journalists 
accounted for about 11 percent of newspaper editors, reporters and 
photographers -- about the same as the previous year's figure.

<HEADLINE> Brooke Shields Tours Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- It wasn't just the big things like the Nile  
or the pyramids that impressed Brooke Shields during a tour of 
Cairo. There were also the little ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was beyond moved by the children themselves,'' the American  
actress said Tuesday. ``I was amazed at how none of them were 
willing to be negative about their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shields and other celebrities are part of the worldwide LISTEN  
project, which aims to raise $99 million for children in developing 
countries at the start of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't matter that I didn't speak their language,'' Shields  
said of the children. ``They just saw a kind face and someone who 
was willing to listen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her eyes filled with tears as Egyptians translated.  
</P>
<P>
	``When my mother comes home things will be better,'' one child  
said. Said another: ``When my father is in the house there is 
music, there is taste again; when he is not there nothing has 
taste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To me as an Egyptian it was an experience never to forget,''  
said sculptor Mohamad Abla, who accompanied Shields on her visit.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Germaine Greer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAFFRON WALDON, England (AP) -- When all the lights in Germaine  
Greer's farmhouse went out recently, she checked the fuses, then 
rang the electric company to report a fault. But the male duty 
officer insisted no one else had a problem -- and inquired curtly 
whether she had checked her fuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I looked beyond my garden and there were blue sparks  
shooting into the sky and a team of people working on the line and 
it turned out to be a major fault,'' she recalls in her broad 
Australian tones, distractedly scraping long fingers through her 
short, gray hair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I rang back and the duty officer said, 'Oh yes,' there was a  
fault noted on his log. He just hadn't read the log. If I was a 
man, he wouldn't have treated me that way -- but I'm a middle-aged 
woman, so it's OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some would argue that any caller could have received the same  
response. But Greer believes it illustrates the way women are still 
trivialized and degraded, 30 years after she wrote her landmark 
treatise, ``The Female Eunuch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the second millennium, women can be prime  
ministers and company presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greer notes that millions of women are still slaving in  
Asian sweatshops for almost nothing-an-hour, wearily raising 
families alone and mutilating their bodies to conform to male 
ideals of feminine beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	Irked by the ``lifestyle feminists'' who claim today's women can  
``have it all,'' the fiery, feisty Greer has written the book ``I 
swore I would never write,'' a major stock-taking of the state of 
women's liberation called ``The Whole Woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Published in Britain in March, it became available on U.S.  
bookshelves in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of being liberated to lead valued, joyous lives, Greer  
argues, women have been sold a dud ideal of equality that dictates 
they become like men in order to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just look at Mrs. Thatcher,'' she says, referring to Britain's  
tough-as-nails former prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's society, she says, is ``far more masculinist'' than it  
was three decades ago, with films, video games and popular music 
all peddling brutish misogyny. 
</P>
<P>
	``On every side, we see women troubled, exhausted, mutilated,  
lonely, guilty, mocked by the headlined success of the few,'' she 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality of women's lives is work, most of it unpaid and,  
what is worse, unappreciated. Every day we hear of women abused; 
every day we hear of new kinds of atrocities perpetrated on the 
minds and bodies of women; yet every day we are told there is 
nothing left to fight for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to get angry again,'' the book says.  
</P>
<P>
	And that Greer clearly is, a taut figure in trademark gray (a  
form of semi-mourning adopted during the Gulf War), coiled on the 
edge of a sofa at her home a few miles from Cambridge University, 
where she teaches women's studies. She is also professor of English 
and Comparative Literary Studies at Warwick University. 
</P>
<P>
	She grows vegetables, bakes her own bread and runs a  
rambunctious household that embraces nine geese, a cat, several 
dogs and a variety of lodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Time -- Greer is now 60 -- has not eroded the intellectual ardor  
of the woman who once demolished Norman Mailer in debate. 
</P>
<P>
	More striking than her photographs depict, she is an intriguing,  
frustrating mixture of contradiction and candor, her speech a 
tumble of expletives illuminated by a sharp, darting wit. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman who once posed naked for a Dutch porn magazine berates  
singer Courtney Love in ``The Whole Woman'' for flaunting her body. 
</P>
<P>
	And she asserts, sweepingly, that ``some men hate all women all  
of the time; all men hate some women some of the time.'' Yet she 
confesses, ``I like men. They have given me the best times of my 
life -- and the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Greer, the whole, liberated woman is comfortable with her  
body -- womb, breasts, menstrual blood and all. 
</P>
<P>
	She ``does not exist to embody male sexual fantasies or rely  
upon a man to endow her with identity and social status.'' And she 
``does not have to be beautiful ... can be clever (and) will grow 
in authority as she ages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Greer says, we get Barbie, the pouting plastic goddess  
who sells by the million, purveying an ersatz ideal of frilly 
femininity to little girls. The ideal Barbie woman is blond, 
barrel-breasted and brainless. Significantly, Greer notes, she is 
also silent. 
</P>
<P>
	So women have allowed doctors to flood their systems with  
chemical contraceptives, trim and tuck their bodies and perform 
unnecessary caesareans and hysterectomies, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	They ``are driven through the health system like sheep through a  
dip. The disease they are being treated for is womanhood,'' she 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
	In relationships, women still take the blame; in the home, they  
do most of the labor, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Greer confesses that she's changed her mind on some  
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``The Female Eunuch,'' she insisted that motherhood was not a  
substitute career. ``Now,'' she says, ``I would argue that 
motherhood should be regarded as a genuine career option ... as 
paid work and, as such, an alternative to other paid work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also once condemned female circumcision as barbaric  
mutilation demanded by men. But after traveling in the 
``woman-centered, child-infested cultures'' of countries like 
Sudan, she says she has realized that such practices can have 
ritual and social value in some cultures. 
</P>
<P>
	The critics are divided on ``The Whole Woman.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Will young women come flocking to this call? Unlikely, I  
think,'' wrote Ros Coward in The Guardian newspaper. ``The days for 
feminist fundamentalism have gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But American feminist Camille Paglia said that while most  
British feminists have ``wasted their lives sitting around in 
discussion groups like atheists looking for a new religion, Greer 
got out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for Greer to take the stage again,'' Paglia said,  
``and I'm glad that she is.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Says Kosovo Turmoil Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Despite more reports of ethnic  
violence, NATO and U.N. officials said today that turmoil has 
declined sharply since peacekeepers arrived and it soon will be up 
to Kosovo's people to keep the peace themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is progressively improving,'' said NATO  
spokesman Louis Garneau. ``The people of Kosovo must now turn to 
peaceful means to resolve their differences. The conflict is 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, NATO troops remain essential for maintaining the  
peace, as evidenced today when a large, well-armed escort by French 
soldiers and police prevented violence from erupting during a march 
by ethnic Albanians through the Serb-held section of the divided 
city of Kosovska Mitrovica. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 ethnic Albanians, closely guarded by the French  
peacekeepers, marched across a bridge dividing the northern Kosovo 
town and through the Serb sector. The crowd chanted ``Albania, 
Albania'' and ``U-C-K, U-C-K,'' the Albanian-language initials for 
the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs retorted with shouts of ``Serbia! Serbia!'' Despite some  
stone throwing and flag burning by both sides at the disputed 
bridge, the hourlong march came off without serious violence, no 
small feat in a city that has come to symbolize Kosovo's ethnic 
divide. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO and the United Nations have been brokering talks aimed at  
defusing tension in the town since Serbs blocked the bridge several 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Garneau condemned scattered acts of violence elsewhere in  
Kosovo, including an incident in the town of Lipljan, south of 
Pristina, in which 10 Serb doctors and nurses allegedly were 
assaulted by the Albanian staff at a clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a Serb also reported she and her husband had been beaten  
in the southern Kosovo town of Urosevac, and a Canadian helicopter 
was fired on, but not hit, during a routine patrol over Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has struggled to restrain returning ethnic Albanian  
refugees from taking revenge on minority Serbs who subjected them 
to brutal abuse during the Kosovo conflict. At least 60,000 Serbs 
have fled the province for fear of reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman Kevin Kennedy said the deployment of civilian  
police from other countries should help curb the violence. ``But 
the bottom line is that unless there is concerted effort on the 
part of political leaders and individuals ... to restrain 
themselves .. there's really very little we can do to stop random 
acts of violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's mission has been complicated by the unexpectedly rapid  
return of refugees to Kosovo since the alliance's 78-day bombing 
campaign forced Yugoslavia's government to accept a peace plan and 
pull out its troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Of an estimated 860,000 Albanians who fled or were expelled from  
Kosovo during the conflict, more than 600,000 have returned since 
NATO peacekeepers began arriving June 12. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO is hoping the deployment of Russian peacekeepers will help  
calm Serb fears. Russia, a traditional Slavic ally of Serbia, is 
sending 3,600 troops to supplement the 55,000 planned by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Planeloads of Russian troops and equipment arrived Tuesday,  
formally ending a stalemate with NATO over their deployment, and 
more are expected to arrive daily to work alongside NATO troops. 
For now, they are remaining close to the airport outside Pristina 
while final details about their deployment are settled, Garneau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new agreement with NATO, the Russians will be deployed  
in Orahovac and Malisevo in the German sector, at Kosovsko Kamenica 
in the American sector, and at Lausa in the French sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, opposition leaders in Yugoslavia said they would step  
up protests to demand the resignation of President Slobodan 
Milosevic, who is widely blamed for the Kosovo conflict and has 
been indicted for crimes against humanity by a U.N. tribunal in The 
Hague. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the opposition remains sharply divided, its leaders have  
been bolstered by growing protests, including two Tuesday in the 
cities of Leskovac and Uzice. Some leaders speak of calling a 
general strike to force Milosevic to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Many accuse Milosevic of virtually losing Kosovo, a southern  
province of Serbia, the dominant republic in what remains of 
Yugoslavia. Though many Serbs regard Kosovo as the cradle of their 
culture and Serbian Orthodox religion, its prewar population of 2 
million was 90 percent ethnic Albanian. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic cast his crackdown in the province as a battle against  
terrorist-led secessionists.

<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- The company producing Coca-Cola in  
Portugal reached an out-of-court settlement Wednesday with a man 
who alleged he was blinded when one of the soft drink bottles 
exploded in his face, according to news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Joao Redondo had demanded compensation from Refrige, which  
produces Coca-Cola in Portugal under license, for injuries he 
allegedly sustained in 1991 while working in a cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	A court in Figueira da Foz, 90 miles north of Lisbon, was to  
start hearing the case Wednesday but the two sides told the judge 
they had reached an agreement, the Portuguese news agency Lusa 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side would give details of the settlement.  
</P>
<P>
	Redondo had demanded $324,000 from Refrige but the company  
refused, and he had rejected their earlier counteroffer of $16,000, 
Lusa reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Redondo alleged the bottle exploded as he put down a crate of  
Coca-Cola bottles on a counter of the cafe where he was working 
during his summer vacation, according to Lusa. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he suffered injuries to his face and chest and lost his  
eyesight. He was 14 at the time.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends at New High of 11,187.36 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks bobbed and weaved into record high  
territory Wednesday as the beginning of the second-quarter earnings 
reporting season injected some uncertainty into the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	After trading in a narrow range for much of the session, the Dow  
Jones industrial average closed up 52.24 at 11,187.36. That topped 
its previous record of 11,139.24, set last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and Nasdaq composite index also set  
new records, posting modest gains after shifting in and out of 
positive territory throughout the session. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 7.74 to 
1,395.86, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.26 to 2,743.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts expect mostly robust earnings reports from  
U.S. companies, whose profits continue to grow along with the 
nation's economy. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. anticipate 
earnings for the companies on the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 list to 
rise 11.4 percent for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But with market indexes at record levels, analysts say investors  
may punish any companies that miss or merely meet published 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is waiting to sink its teeth into some solid  
numbers,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock 
&AMP; Co. ``Having moved up sharply last week, the market is just 
marking time until we see exactly what these second-quarter numbers 
look like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Companies offered a glimpse of those numbers Wednesday, and the  
results were decidedly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management plunged 19 5/8 to 33 15/16 after saying it expects  
to miss Wall Street estimates by as much as 12 cents per share. The 
company blamed a $250 million shortfall in North American revenue, 
prompting downgrades from several analysts who criticized the 
company's management. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa, meanwhile, proved that in the current market, good news  
isn't always enough. Alcoa fell 2 3/8 to 61 3/8 after reporting earnings 
of 64 cents per share, a penny ahead of expectations. Alcoa, 
considered a cyclical stock that thrives in times of economic 
growth, has been the strongest gainer among Dow components so far 
this year, and analysts said investors may be reluctant to bid it 
much higher. 
</P>
<P>
	By late afternoon, the Dow picked up strength from growing  
speculation that General Electric will beat Wall Street's consensus 
earnings estimate of 84 cents per share. Shares of GE rose 4 to 117 
15/16, accounting for much of the Dow's gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet search engine provider Yahoo! tumbled 8 1/16 to 167  
1/16 amid wild speculation over its after-hours earnings report. 
Wall Street called for earnings of 8 cents per share, but traders 
said Yahoo! sank amid rumors that it might miss the ``whisper 
number'' of 9 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Whisper numbers are unofficial forecasts circulated among  
traders and on Internet trading sites. Ultimately, Yahoo! said it 
earned 11 cents a share, and its stock rebounded to 172 1/2 in 
after-hours trading on Instinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts believe that last week's 586.68-point gain in the  
Dow may have left little room to extend the long run of U.S. 
equities. 
</P>
<P>
	``All expectations are for very strong earnings this quarter,''  
said Gary Campbell, chief investment officer at The Commerce Funds 
in St. Louis. ``But that won't result in major gains. It can't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Away from the choppy trading of most market indexes, the initial  
public offering of Musicmaker.com benefited from renewed interest 
in new Internet stocks. The Web-based company, which lets customers 
create customized compact discs, was priced at 14 and closed at 24.

<HEADLINE> Thai Auto Plant Makes 28,000 Trucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Ford and Mazda's joint assembly plant  
in Thailand has produced 28,000 vehicles in its first year of 
operations and is aiming for 65,000 this year, executives said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant produces Ford Ranger and Mazda Fighter pickups and is  
operated under the AutoAllance joint venture by the U.S. and 
Japanese automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since production began July 1, 1998, AutoAlliance has exported  
18,694 pickups, about evenly split between the two brands, making 
the venture the second-largest auto exporter after Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
	Export earnings were about $40 million.  
</P>
<P>
	David Snyder, president of Ford Operations (Thailand), told a  
news conference marking the anniversary of the plant that the 
export targets for the second year are 40,000 to 45,000 pickups. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's domestic strategy faces a major hurdle since the  
government has still not ruled whether the four-door Ranger model 
is a pickup, which is taxed at 5 percent, or a sedan, taxed at 43 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-door model currently is only exported.

<HEADLINE> Toyota To Shed Seniority Pay System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Breaking with Japanese corporate tradition, Toyota  
Motor Corp. said Wednesday it plans to adopt a new pay system based 
on performance rather than seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	The new arrangement, which the automaker hopes to launch in  
October, is intended to encourage employees to work harder by 
rewarding them for their achievements, Toyota spokesman Tomomi Imai 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this will improve our company's performance,'' Imai  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota, like most large Japanese companies, has traditionally  
given management-track workers automatic pay raises as they got 
older. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers will still receive these regular pay raises under the  
new system. The amount they get, however, will be based on 
performance instead of age, Imai said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will ask its labor union to agree to the new payment  
plan in August, and once in place, about 20,000 of Toyota's 70,000 
employees in Japan will be affected, Imai said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the new system will only affect lower-level  
managers. Top Toyota executives are already paid on a merit-based 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker's announcement comes as Japanese companies across  
the board are scrambling for ways to increase productivity and 
innovation through new management styles and drastic labor cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, corporate giants like Mitsubishi Electric  
Corp. and Sony Corp. have announced plans to slim operations and 
cut thousands of workers -- straying from Japan's long tradition of 
lifetime employment. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, many electronics and computer companies have  
adopted performance-based pay scales to spur creative thinking 
among engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even major appliance-maker Hitachi, long criticized as  
inflexible, has slashed its work force and adopted a casual dress 
policy -- something company officials say is to emphasize ``respect 
for the individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota is the first of Japan's automakers to completely abolish  
its seniority-based wage system. Many, however, say it may not be 
the last. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen all kinds of companies adopting this kind of  
policy,'' said Satoko Hiwatari, who studies labor trends for 
Nikkeiren, an influential business group. ``Everything is pointing 
in this direction.''

<HEADLINE> $1M Lien Levied on Frankel Estates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- A judge has levied a $1 million lien on  
two estates owned by fugitive financier Martin Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	The lien was attached at the request of David Rosse, Frankel's  
former bodyguard, who is suing the missing money manager for 
allegedly connecting him to a fraudulent charity, The Greenwich 
Time reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old financier, accused of embezzling at least $215  
million from insurance companies in five states, is wanted on 
federal wire fraud and money laundering charges. Also missing is as 
much as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, a 
purported charity established in the British Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Frankel used the alias ``David Rosse'' to set up  
the charity. Rosse last week sued Frankel for more than $1 million, 
charging misappropriation of his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Frank D'Andrea Jr. signed the lien Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Frankel has been missing since May 5, when firefighters called  
to his mansion found a blazing file cabinet and two fireplaces 
stuffed with burning documents. Left behind was a to-do list -- item 
No. 1: ``Launder money'' -- and astrological charts designed to 
answer such questions as ``Will I go to prison?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is believed to have fled to Europe.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hartford Courant reported today that Frankel may be  
financing his life on the run with $10 million in diamonds he 
bought shortly before disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Frankel transferred $10 million to the  
Beverly Hills branch of an Israeli bank, where it was deposited 
into the account of World Wide Diamond, an international wholesaler 
based in Los Angeles. The FBI is attempting to seize the $10 
million from the diamond company. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Wiener, who operates World Wide Diamond, declined to  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Court Orders Election at Shipyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Union organizers at the Avondale shipyard  
must hold a new union election because the one held more than six 
years ago was ``fatally flawed,'' the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeal ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,850 workers who voted should have had to do more than give  
their names -- especially since the National Labor Relations Board 
knew that hundreds of votes would be challenged, Judge Edith H. 
Jones wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one knows exactly who voted in the Avondale election,''  
Jones wrote. The company also raised serious questions about 
possible vote fraud, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A union attorney called the ruling bizarre, saying the NLRB has  
used the same identification procedure for 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's ruling came as Avondale prepared for a July 27  
merger with Litton Industries Inc., which owns Ingalls Shipyard in 
nearby Pascagoula, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither union attorney Bill Lurye or company attorney Keith  
Pyburn would talk about how the merger will affect the chances of 
union representation at Avondale. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no way to hold another election before the merger, said  
Lurye, adding that it's too soon to say whether the union will 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton spokesman Randy Belote refused to comment on the ruling,  
since shareholders must still vote on the merger July 27. But he 
wouldn't rule out a union at Avondale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Litton enjoys a very good relationship with its union and has  
a close working relationship with the leaders of its union in its 
yard in Pascagoula,'' Belote said. ``We would expect that type of 
relationship to continue in Avondale once we conclude the 
acquisition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New Orleans Metal Trades Council had claimed a 600-vote  
victory immediately after the 1993 election, which Judge Jones 
characterized as ``contentious and bitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union challenged 850 votes, but after a recount the NLRB  
gave the union a 250-vote majority.

<HEADLINE> Return to Peyton Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- ``Indian summer is like a woman. Ripe,  
hotly passionate, but fickle, she comes and goes as she pleases so 
that one is never sure whether she will come at all, nor for how 
long she will stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, readers didn't need to read much more than the opening  
words of Grace Metalious' novel, ``Peyton Place,'' to be shocked. 
</P>
<P>
	In that opening passage, Metalious managed to turn the sedate  
image of a New England autumn into one of blazing emotion and 
color, by comparing unseasonably warm October weather in New 
Hampshire to a voluptuous woman. And she sliced through gender 
stereotypes by focusing on female sexuality at a time when it was 
taboo to discuss it in public. 
</P>
<P>
	Four decades later, Ardis Cameron thinks people should take a  
fresh look at the cultural relevance of the book that offended 
American sensibilities and rocked New England's Puritanical 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The book was so controversial at the time that teens had to  
sneak a read. So did adults, for that matter. Libraries, bookstores 
and even some cities banned it. 
</P>
<P>
	``People read this book in secret,'' said Cameron, a professor  
of American and New England studies at the University of Southern 
Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron, 50, finally read ``Peyton Place'' eight years ago. She  
was surprised to find a scathing commentary of small-town New 
England life. She enjoyed the book so much that she began using it 
in a course she taught. 
</P>
<P>
	After having trouble finding copies for her course, she  
successfully lobbied the Northeastern University Press to rerelease 
the out-of-print book this year in celebration of what would have 
been Metalious' 75th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peyton Place'' focuses on the lives of three women in a small  
New Hampshire town on the Connecticut River. It discusses incest, 
sexual abuse and women's sexual desire at a time when conventional 
wisdom held that sexual predators were strangers, bad girls ``asked 
for it'' and good girls didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Metalious' ``Peyton Place'' is roiling with hypocrisy, spite and  
distrust. It is a place where men can do little wrong, but women 
must be vigilant about preserving their reputations. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Lucas Cross had lived in Peyton Place all his life, as had his  
father and grandfather before him. ... He drank, beat his wife and 
abused his children, and he had one virtue which he believed 
outweighed all his faults. He paid his bills. To be in debt was the 
one -- and only -- cardinal sin to men like Lucas Cross. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	But while men like Cross, who raped his daughter, could do  
almost anything and still be forgiven so long as they paid their 
bills, a woman's reputation could be permanently tarnished by a bit 
of gossip, even if it was untrue. 
</P>
<P>
	Constance MacKenzie illustrates this when she panics upon  
realizing her 14-year-old daughter Allison and her friends are 
playing a kissing game at a party: 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, she'll get hurt! was the first thought that filled her.  
</P>
<P>
	``Then: Oh, she'll get in trouble!  
</P>
<P>
	``And finally, worst of all: SHE'LL GET HERSELF TALKED ABOUT!''  
</P>
<P>
	Just like Metalious.  
</P>
<P>
	Critics, politicians and neighbors pilloried Metalious. They  
dismissed her book as ``cheap,'' ``wicked,'' ``moral filth'' -- ``a 
tabloid version of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while critics were ranting, America was reading. The book  
sold more than 12 million copies at a time when a typical novel 
could expect to sell 2,000. Few, though, would admit reading such 
``trash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Peyton Place'' almost didn't make it into print. Five Boston  
publishing houses and at least four in New York City turned it 
down. Finally, Kitty Messner, president of the Julian Messner 
publishing house, accepted it. Messner, who staffed her late 
ex-husband's company almost entirely with women, read the book in 
one sitting and declared it ``a product of genius.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messner teamed with what was then a small house called Dell  
Publishing, the only other publishing house with a woman at the 
helm, to print the paperback version. It sold 8 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to publish transformed both Dell and the paperback  
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paperbacks became a viable industry that competed with the  
hardback,'' Cameron said. ``Metalious showed there was definitely a 
market among respectable middle-class readers, and it certainly 
opened the eyes of the publishing industry that women writers could 
be best sellers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Metalious opened the door for women novelists like Jacqueline  
Susann, who in the 1960s produced the best-selling ``Valley of the 
Dolls,'' another raunchy tale that went beyond small-town life to 
the fast lanes of Hollywood, New York and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``While it is true, no doubt, that the closets of city dwellers  
are in as sad disorder as those of small-town residents, the 
difference is that the city dweller is not as apt to be on as 
intimate terms with the contents of his neighbor's closet as is the 
inhabitant of a smaller community. The difference between a closet 
skeleton and a scandal, in a small town, is that the former is 
examined behind barns by small groups who converse over it in 
whispers, while the latter is looked upon by everyone, on the main 
street, and discussed in shouts from rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Peyton Place there were three sources of scandal: suicide,  
murder and the impregnation of an unmarried girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Metalious' book covers all three.  
</P>
<P>
	``To a tourist these towns look as peaceful as a postcard  
picture, but if you go beneath that picture it's like turning over 
a rock with your foot. All kinds of strange things crawl out,'' 
Metalious once said. 
</P>
<P>
	A French-Canadian from a working-class Manchester, N.H., family  
of mill workers, Metalious struggled with her husband, George, to 
scrape by on his $3,000-a-year principal's salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go along with all the claptrap about poverty being  
good for the soul, and trouble and struggle being great 
strengtheners of character,'' Metalious wrote in 1958. ``It has 
been my experience that being poor makes people mean and grabby, 
and trouble makes them tight-lipped and whiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mother of three lived in a house she dubbed ``It'll Do,''  
with no running water or sewer lines. She wrote ``Peyton Place'' to 
try to escape from poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had no illusions about that kind of life because she lived  
it and knew how oppressing it was, how debilitating,'' Cameron 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The author's sensitivity to poverty shows in ``Peyton Place,''  
which also touches upon class snobbery. 
</P>
<P>
	David Watters, a University of New Hampshire English professor,  
cites a scene at the end of the book, when residents pass zoning 
laws to ban the shacks from downtown so the area will look good to 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Most of them can well afford to make improvements on their  
property. They could use some of the money they drink up to install 
toilets and tanks and water. . . Maybe a good epidemic would solve 
everything. Perhaps the town would be better off without the 
characters who live in those places,''' says Seth Buswell, the 
town's newspaper editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Communities still argue at town meetings about the struggle to  
pay for schools and services. As in the book, low-income families 
often are blamed for straining services by having kids but not 
paying enough in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that doesn't show New England today, I don't know what  
does,'' Watters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peyton Place'' gave Metalious the money she wanted, but  
because she was inexperienced in business, she only got $75,000 for 
the movie rights. She received no royalties or TV rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of its success, Metalious was able to buy her dream  
house in Gilmanton, where she wrote three other books. But her 
generosity was excessive. By in 1964, at age 39, she had drunk 
herself to death by cirrhosis of the liver and was in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	She knew about ``getting herself talked about,'' something  
looked upon with horror in the book. She was scorned for not 
keeping her house clean and not living up to the image the town 
wanted for the wife of a school principal. 
</P>
<P>
	Divorce and a relationship with a married British man did not  
help. 
</P>
<P>
	``People shut her out almost at the beginning. She wore pants  
and jeans and flannel shirts. They wanted pearls and stockings,'' 
Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't stop people from going to the parties she threw  
in her home, said Allan Hugelman, a director of the town's 
historical society who now lives in Metalious' house in New 
Hampshire. ``It was the 'in' thing in Gilmanton not to like her,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Working-class women who never read Betty Friedan's ``Feminine  
Mystique'' started talking about gender, sexuality and incest after 
reading ``Peyton Place,'' using the book to negotiate their own 
lives and sexual relationships, Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wrote about what was central to the lives of women --  
sexual reality, sexual activity, incest, abortion -- all the things 
that became the foundation of the second wave of the feminist 
movement,'' Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
	The author's reputation plunged further when reporters swarmed  
into Gilmanton in the wake of the book's success. Townspeople 
resented the notion that anyone might think the book was based on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Metalious perhaps conveys her own sense of not belonging with  
the character of Allison MacKenzie, who grows from a girl of 11 to 
a woman trying to become a writer in New York City. Early in the 
book, Allison struggles with burgeoning adolescence in a small town 
that she believes is always watching. 
</P>
<P>
	Metalious based another main character, Selena Cross, on a girl  
from a nearby town who confessed in 1947 to killing her father 
after years of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The book differs greatly from the movie, much of which was  
filmed in Camden, Maine. The movie, starring Lana Turner and Arthur 
Kennedy, glosses over many of the darker aspects of Metalious' 
book. For example, Selena gets an abortion in the book, but has a 
miscarriage in the movie; the townsfolk shun her in the book, but 
embrace her in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV series of the late 1960s, which starred Mia Farrow,  
further sanitized the subject matter. Mill workers, child abusers, 
drunks and Selena Cross don't exist in the TV world of Peyton 
Place. 
</P>
<P>
	After Metalious' death, ABC sanitized the story, removing the  
poor characters and giving the stars different motivations, desires 
and personalities than the characters in the book. The town was 
moved from textile and lumber country to a quaint seashore. The 
publicity blitz surrounding the hugely popular prime-time soap 
opera drove Metalious' work underground. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, some Gilmanton people give tight smiles or roll their  
eyes when asked about the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidi Herzberger, manager of the Temperance Tavern Bed &AMP;  
Breakfast, believes tensions have eased over the years. ``I think 
the town has started to take a live-and-let-live attitude,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Metalious did not think ``Peyton Place'' would sell. Cameron  
said an interviewer asked Metalious in 1956 whether her book would 
be remembered in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a very timid voice, she responded, 'No, no, it's not  
important, it's not important, no one will remember.'''

<HEADLINE>  Packers' Shareholders Sound Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers can remain  
financially competitive at Lambeau Field for four more years, team 
president Bob Harlan told more than 7,000 shareholders gathered 
today for the team's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Harlan said the Packers either must build a new  
stadium or make more than $75 million in renovations to Lambeau 
Field in order to keep up with the spiraling salaries and signing 
bonuses of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make no threats, we have no leverage,'' Harlan said. ``But  
we must find a way to remain competitive in the NFL's changing 
financial situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers' second outdoor shareholders meeting at Lambeau  
attracted fans representing over 56 percent of the shares in the 
league's only publicly held franchise. The 90-minute session 
featured a detailed overview of the upcoming season and reports 
from several team departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers officials called it the largest annual corporate meeting  
in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The shareholders also were invited to ask questions from the  
stands. Hot topics ranged from the stadium situation to the 
possibility of allowing Wisconsin residents to contribute part of 
their tax refund to their favorite team. 
</P>
<P>
	Team treasurer John Underwood assessed the team's financial  
state and called 1999 ``a dramatic reality check.'' The team 
disclosed last month in its annual report that despite record 
earnings, the Packers experienced a small negative cash flow that 
would have been much larger if not for the Cleveland Browns' $16 
million one-time expansion fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Packers have sold out every game at Lambeau Field  
since 1960, the aging stadium has neither the amenities nor the 
seating capacities to allow the team to keep pace in a league in 
which 21 of the 31 teams have new or renovated home fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I listen to the people and the fans who contact me and  
write me, their preference is to stay in Lambeau Field,'' Harlan 
said. ``... But we also recognize that changes will have to be 
made, and we have some decisions to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers and the NFL have determined the team's revenue from  
playing at Lambeau Field will only keep pace with the rest of the 
league for four more years, Harlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay leases its private boxes for about half of the  
league's average price, and Lambeau Field's infrastructure is well 
behind that in other stadiums. In particular, the team said it 
needs to make more money from concessions, seat licenses and club 
seating. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders repeatedly asked Harlan why the team couldn't  
simply add a second deck to Lambeau Field, allowing most of the 
40,000 people on the team's season-ticket waiting list to generate 
revenue by buying the new seats. Harlan explained that the NFL's 
revenue-sharing policy gives 40 percent of ticket sales money to 
the visiting team.

<HEADLINE>  Packers' Shareholders Sound Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers can remain  
financially competitive at Lambeau Field for four more years, team 
president Bob Harlan told more than 7,000 shareholders gathered 
today for the team's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Harlan said the Packers either must build a new  
stadium or make more than $75 million in renovations to Lambeau 
Field in order to keep up with the spiraling salaries and signing 
bonuses of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make no threats, we have no leverage,'' Harlan said. ``But  
we must find a way to remain competitive in the NFL's changing 
financial situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers' second outdoor shareholders meeting at Lambeau  
attracted fans representing over 56 percent of the shares in the 
league's only publicly held franchise. The 90-minute session 
featured a detailed overview of the upcoming season and reports 
from several team departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers officials called it the largest annual corporate meeting  
in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The shareholders also were invited to ask questions from the  
stands. Hot topics ranged from the stadium situation to the 
possibility of allowing Wisconsin residents to contribute part of 
their tax refund to their favorite team. 
</P>
<P>
	Team treasurer John Underwood assessed the team's financial  
state and called 1999 ``a dramatic reality check.'' The team 
disclosed last month in its annual report that despite record 
earnings, the Packers experienced a small negative cash flow that 
would have been much larger if not for the Cleveland Browns' $16 
million one-time expansion fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Packers have sold out every game at Lambeau Field  
since 1960, the aging stadium has neither the amenities nor the 
seating capacities to allow the team to keep pace in a league in 
which 21 of the 31 teams have new or renovated home fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I listen to the people and the fans who contact me and  
write me, their preference is to stay in Lambeau Field,'' Harlan 
said. ``... But we also recognize that changes will have to be 
made, and we have some decisions to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers and the NFL have determined the team's revenue from  
playing at Lambeau Field will only keep pace with the rest of the 
league for four more years, Harlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay leases its private boxes for about half of the  
league's average price, and Lambeau Field's infrastructure is well 
behind that in other stadiums. In particular, the team said it 
needs to make more money from concessions, seat licenses and club 
seating. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders repeatedly asked Harlan why the team couldn't  
simply add a second deck to Lambeau Field, allowing most of the 
40,000 people on the team's season-ticket waiting list to generate 
revenue by buying the new seats. Harlan explained that the NFL's 
revenue-sharing policy gives 40 percent of ticket sales money to 
the visiting team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really in an education mode right now,'' Harlan said.  
``You try to tell them, but I'm not sure they got the message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's second annual meeting has already become a favorite  
event among the team's faithful fans, who traveled from all corners 
of the country to Green Bay. Many wore T-shirts or hats with the

<HEADLINE> Japanese Consumers Buying More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In what may be a sign of optimism for Japan's  
economy, consumers are buying more computers and compact cars and 
plan to travel more this summer -- though many are targeting 
discount models and low-fares. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Travel Bureau estimated that the number of people planning  
trips in July and August rose 2.5 percent from last year, a 
spokesman for the travel agency said today. The increase follows a 
3 percent decline in overseas travel last summer as recession-weary 
consumers cut back. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the increase this summer is a ``recovery in consumer  
sentiment,'' said JTB spokesman Tsuyoshi Kurata. 
</P>
<P>
	But the survey also showed that Japanese are choosing less  
exotic, and cheaper, destinations so that even though there will be 
more travelers, they will only spend about the same amount as last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in discount-travel is part of a broader shift away  
from high-priced, name-brand products, as Japan's once famously 
haughty consumers look for value in tough economic times. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists said the trend is encouraging because it shows  
that more people are willing to open their purse strings. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase in consumer spending is seen as crucial for recovery  
because it accounts for about two-thirds of Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's gross domestic product -- the measure of all goods and  
services produced within its borders -- rose 1.9 percent in the 
first quarter but much of the growth came from government, not 
private, spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in travel wasn't the only recent bright sign.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales of personal computers are soaring this summer, said  
Yoshiharu Satake, a spokesman for Yodobashi Camera, one of Tokyo's 
largest computer and electronics retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company wouldn't disclose exact figures, but Satake said  
computer sales in the last month were about three times higher than 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	And while sales of most cars have been falling in recent months,  
there's been a surge in demand for low-priced compact models. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of the so-called mini-vehicles -- a special category of  
low-power cars that are cheaper to license and insure -- rose 29 
percent in June compared to year ago to 165,466 cars, a trade 
association said. Sales of the cars have risen by double-digits 
every month since October. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, spending by Japanese households in May rose 2.4 percent  
from a year earlier, marking the first pickup in four months, the 
Management and Coordination Agency said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Increases were registered for housing, transportation and  
communications, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumption trend is clearly up,'' said Richard Werner,  
chief economist for Profit Research Center in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Werner said he believes consumer spending is even stronger than  
the recent numbers indicate. 
</P>
<P>
	That's in part because those figures focus too much on sales at  
high-priced department stores and not enough on the discount stores 
and supermarkets where a growing number of people are shopping, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Politician Accused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- A former Bosnian Serb Cabinet  
minister planned a campaign of terror and murder to drive non-Serbs 
from parts of Bosnia in 1992, according to a U.N. indictment 
unsealed today, a day after his arrest by NATO troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Radislav Brdjanin, 51, is the most senior Bosnian Serb civilian  
official yet to be brought to the U.N. war crimes tribunal for 
trial. He arrived at the tribunal's detention unit late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment revealed details of a campaign of persecution  
that Brdjanin, now a lawmaker in the Bosnian Serb parliament, 
allegedly instituted to drive Muslims and Croats from the regions 
of Prijedor and Sanski Most in northwest Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	The former civil engineer, who served briefly as Bosnian Serb  
prime minister in the early part of the 1992-95 Bosnian war, 
allegedly helped design and execute a three-point plan aimed at 
ethnic purges. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan involved first pressuring non-Serbs to flee by creating  
``impossible conditions involving pressure and terror tactics,'' 
the indictment claims. Those who refused to leave allegedly were 
physically forced from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The chilling final stage was ``to liquidate those non-Serbs who  
remained,'' according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Brdjanin was president of a so-called crisis  
staff in the region responsible for putting the plan into action in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges he ``planned, instigated, ordered,  
committed or otherwise aided and abetted'' attacks on villages, 
killings and the imprisonment of non-Serbs in camps. Hundreds of 
prisoners were killed in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Brdjanin was arrested Tuesday in the northern Bosnian city of  
Banja Luka by British troops serving in the NATO-led Stabilization 
Force. His March 12 indictment was kept secret by the tribunal 
until his arrest to prevent him from going into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Bosnian war, Brdjanin served as minister of  
urbanization in the government of Radovan Karadzic and also has 
been blamed for ordering the destruction of mosques in mainly 
Muslim areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Karadzic, who no longer holds power, twice has been indicted by  
the U.N. war crimes tribunal on genocide charges but remains at 
large. 
</P>
<P>
	Brdjanin was formally charged with persecution, a crime against  
humanity. He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	No date was immediately set for his arraignment, at which he  
will be asked to confirm his identity and enter a plea to the 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related case, the tribunal announced today that judges will  
deliver their verdicts July 15 in prosecution and defense appeals 
of Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic's 1997 war crimes conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tadic, the first defendant to be tried at the U.N. tribunal, was  
sentenced to 20 years imprisonment after being convicted of 
murdering and torturing non-Serbs in the Prijedor region in 1992 -- 
the same period in which Brdjanin allegedly planned atrocities 
there.

<HEADLINE>  Heat Toll Hits Poor, Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For most people heat waves merely mean  
discomfort or inconvenience, but they can also kill by the 
thousands -- mostly poor and elderly victims with bodies unable to 
cope with the temperature or wallets unable to afford the costs of 
cooling. 
</P>
<P>
	Only winter's cold kills more people, year after year, than  
heat. Tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes are less 
deadly, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1979 through 1996, a yearly average of 381 people died of  
heat in the United States, the federal Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention in Atlanta said. It calculated 6,864 heat deaths in 
that time span. 
</P>
<P>
	And the heat wave now baking much of the nation promises to add  
to the toll. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 40-year period from 1936 through 1975, almost 20,000  
people were killed in the United States by the effects of heat and 
solar radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	A sizzling July in 1901 baked the Midwest, claiming more than  
9,500 lives, according to a report in NOAA, the former magazine of 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That easily 
exceeds the death toll of 6,000 from a hurricane a year earlier 
that struck Galveston, Texas, often cited as the deadliest weather 
event of the 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1906 an earthquake and fire in San Francisco claimed 452  
lives - fewer than Los Angeles-area heat waves that caused 546 
deaths in 1939, 946 in 1955, and 580 in 1963, a study in the 
journal Environmental Research found. 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe the tolls are understated, listing only those who  
succumb directly to temperature-related conditions such as 
heatstroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can know how many more deaths are advanced by heat wave  
weather, how many diseased or aging hearts surrender that under 
better conditions would have continued functioning,'' the National 
Weather Service reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Indirect casualties can be staggering, with the stress leading  
to a jump in deaths from heart attacks and other causes. During a 
1966 heat wave, the mortality rate more than doubled in New York 
City and leaped fivefold in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control noted that age is a major factor  
in succumbing to the heat; half the victims are 65 or over. 
</P>
<P>
	Some deaths can be attributed to lack of air conditioning in a  
city where the weather is usually cooler. Others can be traced to 
power outages. Many occur simply because people don't consider the 
danger of heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Many who died in the 1995 Chicago heat wave were frail,  
frightened or alone. Some died behind boarded windows, their fear 
of intruders contributing to their demise. Others lost their lives 
when no one came to check on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities are particularly dangerous in heat waves. Paving and  
buildings absorb heat and warm the temperature, and air movement is 
restricted by buildings.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Proposes Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As investors continue pouring money into the  
stock market, House Republicans are proposing to slash the top 
capital gains tax rates from 20 percent to 15 percent as part of 
the GOP's mammoth tax relief bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement today by House Ways and Means Committee  
Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, followed Tuesday's unveiling of a 
proposed new exemption for people who provide long-term care to 
elderly relatives at home. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 84 million Americans now invest in stocks, up 170  
percent since 1970, according to the nonpartisan Congressional 
Research Service. Archer said reducing capital gains tax rates 
would help keep economic good times rolling and allow more people 
to enjoy the fruits of their investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Capital gains are no longer just for Wall Street brokers and  
high rollers,'' said Archer. ``Today, a stake in America's private 
sector often pays for college or a more secure retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would slash individual capital gains taxes on most  
investments held longer than one year from 20 percent to 15 
percent, effective retroactively to July 1, 1999. For people who 
pay income taxes in the 15 percent bracket, those same investments 
now taxed at 10 percent would drop to 7.5 percent, also retroactive 
to July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Cost of the cuts over 10 years is unofficially estimated at $50  
billion. They will be part of an $850 billion, 10-year tax package 
expected to emerge from the Ways and Means Committee next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the bill also is likely to include  
broad-based cuts in income taxes, relief from the ``marriage 
penalty'' paid by millions of two-income couples and breaks for 
health care, education and cuts in inheritance taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutting capital gains taxes is a priority for pro-growth GOP  
conservatives but is opposed by many Democrats, who contend the 
cuts primarily benefit the wealthy. President Clinton has said that 
any tax cuts using budget surplus money must wait until Social 
Security and Medicare are safeguarded for the future -- and then, 
such cuts must be targeted to the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Tuesday with CNBC, Clinton said he would prefer  
using some of the annual budget surpluses to reduce the federal 
government's $5.5 trillion debt, and still provide a ``sizable tax 
cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we take this country out of debt for the first time since  
1835, then average people are going to have more money in their 
pockets than if we keep the country in debt and give them a tax cut 
now because we got an election in a year and a half,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the capital gains cut were to become law, it would mark the  
second major reduction since 1997, when top long-term rates dropped 
from 28 percent to 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released last week by Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a research  
firm based in Lexington, Mass., said the 1997 cut reduced the net 
cost of capital for new investment by 3 percent and will push 
average U.S. household income $309 higher each year over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans are slowly trickling out the parts of their  
big tax relief measure this week, hoping to keep public attention 
on the issue while Congress is scattered for the Independence Day 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said Tuesday the bill would add a new personal exemption  
-- similar to existing exemptions for dependent children -- for 
people who provide long-term care to elderly relatives at home. The 
exemption this year would be $2,750, but the figure changes 
annually based on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the measure would allow people to deduct from their  
income taxes the cost of long-term health care insurance premiums. 
The deduction would be phased in over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also would allow employers to include long-term  
care insurance in ``cafeteria'' benefits plans. That would allow 
employees to put pretax earnings toward the purchase of such 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed this year a $1,000 tax credit for long-term  
care, but it would be phased out for married couples with adjusted 
gross incomes above $110,000 and $75,000 for singles. The GOP plan 
contains no such income limits. 
</P>
<P>
	John Rother, public policy director for AARP, formerly the  
American Association of Retired Persons, called the GOP proposal 
``exciting'' but said the nation's largest organization of older 
adults needs time to determine if the plan reaches the lower- and 
middle-income people who are most in need. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had any time to figure out if there's any losers in  
this changeover, or if it's just a better deal for everyone,'' 
Rother said. ``There's relatively limited dollars here, and we want 
to see those dollars go to people who are not able to afford other 
options.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Focuses on American Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- President Clinton turned the attention  
of his national poverty tour today to arguably the poorest, most 
forgotten U.S. citizens of them all: American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was going to the Pine Ridge Reservation for a visit with  
the Oglala Sioux nation and to participate in a conference on 
Native American homeownership and economic development. He also was 
touring a housing facility and signing a pact with Oglala leaders 
establishing an empowerment zone for Pine Ridge.

	But the main purpose of the visit -- the first to a reservation  
by a president since Franklin Roosevelt -- was simply to pay 
attention to American Indians, who are so raked by grinding poverty 
that Clinton's own advisers suggested he come up with special 
proposals geared specifically to the Indians' plight. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pine Ridge, a scrolling marquee at Big Bat's Texaco expressed  
both joy over Clinton's visit and wariness of all the official 
attention: ``Welcome President Clinton. Remember Our Treaties,'' 
the sign read. 
</P>
<P>
	According to statistics from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of  
Indian Affairs, there are 1.43 million Indians living on or near 
reservations. Roughly 33 percent of them are children younger than 
15, and 38 percent of Indian children aged 6 to 11 live in poverty, 
compared with 18 percent for U.S. children of all other races 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from that, only 63 percent of Indians are high school  
graduates. Twenty-nine percent are homeless, and 59 percent live in 
substandard housing. Twenty percent of Indian households on 
reservations do not have full access to plumbing, and the majority 
-- 53.4 percent -- do not have telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	The per capita income for Indians is $21,619, one-third less  
than the national per capita income of $35,225. An estimated 50 
percent of American Indians are unemployed, and at Pine Ridge the 
problem is even more chronic -- 73 percent of the people do not have 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who visited the reservation last  
August, said Pine Ridge is a metaphor for the poverty tour, for it 
sits in Shannon County, the poorest census tract in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is generations of poverty on the Pine Ridge reservation,  
with very, very little progress,'' Cuomo said. ``We didn't get into 
this situation in a couple of weeks and we're not going to get out 
of it in a couple of weeks. It's going to take years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To begin addressing the housing problem, Clinton was announcing  
a partnership between the Treasury Department, the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, tribal governments and mortgage 
companies to help 1,000 Indians become homeowners over the next 
three years -- a small number that nonetheless would double the 
number of government-insured home mortgages issued on tribal lands. 
Under the effort, ``one-stop mortgage centers'' would be opened at 
Pine Ridge and on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona to help 
streamline the mortgage lending process. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo said special steps were needed to help Indians create and  
own houses because the nature of the land on which they live 
effectively shuts them out of conventional home loan processes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The land is held in trust. The bank doesn't want to take it as  
collateral because it's in trust,'' Cuomo said. ``So the main asset 
on the reservation -- the land -- can't even be used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, two of the country's largest municipal securities  
underwriters, Banc One Capital Markets and George K. Baum &AMP; Co., 
were committing to underwriting $300 million in bonds annually for 
five years to create a market for reservation mortgages. Those 
bonds would help raise $1.5 billion that could then be lent to 
tribes, tribal housing authorities and individuals for buying 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was part of Clinton's four-day, cross-country  
tour to highlight the ``untapped markets'' in America's inner 
cities and rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Northeast Sizzles in Heat Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Temperatures climbed to 100 steamy degrees in the East for the  
third day in a row Tuesday, triggering blackouts and making for an 
unpleasant return to work for people who spent the holiday weekend 
in shorts and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight deaths have been blamed on the heat in the  
Midwest and East. The heat also stalled commuter trains and subways 
in New York and forced summer schools to send children home early. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like somebody's thrown buckets of hot water in your  
face,'' griped Pat Renaghan, running a stuffy elevator to a deep 
subway station in New York City. ``Sometimes when you take the 
elevator down, the air feels so thick, you feel like you could chew 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	High temperature records started falling before the sun even  
reached its peak, as Atlantic City, N.J., hit 98 before noon, with 
humidity of about 40 percent. The mercury hit record highs of 100 
at Newark, N.J., and Harrisburg, Pa., and 101 in New York City and 
at Washington's Reagan National Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the East, relief was expected sometime Tuesday night,  
with New Yorkers looking forward to highs in the 80s the rest of 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat worsened the return to the office after the long Fourth  
of July weekend of bathing suits and bare feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard,'' George Matthew, a Philadelphia lawyer, said as  
sweat poured down his cheeks after he ran outside to feed a parking 
meter. ``I'd rather be at home in shorts and a T-shirt under the 
air conditioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Foster wasn't burdened with a suit and tie but was stuck  
wielding a king-size blowtorch, sealing waterproofing materials for 
street repairs at New York's Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to come in, but the bills don't stop just  
because it's hot,'' Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia school officials sent hundreds of summer-school  
students home early because many buildings had no air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Hearn checked himself into a Philadelphia hospital early  
Tuesday. He almost passed out in the heat Monday while painting a 
house in Cherry Hill, N.J., and then spent a nearly sleepless 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just felt like the end of the world,'' Hearn said. ``I want  
to get a nice job inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered blackouts developed as utilities were strained by air  
conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
	About 55,000 customers of GPU Inc., one of New Jersey's three  
major electric utilities, lost power Tuesday. In New York, the Long 
Island Power Authority said outages had affected at least 50,000 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Maryland utility Conectiv started a series of rolling  
blackouts -- shutting off 20,000 customers at a time for about 20 
minutes -- on the Eastern Shore because one of its generators 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat damaged overhead electrical wires for commuter trains  
in Connecticut, and 41 of the 58 morning trains from New Haven into 
New York City were late, said Metro North spokeswoman Marjorie 
Anders. 
</P>
<P>
	Subways on Manhattan's Upper West Side were shut down during the  
afternoon because of heat-related power dips, sending hundreds of 
people looking for cabs and buses. Several lanes on Manhattan's 
Queensboro Bridge over the East River closed for eight hours during 
the night because of heat-warped decking, and highways buckled 
elsewhere in the East. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, not everyone was complaining.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is my kind of weather. With heat, at least you don't have  
to shovel,'' said boat salesman James Pieklo at Somers Point, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Report: Cavaliers To Hire Wittman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Randy Wittman  
reportedly will be the new coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs, who have been looking for a head coach since Mike  
Fratello was fired June 1, scheduled a 4 p.m. EDT news conference 
to introduce their coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman and his family arrived at Cleveland Hopkins  
International Airport about noon. As television camera crews and 
reporters waited at the flight gate, Wittman exited from a side 
door and was whisked by van to a waiting limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Akron Beacon Journal reported in today's editions that  
Wittman told Orlando head coach Doc Rivers, a former NBA teammate 
and longtime friend, that he had accepted the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really excited,'' Rivers said. ``He thinks it's a perfect  
situation for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Plain Dealer and several Twin Cities and Cleveland  
television stations, citing unnamed sources, also reported Wittman 
would be the new Cavs coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman does not have a listed phone number in the Twin Cities  
area. The Cavaliers would not confirm Wittman's hiring officially 
and Timberwolves spokesman Kent Wipf also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman, 39, is well regarded in NBA coaching circles, and in  
his five years with the Timberwolves gained a reputation as one of 
the league's brightest assistants. He also has been an assistant 
with the Indiana Pacers and Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	A nine-year NBA veteran, Wittman was a first-round draft pick of  
the Washington Bullets in 1983 but was traded to the Atlanta Hawks 
before the 1983-84 season. He finished his career averaging 7.4 
points per game following playing stints in Atlanta, Sacramento and 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to playing for Indiana's 1981 NCAA title team,  
Wittman was a two-time academic All-American with the Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland hasn't made it past the first round of the playoffs  
since 1993 and has seen average attendance sag from 18,011 in 
1994-95 to 14,120 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman first met with Cavs general manager Jim Paxson on June  
16 and was back in Cleveland 10 days later to have dinner with 
Paxson. He emerged as the frontrunner over the holiday weekend 
after meeting with Gordon Gund at the owner's offices in Princeton, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs were secretive about their coaching search after  
Fratello was fired. Four coaches were known to have been 
interviewed: Wittman, Dave Cowens, Del Harris and John MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman is the only one of the group who has no NBA head  
coaching experience.

<HEADLINE> Former Cop Finds No Pressure in Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Playing in a golf tournament, even  
one as prestigious as the U.S. Senior Open, is no pressure for Ron 
Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure is looking into the barrel of a gun held by an angry  
man who wants to kill you. Pressure is leveling a shotgun at a 
suspect, pulling the trigger and killing him. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the kind of pressure Ferguson faced before retiring from  
the Orlando, Fla., police force to become a professional golfer. 
After that, facing a 10-foot birdie putt to win a tournament hardly 
rates any perspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I came here, three of my good cop buddies, they were as  
excited as I am,'' said Ferguson, one of the 156 golfers starting 
play in the Senior Open Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of them wrote me a little note and said that he was proud  
of me for being here and that no matter how tough the stress and 
the pressure got, that I have already been through more stress and 
pressure than everybody else put together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 25-year career as a police officer brought enough stress to  
fill a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, three years after joining the force, Ferguson was  
pistol whipped and shot twice with his own gun -- in the side and in 
the chest -- by a man he was trying to arrest for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson said bullet wounds in the side didn't hurt. Not so with  
a slug he took in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am down and he is up over me and he has got the gun pointed  
and I rolled out of the way and the bullet hit me in the chest and 
that one did hurt,'' he said. ``It was very loud and I could feel 
the percussion from the gun shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``And he kept clicking. The gun was out of bullets. He kept  
clicking. I got up and he hit me in the head with the gun a few 
more times. And then I ran to an apartment complex and he ran the 
other way. He got in my car and took off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The man later was apprehended, convicted of murder and executed.  
Ferguson, coughing up blood and his head battered, was hospitalized 
for a week-and-a-half and spent another week-and-a-half 
recuperating at home before returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, Ferguson was on the other end of a shooting.  
He and a partner were staking out a gas station that an informant 
had told them would be robbed. After the stickup, the bandit was 
fleeing the scene and pulling up the mask he had been wearing when 
Ferguson's partner yelled, ``Halt, police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the man turned and pointed his gun at the other officer,  
Ferguson fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I shot him with a shotgun, hit him with nine pellets in the  
chest,'' he said. ``I could see the look on his face with the mask 
pulled like that. I could hear the air coming out of his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	``So he dropped and he was dead right there.''  
</P>
<P>
	After being applauded by his back-slapping fellow officers,  
Ferguson soon found that shooting someone was much harder than 
being shot. He got sick to his stomach and couldn't eat. If he 
tried to eat, he'd throw up. A 6-foot-1, 190-pounder now, his 
weight dropped to between 135 and 140 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ended up going to the hospital, contemplated suicide and  
finally survived. I pulled out of it,'' Ferguson said. ``I could 
still picture that in my mind, me shooting him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson, 51, who had been a successful amateur golfer in  
Florida, turned pro in October 1996 after retiring from the police 
force that summer. He has made $30,000 so far, which is about what 
he has paid in traveling expenses and entry fees. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter. He's living out a dream, and no one is shooting at  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been treated so well in all my life,'' Ferguson  
said. ``I have a Cadillac waiting for me at the airport. I've got a 
locker right next to Raymond Floyd and Bruce Fleisher and four 
dozen Titleists. Guys are asking for my autograph, kids, women. It 
is a thrill.''

<HEADLINE> Western Union Returns To Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- The yellow sign still hangs outside Havana's old  
Western Union office, closed after the United States imposed trade 
sanctions against communist Cuba at the height of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	But under President Clinton's moves to increase contacts between  
people in the United States and Cuba, Western Union is authorized 
to begin sending wire transfers to the island on Thursday, making 
it easier, safer and cheaper for people to send money to their 
loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The wire transfer company previously had been permitted to  
handle cash transfers only for emergency expenses or emigration 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban government holding company Cimex, which will run the  
Western Union operation on the island, in recent months has been 
busy building new Western Union outlets in gas stations and 
supermarkets. One will be located in the year-old Carlos III 
shopping mall, the largest modern commercial center in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	Cimex officials approached about the new service declined to  
comment, nor would they provide media access to the new Western 
Union offices. 
</P>
<P>
	But one passer-by, who declined to give his name, said Cubans  
were excited about the move. ``If this method is direct, I believe 
it will be much easier for us Cubans who receive money from our 
families in the United States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For years Cuban immigrants in the United States have relied on a  
network of agencies with links to businesses in Cuba to get money 
to friends and relatives on the island. Since the collapse of the 
Soviet Union in 1991 sent Cuba into a severe economic crisis, 
Cubans have increasingly depended on cash remittances from 
relatives in the United States just to get by. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Cuban American National Foundation, a prominent exile  
lobby group that opposes U.S. government moves toward detente with 
President Fidel Castro's government, has come out in favor of the 
resumption of Western Union service. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, rules under the U.S. embargo against Cuba  
allowed only family members of Cubans on the island to send up to 
$300 in cash remittances every three months. But under new rules, 
anyone in the United States now can send that amount, as long as 
the money does not go to senior Cuban government or communist party 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Union will charge $29 for sending between $200 and $300  
in cash. Agencies now offering the service to Cuba set their own 
prices.

<HEADLINE> Networks Near Low-Water Marks / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC set an all-time ratings low in prime-time,  
while competitors managed to avert dubious records during a holiday 
week when television viewers appeared to get their fireworks 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS won the week's Nielsen Media Research crown with a 6.1  
rating and 13 share, even though it tied for the second-lowest 
weekly rating the network has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's 5.5 rating and 11 share was the network's lowest weekly  
rating ever, but was good enough for second place last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsmagazines, led by ABC's ``20/20'' last Wednesday, accounted  
for nine of the week's 20 top-rated shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The low network ratings were inevitable, said David Poltrack,  
CBS's top researcher. Networks concentrate their best material 
during the TV season that ends in May, and try to drum up more 
viewer interest as the new fall season approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can pretty well predict that the July Fourth weekend will  
be the lowest point every year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC had a 5.3 rating and 11 share for the week, Fox was at 3.8  
and 11, the WB had a 2.1 and 4, UPN was at 1.4 and 3 and Pax TV had 
a 0.7 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
6.9 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 6.7 
rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 6.0 and 
14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of June 28-July 4, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC; ``ABC Monday Night 
Movie: The Stranger Beside Me,'' ABC, 8.6; ``60 Minutes II,'' CBS, 
8.5; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 8.3; Everybody Loves Raymond,'' 
CBS, 8.3; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 8.2; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 8.2; 
``Becker,'' CBS, 7.8; ``20/20-Monday,'' ABC, 7.7; ``60 Minutes,'' 
CBS, 7.7; ``Friends,'' NBC, 7.7.

<HEADLINE> Cell-Phone Charges Start With 'Send' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For those who thought a telephone call starts  
with ``hello,'' here's a wireless wake-up call that starts with 
``send.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cell phone users are not only charged for talking, but for  
ringing. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, most of the nation's big wireless calling  
companies time their customers from the moment they press the 
``send'' button on a mobile phone to the moment they hit ``end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since most companies charge for a full minute even when less  
than a minute is used, those seconds when the phone is ringing can 
really add up -- especially if a person pays extra for peak-hour 
usage, long-distance or calls made far away from home that trigger 
``roaming'' charges of 60 cents or more a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	There's generally no fee levied for unanswered calls or busy  
signals. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``send-to-end'' billing policies are spelled out in the  
contracts signed by today's 76 million cell phone users, even some 
experts and careful shoppers never imagined that the basic rules of 
telephone calls might not ring true in the wireless world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea, and I would consider myself as astute on my  
telephone charges as anybody,'' said Rex G. Mitchell, a 
telecommunications industry analyst with Banc of America Securities 
in San Francisco and a former executive with the regional phone 
company U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	``Occasionally, when I'm out of town, I will make a call and  
look at the second hand on my watch to keep it under a minute 
because I'm paying long-distance or roaming charges,'' said 
Mitchell. ``But I've been timing it from `hello' instead of from 
`send.' I won't make that mistake now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of first-minute billing policies caught the public eye  
in recent weeks after Cellular One tried to reduce the free 
``ringing time'' it gives its New England customers to 15 seconds 
from 30. The carrier was bombarded by customer complaints, and 
quickly scrapped the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the million or more people signing up for wireless  
service each month focus less on when the call begins and more on 
how many minutes are included in their monthly calling plan or the 
fees for long-distance and peak-hour calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's rationale in treating mobile phones differently  
from regular phones is that every wireless call uses the airwaves 
regardless of whether the call is successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, regular calls also use resources such as space on a  
fiber-optic cable. But the companies argue that they have far 
greater capacity in their cables than their wireless channels, and 
that the demands of carrying a regular phone signal are negligible 
compared with a wireless signal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're occupying a channel. So when you make a connection, you  
get charged from the inception of when you seize that channel,'' 
explained Jeff Battcher, a BellSouth spokesman. ``For the most 
part, it's always been that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the major companies that start the meter running from  
``send,'' not ``hello,'' are AT&AMP;T Wireless, AirTouch, Sprint PCS, 
Bell Atlantic Mobile, BellSouth Mobility and Nextel Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, since many calling plans come with hundreds of  
minutes to burn each month, a lot of mobile phone users rarely 
reach their limit and don't need to pay additional charges for 
calls that don't go through. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Litwinski, 26, an independent film maker from New York,  
pays $100 a month for a Sprint PCS plan with 1,000 minutes of air 
time so he won't have to worry about how long he talks or how many 
calls he makes. ``I never go over,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for those who frequently exceed their monthly allowance or  
sign up for cheaper plans with smaller time allotments, those 
first-minute charges can be substantial since the average user 
racks up 100 minutes a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Adkins, spokeswoman for the Council of Better Business  
Bureaus and a Cellular One customer, was also surprised to hear 
about ``send-to-end'' charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't tell you these things. I read my bill. I read all  
the flyers. It goes to show, you really have to read your 
contract.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes, Keyes Address GOP Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Republican presidential candidates Steve  
Forbes and Alan Keyes told party activists Wednesday night the GOP 
must present a substantive message to voters to have any hope of 
winning the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	They made their remarks at a private dinner kicking off the  
Republican National Committee's summer meeting here. It was a tough 
crowd: Many of the delegates have already come out in support of 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Party activist Charles P. Sexton's response was typical:  
``Excellent Republican message. Nobody's swayed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dinner was closed to reporters, but in an interview Forbes  
said he reminded RNC members that the last Republican convention in 
Philadelphia, in 1948, featured Thomas Dewey as the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``They nominated somebody who didn't have a substantive message  
and lost in an upset to a man named Harry Truman,'' Forbes said. 
``I told them that when we have a substantive message, we win, and 
when we don't, we lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And how was his message received?  
</P>
<P>
	``Very politely and cordially,'' Forbes said. ``I'm not sure  
everyone would agree, but that's what a campaign is for -- to have a 
vigorous and honest debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes talked of a moral crisis in America, made worse by eight  
years of the Clinton administration. But he reserved his harshest 
words for Bush, who raised a record $36 million in the first six 
months of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Keyes called the Texas governor ``the virtual  
reality candidate'' and a ``fabrication of the money bosses and the 
media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's millions ``can't buy a single heart, can't change a  
single mind, won't move a single conscience,'' Keyes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that each of the dollars he gets is a shackle tying  
him to the interests of the monied establishment of this country 
that has shown a willingness to sell out our conscience and even to 
betray our national security. I think it's very suspect,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, whose personal wealth makes him the only candidate able  
to match Bush dollar for dollar, said ``nine out of 10'' Americans 
aren't yet paying attention to the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they do, we're going to be there,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans from across the country will meet here through  
Saturday to plot strategy for next year's elections. It's their 
first trip to Philadelphia since they chose the city to host their 
2000 national convention.

<HEADLINE> Gay Reporter on Trial in Sex Sting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY NOAH ISACKSON   	
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- A gay journalist says he was simply doing  
research for a story on homosexual teens when he showed up at a 
park to see a 13-year-old boy he met on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Mirken, 42, went on trial Tuesday, accused of arranging  
for sex with a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested a year ago in a Sacramento park where he went to  
meet a gay boy he had conversed with online. Instead he was met by 
an undercover police officer in a sting operation that tracked 
Mirken's e-mail and phone conversations with ``Anthony,'' a 
fictitious boy used to dupe Mirken. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirken could get up to four years in prison if convicted of  
attempting to commit a lewd and lascivious act on a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities started investigating Mirken after he answered an  
electronic message posted in a chat room by ``Anthony,'' who said 
he was looking for an adult friend because his last one moved away. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirken, whose stories about gay and lesbian culture have  
appeared in newspapers and magazines including the San Francisco 
Examiner, Miami Herald, Detroit Free Press, Men's Health and Out, 
contends he corresponded with the boy in hopes of writing an 
investigative story about troubled gay youth, not to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to testify,'' said Mirken, who took notes in a  
spiral notebook throughout Tuesday's opening arguments. ``The 
prosecution's evidence is made up of out-of-context statements and 
half-truths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First Amendment advocates fear the case may hurt reporters'  
efforts to gather information. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not all that uncommon for a journalist who is dealing  
with the fringes of society to ignore or play along with the 
source,'' said Terry Francke, general counsel for the California 
First Amendment Coalition. ``The whole point is to get the 
information that the journalist is looking for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors told the jury that recorded conversations and e-mail  
records between Mirken -- who used the screen name ``Luvboys343'' -- 
and the boy were sexually charged and filled with flirtatious 
questions such as, ``Do you skinny-dip?'' and ``Does your mother 
come home during lunch?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense argued that the boy introduced himself to Mirken as  
lonely and that the questions were not sexual in their proper 
context. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have are innocent statements by Mr. Mirken and a  
series of sexual responses by the police officer,'' said his 
attorney, Bruce Nickerson. ``What interested Mr. Mirken were 
statements by the boy that sounded like he may be in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Perry Sims said Mirken clearly indicated his sexual  
intentions by arranging to meet the boy in a park nearly 90 miles 
from his home and leaving his notebook and expired press pass in 
his car when he got there. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims said Mirken was arrested carrying $96, the amount the  
undercover officer had said it would cost for them to get a hotel 
room.

<HEADLINE> El Guerrouj Sets Mile Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Hicham El Guerrouj smashed the world record in the  
mile with a time of 3 minutes, 43.13 seconds at the Golden Gala 
meet Wednesday, fighting off Kenya's Noah Ngeny, who also beat the 
old mark. 
</P>
<P>
	In becoming the first Moroccan to hold one of track and field's  
most hallowed records, El Guerrouj shaved 1.26 seconds off the mark 
of 3:44.39 set by Noureddine Morceli of Algeria on Sept. 5, 1993, 
at Rieti, Italy. Ngeny was timed in 3:43.40. 
</P>
<P>
	This was only the third time in 18 years the record was broken.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight year that El Guerrouj set a world  
record at the Golden Gala meet, and each time he erased a mark held 
by Morceli. Last year, he cracked the 1,500-meter record with 
3:26.00. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rome is a magic track for me,'' El Guerrouj said. ``I can't  
compare this year with last year. It's another El Guerrouj. I was 
more concentrated, but the public was the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans supported El Guerrouj, shouting and applauding noisily  
as he rushed to the record. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj ran a victory lap, waving a Moroccan flag to the  
cheering fans. He dedicated the race to his family and to King 
Hassan of Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to bring some happiness to my family, as my uncle  
died recently,'' he said. ``I hope God continues to give me 
strength because I want to be the strongest in the world at all 
distances between 1,500 and 5,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Britain's Sebastian Coe reduced the record to 3:47.33 in  
1981, the mark stood until 1985, when another Briton, Steve Cram, 
lowered it to 3:46.32. Cram's time held for eight years until 
Morceli clipped nearly two seconds off it. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj, 24, has been almost unbeatable the past four years.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he won 12 of 13 races at a mile or 1,500 meters, losing  
only in the Olympic 1,500 final when he fell just before the bell 
lap and Morceli went on to win the gold medal. Later that season, 
he ended Morceli's four-year winning streak at 1,500 meters, 
winning the IAAF Grand Prix final. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj won 14 of 15 races in 1997, losing only at one mile  
in the Grand Prix final. Last year, he won all 12 races, including 
one at 2,000 meters, and just missed world records at the mile with 
3:44.60 and 2,000 meters with 4:48.36. He is undefeated this year.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Shifts USS Carriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk, which  
rushed to the Persian Gulf in April to fill a gap created by the 
Kosovo crisis, will return to its normal duty station in the 
Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Bacon, chief spokesman for Defense Secretary William  
Cohen, said the Kitty Hawk will be able to leave the Gulf because 
Cohen has ordered the carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt to take its 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roosevelt is due to arrive in the Gulf by this weekend. It  
has been in the Mediterranean since April as part of the NATO force 
that bombed Yugoslavia for 11 weeks. The Roosevelt and its battle 
group originally were assigned to the Gulf but were diverted when 
the NATO air war broke out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kitty Hawk will be back in Asia within a few weeks,  
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Posts Profit Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A sharp increase in visitors to its leading  
network of Web sites helped Yahoo! Inc. report second-quarter 
profits and revenues that easily beat Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the cost of buying Internet companies such as  
GeoCities, Yahoo! said Wednesday it earned $28.3 million, or 11 
cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30. That was up from a 
profit of $1.5 million, or 1 cent a share, in the second quarter of 
1998, also excluding one-time charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues soared 156 percent to $115.2 million from $45 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The results easily beat the 8-cents-a-share profit and $103  
million revenue forecast by Wall Street analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the expense of acquisitions, the Santa Clara,  
Calif.-based Yahoo! lost $15 million, up slightly from the $14.3 
million it lost in the same period the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were pleasantly surprised,'' said Tim Koogle, company chief  
executive officer. His explanation was simple: ``We've got a big 
audience and they're consuming a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo's earnings reflected exponential growth at the company.  
Excluding one-time charges, net income for the first six months of 
1999 was $48.2 million, or 18 cents a share, up from $1 million, or 
zero cents a share, for the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, more than 80 million people visited the Yahoo! network  
of Web sites. Combined traffic on Yahoo!'s network increased to an 
average of 310 million page views per day, up from 235 million in 
March 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, whose network of sites is the most frequently visited,  
features everything from chat rooms to news and search services.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Court Monitors TV Judge Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Supreme Court is  
scrutinizing the amount of time that TV's Judge Joe B. Brown spends 
on his real-life bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice E. Riley Anderson is trying to determine whether  
Brown received permission from the state's high court for all the 
days he has taken off to tape ``Judge Joe Brown'' in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson allowed a retired judge to sit in for Brown on six days  
this winter. But records show the retired judge sat in 14 
additional days. Brown said he thought Anderson's approval also 
applied to those absences. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also said the show isn't causing him to fall behind  
because he has streamlined his court in Memphis and convened on 
weekends and evenings. Besides, he said, it's good for business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The show helps me be a better judge on the state level,'' he  
said. ``People can get stagnant in their work. I'm hooked up with a 
lot of judges in Los Angeles. We talk about what kinds of problems 
we have and how we can address these problems.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up in Quiet Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against major currencies  
Wednesday, but trading was subdued as dealers were wary of market 
intervention by the Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's central bank stepped into currency markets earlier this  
week to push down the value of the yen, which had risen on a report 
showing increasing confidence among business leaders. The Bank of 
Japan fears that an overly strong yen could jeopardize Japan's 
economic recovery by making exports more expensive abroad and 
threatening the earnings of major exporting companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading against the euro was quieter, with the dollar holding  
steady against the currency a day after the euro touched another 
low against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 122.23  
Japanese yen, up slightly from 122.02. The euro was quoted at 
$1.0226, unchanged from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5693 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5668, and 1.4700 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4703. The British 
pound fell to $1.5603 from $1.5618. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Since Wednesday's dollar-euro rate was unchanged from Tuesday, so 
were the dollar equivalents against the European currencies under 
the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9128  
German marks, 6.4144 French francs, and 1,893.94 Italian lire, all 
unchanged from Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Price of Racing Popularity High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	These days, when fans talk about ``trading paint,'' they might  
not be discussing the bumping and banging that for so long defined 
stock car racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it's the business side that keeps those paint shops  
busy -- and fans in need of more than just a program. A copy of 
Consumer Reports might help, too. 
</P>
<P>
	One year, Sterling Marlin is driving the Kodak car; the next, it  
belongs to Bobby Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Need to sell a new die-cast model? Change the paint scheme.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, one of the senior sponsors in the sport, Skoal, is dropping  
out. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ricky Rudd has lost his nine-year ride with Tide to a team  
yet to run a NASCAR race. 
</P>
<P>
	For at least the last decade, hardly a driver can finish a  
sentence without mentioning the sponsors of these rolling 
billboards masquerading as Chevrolets, Fords and Pontiacs. Some in 
the sport believe the slick, 1990s version of NASCAR has been 
created at a price. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're an old-style racing fan, today's racing is boring,''  
said Kyle Petty, son of Richard Petty, the man who more than three 
decades ago put the first real face on the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But things have changed dramatically since he was in the prime  
of a career that produced a record 200 victories. Drivers who once 
did nothing but race are now also pitchmen seemingly more 
interested in protecting lucrative Winston Cup points positions 
than in taking chances on winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Petty decries what he perceives to be a lost adventure.  
</P>
<P>
	He pines for the purity of a true one-on-one showdown -- not the  
kind that now frequently span only the final few laps of a race. He 
remembers his father running door-to-door for lap upon lap with 
Bobby Allison, Cale Yarborough, Buddy Baker and others who 
dominated the sport in a simpler time. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, nobody could have imagined their races filling a  
prime-time slot on network TV. But last Saturday night, the Pepsi 
400 -- remember when they called it the Firecracker 400? -- was 
televised on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	And none other than Baker was part of this show, providing  
analysis for a sport he still loves, even though it barely seems 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as changing things, I don't see any problem with the  
sport,'' Baker said. ``It's growing every day. The sport is 
healthy, and I think NASCAR does a great job of making sure the 
competition is all on a level playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd might disagree.  
</P>
<P>
	A single-car owner in an era of multicar teams, he has slogged  
along over the last five years, unable to generate the money to 
field a second car. One-car teams are a dinosaur of the high banks, 
where every race this year has been won by a driver from a multicar 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	With a second car, Rudd would have more manpower, more time and  
ways to test, and a better chance to be competitive. He lost his 
sponsor at a time when he seeks to extend one of Winston Cup's 
hallowed records. He has at least one victory in each of the last 
16 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll surely find a sponsor for next year, but the loss of Tide  
definitely set back his plans to find a partner. It also offered 
him a jolting reminder that the old days are certainly gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd longs for the era when pioneer owners like Bud Moore and  
Junie Donlavey would have cars in the field every week. There was 
then an unmistakable flavor to a sport many feel is slowly being 
homogenized. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who hit the beach in the first wave on D-Day, is gone,  
unable to attract a sponsor despite 63 wins. The familiar No. 90 
car of Donlavey, also a victim of poor sponsorship, is all but 
invisible in his 50th year in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``As this becomes the trendy thing to be a part of, some of the  
negative fallout is nobody really pays attention'' to the 
old-timers and their brand of racing, Rudd said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like, `Hey, the 90 car isn't here this week.' But he's  
been here for every race for the last how many thousands of races 
when they needed cars in the field,'' said Rudd, who drove for 
Donlavey 20 years ago, and later for Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Petty fears the day will come when there will be no fans  
who remember what stock car racing once was. 
</P>
<P>
	``People talk about how much the sport has changed in the last  
seven, eight years,'' he said. ``There are more sponsors, more TV, 
more fans. At the same time, racing on the racetrack is changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is it for the better?  
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways it might be,'' he said. ``But I don't think  
boring is for the better.''

<HEADLINE> Special Olympian Claims Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- A Special Olympics athlete from  
Reunion, an the island off southern Africa, has accused a 
13-year-old teammate of sexually assaulting her. 
</P>
<P>
	The assault was said to have occurred Thursday at Morrison  
Dormitory at North Carolina-Chapel Hill, according to the Orange 
County district attorney's office and UNC police. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes' coach took them to the UNC Hospitals emergency  
room, then notified police, according to a police report. 
</P>
<P>
	The case will be decided in Reunion, according to authorities.  
</P>
<P>
	Police and the DA's office declined to investigate further  
because, among other things, evidence from a hospital ``rape kit'' 
examination could take months to process, long past the time 
athletes were due to return home. The Special Olympics World Summer 
Games ended Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The long wait for rape kit results would have meant keeping the  
alleged assailant in jail for a long period of time, said UNC 
Police Chief Derek Poarch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't even know if he had the mental capacity to understand  
that he was committing anything wrong,'' Poarch said. 
</P>
<P>
	DA Carl Fox said he would forward the physical evidence to  
Reunion officials if they requested it. 
</P>
<P>
	Special Olympics officials conducted an investigation and found  
discrepancies in the woman's story, said Joe Freddoso, the Games' 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some questions whether a sexual assault actually  
occurred,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fan Cast 40,000 Votes for Shortstop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Red Sox wanted fans to vote early and often  
for Nomar Garciaparra. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Nandor, of Carver, Mass., took the promotional campaign to  
heart and voted for the shortstop almost 40,000 times via the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, when I first heard he won, I wasn't sure, but I thought  
it could've been me,'' Nandor said Tuesday night. ``But I also 
thought it could've been other people in addition to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only major league baseball and its computer people detected the  
ballot box-stuffing and threw out Nandor's votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've outlined certain procedures that catch 99 percent of the  
potential problems out there,'' Alex Kam, major league baseball's 
director of new media, said Wednesday. ``It does happen quite 
frequently, (but) they filter it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra overtook New York Yankees' rival Derek Jeter in the  
final week of counting, winning 1,089,974 to 1,069,528. But 
baseball says hackers didn't influence the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Individuals voting on the Internet were limited to 22 votes --  
matching the average number of home games for teams during the 
voting period. 
</P>
<P>
	Kam says Nandor used a computer programming language to evade  
limits on how many times a person could vote on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 19, Nandor tried to vote 14,000 times, Kam said. And The  
Boston Globe reported Tuesday that Nandor cast 25,259 more votes 
for Garciaparra from June 25-27. The ballots also voted for Red Sox 
players Scott Hatteberg, John Valentin and Jose Offerman. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a matter of process, we look for certain type of activity  
that would be repetitive in nature,'' Kam said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nandor says when he heard Garciaparra had garnered enough votes  
to start, he suspected perhaps he had had something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
	What apparently did in Nandor was a certain amount of laziness.  
In his first attempt in May, Nandor used the same e-mail address. 
His last attempt, in June, he used the same phone number 
(111-222-3333) and ZIP code (11111). Nandor wrote that he set his 
computer to run repeatedly, then went to a barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in large part I did it just because the All-Star game  
was going to be in Fenway, so I felt Nomar deserved a start on his 
home turf, with the incredible season he's had,'' he said in an 
e-mail to the Globe. ``I still might have done it if the game had 
been in New York, but it makes me feel good to have this 
justification for my actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because Nandor didn't vary his basic bits of information, the  
systems administrators at CBS SportsLine, the Internet site which 
conducted the voting, caught on quickly, Kam said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Orwant, a doctoral candidate at MIT's Media Lab who  
inadvertently tipped off the Globe about his friend Nandor's 
program, remains unconvinced that the system can withstand a clever 
hacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they claim their system is foolproof, they're wrong,'' he  
said. ``I'll prove it to them next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kam says baseball will be ready.  
</P>
<P>
	``It makes us redouble our efforts,'' he said. ``There are a lot  
of enterprising people out there who might try to do this.''

<HEADLINE> Fernandez Recalls Senior Open Loss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vicente Fernandez recalls his  
narrow loss at last year's U.S. Senior Open not with a scowl but a 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's exactly how the television camera caught him at the  
Riviera Country Club near Los Angeles when Hale Irwin sank the 
12-foot birdie putt that gave him a one-stroke victory over 
Fernandez -- smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez was reminded of that moment Tuesday before starting a  
practice round for the 1999 Open beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, yes, I remember, because it was a very good day for me,''  
Fernandez said. ``I thought I did the best I could do and then it 
wasn't on me to win the tournament. It was on him to win or not to 
win. He did it in a magic way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both golfers enter this year's tournament with confidence, Irwin  
ranking fourth in winnings and Fernandez fifth. And Irwin is coming 
in on a tear. 
</P>
<P>
	He has won three of his last five senior tournaments and has  
shot par or better in 16 of 17 rounds in that stretch. In 12 of 
those rounds, he has scored in the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like my game is back where I want it to be,'' said  
Irwin, who struggled early this year after winning seven events in 
1998 and leading all of golf with nearly $2.9 million in prize 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, whether or not I continue playing as I have, it's  
anybody's guess,'' he said. ``But I feel good about my game right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He should. Since the first week of May, Irwin has won the  
Nationwide Championship, Boone Valley Classic and Senior Players 
Championship. He finished sixth at the Las Vegas Senior Classic, 
which Fernandez won. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin's only downer was a tie for 26th at the BellSouth Classic.  
But the next time out, he won the Senior Players Championship by 
seven strokes, closing with rounds of 64 and 65. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have played extremely well, there's no doubt about that,''  
Irwin said. ``I think it's in large part due to sort of a 
recommitment, of focus if you wish, to get myself more back in the 
frame of mind and the playing mode which I found myself in at this 
time last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Something else might be just as important, though. Just before  
he started winning again, Irwin changed the ball he used. He 
discarded the new style Titleist he had been using for the first 
part of the year in favor of the old style ball he had played last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin admitted there isn't much difference between the old  
Professional and new Professional. He just feels more comfortable 
with the old one. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old Professional was a ball which I knew how far I was  
going to hit it each time under what conditions,'' Irwin said. ``It 
was a very predictable ball that fit my game nicely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new Professional is a very good ball, too, but it goes a  
little bit farther. It has different flight characteristics and 
affected my game more than it might affect some other player's 
game. I was hitting it a little too far with some clubs and I 
couldn't find the right pattern. When I went back to this other 
one, it was just like it fell into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's just one problem. Titleist no longer makes the old  
Professional, so supplies are limited. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm squeaking through,'' Irwin said. ``I've got enough at home  
probably to last me another several months, and if Titleist can 
come up with a few others, that would be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez said he figured Irwin would come around eventually. He  
said those who thought Irwin would be in no position to repeat his 
Open title have been proven wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time they ask me about Hale being a little bit slow  
starting this year, I always said ... he was taking a rest,'' 
Fernandez said. ``I think he is ready again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez said he's ready, too, though his scores have slipped  
the last couple of weeks. Someone suggested he might be saving 
himself for the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope so,'' Fernandez said. ``I have been striking the ball  
the best ever the last four weeks, but I couldn't take full 
advantage of that. I never try to save anything, but maybe it was 
somebody up there in heaven that is saying, `Well, you have 
something waiting for you.'''

<HEADLINE> Anderson, Williams Miss Mini-camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Pro Bowl running back Jamal Anderson did the  
expected Wednesday and failed to show for first day of the Atlanta 
Falcons' three-day mini-camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Due to be paid $2.6 million this season in the final year of his  
contract, Anderson has made clear his desire for a restructured 
deal that would place him among the NFL's highest-paid players. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, offensive lineman Gene Williams and kicker Morten  
Andersen were the only players not present for the first official 
summer workout for the defending NFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Morten wasn't going to be here because I had given him  
an excuse, but those two guys have a contract, and I fully expect 
them to honor it and be here,'' coach Dan Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we haven't had a conversation. They understand  
what the situation is. I didn't write the rules the way the 
National Football League is now. I'm disappointed they aren't out 
here, you bet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves indicated Anderson and Williams will receive the maximum  
fine, $1,000 per day, that is allowed under the NFL collective 
bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a contract and they should live up to it,'' said  
Reeves, who allegedly spoke with New England during the April NFL 
draft about a possible trade involving Anderson. ``I'm disappointed 
they aren't here, and they will be fined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and his Oakland, Calif.-based agent, Jim Sims, already  
have turned down an offer from the Falcons, but dispute the team's 
description of a five-year deal worth $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims told the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer on Tuesday night that the  
Falcons have offered a signing bonus of just over $6 million, while 
he and Anderson are seeking $10 million. At least, Sims said, 
Anderson wants to be the highest-paid Falcon. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Chris Chandler signed a five-year, $25 million  
extension last season as he and Anderson were earning spots on the 
NFC Pro Bowl team. Anderson rushed 410 times for 1,846 yards -- tops 
in the NFC and second only to Denver's Terrell Davis in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who also ran for an NFC-high 14 touchdowns, crossed  
the 1,000-yard mark for the third straight season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that with his impending and imminent free-agent  
status, you take a lot of risk by putting a player on the field 
(who's earning) below what his market value is,'' Sims said. ``He 
would certainly take that risk if he steps on the field for the 
mini-camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons general manager Harold Richardson said he had responded  
to one of the two proposals he received from Sims on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're both trying to get the same thing done,'' Richardson  
said. ``Is it possible in these situations that you can both want 
to get something done and you can just flat disagree on the numbers 
(so much) that it doesn't get done? 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure. But we both want to get it done and we're pushing it  
that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said last month that he wants to remain a Falcon and  
prefers not to test the free agent market after the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Ray Buchanan said he hopes the issue will be settled  
as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jamal knows he's one of the thumping heartbeats on this  
football team, and we need him here,'' Buchanan said. ``But at the 
same time, he's got to think about himself and his situation with 
his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's deserving of a lot of money. He's played well for this  
football team. That's the way contract negotiations go. We can't 
really think about his situation as much as trying to get ourselves 
prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Bob Christian, however, was less diplomatic.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll keep that to myself,'' Christian said. ``It means I get  
more (practice time). I got to do the nickel stuff, which I like.''

<HEADLINE> Lott Holds Up Holbrooke Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott himself is  
among three senators now blocking the long-delayed nomination of 
Richard Holbrooke to be U.N. ambassador, congressional and 
administration officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are doing it secretly,  
said the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Sen. 
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, is the third, but he announced his 
``hold'' on the veteran diplomat's nomination late last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., and McConnell are using the delaying technique to  
apply pressure on the White House to nominate an Ohio law professor 
for a position on the Federal Election Commission, said the 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The professor, Bradley A. Smith of Capital University in  
Columbus, had been recommended by Republican Senate leaders for a 
Republican vacancy on the commission, which is evenly divided 
between Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, their recommendation likely would be accepted.  
But Common Cause and other public-interest groups have waged a 
campaign to persuade President Clinton not to make the nomination, 
saying Smith's writings demonstrate hostility to campaign-finance 
laws he would be sworn to uphold. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell is chairman of the Senate GOP committee that helps  
elect Republicans to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for neither Lott nor McConnell could be reached today  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said last week said that Holbrooke's nomination ``has some  
problems right now,'' and his spokesman, John Czwartacki, cited 
``irreconcilable holds'' on the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	However, until now, only the identity of Grassley had been known  
among those blocking the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	By Senate tradition, any senator can block a nomination, at  
least temporarily, by putting a ``hold'' on it, which can be 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, who has sought to overhaul that practice by requiring  
senators to announce such holds publicly, is blocking the 
nomination for a different reason. He contends that a government 
official who worked at the U.N. mission in New York was demoted and 
transferred to a lesser job in Washington in retaliation for her 
telling members of Congress about waste and inefficiency at the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has said that the official, Linda Shenwick,  
was reassigned because of unsatisfactory job performance, not 
because she was a whistle-blower. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Grassley, Jill Kozeny, said today that  
``nothing has changed'' and that the Grassley hold remains. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``holds'' are just the latest obstacles in the course of  
Holbrooke's more than yearlong effort to win confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of that delay was caused by the administration's own ethics  
background investigations into Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was approved last week by the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Met's John Franco Out 3-10 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets reliever John Franco will miss  
3-10 weeks with a partially torn tendon on the middle finger of his 
left hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco, 38, injured the finger in the ninth inning of a 16-0  
loss to the Braves last Friday night at Shea Stadium. He underwent 
an MRI on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no illusions of losing him for more than two weeks,''  
Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ``I think of our bullpen as a 
group and obviously, there's a big hole in our group right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 34 games this season, Franco was 0-2 with a 3.45 ERA and had  
converted on 19 of 20 save chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully it will be about four weeks,'' Franco said. ``The  
doctors have learned from having dealt with other pitchers. Right 
now, they're just trying to keep it (the finger) immobilized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franco, who has 416 career saves, was one of many Mets denied  
the chance to join catcher Mike Piazza at the All-Star game in 
Boston next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ironically, here we are talking about his injury and the  
All-Star selections,'' Valentine said. ``I feel he was as deserving 
as anyone on our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armando Benitez is expected to handle the full-time closer  
duties in Franco's absence. He has saved five games so far this 
season while striking out 49 in his last 27 innings.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Wins India Cable Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- American film companies won a court  
battle in India today when judicial officials blocked India's two 
largest cable television networks from illegally showing top 
Hollywood films, a domestic news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The production houses, including Twentieth Century Fox, Columbia  
Pictures, Time Warner Entertainment and Disney Enterprises, jointly 
petitioned the New Delhi High Court accusing Siti Cable and In 
Cable and their distributors of illegally copying and broadcasting 
their films. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies joining the lawsuit included Paramount Pictures,  
Metro-Goldwyn Mayer Studios, Tristar Pictures, Universal City 
Studios and Lucasfilm. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ordered Indian police to stop the cable networks from  
broadcasting the feature films without the permission of the 
American companies, Press Trust of India news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans said the Indian networks recently showed  
``Speed,'' ``The Mask of Zorro,'' ``Wag the Dog,'' ``As Good As it 
Gets'' and ``City of Angels'' without permission.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Co. to Acquire Snyder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Snyder Drug Stores Inc. is being sold to The  
Katz Group, which has drugstore chain holdings throughout Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the sale, which requires regulatory approval, were not  
disclosed. The sale is expected to close in early October. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder Drug, based in Minneapolis, operates 141 company-owned  
and independent drug stores in six states. Founded in 1928, Snyder 
is the largest retail drug store chain in the Twin Cities and 
employs 1,600 people in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Katz Group, based in Edmonton, Alberta, is one of Canada's  
leading drug store operators with annual revenue exceeding $547 
million. The company operates more than 300 units in five Canadian 
provinces under the Pharma Plus Drug Mart, Rexall Drug Store and 
The Medicine Shoppe Pharmacy banners. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder -- which has stores in Illionis, Iowa, Michigan,  
Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin -- will be Katz's first 
purchase of a U.S. drug store chain and will solidify Katz as one 
of the largest drug store chains in North America with expected 
annual revenues of more than $752 million. The stores will keep the 
Snyder name.

<HEADLINE> Parsons' Find Has Racing Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Benny Parsons never figured to discover a great talent when he  
went to Winter Heat, an off-season watering hole for thirsty NASCAR 
wannabes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, one December afternoon in the Arizona desert, he found  
Greg Biffle. Three years later, the driver from suburban Portland, 
Ore. -- a place hardly synonymous with big-time stock car racing -- 
is a big star in the Craftsman Truck series. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Saturday, in West Allis, Wis., Biffle won for the third  
time in his last eight races. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who was at Tucson could easily have seen the talent he  
has,'' Parsons said. ``My only advantage in telling people about it 
was that I had validity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parsons, now a NASCAR racing analyst for ABC and ESPN, won the  
Winston Cup championship in 1973 and posted 21 victories in 19 
seasons on stock car racing's most demanding circuit. So, when he 
mentioned Biffle to Jack Roush, the car owner gave him a listen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Benny Parsons, with his stock car wisdom, told me Greg Biffle  
was one of the best talents and showed the greatest potential in 
his 40 years of racing,'' said Roush, who also owns five cars -- 
including those of superstars Mark Martin and Jeff Burton -- on the 
Winston Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Parsons, who gave up driving a taxi cab in Detroit to race full  
time more than three decades ago, laughs now about the exchange 
with Roush. But, for Biffle's sake, he's happy his credentials gave 
him credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had been some fan, Jack would have dismissed it and gone  
down the road,'' Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Biffle is glad that didn't happen. The Parsons-Roush connection  
has allowed him to spend more time driving race trucks rather than 
fabricating race cars. 
</P>
<P>
	It also took him away from his pub in Vancouver, Wash. Carrying  
trays around the corner has given way to carrying speed in the 
corners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I owe everything I have to Benny Parsons and Jack Roush,''  
said Biffle, the truck series Rookie of the Year in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Roush never second-guessed himself for hiring the former  
short-track terror of the Northwest, who in 1996 won 27 of his 47 
races. But he certainly spent a lot of money fixing trucks Biffle 
kept breaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wrecked all together too much last year, which was a  
disappointment to me,'' Roush said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't alone. Biffle was concerned about more than the bills  
Roush was paying to remove all the dents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was in grave jeopardy of losing my job,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't, and by the end of the season Biffle was a force. He  
ran consistently among the top 10, leading in five of the final 
seven races. 
</P>
<P>
	But early on, he had no way of knowing there would be impressive  
final numbers of eight top-five finishes in 27 races, four poles 
and earnings of $359,782 that would stamp him as a star of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying my hardest to get good finishes, but I was being  
too aggressive at the wrong times,'' he said. ``I was making rookie 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the 29-year-old driver has learned to be more judicious on  
the track. 
</P>
<P>
	His aggressive style has not changed. But he realizes there are  
times when a pedal-to-the-metal approach just won't work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still take chances now, but only when I have a safety net,''  
he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The boss has noticed.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin and Burton, with a combined 38 Winston Cup victories,  
have conditioned Roush to expect nothing less than solid contention 
from his top drivers. It's no different with Biffle. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Roush adds ``maturity'' to words such as potential and  
ability in discussing Biffle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stays out of trouble, but still maintains great enthusiasm  
and skill,'' Roush said. ``He's developing judgment that has got 
him to the point that he's in position to win every week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To Randy Goss, crew chief for the Roush truck effort, Biffle is  
doing more than just driving well. Goss gets more feedback, the 
kind he says will help Biffle steadily improve. 
</P>
<P>
	The most important factor is the driver's input on chassis  
setups for their Fords, and adjustments needed to improve the 
vehicles during the races. The payoff has been a second-place 
standing in points after 13 of 25 races. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's more assertive with telling us what he wants, and I let  
him make more of his own decisions out there,'' Goss explained. 
``Last year, we were trying to guide and sometimes even think for 
him.''

<HEADLINE> Racing Canceled, Outage Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Planned power outages cost Monmouth Park  
patrons a chance to view and bet on horse races from four other 
tracks Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The track decided to cancel the evening simulcasting program  
after learning that GPU Energy planned to cut power in Oceanport 
and other Monmouth County towns for up to four hours to prevent 
widespread outages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would create a real inconvenience to our players,'' track  
spokesman Steve Schwartz said. ``It's always going to go out before 
a guy said he made a winning bet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evening simulcasts usually attract several hundred patrons, who  
usually bet less than $100,000, he said. Bad weather has led to 
prior cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
	Simulcast wagering at Monmouth Park is to resume Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Monmouth's day program Wednesday of 10 live thoroughbred races  
and simulcasts from a half-dozen other tracks was not affected, 
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility said the ``rolling outages'' were needed because it  
was straining to meet continued high demand for electricity in the 
region, even with a break in a three-day heat wave.

<HEADLINE> Rain Falls in Bank One Ballpark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The roof was closed, but that didn't stop the  
rain from falling in Bank One Ballpark for the second time in its 
young history, sending fans scurrying for higher ground in some of 
the choicer seats Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The roof on the $354 million structure couldn't hold back the  
water from a fierce thunderstorm that blew through downtown 
Phoenix, Diamondbacks president Richard Dozer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew this was a possibility,'' Dozer said. ``But we didn't  
think it would happen very often. It had to becoming in real hard 
directly from the north or south.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rain began about the time the game began but only last into  
the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, rain fell on fans because of leaks in the retractable  
roof. This time, the water made its way indoors because of the 
roof's design, Dozer said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a gap of a foot or two between the roof and the walls  
of the ballpark on the north and south side. The heavy wind blew 
the rain sideways through the gap and down on the fans in a sheet 
of water a few feet deep, Dozer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Maxwell was watching the game with his girlfriend and her  
daughter when the water came down. His legs were drenched as he 
laughed about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe it. I thought that's why there was a  
dome,'' he said. ``I was the only one who sat there. Everybody else 
took off, but I'm a diehard. I wanted to watch the game.''

<HEADLINE> Tom Kite Pulls Out of British Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Former U.S. Open champion and Ryder  
Cup captain Tom Kite pulled out of next week's British Open today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kite, who will miss the tournament for the first time since  
1981, cited recent poor form as his reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Kite was captain of the Ryder Cup team which lost to the  
Europeans at Valderrama in Spain two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kite, the 1992 U.S. Open champion, has never won the British  
Open. His best finish was in 1978, when he tied for second behind 
Jack Nicklaus at St. Andrews. He finished 10th at Royal Troon two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus' son, Gary, withdrew from this weekend's final  
qualifying tournament, as did Sweden's Peter Hedblom.

<HEADLINE> Mich. St. Players Likely Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan State basketball stars  
Mateen Cleaves and Antonio Smith are likely to go to trial after 
prosecutors refused to dismiss theft charges against them today. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair is charged with the theft of a 40-ounce bottle of beer  
from an East Lansing 7-Eleven. The car they were in was pulled over 
early on the morning of April 14 because the vehicle was said to 
match the description of the one involved in the theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is charged with two misdemeanors: larceny of property  
worth less than $200 and malicious destruction of property. He is 
accused of breaking the door lock on 7-Eleven's cooler. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves is charged with larceny of property worth less than  
$200. Both men pleaded innocent to the charges last month. If they 
are convicted, the charges carry penalties of up to three months in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the players' attorney, Brian Jeffries, met  
privately with Ingham County Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III to 
discuss whether a plea bargain could be reached and a trial could 
be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunnings refused to reduce the charge against Cleaves. Smith was  
given the option of pleading guilty to one of the charges in 
exchange for the dismissal of the second charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffries said he wouldn't agree to those terms.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a deal on the table and we'll consider that,'' he  
said. ``But at this point we're going to move toward a trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunnings said prosecutors have a videotape from the 7-Eleven as  
well as accounts from at least six witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffries called the evidence ``primarily circumstantial'' and  
said the video from the store ``doesn't show a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged theft occurred a little more than two weeks after  
team captains Cleaves and Smith led the Spartans to their first 
Final Four in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith completed his eligibility in March.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, a two-time All-American, has chosen to stay for his  
senior year next fall, passing up an opportunity to declare for the 
NBA Draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves also faces two citations filed against him last week  
after a noisy party at his campus apartment. Those citations carry 
penalties of up to 90 days in jail.

<HEADLINE> Paroled Suspect Arrested in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A prison parolee accused of stabbing two  
teen-age girls and leaving them for dead was arrested after he was 
spotted on a city plaza bench and recognized by his tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Gatson, 22, was the subject of a police manhunt after the  
attack Monday, two days after he was released from San Quentin 
prison. The girls were each stabbed more than 15 times and left in 
a ditch to die. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims had improved from critical condition early Wednesday  
and ``were getting better by the hour,'' Fremont Det. Dennis Madsen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Passers-by at the Nations Plaza spotted Gatson on Wednesday  
afternoon because of his tattoo, a star on the back of his shaved 
head, said San Francisco police spokesman Sherman Ackerson. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for the citizens coming forward and calling  
police, he wouldn't be in custody,'' Ackerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson was paroled Saturday after serving time for possession of  
stolen property. He has also been convicted of grand theft, lying 
to a police officer and being under the influence of 
methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were an 18-year-old girl from Fremont and a  
15-year-old girl from Reno, Nev., who was visiting relatives. Their 
identities were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Gatson and an 18-year-old accomplice later arrested  
met the teen-agers near a high school. The girls were threatened 
with knives and a gun and forced to withdraw about $200 from an 
automated teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The group then drove to Palomares Canyon, about 30 miles  
southeast of San Francisco, police said. There, each woman was 
stabbed and the younger victim was shot in the face.

<HEADLINE>  Turkish Minister Attempts Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's economy minister tried to kill  
himself Wednesday after hearing a report on the news about a 
scandal involving his agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Hikmet Ulugbay underwent three hours of emergency surgery to his  
chin, mouth and tongue on Wednesday but was not in life-threatening 
condition, Mehmet Haberal of Ankara's Baskent hospital said. There 
was no damage done to his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulugbay's family rushed to the private study after hearing the  
first shot and prevented him from firing a second shot, NTV 
television quoted his wife, Nedret, as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister, visibly upset and his voice breaking, later  
spoke in parliament to offer an explanation for the suicide 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Ulugbay is a person with an extraordinary sense of  
responsibility and is extraordinarily sensitive,'' Prime Minister 
Bulent Ecevit said. ``He may have been upset more than anyone else 
by the unfair allegations directed at his colleagues at the 
Treasury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-year-old Ulugbay had recently conducted two weeks of  
talks with a visiting International Monetary Fund delegation to try 
and secure funds to increase Turkey's creditworthiness and attract 
foreign investments. 
</P>
<P>
	He was said to be saddened by a reported leak of a secret IMF  
document to a brokerage firm owned by a cousin of Mesut Yilmaz, a 
former prime minister and a coalition partner in the government. 
The firm allegedly used the information to manipulate stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The government denied the allegations of insider trading, but  
Treasury Undersecretary Cuneyt Sel resigned from his post last week 
after claims that he leaked the document to former Economy Minister 
Gunes Taner, who reportedly gave it to Yilmaz. 
</P>
<P>
	Yilmaz claimed Tuesday that he was shown the secret documents by  
Ulugbay himself, but denied allegations that he passed them on to 
market traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon news of Ulugbay's suicide attempt, the Istanbul stock  
market dropped nearly 4 percent upon opening Wednesday. The market 
recovered to close at 1.3 percent down from Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Inhaled Drug Effective Against Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- A drug inhaled once a day proved  
effective in helping to prevent two common flu strains, researchers 
reported today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the study, University of Michigan epidemiologist  
Dr. Arnold Monto, said current flu vaccines remain the best defense 
against the flu, but they require two to four weeks to take effect 
after getting the shot. 
</P>
<P>
	His research found that inhaling Relenza, known generically as  
zanamivir, works against both the Type A and B strains of 
influenza. 
</P>
<P>
	Monto found that more than two-thirds of adults who used the  
drug for four weeks avoided the flu, compared with a group that 
received a placebo. It was even more effective at stopping flu with 
fever, working 84 percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The study followed 1,107 students at the University of Michigan  
and the University of Missouri during the 1997 flu season. They 
kept diaries to note any flu symptoms and rate their severity. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's numbers are small because that flu season was a  
relatively mild one. Only 34 of 554 people assigned to receive a 
placebo came down with flu compared with 11 of 553 people who took 
Relenza. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common side effects were headache, nasal symptoms, sore  
throat, coughing and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza, made by GlaxoWellcome Inc. and available in Europe, is  
awaiting approval for sale as a flu treatment in the United States. 
A Food and Drug Administration committee has asked for more proof 
about the drug's effectiveness and questioned whether consumers 
could use inhalers. 
</P>
<P>
	An editorial accompanying the JAMA report raised the same issue,  
saying that without careful supervision, it ``could prove 
befuddling to the first-time user.''

<HEADLINE> Brief Summary of Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOIS, France (AP) -- A look at today's fourth stage of the 86th  
Tour de France: 
</P>
<P>
	STAGE: A 121-mile ride from the Laval in western France to Blois  
in the Loire Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	STAGE WINNER: Italy's Mario Cipollini won in record time of  
31.290 mph for a flat stage. The previous record, set in 1993, was 
30.707 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	HOW OTHERS FARED: Germany's Erik Zabel was second and  
Australia's Stuart O'Grady third. They finished in the same 
positions Tuesday. Belgium's Tom Steels, winner of the second and 
third stages, placed fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	OVERALL STANDINGS: Estonia's Jaan Kirsipuu, who finished fifth  
Wednesday, retained the leader's yellow jersey for the third day in 
a row. O'Grady, 16 seconds behind, moved into second place, and 
Steels fell to third. Lance Armstrong was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	TOUR TIDBITS: Wednesday was Zabel's 29th birthday, and he  
narrowly missed giving himself the ultimate birthday present, a 
stage win. ... Steels has an extra incentive to wear the yellow 
jersey later this week: the Tour will approach the border of his 
home country, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``It was the perfect sprint,'' Cipollini, the  
stage winner, said. 
</P>
<P>
	NEXT STAGE: Thursday, Bonneval to Amiens, 145 miles.

<HEADLINE> McCain Calls for Internet Tax Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John  
McCain said Wednesday he favors a permanent ban on Internet sales 
taxes, a position that may distinguish him from front-runner George 
W. Bush and incur anger from governors and mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to about 100 conservatives, McCain said ``the ban  
must be permanent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked later about the specifics of his proposal, he took a  
softer stance, saying he liked the idea of exempting Internet sales 
from state and local taxes but would await the findings of a 
congressional panel created last year to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the Texas governor  
is still considering whether commerce on the Internet should be 
taxed. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a Republican senator from Arizona, bemoaned a shortage  
of skilled foreign workers allowed into the country, and he 
denounced ``the nation's out-of-control'' civil justice system. 
Both are hot-button issues for high-tech industry executives here. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Bush, he attacked the Clinton administration for dragging  
its feet on a bill Congress passed last week that would make it 
harder to sue high-tech companies for Y2K-related problems. 
President Clinton has said he will sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Touching on another issue dear to Silicon Valley, McCain called  
for removing more trade barriers, proclaiming himself ``the most 
free-trading, anti-protectionist you will ever see in the United 
States Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain delivered his speech at the Hoover Institution, a  
conservative think tank based at Stanford University that is home 
to at least 10 Bush policy advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology companies have pleaded with the federal government to  
raise the cap on visas that allow highly skilled foreign workers 
into the country. Congress did so last year, but not as much as 
U.S. manufacturers of high technology products wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain blamed union donations to political parties for that  
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Labor unions, having spent millions in soft money quid,  
received their pro quo,'' he said. ``The visas have already run 
out; the high-tech experts and the jobs they create will now roll 
overseas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, like Bush, McCain didn't say to what extent he would  
raise the cap. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain praised President Clinton for agreeing to sign the Y2K  
bill last week, ``over the vehement objections of the trial lawyers 
and the vice president.'' But he called it ``less than comforting'' 
that ``it was still in the end a close call for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last year imposed a three-year moratorium on new  
federal, state and local electronic commerce taxes, which expires 
in October 2001. It also created the Advisory Commission on 
Electronic Commerce to recommend future Internet tax policy.

<HEADLINE> Trade Group Announces Privacy Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a familiar scenario: You donate money to a  
charity and the next thing you know, telemarketers are calling 
during dinner and your mail box is stuffed with catalogs and 
promotions from credit-card companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Such unwanted solicitations may soon come to an end: The Direct  
Marketing Association announced today that it is requiring all of 
its members doing business in the United States to disclose when 
they are sharing consumers' private information with other 
marketers. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade group's members that deal with U.S. consumers --  
including 2,600 Internet companies, catalogs, banks, financial 
institutions, publishers, manufacturers, nonprofit organizations 
and books and music clubs -- will be required to adhere to the new 
privacy practices immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the time is now to step forward and assure  
consumers that information in marketers' hands is used responsibly, 
in beneficial ways, and with respect for individual choice,'' H. 
Robert Wientzen, president and chief executive of the New 
York-based association, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct marketing is big business in the United States, with  
sales exceeding $1.3 trillion in 1998, according to a study for the 
association by the research firm The WEFA Group. 
</P>
<P>
	But direct marketers have been criticized in the past for  
sharing private consumer information to build their customer base. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new policy, companies will be required to disclose to  
customers when information about them -- such as their names and 
addresses -- may be shared with other marketers. They also must tell 
consumers that they have the option to not have their information 
shared. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies must also honor any individual's request to not  
receive solicitations, and they must use the DMA's two national 
name-removal services -- which track the names of people who don't 
want solicitations by mail or by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley lauded the new  
regulations, saying they are important to building consumer 
confidence in how personal information is handled.

<HEADLINE> Alexander Launches Straw Poll Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander  
opened a grassroots drive Wednesday to build support for a straw 
poll next month that could be a key to his hopes for the GOP 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said he plans to campaign in 60 of the state's 99  
counties in the 23 days he has planned in the state before the Aug. 
14 straw poll in Ames. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to get the presidential campaign discussion back  
where it ought to be and away from polls and money and media and 
back to character, to schools and farm prices,'' Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said he will undertake an intense organizational  
effort to get backers to show up at the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	After focusing such heavy attention on the straw poll, a weak  
showing would be a big blow to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot is at stake for a lot of us,'' Alexander said. ``I plan  
on making a stellar showing. My reason for going to 60 counties is 
to improve my chances of making a good showing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drive started Wednesday with an ice cream social at the home  
of one of Alexander's most prominent and visible Iowa supporters, 
former Gov. Terry Branstad. 
</P>
<P>
	The straw poll is being closely watched because it is one  
measure of a campaign's ability to deliver supporters to a 
political event, the same skills needed to score well on caucus 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush has dominated the race in recent  
weeks, riding high atop the opinion polls and raising far more 
money than his GOP rivals. He has only campaigned in the state 
once, but has said he will compete in the straw poll and his 
campaign is putting together a big effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Bush win the straw poll after only campaigning in the  
state once, it would provide a big burst of momentum. It also would 
be a big blow to Alexander, who has campaigned for months.

<HEADLINE> Broadway Plays Closing on New Year's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Great White Way will stay dark on the last  
night of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The city police department, fearing that overflow Times Square  
crowds could create massive problems, asked the city's Broadway 
theaters to shut down on Dec. 31, 1999. The owners quickly 
acquiesced to the request. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very, very, very congested area this  
year,'' Lee Silver of the Shubert Organization, which operates 16 
theaters, explained Wednesday. ``The theater people have agreed to 
go along with the police concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move could cost Broadway's producers hundreds of thousands  
of dollars in advance ticket sales -- not to mention upsetting the 
people who planned their New Year's Eve around the theater.

theaters, said it made sense to shut down for the night. The 
theater crowd could have added another 40,000 people to the New 
Year's revelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something to consider carefully,'' Libin said  
Wednesday. ``It made a lot of sense. The men in blue are terrific. 
They know their business, and we know our business. Together, we 
reached this decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A show like ``Chicago,'' playing at the 1,600-seat Shubert  
Theater, could lose $320,000 in sales if the performance is 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown plans were first reported in the New York Post.  
</P>
<P>
	Police are estimating that 2 million people may pack Times  
Square to ring in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Camryn Manheim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It is a hot, muggy summer day. Manhattan is  
sizzling. And so is Camryn Manheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, Manheim became a champion of large-size women  
when she triumphantly hoisted her Emmy into the air and exulted: 
``This is for all the fat girls!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Emmy was really spectacular,'' she said during an  
interview in her dressing room at the Hammerstein Ballroom. ``My 
parents were there, and my best friend was there, and it was the 
first time I had ever been to an event like that and walked down a 
red carpet. The whole day was really spectacular. And like a 
fantasy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manheim, who divides her time between New York and Los Angeles,  
is on Ladies' Home Journal's list of the 10 Most Fascinating Women 
and People magazine's 25 Most Intriguing People of 1998. Her face 
has graced the covers of TV Guide, Mode, Radiance and Parade 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Her portrayal of feisty lawyer Ellenor Frutt on ABC's ``The  
Practice'' also won her a Golden Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, she is a recipient of the Golden Hanger, bestowed  
by E! Entertainment's Joan Rivers, who is known for her cutting 
comments as fashion-challenged stars walk down the red carpet on 
Oscar night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Golden Hanger award was thrilling for me because ... I'm  
representing a group of women who've been overlooked for so many 
decades,'' said Manheim, who is a size 22. ``I actually took it 
very seriously that a plus-size woman was getting an award for 
setting trends in fashion. I actually am very proud of that award 
and it sits right next to my Emmy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her memoir, ``Wake Up, I'm Fat!'' (Broadway Books), hit the The  
New York Times and Publishers Weekly best-seller lists. Her 
one-woman off-Broadway show of the same name ran from 1993 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Manheim, who earned her master's degree from New York  
University, is only hours away from her runway debut, where she 
will model outfits for Lane Bryant's Venezia Jeans Collection. Lane 
Bryant services the large-size market. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what's going to freak me out the most? It's the  
decline on the runway in heels,'' the 5-foot-10-inch actress 
laughed. ``THAT is the most frightening part.'' (P.S. Manheim later 
strutted down the catwalk like a pro, planting a sassy air kiss on 
the audience.) 
</P>
<P>
	Her outfits: red silk-crepe bustier and matching long red skirt;  
long, neon-white silk coat and matching trousers; and black V-neck 
silk top and trousers paired with a hot-pink taffeta duster. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty fancy for a woman who rides a motorcycle!  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a jeans and a T-shirt gal,'' said Manheim, 38, who is  
fashionably attired in black pants and sheer long-sleeve white 
shirt layered over a white top. 
</P>
<P>
	When David E. Kelley picked her to play Ellenor Frutt on ``The  
Practice,'' she recalled: ``I said to the wardrobe designer, `I'd 
like to wear pants, and then she said, `Well, you know, it's 
conservative Boston court system, the commonwealth of Massachusetts 
and all,' and I said, `Listen, it's a federal law that women can 
wear pants in court and you tell Mr. Kelley that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Manheim got her way.  
</P>
<P>
	``But that's before I knew how powerful he was,'' she laughed.  
``Had I known, I wouldn't have been so bold. As far as I was 
concerned, he was Michelle Pfeiffer's husband. He wasn't his own 
entity at the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She recently completed work on an ABC television movie, ``The  
Loretta Claiborne Story,'' the true story of a woman who became a 
Special Olympics champion. Manheim also has a part in a new Mike 
Nichols comedy and will play Snow White in a new NBC miniseries, 
``The 10th Kingdom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	1. Did you ever dream that you would be backstage in your  
dressing room getting ready for a fashion show at the Hammerstein 
Ballroom in New York? 
</P>
<P>
	Manheim: Well, I fantasized about it as a young girl. I think  
all little girls fantasize about taking the trip down the runway 
with the photographers clicking their cameras and blinded by the 
lights. (Laughs.) The funny thing about my life is that I had 
unbelievable fantasies which I never thought would become realities 
and they all have. So nothing surprises me anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Not everyone can boast of having both an Emmy and a Golden  
Hanger. How does it feel? 
</P>
<P>
	Manheim: I joke about it and say, `You know, this award was  
harder to win than the Emmy,' and in some ways it was. But thanks 
to Joan Rivers, she is acknowledging that plus-size women can be 
beautiful. And I know that she has in the past given a lot of flak 
to some women who have had weight issues, but I think she's opening 
up her eyes and widening her interpretation of what beauty is. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Where is your favorite place to shop?  
</P>
<P>
	Manheim: In L.A., my favorite big girls' store is called Culver  
Large. Nothing costs more than $50, and things cost as little as 
$4.99. It's in the Culver City Mall. It's FAN-TASTIC! This shirt's 
from there. It literally was like $8.99. I love everything that 
comes from Culver Large. I'm telling you, it's the best. That's for 
my everyday wear. I shop at Lane Bryant all the time, especially 
for intimate apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	4: Would you reveal the names of any stars who have signed your  
autograph book? 
</P>
<P>
	Manheim: I'll just tell you my favorite. My very favorite  
autograph is Roberto Benigni. He wrote something in Italian, and I 
worship the ground he walks on. And I have some very special 
autographs, I have a whole list, and one day it will be auctioned 
off at Sotheby's. It's pretty cool. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm looking for another autograph book. So please put in your  
article that if anyone can find the ones that say `Autographs' on 
it, I'd really appreciate it. And they can tell me at my Web site, 
www.camryn.com. 
</P>
<P>
	5. How did David E. Kelley come up with the name Ellenor Frutt?  
</P>
<P>
	Manheim (laughing): You know, Ellenor I like. Ellie I like.  
Frutt? I don't know what he was thinking. And had I been as cocky 
then as I am now, I would have said to David, `What is up with 
Frutt?'

<HEADLINE> Fiat, Mitsubishi To Build SUV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURIN, Italy (AP) -- Italian automaker Fiat SpA and Japan's  
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said Wednesday they have agreed to build a 
four-wheel-drive sport utility vehicle in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is the first in what Fiat in a statement indicated  
could be several deals as negotiations continue in the coming weeks 
on other joint projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Pininfarina SpA, an Italian car design and production company,  
this week began producing Mitsubishi's latest version of its Pajero 
SUV, the Pinin, which also will have an annual production target of 
30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of the new Fiat-Mitsubishi SUV will begin in early  
2001 at a plant outside of Turin. Three-door and five-door versions 
will be produced with either diesel or gasoline engines. Fiat will 
provide the design while Mitsubishi will furnish the body and basic 
mechanical parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiat has been the subject of extensive speculation that it wants  
to form an alliance or merger with another automaker to better 
compete with larger players in the consolidating global auto 
industry. The deal announced Wednesday falls far short of such an 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi jointly produces cars in the Netherlands with Volvo  
Cars Corp., but that relationship is under review after Ford Motor 
Co. acquired Volvo's car division in January.

<HEADLINE> Terry Nichols Seeks New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Terry Nichols' lawyers asked for a new trial in  
the Oklahoma bombing Wednesday, arguing that the government 
withheld FBI documents that could have helped his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Michael Tigar said there are 43,000 documents  
still hidden in FBI files. Prosecutors countered that they turned 
over 12,000 pertinent FBI files and that the others wouldn't have 
changed the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch, who presided over the trial,  
said he will have to study the documents and will issue a ruling 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 44, was convicted in 1997 of conspiracy and involuntary  
manslaughter in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah 
Federal Building that killed 168 people. He is serving a life 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy McVeigh, his former Army buddy, was separately convicted  
of murder and weapons convictions and sentenced to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claimed Nichols helped McVeigh finance the plan,  
gather the ingredients and mix the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Sean Connelly argued ``there is no legal or factual  
basis'' for turning over the documents or giving Nichols a new 
trial because the documents would not have changed the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	He said prosecutors and the FBI closely screened the documents  
and determined that most of them were internal reports not subject 
to disclosure, or so vague they were of no value. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tigar said an FBI document that wasn't released until late  
in the trial contradicted the prosecution claim that racing fuel 
used in the bomb was purchased in Texas. Tigar claimed he has other 
documents showing that McVeigh plotted the attack with a group of 
associates operating around Kingman, Ariz., rather than with 
Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar said other FBI documents show that a gun dealer who was  
supposedly robbed by Nichols and McVeigh to finance the bombing 
changed his testimony.

<HEADLINE> Report: Cavaliers To Hire Wittman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Randy Wittman  
reportedly will be the new coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs, who have been looking for a head coach since Mike  
Fratello was fired June 1, scheduled a 4 p.m. EDT news conference 
to introduce their coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman and his family arrived at Cleveland Hopkins  
International Airport about noon. As television camera crews and 
reporters waited at the flight gate, Wittman exited from a side 
door and was whisked by van to a waiting limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Akron Beacon Journal reported in today's editions that  
Wittman told Orlando head coach Doc Rivers, a former NBA teammate 
and longtime friend, that he had accepted the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really excited,'' Rivers said. ``He thinks it's a perfect  
situation for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Plain Dealer and several Twin Cities and Cleveland  
television stations, citing unnamed sources, also reported Wittman 
would be the new Cavs coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman does not have a listed phone number in the Twin Cities  
area. The Cavaliers would not confirm Wittman's hiring officially 
and Timberwolves spokesman Kent Wipf also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman, 39, is well regarded in NBA coaching circles, and in  
his five years with the Timberwolves gained a reputation as one of 
the league's brightest assistants. He also has been an assistant 
with the Indiana Pacers and Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	A nine-year NBA veteran, Wittman was a first-round draft pick of  
the Washington Bullets in 1983 but was traded to the Atlanta Hawks 
before the 1983-84 season. He finished his career averaging 7.4 
points per game following playing stints in Atlanta, Sacramento and 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to playing for Indiana's 1981 NCAA title team,  
Wittman was a two-time academic All-American with the Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland hasn't made it past the first round of the playoffs  
since 1993 and has seen average attendance sag from 18,011 in 
1994-95 to 14,120 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman first met with Cavs general manager Jim Paxson on June  
16 and was back in Cleveland 10 days later to have dinner with 
Paxson. He emerged as the frontrunner over the holiday weekend 
after meeting with Gordon Gund at the owner's offices in Princeton, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs were secretive about their coaching search after  
Fratello was fired. Four coaches were known to have been 
interviewed: Wittman, Dave Cowens, Del Harris and John MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman is the only one of the group who has no NBA head  
coaching experience.

<HEADLINE> Gasoline, Heating Oil Prices Rise Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Futures prices for refined oil products rose  
Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid expectations 
that a weekly report would show a drop in U.S. inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	However, crude prices edged lower a day after spiking above $20  
a gallon for the first time in 19 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract for August delivery of light sweet crude oil  
settled at $19.77 per barrel, down 1 cent. 
</P>
<P>
	But unleaded gasoline for delivery in August settled at 59.17  
cents a gallon, gaining 0.69 cent, while home heating oil for 
delivery in August settled at 50.08 cents a gallon, up 0.70 cent. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices briefly pushed above $20 a barrel on Tuesday as  
investors bet that world oil producers are making good on promises 
to slash output. Recent inventory data has continued to show 
tightening supplies, and analysts say shortages could begin to 
appear by September if the output cuts hold. 
</P>
<P>
	After the close of Wednesday's trading, the American Petroleum  
Institute reported that the nation's crude supply slipped to 327.94 
million barrels in the week ended July 2, down from 329.87 million 
a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline inventories fell from 220.79 million barrels to 216.38  
million by the end of last week, while heating oil supplies rose to 
132.44 million barrels from 131.17 million a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Friday, natural gas prices were lower, with  
contracts for delivery in August settling at $2.141 per 1,000 cubic 
feet, down 5.0 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
August settled at $18.15 per barrel, up 5 cents at the 
International Petroleum Exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Lisa White jumps in the air and heads the soccer ball, making  
her brown braid slap wildly. Around her, teammates practice their 
dribbling and long kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa, an 11-year-old from Gardena, Calif., already has her  
soccer future mapped out: She wants to be on her high school team, 
win an athletic scholarship to UCLA and then play professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like that a lot,'' she said, grinning.  
</P>
<P>
	So would many in a new generation of young, female soccer fans  
whose passion for the game has been heightened by the Women's World 
Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
	TV ratings for World Cup soccer have exceeded those for NHL  
playoff games, and the successful U.S. team is regularly drawing 
sellout crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when the Americans aren't playing, more than 22,000 people,  
mostly girls and women, have turned out for matches. Hair dyed red, 
white and blue and faces painted with American flags are de rigueur 
in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has become so popular with mainstream America, not  
just the soccer fans,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said. ``They're 
such a wonderful group of women that once people got to know them, 
it's just steamrolled. It's awesome to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a drastic change from 1991, when the American women won the  
World Cup in China. That victory barely registered a blip in U.S. 
newspapers or on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years later, the United States is in a position to win the  
World Cup again. This time, millions will be watching. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States plays China for the championship Saturday at  
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. A sellout crowd of more than 
88,000 is expected, which would top the record of 78,972 for a 
women's sporting event, set June 19 at the World Cup opener in 
Giants Stadium in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be a soccer player after watching the tournament. It  
has inspired me,'' said 11-year-old Ye Pei of Devon, Pa. ``My 
favorite player is the Chinese goalie, because she is so 
athletic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More girls are playing soccer since the 1996 Olympics, when the  
U.S. women won a gold medal, said Mike Nelson, a regional 
coordinator and coach of American Youth Soccer Organization teams 
in Torrance, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``The girls are seeing there's an opportunity,'' said Nelson, a  
father of four girls. ``My youngest knows the girl players by name 
now. Where she was big on Ken Griffey Jr., it's Mia Hamm now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 8.6 million soccer players in the United States, 2.5  
million are girls, according to AYSO. About 635,000 boys and girls, 
ages 5 to 18, play in AYSO's 1,000 leagues nationwide. Forty 
percent are female. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson is projecting an enrollment of 44 percent girls in his  
region's leagues this fall, up from 38 percent five years ago. The 
first female players allowed in AYSO in 1971 now are mothers, and 
he credits them with enrolling their daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Brittany Stevens, 12, of Torrance was introduced to soccer by  
her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said it would be good for me because I like to kick  
things,'' Brittany said. ``You're in the game to have fun and not 
just for competition. It's fun to be aggressive, roll in the mud 
and slide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said the numbers of female players in the under-6,  
under-8 and under-10 divisions are on the rise. He expects six of 
seven divisions in his region to set records this fall for 
participation by girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Alyssa Baydar, 10, comes from a soccer-crazy family. Her father  
introduced her to the sport when she was 5, and her 13-year-old 
sister plays, too. The Torrance family watches World Cup matches 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	``They teach me if I make a mistake how to correct it and what I  
can do better in the next game,'' she said, referring to Hamm and 
Brazilian sensation Sissi. 
</P>
<P>
	Girls tend to stick with soccer for years, while boys often skip  
from football to basketball to baseball, Nelson said. He said the 
girls play better, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The girls play a more teamwork-based game. The girls don't get  
on each other when a mistake is made. They kind of band together,'' 
Nelson said. ``The boys' game is sometimes a little faster, but 
it's also a little more out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. midfielder Julie Foudy believes kids accustomed to  
following individual sports such as figure skating and gymnastics 
enjoy seeing a team of Americans succeeding together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team is a special group because we've been playing  
together for so long and there's a bond there that people notice. 
That's an attraction to the kids,'' she said. ``We have fun when we 
play, we have fun when we're together, so I think they're attracted 
to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a World Cup quarterfinal between Norway and Sweden,  
11-year-old girls Jamie Loney and Laura Adams of Pleasanton, 
Calif., wore painted American flags on their faces and chanted: 
``Girls rule! Boys drool! Soccer's cool!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's unusual for girls our age to be so into sports,''  
Jamie said, ``but when I look at the players, I just know it's 
something I want to do when I get older.''

</P>
<P>
	``The girls are seeing there's an opportunity,'' said Nelson, a  
father of four girls. ``My youngest knows the girl players by name 
now. Where she was big on Ken Griffey Jr., it's Mia Hamm now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 8.6 million soccer players in the United States, 2.5  
million are girls, according to AYSO. About 635,000 boys and girls, 
ages 5 to 18, play in AYSO's 1,000 leagues nationwide. Forty 
percent are female. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson is projecting an enrollment of 44 percent girls in his  
region's leagues this fall, up from 38 percent five years ago. The 
first female players allowed in AYSO in 1971 now are mothers, and 
he credits them with enrolling their daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Brittany Stevens, 12, of Torrance was introduced to soccer by  
her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said it would be good for me because I like to kick  
things,'' Brittany said. ``You're in the game to have fun and not 
just for competition. It's fun to be aggressive, roll in the mud 
and slide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said the numbers of female players in the under-6,  
under-8 and under-10 divisions are on the rise. He expects six of 
seven divisions in his region to set records this fall for 
participation by girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Alyssa Baydar, 10, comes from a soccer-crazy family. Her father  
introduced her to the sport when she was 5, and her 13-year-old 
sister plays, too. The Torrance family watches World Cup matches 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	``They teach me if I make a mistake how to correct it and what I  
can do better in the next game,'' she said, referring to Hamm and 
Brazilian sensation Sissi. 
</P>
<P>
	Girls tend to stick with soccer for years, while boys often skip  
from football to basketball to baseball, Nelson said. He said the 
girls play better, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The girls play a more teamwork-based game. The girls don't get  
on each other when a mistake is made. They kind of band together,'' 
Nelson said. ``The boys' game is sometimes a little faster, but 
it's also a little more out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. midfielder Julie Foudy believes kids accustomed to  
following individual sports such as figure skating and gymnastics 
enjoy seeing a team of Americans succeeding together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team is a special group because we've been playing  
together for so long and there's a bond there that people notice. 
That's an attraction to the kids,'' she said. ``We have fun when we 
play, we have fun when we're together, so I think they're attracted 
to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a World Cup quarterfinal between Norway and Sweden,  
11-year-old girls Jamie Loney and Laura Adams of Pleasanton, 
Calif., wore painted American flags on their faces and chanted: 
``Girls rule! Boys drool! Soccer's cool!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's unusual for girls our age to be so into sports,''  
Jamie said, ``but when I look at the players, I just know it's 
something I want to do when I get older.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Use Signs To Air Grievances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- Edgar Bear Runner held up a sign and  
yelled to urge President Clinton to grant clemency to an Indian 
serving a life term for killing two FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
	But he and other activists decided against holding formal  
demonstrations during the president's visit Wednesday to the Pine 
Ridge Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those worried about human rights and other issues agreed  
the president's visit should remain focused on his plans for 
bringing jobs and better housing to the reservation, said Bear 
Runner, who lives at Porcupine village. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Clinton's speech, some activists had said they planned  
to stage demonstrations during his visit to the reservation, but 
none occurred during the time he was in Pine Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Some held up signs during Clinton's speech calling for the  
return of land taken from the Sioux more than a century ago. 
Another sign referred to unsolved murders on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	People who have marched to protest the sale of beer at  
Whiteclay, Neb., only two miles from the village of Pine Ridge, 
also had threatened to demonstrate. Indian activists Dennis Banks 
and Russell Means have been involved in the recent marches, but 
they did not appear to be in Pine Ridge on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcohol is banned on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, but  
alcohol bought elsewhere creates severe problems for residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Runner, who was involved in some American Indian Movement  
activities when he was younger, wanted the president to know about 
Leonard Peltier, who has been in prison since 1977. Peltier was 
convicted of the 1975 murders of two FBI agents during a shootout 
on the Pine Ridge Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here as Peltier's supporters to continue to echo the  
sounds of freedom for Peltier,'' Bear Runner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Babe Poor Bear held up a sign urging Clinton to follow the terms  
of treaties that had given the Sioux most of western South Dakota. 
Those treaties were broken more than a century ago and the tribes 
were restricted to smaller reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	One line on her sign urged the president to ``give back the Paha  
Sapa,'' the Sioux name for the Black Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendell Yellow Bull, executive director of the Oglala Sioux  
Tribe, said most people wanted to avoid any demonstrations that 
might have disrupted discussions on improving the reservation's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the people just wanted this to go well,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Titleist Suing Nike Over Woods' Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- You're not likely to see Tiger Woods wearing  
Reebok golf shoes or an Adidas T-shirt. That's because Nike pays 
him about $40 million to wear theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike says it has no problem with two of its television ads that  
show the golfer swinging a club at a golf ball, even though the 
club and ball are made by one of Nike's competitors, Titleist, 
which is paying Woods about $20 million to promote its clubs and 
golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
	But now the Fairhaven, Mass.-based Titleist is swinging back,  
with a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed on June 25, claims that the Nike ads violate  
Woods' exclusive contract to endorse Titleist balls and clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	In one ad, Woods bounces a ball off the face of a wedge several  
times before swatting it baseball-style. In the other, regular 
golfers join Woods at the driving range, and begin hitting the ball 
300 yards, just as he does. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials for Acushnet Co., the parent company for Titleist,  
FootJoy footwear and Cobra Golf Inc., say the Nike ads have caused 
``irreparable harm'' because a Nike slogan appears at the end of 
both commercials. As a result, ``many tens of millions'' of people 
may think Woods has switched to Nike equipment, according to court 
papers filed by Acushnet's lawyer, James King. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nike says it's doing nothing wrong. Tiger is using a  
Titleist club and hitting Titleist balls in the ads, said Mike 
Kelly, Nike's director of golf communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has already changed the slogan at the end of the ad  
from ``Nike Golf'' to ``Nike -- Just Do It'' in an effort to 
accommodate Titleist, Kelly said. And the company is considering 
other slogans before the ad's next run on network television, 
scheduled to coincide with the PGA Championship in August. The ads 
are currently running primarily on the Golf Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't advertise Tiger without him playing golf,'' Kelly  
said. ``We're within our rights to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Titleist seeks unspecified monetary damages in the suit and  
hopes that talks with Nike, which began manufacturing golf balls 
this year, will pull the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	That's unlikely, Kelly said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We plan to continue airing these two ads on national  
television, and we have communicated that to the Acushnet 
Company,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, said he was working closely with  
both companies to settle the dispute, but he declined to say how a 
compromise could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly don't want two of Tiger's biggest sponsors to  
just slug it out,'' Steinberg said. ``We're taking an active role 
in trying to get this settled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, 23, turned pro in 1996 after winning his third straight  
U.S. Amateur tournament. He immediately signed endorsements with 
Nike and Titleist worth a total of $60 million over five years.

<HEADLINE> Former Broker Sentenced to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A broker at a now-defunct investment firm that  
stole $75 million from clients was sentenced Wednesday to nine 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	State Supreme Court Justice Edward McLaughlin imposed the  
sentence on Roman Okin, 31, of Manhattan, who had worked for A.R. 
Baron &AMP; Co. The firm was created solely to steal its customers' 
money, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Okin, jailed for the past 13 months, pleaded guilty in May 1998  
to enterprise corruption and began helping in the prosecution of 
co-defendants and the recovery of some of the stolen money. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant District Attorney John Moscow told the judge that  
Okin's help was valuable. ``A substantial number of the crooks he 
was dealing with will soon be in prison,'' the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Okin was among 14 Baron brokers charged in 1997 in a 174-count  
indictment that accused them of lying to investors, making 
unauthorized trades, forging documents, and manipulating stocks and 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow said 13 of the defendants have pleaded guilty and one,  
John McAndris, was convicted after trial. McLaughlin sentenced 
McAndris, 57, of Montvale, N.J., to five to 15 years in prison, the 
longest sentence imposed in the Baron case. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-year maximum sentence McLaughlin imposed means that  
Okin must serve at least three years in prison and that he will be 
eligible for parole in 23 months. The judge could have sentenced 
him to 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Baron opened in July 1991 and closed in July 1996 after years of  
complaints. When the indictments were handed up, District Attorney 
Robert Morgenthau estimated that Baron had stolen $75 million from 
8,000 clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney said then that Baron was a place where  
``every conceivable form of dishonesty was used,'' and which ``was 
created and existed for no other reason than to line the pockets of 
its executives and employees at the expense of unsuspecting members 
of the public.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slips, Tokyo Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen late today in  
Tokyo and stocks fell for a second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.96 yen in late trading in Tokyo, down 0.12  
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 122.02 yen. The dollar traded between 121.94 yen and 
122.21 during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 91.83  
points, or 0.51 percent, to close at 17,958.90. On Tuesday, the 
average closed down 84.33 points, or 0.47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, investors took profits for a second  
day after the average closed above 18,000 on Monday for the first 
time in almost two years. Prices soared after the Bank of Japan's 
``tankan'' survey showed a rise in business confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 1.70 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,477.02 
points. The TOPIX closed down 7.86 points, or 0.53 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the main section of the Tokyo exchange was estimated  
at 645 million shares, down from 675 million Tuesday. Declining 
issues barely outnumbered rising stocks 595 to 580, while 152 
shares were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent gains by the Nikkei gave the Japanese currency a  
boost by encouraging foreign investors to sell dollars to buy yen 
and invest more money in Japanese markets, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the currency market, foreigners, encouraged by recent rises  
in the Nikkei, sold dollars to buy yen, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of dollar selling pressure, especially because  
foreigners want to buy yen to invest in Japanese stocks,'' said 
Ryohei Muramatsu, a foreign exchange manager at Commerzbank in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar earlier in the day edged higher against the yen on  
expectation the central bank would again intervene to stem a rise 
in Japan's currency, but the bank was never seen in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan last bought dollars on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan is still struggling to recover from its longest postwar  
recession despite some improved economic indicators recently. 
Officials are concerned a rise in the yen could send the economy 
back into the doldrums because a stronger Japanese currency makes 
exports more expensive abroad and reduces dollar denominated 
earnings at domestic companies. 
</P>
<P>
	A day before his promotion to vice finance minister for  
international affairs, Haruhiko Kuroda played down government 
efforts to prop up the dollar against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In a talk regarding how closely the government is monitoring the  
dollar-yen exchange rate, Kuroda suggested reporters translate a 
Japanese phrase generally rendered as ``carefully watching'' as 
just ``watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.06 yen, up from  
124.80 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.6500  
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.6800 percent, driving its price 
up to 101.30 yen from 101.04 yen.

<HEADLINE> New $8M Facility for Kings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The Sacramento Kings owners have announced  
plans to build an $8 million training facility next to Arco Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maloof family, which last week took over controlling  
interest in the NBA franchise and the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs, 
said Wednesday that the 38,500-square-foot facility will serve both 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility is scheduled for completion during the Kings'  
2000-2001 season. It will include two full-sized basketball courts, 
two locker rooms, a weight-training room, a videotape viewing room 
and offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this training facility, we are making an investment in  
our players and basketball staffs by providing them with the 
resources to become championship caliber contenders,'' said 
co-owner Gavin Maloof. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility also will be used for the teams' community youth  
activities.

<HEADLINE> Oil Producers Raise Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- With the price of oil flirting with $20 a barrel  
for the first time in 19 months, energy companies are beginning to 
spend more freely on exploration but are being cautious before 
reversing thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	As prices sank toward $10 a barrel late last year, the oil  
industry tightened its belt in a harsh retrenchment that slashed 
payrolls and cut budgets. In Texas alone, 14,200 jobs in the 
industry were eliminated since May 1998, according to state labor 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies also sped up the pace of mergers in a push for  
efficiency and survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly doubling of prices in the past seven months, however,  
has prompted many producers to increase their budgets for 
exploration and production. 
</P>
<P>
	But producers are waiting to see if prices stay put before  
resuming hiring. Michael Mayer, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co., 
said many jobs lost due to mergers will never be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Worth-based Cross Timbers Oil Co. is among those increasing  
development budgets in light of the recovery in oil prices. 
Spending plans for the year were raised from $60 million to a range 
of $70 million to $90 million, said chief financial officer Louis 
Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an inventory of projects that go out three or four  
years. With improved prices, we're going to execute more of those 
than we had planned this year,'' Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Enron Oil &AMP; Gas Co. in Houston said that if cash flow improves,  
its exploration spending will be at the higher end of its budget 
range of $575 million to $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Other small to medium producers, including The Coastal Corp. and  
Apache Corp., both based in Houston, have also announced increases 
in capital spending, but the industry's giants have not gone along. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majors have almost decided that North America is a  
marginal area to spend their money,'' said Joseph Culp, an analyst 
with A.G. Edwards. He said mergers such as Exxon-Mobil and BP 
Amoco-Atlantic Richfield indicate that majors have planned for low 
oil prices and won't change their strategy now. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon Corp., which increased its exploration spending from $8.8  
billion to $10 billion last year, has said it will not increase 
spending this year. Asked if the plans have changed with the 
rebound in oil, spokesman Ed Burwell said Wednesday that Exxon 
would have no further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil has been trading at 19-month highs on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange and briefly shot above $20 a barrel on Tuesday. 
In trading Wednesday, the contract for August delivery of light, 
sweet crude oil was little changed, dipping 1 cent to close at 
$19.77 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices sank to a 12-year low in December 1998, dropping as far  
as $10.65 a barrel on the Nymex, as markets were awash with oil and 
demand was reduced because of economic crises spreading from Asia. 
The recovery in oil prices has come as the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers adopted 
substantial cuts in output and apparently stuck to them, and as 
Asian economies began to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas oil producers remain skeptical about the recovery in  
prices after a prolonged slump. Many worry openly about the central 
role of OPEC, which until recently has failed to enforce oil-output 
limits on members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to rush out and drill a bunch of new wells this  
month,'' said Ted Collins, president of Collins and Ware Inc. of 
Midland, Texas, which operates more than 600 oil and natural gas 
wells. ``The OPEC countries have been pretty fickle, and it doesn't 
take much of a break in the ranks to crater this whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just this week, Obeid bin Sief al-Nasseri, the United Arab  
Emirates oil minister, warned fellow OPEC members not to 
``exploit'' the higher oil prices by stepping up production. 
</P>
<P>
	Exploration activity, meantime, remains far below levels of  
oil's hey-day. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry had a record 4,530 drilling rigs in use nationwide  
in December 1981. That plunged to an all-time low of 498 in April 
before recovering somewhat to 580 last week, according to Baker 
Hughes, which has been keeping count of active oil-drilling rigs 
since 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not seeing any new drilling yet, and that's where the  
jobs are,'' said Morris Burns, executive vice president of the 
Permian Basin Petroleum Association in West Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In that part of the Oil Patch, most activity this summer has  
consisted of workovers -- resuming production in old wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Burns said drilling probably won't resume in earnest until  
prices have stabilized at $20 or higher for six to 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts, including Culp and Ken Miller of Houston energy  
consulting firm Purvin &AMP; Gertz, predict prices will settle in a 
range of $17-$20 a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Subaru Recalling 95,000 Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Subaru of America Inc. on Tuesday recalled 95,000  
Impreza and Legacy cars for removal of front tow hooks to eliminate 
a flaw that could cause air bags to deploy unintentionally. 
</P>
<P>
	If the tow hooks come in sharp contact with curbs, dips,  
potholes, railroad crossings or similar road hazards they can cause 
the air bags to deploy, the automaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reports of serious injuries that have  
resulted in the few cases where the unintended deployment has 
occurred, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall covers some 1994 and 1995 Imprezas and some 1995 and  
1996 Legacys, excluding Outback versions. The company said it is 
notifying owners by mail and asking them to have the tow hooks 
removed by their dealer at no charge.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan: Expand Border Fencing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Commentator Pat Buchanan called Wednesday  
for expanded security fencing along the southern border with Mexico 
as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great threat to America, the great crime problem in this  
nation, the growing crime problem comes from illegal immigration,'' 
said Buchanan, who is making his third bid for president. ``The 
administration has done little or nothing about it'' and 
Republicans won't talk about it, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Texas Gov. George Bush, the frontrunner for the GOP  
presidential nomination, should take a ``more serious view about 
illegal immigration into this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to make it a major issue,'' Buchanan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan pointed to a 14-mile security fence south of San Diego  
``which works, it has stopped illegal immigration.'' He said that 
could be expanded to key crossing points where the flood of illegal 
immigrants is greatest. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't need a security fence across 2,000 miles of border,  
most of which is desert and people come across the border in ones 
or twos and the border patrol can deal with them,'' said Buchanan. 
``You need these security fences, triple-line security fences, 
along the main border crossings where they run in, in the hundreds 
and thousands on the weekends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said that in addition to fencing in ``six or seven  
border crossings,'' the border patrol could be doubled, and a 
tougher policy could be put in place for expelling illegal aliens 
apprehended for other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You expel anyone who is apprehended,'' said Buchanan. ``I  
don't care if it's drunken driving. If there's an illegal alien, 
get him back where he belongs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan made his comments during a taping of Iowa Public  
Television's ``Iowa Press'' program to be aired on Sunday. He was 
hammering at illegal immigration in his latest campaign swing in 
Iowa, where precinct caucuses launch the nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these issues are directly due to a bleeding open border  
where criminals can walk back and forth into the United States,'' 
said Buchanan.

<P>
	``This country has treaties to defend the borders of 50  
countries around the world and we're not even defending the borders 
of the United States of America,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan has long hammered the immigration theme. At one point  
in his 1996 bid, he went to the security fence south of San Diego 
to dramatize his point. 
</P>
<P>
	Some strategists have argued that Republicans make a tactical  
error hammering on illegal immigration because the practice runs 
the risk of offending Hispanics, one of the fastest growing ethnic 
voting groups in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the leading GOP candidate for the  
nomination, avoids immigrant-bashing and pointedly includes a few 
lines in Spanish in his stump speech. 
</P>
<P>
	That drew scorn from Buchanan.  
</P>
<P>
	``First, I wish the governor of Texas would take a more serious  
view about illegal immigration into this country and the problem it 
presents for American citizens,'' said Buchanan. ``It's nice that 
he walks around speaking Spanish, a few words, but in my judgment 
he ought to deal with that problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Buchanan rejected suggestions he was bashing  
immigrants, saying many in the Hispanic community agree with his 
views on illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all children of immigrants, but we all have the right to  
protection in what is our own country,'' said Buchanan.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man whose nickname for himself was  
``Evil'' was executed by injection Wednesday for killing a woman 
during a burglary of her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Fuller, 35, was convicted of killing a 26-year-old woman  
who was stabbed 44 times, beaten, whipped with an electrical cord 
and raped. 
</P>
<P>
	A pathologist determined she likely lived for several hours  
after the 1988 attack but couldn't scream for help because one of 
the stab wounds severed her vocal chords. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the attack, Fuller was on parole for his second  
burglary conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Fuller's accomplices received a life prison term in a  
plea bargain. Charges against a third man were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please do not mourn my death or my life. I hold no bitterness  
toward no one,'' Fuller said in his final statement. ``Just 
remember the light. I'm going to let this light shine. Remember to 
let the light shine.''

<HEADLINE> Martin Undergoes Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Mark Martin underwent surgery  
Wednesday to repair a broken tibia plateau in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASCAR Winston Cup star was hurt in an accident last Friday  
at Daytona International Speedway. The fracture was identified 
during an MRI Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Chuck Kollmer performed arthroscopic surgery in New Smyrna  
Beach, Fla., inserting a screw to hold the tibia in place. Martin 
will continue to wear a leg brace, which will allow him to drive in 
Sunday's race at New Hampshire International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Kollmer assured me that I will be able to drive this  
weekend in New Hampshire,'' Martin said. ``I'll go back to see him 
Monday after the race to evaluate how long I should wear the brace. 
Once I get this taken care of I should be much better since my 
wrist and ribs are already feeling better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash occurred when a tire was cut and the rapid loss of air  
sent Martin's car slamming into the wall. He drove in Saturday 
night's race and finished 17th despite a fractured bone in his left 
wrist, sore ribs and the knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials for Roush Racing said Martin intends to drive the  
entire race on Sunday, but that NASCAR Busch Series driver Matt 
Kenseth will be standing by should a substitute be needed.

<HEADLINE> The Artists: El Nuevo Mundo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The photographer, who has amassed countless  
stories from behind his Nikon, likes to tell of the Salvadorans who 
moved into the Los Angeles bungalow. Behind their front-yard fence, 
encircled by concrete and metal and urbanity, they kept all manner 
of fowl -- until the health department stopped by with a warning. 
</P>
<P>
	The geese were relocated to the park and the duck to the dinner  
table. ``But,'' offers Camilo Jose Vergara, ``they still keep some 
chickens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vergara, a documentary photographer who uses his camera to  
explore the starkness and vibrancy of everyday life, has been 
exploring such corners of Los Angeles' Latino culture for years. 
While he originally went to chronicle poverty, he found instead a 
thriving culture within a culture, a second city with an identity 
all its own. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest photo exhibit, ``El Nuevo Mundo'' (``The New  
World''), on exhibit at the National Design Museum, investigates 
this phenomenon: What happens when an established urban landscape 
meets -- collides with, some might say -- an immigrant population 
insistent on maintaining many traditional folkways. 
</P>
<P>
	``Los Angeles talks about mosaics. There's no mosaic here. This  
is just a big chunk of Mexico and Central America that is there -- 
and is functioning,'' says Vergara, a 55-year-old Chilean immigrant 
who specializes in poking into urban corners and enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you look at something here, you come up with a  
sense of identity,'' he says. ``You can drive for 10 miles in this 
environment; it's so big, you could dump Philadelphia here. And it 
happened in 15 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles he's talking about is one where older buildings  
are retooled, redesigned, even just repainted to fit their new 
Latino owners. Space -- ``transnational space,'' Vergara calls it -- 
is used differently. Distances and proximities between things are, 
to the Anglo eye, a little distorted. Exuberance -- mercantile and 
otherwise -- is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Two ways of life are blending, and the results -- ``material  
objects that bear witness to Latino culture'' -- are always 
fascinating and occasionally even artistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the poetry of the streets,'' Vergara says. ``Everywhere  
you go, you see the hand of people. You have a sense that it was a 
person doing the job, not a machine. You see the place being made. 
And this is a very malleable area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pastiches revealed in his photographs point this up  
dramatically. In one, mattresses are for sale, stacked in the front 
yard of a light-blue bungalow with blue skies beyond. Another 
features an old red van, now used as a food cart, painted with 
house paint. The windshield is used for sign display; the motor has 
been removed so the van can't be stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	One photographed junk heap includes an old airplane; on it, in  
English, someone has written: ``Will it ever fly?'' A junkyard 
truck becomes an ice-cream shop -- another L.A. castaway converted 
into an entrepreneurial accouterment. A man paves over his backyard 
because it's more convenient -- and a step away from the mud of his 
home village in Mexico; another, a gardener, pours water into yard 
dirt and smells it to remind him of home. 
</P>
<P>
	Vergara documents the business of the neighborhoods, too: The  
guy who paints elaborate portraits from snapshots. The barber who 
makes house calls. The woman who operates the clothing store whose 
outside wall is festooned with hanging clothes, both painted and 
real; when a car crashed through the outside wall, she made it into 
a window. The stores, many with elaborately designed, hand-painted 
signs designed to catch the eye and stop the passer-by. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a can-do attitude -- people who are willing to do just  
about anything to make a sale,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	And the patchwork fences in Latino neighborhoods -- ``the  
archaeology of LA,'' Vergara calls them. They are cobbled together 
from scraps of metal, wood and wiring, much of it still bearing the 
sign of its original incarnation (``DiSalvo Trading Company,'' one 
segment says). Everything is game for use and reuse. 
</P>
<P>
	It's about survival in a world that's new to the immigrants but  
also similar; after all, many of them come from only a couple 
hundred miles south, albeit from more rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of this is imposing rural ways on what is a very advanced  
city,'' Vergara says. ``Their ideal is to reconstruct `el 
ranchito,' because that's the way they grew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vergaro is fascinated with what humans infuse into -- and what  
they draw from -- the places they inhabit. 
</P>
<P>
	His best-known project explored how places change over time; for  
it, he photographed buildings and storefronts in New York City over 
two decades. Some improved over time, but many decayed. Both the 
changed and the unchanged told compelling stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Vergara ends ``El Nuevo Mundo'' with more fences -- not in  
neighborhoods but miles south, at the U.S.-Mexico border. One juts 
340 feet into the Pacific Ocean to keep people out, which he finds 
unimaginable. 
</P>
<P>
	His notion: Such approaches won't work forever in a culture  
where people are continually going back and forth, building new 
lives while maintaining strong ties to the culture that produced 
them -- which, after all, isn't really that far away. 
</P>
<P>
	``People come to a place with tradition, a certain rhythm of  
living life. They come to California thinking this used to be OUR 
land, so there's no sense of going to a foreign country,'' Vergara 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``And they ask: What is the way life should be lived? You should  
be close to animals, close to nature. That's what's here. People 
see these pictures and they understand -- it's something that 
they're part of. It's the place that allows you to have these 
experiences, and tells you who you are.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Two Cos. Search for Brazilian Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- U.S. oil giant Texaco Inc. and  
Brazil's Petrobras will jointly search and drill for oil on the 
continental shelf near Rio, the Brazilian company announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are expected tomrrow to sign two contracts worth a  
reported $1.5 billion for exploration and production in the Campos 
Basin, which now produces more than half of Brazil's petroleum, a 
Petrobras spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each company will own 42.5 percent of the venture, but Texaco  
will be the operator, the spokeswoman said. Japanese group Nissho 
Iwai Corp. holds a 12.75 percent stake and Brazil's Odebrecht has 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco was among the big winners in Brazil's auction of 27 oil  
and gas blocks last month, acquiring a share of three areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The stench of spoiling meat rose from small  
groceries left without refrigeration by a heat wave blackout 
Wednesday, as hundreds of police guarded against looting and 
directed traffic down avenues where signal lights were dark. 
</P>
<P>
	Some shops sold durable goods by what light came through doors  
and windows, but other stores remained shuttered in the midst of 
the blackout affecting upper Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost about $500 worth of meat products,'' said Dimitrios  
Tabares, owner of the Tabares grocery store on West 187th Street. 
Employees had to use flashlights to find their way through darkened 
aisles, and the store was selling out of batteries, flashlights and 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
	At La Mundial grocery, thawed chickens spilled out of boxes in  
the basement freezer, where the temperature topped 70 degrees. The 
stench of bad meat wafted from the open freezer door up the rickety 
wooden stairs to the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to lose all the meat,'' manager Reso Infante said.  
</P>
<P>
	The blackout affected 68,000 businesses and households in a  
250-square-block area above Manhattan's 155th Street. 
</P>
<P>
	After two days of record heat and record demand for electricity,  
six of the 14 feeder cables into the area failed, forcing the 
utility company, Consolidated Edison, to shut the rest down Tuesday 
night, spokesman Michael Spall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility hoped to have power completely restored to the area  
by Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 police were sent to patrol the area. Officers reported  
a handful of break-ins and nine arrests, a sharp difference from 
the 1977 blackout that affected the whole city and led to 
widespread looting. 
</P>
<P>
	This power outage left 200,000 people in the dark without air  
conditioners or fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the lights turned off, everyone got scared,'' said  
13-year-old Victor Pena. ``I felt like I was in a maze. I could see 
nothing. But I had to feel my way around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Thelma Goris, said other people also had reason to  
be afraid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard ambulances all night. They were taking old people and  
newborns to the hospital because it was as hot as an oven and they 
couldn't resist the heat,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marielina Bonilla, 18, spent the night sleeping on her  
second-floor fire escape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was scared I might fall asleep and roll off,'' she said.  
``But the alternative was to stay inside, where I was burning.''

<HEADLINE> Jesse Jackson Tours With Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- President Clinton had just finished an  
impassioned call for a sea change in how the government treats 
American Indians when some in the audience began chanting for a man 
who hadn't uttered a word: Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Speak, Jesse Speak!'' a few people called. ``Run, Jesse Run!''  
others said. 
</P>
<P>
	One women just yelled ``Reverend Jackson!'' over and over again.  
</P>
<P>
	This is how it's been since Clinton began his national poverty  
tour in Appalachia three days ago with Jackson at his side. 
</P>
<P>
	It started with ringing applause in Hazard, Ky., to Jackson's  
call to ``keep hope alive,'' and continued through Pine Ridge on 
Wednesday when even Clinton gave a nod to Jackson for helping shape 
his message of economic empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to thank my good friend Jesse Jackson for never letting  
us forget our common obligations,'' Clinton said. Jackson did not 
address the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, their pairing made for interesting political theater.  
Clinton and Jackson may not have literally been competing with each 
other, but their reputations as men of the people certainly were. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not more popular than he is,'' Jackson said as he awaited  
Clinton on the tarmac at South Dakota's Ellsworth Air Force Base. 
``Both of us are well known, but he is the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night in Memphis, Clinton and Jackson went together to  
the civil rights museum in the Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther 
King Jr. was assassinated. After their tour, Jackson grabbed a cell 
phone and called the widow of Ricky Byrdsong, the former 
Northwestern University basketball coach shot to death last week by 
a white supremacist. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jackson finished the conversation, he handed the phone to  
Clinton so he could chat with the slain man's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson tagged along and worked the masses alongside Clinton at  
Ellsworth. On the far edge of the crowd, a woman held up a sign 
that read, ``Jesse Rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She wanted to thank Jackson for bringing the three American  
soldiers back from Yugoslavia unharmed. Jackson kissed her, 
autographed the sign and posed for a picture with her and Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson and Clinton also were side by side with Oglala Lakota  
Sioux on a courtyard at the reservation's high school. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton finished shaking hands, Jackson lingered to play with  
2-year-old Aaron Black Bull. He took Aaron in his arms and carried 
him over to Clinton, who kissed the boy on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men turned to leave - until a woman called, ``Jesse, we  
want to shake your hand.'' Jackson went back to the crowd and so 
did Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	A blue baseball cap labeled, ``Water is Life'' -- which Clinton  
took off and replaced with a black one that read ``Native 
American'' -- somehow found its way onto Jackson's head. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson attributed the attention he has gotten to the fact that  
he has visited the same places during the past year, advocating the 
same sort of economic investment that Clinton now is touting. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, he said, he drummed up votes for Clinton in places like  
Pine Ridge in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a team,'' Jackson said. He likened his alliance with  
Clinton to the interaction between Michael Jordan and Scottie 
Pippen in taking the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have a chemistry, an undeniable chemistry, with the  
people,'' Jackson said of Clinton. ``He's touching a live nerve 
when he's touching the needs of working poor people and the middle 
class at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton left Pine Ridge in his usual limousine. Jackson climbed  
into a van a few vehicles back in the motorcade. The van was called 
``Special 1.''

<HEADLINE> Study Raises Alzheimer's Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Raising hopes of someday preventing Alzheimer's, scientists have  
developed a vaccine that in mice appears to ward off and even 
reduce the brain-clogging deposits that are characteristic of the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	It is uncertain whether the treatment will work in humans, but  
the San Francisco pharmaceutical company behind the research wants 
to test it on people soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Deposits in the brain of a sticky protein called amyloid are one  
of the characteristics of Alzheimer's. The vaccine appears to 
prevent the formation of these so-called plaques in mice that were 
genetically engineered to overproduce amyloid. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Zaven Khachaturian, senior medical adviser to the  
Alzheimer's Association, called the study a landmark. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one can repeat the same phenomenon in humans, it will have  
a very important impact,'' he said. Even if it fails to produce a 
treatment, it introduces the idea of using a vaccination against 
protein deposits, which are associated with a variety of diseases, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no known cure for Alzheimer's, which is believed to  
affect more than 4 million Americans. The patients, most of them 
older than 60, progress from forgetfulness to dementia and usually 
die five to 10 years after diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, published in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature, a team of researchers led by Dale Schenk at Elan Corp. 
tried to trick the immune system of the mice to recognize amyloid 
as a foreign substance that should be attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers injected nine 6-week-old mice with amyloid  
combined with substances that excite the immune system. Seventeen 
other mice of the same age did not get the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	When the mouse brains were dissected after a year, the  
researchers were surprised to find no or very small plaques in the 
injected mice, while the unvaccinated mice had extensive deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers then tried a more ambitious experiment:  
injecting the vaccine into 24 1-year-old mice that already had 
plaques. Twenty-four similar mice did not get the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw that it completely stopped the further progression of  
the disease,'' Schenk said. ``It looks like it might have actually 
diminished the plaques.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elan wants to start trials with people later this year. Schenk  
said that the researchers hope to submit a vaccine to the Food and 
Drug Administration for approval in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are a number of reasons the method may not prevent or  
halt Alzheimer's in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Most important, the amyloid plaques may be a symptom of the  
disease, rather than the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Alzheimer's patients have other changes in the brain that  
the mice do not fully exhibit, such as tangles of protein inside 
nerve cells, according to Dr. Blas Frangione, head of the 
Alzheimer's research unit at the New York University School of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	If the vaccine does work, scientists will face another  
challenge: determining who needs it. While detectable genetic flaws 
cause some Alzheimer's cases, most patients have no such telltale 
markers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are going to have the maximal effect of this, we need to  
find out who has the disease, who is at risk, much earlier,'' 
Khachaturian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neurobiologist Peter St. George-Hyslop at the University of  
Toronto said the study raises the prospect of using immunization to 
treat or prevent other diseases associated with protein deposits. 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the fatal human brain disorder thought 
to be related to mad cow disease, would be a candidate. So would 
Parkinson's disease and myeloma, a form of cancer that overproduces 
protein in bone marrow.

<HEADLINE> Aussies Choose Hewitt for Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Lleyton Hewitt will make his Davis Cup debut when Australia  
faces the United States in this month's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewitt was placed on the team Wednesday, replacing injured Mark  
Philippoussis for the July 16-18 matches in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old player reached the third round at Wimbledon  
before losing to Boris Becker. He joins an Aussie team that also 
features U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter, Todd Woodbridge and 
Mark Woodforde. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewitt and Rafter are expected to play singles. Woodbridge and  
Woodforde, the ``Woodies,'' will play doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team is composed of Pete Sampras, Jim Courier, Todd  
Martin and doubles specialist Alex O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippoussis hurt his knee during his Wimbledon quarterfinal,  
quitting early in the second set against Sampras, the eventual 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippoussis later withdrew from the Davis Cup, prompting  
Rafter to recommend Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not even an issue right now,'' said Rafter, a  
Wimbledon semifinalist. ``He's definitely put the runs on the board 
and I still think he has a chance of playing regardless. I put him 
high on the list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hewitt, a swift, hard-hitting baseliner, began his ascent in  
January 1998. He won a tournament in his hometown of Adelaide to 
become the lowest-ranked player (No. 550) to capture an ATP event. 
He is now ranked No. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Captain Tom Gullikson has not said if Sampras will play singles.  
Courier and Martin led the United States to a 3-2 win over Britain 
in April, inspiring Sampras to play in the next round. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras has said he doesn't want to take a singles spot from  
Courier or Martin, but Martin has offered to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Davis Cup quarterfinals, 1997 French Open champion  
Gustavo Kuerten, a surprise quarterfinalist at Wimbledon, will lead 
Brazil against France. 
</P>
<P>
	Yevgeny Kafelnikov will lead Russia against a Slovak Republic  
team featuring Karol Kucera in Moscow. Belgium and Switzerland meet 
in Brussels.

<HEADLINE>  Kashmir Fighting Escalates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- India captured key mountain peaks Wednesday  
from Pakistan-based Islamic fighters in the battle for Kashmir, 
while Pakistan held off on its promise to withdraw forces from 
Indian territory. 
</P>
<P>
	India blew up an ammunition bunker and captured a third key  
lookout in craggy Himalayan ridges over Kashmir's main highway, 
which is also India's primary military supply route. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Pakistan's pledge to call back the insurgents, an Indian  
commander in the Batalik sector battle zone said there was no sign 
of a rebel retreat. Instead, the rebels attacked positions they had 
lost earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The enemy is giving us stiff resistance,'' said Col. Bikram  
Singh, the Indian military spokesman. Five Pakistani artillery 
shells landed in Kargil town. One shell hit the office of state-run 
All India Radio, killing one policeman, a local commander said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pakistan, defiant government and militant groups waited for  
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to return Thursday from 
London, where Prime Minister Tony Blair encouraged him to fulfill 
the agreement he made with President Clinton in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said Sharif agreed on Sunday that the  
intruding forces would be returned to the Pakistani side of the 
Line of Control, which divides Kashmir between the two 
nuclear-power neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	India says Pakistani troops are leading the rebel forces. The  
Islamabad government, however, denies the Indian claim, but in the 
past has acknowledged its influence over the separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, said Tuesday that  
a request for retreat would have to wait until Sharif returned. But 
he said Pakistan ultimately had no control over the insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
	The militant groups in Pakistan said they would rather die than  
withdraw from their fight to separate Muslim-majority Kashmir from 
Hindu-dominated India. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mujahedeen will fight until the last drop of blood,''  
United Jehad Council chairman Syed Salauddin said in Islamabad. He 
called Sharif's meeting with Clinton a ``stab in the back of the 
Kashmiri freedom struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fiercest fighting so far was under way on icy, knife-edged  
ridges in Batalik, east of Kargil, where Indian soldiers captured 
three heights, two of them Tuesday night and the third on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Delhi, India's Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said  
military operations will continue until all Pakistan-based forces 
that two months ago crossed the 1972 cease-fire line dividing the 
disputed Kashmir region have left. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said India would not accept mediation by a third party.  
</P>
<P>
	India has ruled out a safe passage for nearly 700 Islamic  
fighters who crossed four miles into the cease-fire line. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to find their own way out,'' said Raminder Singh  
Jassal, Indian foreign ministry spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian soldiers said they recovered the bodies of 77 Pakistani  
soldiers this week from the battlefields in the Dras and Batalik 
sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	India says 542 Pakistani soldiers and more than 150 Islamic  
guerrillas have been killed, while 283 Indian soldiers have died, 
451 were wounded and 10 are missing. The figures cannot be 
independently confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Judge Questions Cisneros Over Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge on Tuesday questioned the  
effort by lawyers for former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros to 
prevent tapes secretly recorded by his former lover from being used 
as evidence in his upcoming conspiracy trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eighth day of a pre-trial hearing on the admissibility of  
the tapes, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin again demanded that 
Cisneros' legal team show that the recordings made by Linda Jones 
don't represent what Cisneros actually said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporkin has indicated growing skepticism in recent days over the  
defense's argument that the tapes should be rejected wholesale 
because they bear the signs of some editing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's get down to the brass tacks here,'' Sporkin said  
Tuesday, expressing irritation at the lengthy pre-trial 
maneuverings. ``The relevant issue here is: The statements the 
government wants to put in, are they reliable or aren't they 
reliable?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, tapes of intercepted phone communications may  
not be admitted into evidence if the person doing the taping has an 
unlawful intent in making them. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' attorneys are challenging use of the recordings on two  
grounds: They allege Mrs. Jones was extorting Cisneros for ``hush 
money'' during the period she was taping her phone conversations 
with him; and the tapes are copies, in some cases altered, of 
since-destroyed originals. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' lawyers have not accused Ms. Jones of manufacturing  
conversations by pasting together different sections, and the 
government's tape expert testified he found no evidence of 
splicing. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense, however, asserts that she deleted some passages  
that would show Cisneros in a positive light and eliminated 
sections unfavorable to herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The courts have said if it is not original, if an item has  
been tampered with, it does not come into evidence,'' said Barry 
Simon, one of Cisneros' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Simon forged ahead with his argument that the  
tapes should be thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibit A was a tape recording of a Dec. 3, 1992 phone  
conversation between the two former lovers. While phone company 
records indicate the call lasted 42 minutes, only 20 minutes of the 
conversation were captured on the tape that Ms. Jones provided 
federal investigators, Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' lawyers contend all 88 tapes handed over by Ms. Jones  
-- 26 of which the government is seeking to use at Cisneros' 
September trial -- are inadmissible. Prosecutors say only four of 
the 26 tapes were edited by Ms. Jones, largely to erase her threats 
to Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contends that the pauses reflect instances where she  
was deleting information. Mrs. Jones acknowledged on the witness 
stand that she edited out passages where she threatened to publicly 
reveal Cisneros' payments to her if the money flow stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes are crucial to Independent Counsel David Barrett's  
case that Cisneros, while being considered for a post in the 
Clinton Cabinet, conspired with Ms. Jones to understate his 
payments to her. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros acknowledged during his Cabinet background check that  
he gave her financial support, but prosecutors contend he falsely 
told the FBI he never paid her more than $10,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-count indictment against Cisneros alleges he paid her  
more than $264,000 between 1990 and 1993. He has pleaded innocent.

<HEADLINE> Berlin Power Co. To Cut Jobs, Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The Berlin electrical utility, Bewag,  
said today it will eliminate up to 4,000 jobs, or about half of its 
work force, over the next three years as part of an effort to cut 
costs by $555 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility said pressure to reduce prices required that it cut  
costs to maintain its market share of 80 percent in Berlin and 5 
percent in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Bewag is facing pressure in its home market, with Germany's  
largest utility RWE AG having made Berlin a key expansion target. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Germany's cartel office is considering cases  
against Bewag's refusal to allow third-party access to Berlin's 
power grid. If Bewag loses, it could face heavy competition from 
other producers who stand ready to encroach into the company's home 
market.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nikki McCray scored 16 points, and Chamique  
Holdsclaw added 14 as the Washington Mystics rallied in the second 
half to defeat the New York Liberty, 71-63. 
</P>
<P>
	McCray helped spark a 10-point Washington run early in the  
second half, and Holdsclaw scored 10 of the team's final 23 points 
as the Mystics held on for their second victory of the season over 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	McCray also had nine assists. Holdsclaw was five of seven from  
the field in the second half and also added seven rebounds, taking 
over the game in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Murriel Page added 11 points for Washington, Shalonda Enis had  
10 and Andrea Nagy scored eight, including five of six free throws 
in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mystics wore New York down in the second half by picking up  
the tempo. Liberty point guard Teresa Weatherspoon scored a 
team-high 16 points, but New York had trouble executing its 
half-court offense throughout the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberty made just 11 of 33 field goals in the second half,  
missing several shots from in close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mystics converted 12 of 21 from the field, often coming up  
with easy transition baskets.

<HEADLINE> New Look for All-Star Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This year's All-Star game will have a decidedly  
new look. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three players will make their All-Star debuts next  
Tuesday, many taking the place of familiar names who have been 
slowed by injuries and ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	AL manager Joe Torre and NL manager Bruce Bochy picked their  
pitchers and reserves Wednesday, with Torre selecting four of his 
Yankees and seven newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy will bring Padres pitchers Andy Ashby and Trevor Hoffman  
with him to Fenway Park, along with 16 players who are used to 
getting three days off midway through the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens, Mo Vaughn, Alex Rodriguez, Greg Maddux, Barry  
Bonds and Kevin Brown will have a rare break before starting the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year, you're going to have one or two deserving guys  
out, and that's unfortunate,'' said Rodriguez, who was beaten out 
by New York's Derek Jeter and Cleveland's Omar Vizquel for the 
backup shortstop spots. ``I'm going to take those three days and 
rest my knee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the eight players who signed contracts worth more than  
$40 million this offseason -- Vaughn, Brown and Albert Belle -- won't 
be making the trip to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	In their place are a bunch of newcomers, ranging from  
Baltimore's B.J. Surhoff, whose 855 RBIs in 13 seasons were the 
most by an active player not to make an All-Star team, to Texas 
middle reliever Jeff Zimmerman, who sent faxes to all 30 teams two 
winters ago just for the chance to try out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers were the only team to bite and Zimmerman has made  
the risk pay off, going 7-0 with an 0.94 ERA as a rare All-Star 
middle reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``His numbers are so great that it's really hard to ignore what  
he's done,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmerman is joined by three teammates, first baseman Rafael  
Palmeiro, closer John Wetteland and starting catcher Ivan 
Rodriguez. A fifth Ranger, Juan Gonzalez, said he wouldn't play if 
he wasn't a starter and the AL honored his request. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians, who lead the majors in wins, led both leagues with  
six All-Stars. Vizquel and right-hander Charles Nagy joined four 
starters: first baseman Jim Thome, second baseman Roberto Alomar 
and outfielders Kenny Lofton and Manny Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagy replaced Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, who turned down his  
bid to tend to personal business at home in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champion Yankees, snubbed by the voters for the  
second straight year, still have Jeter, outfielder Bernie Williams 
and pitcher David Cone. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year Diamondbacks also have four All-Stars, followed  
by Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia and San Diego with three each. 
The Padres' Tony Gwynn was elected by the fans but will miss the 
game with a calf injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Clemens nor Vaughn, two prominent former Red Sox who  
left Boston as free agents, were selected. The Red Sox should have 
two starters, shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, the fan's choice, and 
Pedro Martinez (15-2, 2.02 ERA), the likely starting pitcher. 
Second baseman Jose Offerman was selected as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the 30-man NL squad will make its All-Star  
debut next week, with 16 players suiting up for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Networks Near Low-Water Marks / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the major TV networks, it was a week to  
forget. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans didn't spend much of the July Fourth weekend and the  
previous week in front of their TV sets, as NBC set an all-time 
ratings low in prime-time and CBS had its second-lowest week ever. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't say much for its rivals, either, since CBS won the  
week and NBC came in second. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsmagazines, led by ABC's ``20/20'' on June 30, accounted for  
nine of the week's 20 top-rated shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The low ratings were inevitable, said David Poltrack, CBS's top  
researcher. Networks concentrate their best material during the TV 
season that ends in May, and try to drum up more viewer interest as 
the new fall season approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can pretty well predict that the July Fourth weekend will  
be the lowest point every year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's first-place showing came with a 6.1 rating and 13 share,  
followed by NBC's 5.5 rating and 11 share. ABC had a 5.3 rating and 
11 share for the week, Fox was at 3.8 and 11, the WB had a 2.1 and 
4, UPN was at 1.4 and 3 and Pax TV had a 0.7 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
6.9 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 6.7 
rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 6.0 and 
14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of June 28-July 4, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC; ``ABC Monday Night 
Movie: The Stranger Beside Me,'' ABC, 8.6; ``60 Minutes II,'' CBS, 
8.5; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 8.3; Everybody Loves Raymond,'' 
CBS, 8.3; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 8.2; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 8.2; 
``Becker,'' CBS, 7.8; ``20/20-Monday,'' ABC, 7.7; ``60 Minutes,'' 
CBS, 7.7; ``Friends,'' NBC, 7.7.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rican Sentenced for Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A Puerto Rican nationalist convicted of planting  
a bomb that wrecked a car outside an Army recruiting station here 
has been sentenced to 51 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	As Jose Solis Jordan was led from the courtroom Wednesday, more  
than a dozen spectators stood and shouted slogans such as ``Viva 
Puerto Rico'' and ``Puerto Rico libre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have hope that one day the possibility of justice will be  
realized by the people of Puerto Rico,'' Solis told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	He contends he had nothing to do with the bombs, planted in  
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	A 46-year-old former University of Puerto Rico education  
professor, Solis also has a doctoral degree from the University of 
Illinois and once taught Puerto Rican history at DePaul University 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted in March by a federal court jury.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the bombs was disarmed before it could go off. The other  
did not explode but caught fire, destroying a Marine Corps car. 
</P>
<P>
	In a December referendum, 46.5 percent of Puerto Rico's voters  
backed statehood while just 2.5 percent supported independence. But 
50.3 percent voted for ``none of the above'' -- a protest against 
what critics described as ballot language skewed in favor of 
statehood.

<HEADLINE> Man Awarded $1M in Wis. Hazing Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCONTO, Wis. (AP) -- A computer analyst who was spanked by his  
boss with a carpenter's level as part of a company hazing has been 
awarded $1 million by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Smith, 36, and his wife, were awarded the punitive  
damages for the humiliation and injuries he said he suffered at 
Phillips Getschow Co. The July 1 verdict was released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who joined the mechanical contractor company in 1995,  
said the company's chief executive officer, Kurt Getschow, told him 
to report for a ``weighing-in ceremony'' and made him stand in the 
center of a room. 
</P>
<P>
	He then hit Smith ``with great force'' across the buttocks with  
a 4-foot-long carpenter's level. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the incident left him with physical injuries,  
emotional distress, embarrassment and humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Getschow had said he went through a similar ``spoof'' two  
decades ago and pointed out that Smith never sought treatment for 
the injuries.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players To Face Marijuana Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Marijuana testing is coming to the NBA,  
and the players' union wants its rank and file to know the time to 
stop partying is now. 
</P>
<P>
	Player representatives for the 29 teams were told at the union's  
annual meeting to spread the word to their teammates about the 
league's new drug policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Since marijuana can stay in a person's system for two to three  
months, players who use it in July run a risk of getting caught in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think that if guys are using, they got the message  
last year that they'll be tested,'' Tyrone Corbin of the Atlanta 
Hawks said Wednesday. ``Some guys, just like society in general, 
don't get the message until they're caught. Hopefully, they'll get 
this message and it won't put their careers in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steroids were also added to the league's banned substances list  
during the last collective bargaining negotiations, and all players 
will be tested when training camps open in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookies will be tested four times a season on a random basis.  
</P>
<P>
	``When the testing comes, the proof will be in the pudding,''  
said union director Billy Hunter, who scoffed at a report in 1997 
saying about 70 percent of the league's players either use 
marijuana or are heavy drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
	A player also can be tested during the regular season if an  
arbitrator decides, after a hearing, there is reasonable cause to 
believe a player has used, possessed or distributed any prohibited 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
	Many players taking part in the union meeting said there are a  
number of marijuana users, although the total is nothing close to 
70 percent of the player population. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players, including Chris Webber, Mookie Blaylock, Vernon  
Maxwell and J.R. Rider, have been arrested on marijuana-related 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento Kings guard Jason Williams was kicked off his college  
team at Florida for testing positive for marijuana twice. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players who test positive at training camp must undergo a  
mandatory counseling program. A second positive test brings a 
$15,000 fine, and any third or subsequent positive test results in 
a five-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA is like any industry, there's going to be people on  
drugs,'' Jim McIlvaine of the New Jersey Nets said. ``As role 
models, people need to know that we don't condone its use. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly there are guys out there using, and hopefully  
they'll get the message that they have to stop,'' McIlvaine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties for such illegal narcotics as cocaine, heroin and PCP  
are much more severe. A positive drug test -- or a conviction or 
guilty plea to a crime involving one of those drugs -- can lead to 
disqualification from the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone testing positive for steroids gets a five-game suspension  
for the first offense, a 10-game suspension for a second offense 
and a 25-game suspension for a third offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Androstenedione, the testosterone-producing substance taken by  
baseball slugger Mark McGwire and others, is not on the NBA's list 
of banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a very big problem in the league,'' said  
Corbin, who was at Vancouver's airport in 1997 when Blaylock, his 
Hawks teammate, was found to be carrying marijuana by a 
drug-sniffing dog. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Schayes of the Orlando Magic said reports of widespread  
usage are overblown. However, he said drug use -- and not just 
marijuana -- was a serious problem when he entered the league in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything going on today is mild compared to 20 years ago,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> US Wants Mercury Out of Vaccines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is about to ask manufacturers  
to remove from vaccines a type of mercury used as a preservative 
since the 1940s, citing concern that small infants now need so many 
immunizations that they may get too much of the chemical, The 
Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents should not worry -- or delay getting their children  
properly vaccinated -- because the move concerning the preservative 
thimerosal is strictly a precaution, vaccine experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While our immunization practices to date are safe, we have the  
opportunity to increase that margin of safety,'' said Dr. Louis Z. 
Cooper, a Columbia University professor and member of the board of 
directors of the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential that children continue to receive all vaccines  
according to currently recommended schedules,'' added Surgeon 
General David Satcher. ``The risk of devastating childhood diseases 
from failure to vaccinate far outweighs the minimal, if any risk, 
risk of exposure to cumulative levels of thimerosal in vaccines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thimerosal is an organic form of mercury also commonly found in  
eyedrops and contact-lens solutions -- not the same type of mercury 
that causes poisonings during industrial accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Thimerosal is effective at preventing bacterial contamination of  
certain vaccines. It isn't needed in all vaccines, including those 
made of live viruses, but it is present in vaccines against 
hepatitis B, whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus and bacterial 
meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
	The thimerosal levels in any one shot are tiny.  
</P>
<P>
	But ensuring those levels stay low is important because very  
high amounts of mercury may cause brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last month, the government notified vaccine experts that if  
infants younger than 6 months receive a number of 
thimerosal-containing vaccines during the same doctor's visit, the 
thimerosal levels could add up enough that small babies might 
temporarily hit the Environmental Protection Agency's precautionary 
limit on mercury exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA's limit is well below the mercury level the Food and  
Drug Administration and other health agencies consider dangerous, 
an official familiar with the issue told the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, because doctors want to avoid as much mercury as  
possible, the FDA is about to tell vaccine manufacturers to replace 
thimerosal with other preservatives, said the official, who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the American Academy of Pediatrics is preparing its  
own precautionary recommendation: That if new mothers are proven to 
be free of the liver virus hepatitis B, their newborns can safely 
postpone getting a hepatitis B vaccine until they're a few months 
older. When babies are older and bigger, the mercury amounts are 
too small to have an effect, explained Dr. Jon Abramson of Wake 
Forest University, the academy's infectious disease chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the vaccines are safe and we don't want parents to  
worry, but if you're going to worry about anyone, it's a very 
small, premature baby,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Most pregnant women today are tested for hepatitis B. Mothers  
with the disease have a 90 percent chance of infecting their new 
babies, so those infants need the vaccine at birth or in the first 
few weeks of life, Abramson stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	How quickly vaccine manufacturers will find substitutes for  
thimerosal is in question. A spokesman for one, SmithKline Beecham 
Pharmaceuticals, called it ``premature for us to comment.''

choosing to seek election from a state where she has never lived or

important than where I am from.'' She is the only first lady ever 
to seek public office. Mrs. Clinton plans a four-day swing through

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO and U.N. officials said today  
that violence in Kosovo has declined sharply since peacekeepers 
arrived and it soon will be up to Kosovars to keep the peace 
themselves. But NATO troops remain essential for maintaining the 
peace, as evidenced today when a large, well-armed escort by French 
soldiers and police prevented violence from erupting during a march 
by ethnic Albanians through the Serb-held section of the divided 
city of Kosovska Mitrovica. Of an estimated 860,000 Albanians who 
fled or were expelled from Kosovo during the conflict, more than 
600,000 have returned since NATO peacekeepers began arriving June 
12.

he was owed at least $250 million by the entertainment giant. Terms 
of the settlement weren't disclosed. Katzenberg, who left his post 
of studio chief at Disney in 1994 after he was denied a promotion, 
sued claiming the company owed him a 2 percent bonus from profits 
for shows produced during his tenure and future profits of all 
films. Disney had argued that Katzenberg forfeited that bonus

<HEADLINE> Waste Management Shares Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Shares in Waste Management Inc. plunged 37  
percent Wednesday after the largest U.S. trash hauler warned both 
quarterly and year-end earnings will fall at least 10 percent short 
of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management said Tuesday night that a $250 million  
shortfall in its core solid waste business would result in 
second-quarter earnings per share in the range of 67 to 70 cents, 
compared to the 78 cents per share projected by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, the company projected earnings of $2.65 per share,  
well short of the $3.02 predicted by analysts polled by First Call 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston company's stock price closed down $19.62 1/2 to $33.93 3/4  
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Both revised figures would be increases from last year, when  
Waste Management earned 41 cents per share in the second quarter 
and $1.82 for the year. But the new estimates fall well short of 
the company's own expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we are disappointed with the revised projections, we  
remain proud of our accomplishments over the past 12 months,'' 
Waste Management chief executive officer Rodney Proto said. ``And 
the fact that the new full-year 1999 earnings expectation still 
represents a minimum of 46 percent improvement over comparable 1998 
results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melville Cody, an analyst with Sanders Morris Mundy, said  
Wednesday that the loss stems from an unexpected downturn in June, 
normally a busy month when business is supposed to increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they lost some business from price increases, but  
there could be a service component involved,'' she said. ``They've 
cut $800 million in costs out of the company and let some people 
go, and it's possible customers were not getting the service they 
were accustomed to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proto said the company is investigating the causes of the  
shortfall and will provide more details when it formally releases 
its earnings report on Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody also said the company might have been too optimistic about  
quickly integrating its new components after Houston-based USA 
Waste Services and Oak Brook, Ill.-based Waste Management closed a 
$13.5 billion merger last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company retained the Waste Management name, though USA Waste  
effectively gained control of its larger but struggling former 
rival. The combined company then bought Mt. Laurel, N.J.-based 
Eastern Environmental Services Inc. in late 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tremendous undertaking to do it all (both mergers) in  
one year,'' Cody said. ``They probably set their sights too high 
and set expectations on Wall Street too high.''

<HEADLINE> Palmer To Play at Senior Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Fans, golfers and organizers all  
felt the disappointment when Jack Nicklaus withdrew from the U.S. 
Senior Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Palmer did his best to ease it.  
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who at 69 still retains the aura that made him one of  
the nation's most popular sports figures, drew a huge throng of 
fans as he played a practice round at the Des Moines Golf and 
Country Club on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had not been sure if Palmer would make it because he  
has been bothered by a pulled muscle in his rib cage. But Palmer 
said he never wavered in his commitment to play the 72-hole 
tournament, which begins Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no doubt in my mind,'' he said. ``I had some problem  
I had treated. I feel fine. I was going to play with or without 
that problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, one of Palmer's few rivals in worldwide golf acclaim,  
decided not to play because of an aching left hip. 
</P>
<P>
	He had the hip replaced on Jan. 27 and returned to tournament  
play in May. But Nicklaus hasn't played competitively since 
withdrawing after 45 holes of the Senior Players Championship two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The hip hurt so much in that tournament that Nicklaus had to  
ride in a cart before withdrawing because he was in so much pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hip is starting to feel good,'' he said. ``But I think it  
would be wise on my part to wait a week or so to test it again. I'm 
very eager to play golf, but I just don't think I should right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, 59, won the U.S. Senior Open in 1991 and 1993. His  
last victory on the Senior Tour came at The Tradition in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think to a man we're disappointed that Jack is not playing  
and to a man we hope that he recovers quickly,'' defending champion 
Hale Irwin said. ``Certainly the U.S. Open is not complete without 
Jack being in there. 
</P>
<P>
	``But at the same time, I think we're going to have a wonderful  
tournament without Jack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer certainly brought plenty of luster with his appearance at  
the biggest golf event ever to hit Iowa. Fans lined two and three 
deep behind the ropes begged Palmer for an autograph as he walked 
from the driving range to the chipping green, with several 
reporters and TV cameras following along. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does this mean I'm in Arnie's Army?'' one reporter asked.  
</P>
<P>
	By mid-afternoon on a perfect summer day, an estimated 5,000  
fans were walking the course with Palmer, who said he wasn't there 
just for practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come all the way from Latrobe, Pa., to Des Moines,  
Iowa, not to play,'' Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer also said he was impressed with the crowds. The  
tournament was sold out in advance for the first time in the 
20-year history of the Senior Open and the attendance for Tuesday's 
practice round was estimated at 27,000. About 25,000 showed up for 
Monday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great the USGA has seen fit to bring the Open  
here,'' Palmer said. ``I think they should do more things like this 
to spread the championships around. It's good for golf.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Enjoying the Soccermania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- When the United States and China trot  
onto the Rose Bowl field Saturday for the Women's World Cup final, 
it will conclude an unprecedented chapter in American sports 
history. Call it Soccermania '99. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium will be filled -- organizers put another 3,000-5,000  
seats on sale Tuesday, meaning a crowd between 88,000 and 90,000 
can be expected. Young girls with red-white-and-blue painted faces 
will be in the stands. American flags will wave everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the Olympics would seem capable of such a scene, and the  
1996 Atlanta Games came close. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympics is about the patriotic USA,'' Tiffeny Milbrett  
said. ``It's people going to games because it's the Olympics. If we 
have success, they will also come; I think that showed in the 
numbers, when we had 25,000 for an early Olympic game and then sold 
out the final. But it was not just a soccer crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``But 79,000 at the opener says they knew about our soccer and  
they wanted to come and watch soccer, watch women's soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some perceived the '96 Olympics as a watershed for women's  
sports in this country. The soccer team shared the spotlight with 
the U.S. basketball, softball and gymnastics teams that also won 
gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the Americans and Chinese and Brazilians are selling  
soccer -- and selling out major league stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``This event has done better than anyone could have expected,''  
Milbrett said. ``I'm shocked at how massive it has been. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it would be huge and we felt it would be OK if we have  
maybe 40,000 fans at the games. But we never thought of anything 
like sellouts at every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's more than the crowds at games that has turned this  
tournament into a phenomenon. It's the affability of the players. 
And their accessibility. Not to mention their soccer ability. 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, they're reaching rock star status. Young fans  
chant their names, squeal in their presence and even chase their 
bus. Homemade signs paying tribute to each of the players appear 
not just at the games, but at practices, where hundreds of fans 
routinely turn out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' laughed Tisha Venturini, ``we see those signs saying  
`I Love Tisha' or whoever, and everyone gives each other grief 
about it. Then there's a sign for somebody else, a sign about each 
of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National television has discovered them -- and not just  
SportsCenter or Lifetime Channel. ``CBS Evening News'' was on hand 
at Tuesday's practice at Pomona Pitzer College. David Letterman 
hopped aboard the bandwagon before the World Cup began, and now 
he's ready to drive it straight to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who attended the quarterfinal win over  
Germany at Landover, Md., decided Tuesday to extend his seven-state 
trip across the country through the weekend so he can attend the 
final. In 1994, Clinton went to the World Cup opener in Chicago and 
Vice President Gore went to the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has moved the game into the mainstream,'' coach Tony  
DiCicco said. ``It's no longer just the little girls who play 
soccer who are excited about it. I think all of America is excited 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brandi Chastain knew the excitement would come if only her team  
was given the opportunity to spark it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been excited by the tournament and overwhelmed by the  
response,'' Chastain said. ``I knew there was a special package we 
had to offer, and now we are getting a chance to present it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America is soaking it up.

<HEADLINE> Pregnant Woman Awakens From Coma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Maria Lydia Hernandez Lopez had been in a  
coma for a month. Doctors didn't expect her or the twins in her 
womb to survive. Her family prepared to remove life support and 
called in a priest. 
</P>
<P>
	As he prayed, Mrs. Lopez suddenly coughed and moved.  
</P>
<P>
	Reflexes, doctors said. A sign from God, relatives insisted, and  
decided to continue her care. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the 25-year-old woman is awake and can communicate by  
wiggling her fingers. She gave birth to two girls last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were there from the beginning to now, it's just very  
awesome,'' her sister Adela Hernandez said Wednesday. ``It is a 
miracle. We just thank God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Mrs. Lopez began complaining of headaches. Doctors  
blamed them on her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 24, she had trouble breathing and slipped into the coma  
in an ambulance on the way to the hospital. It turned out that a 
blood vessel had popped inside her brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lopez has a condition called arteriovenous malformation, in  
which people are born with malformed or tangled blood vessels in 
the brain. Over time, the vessels can pressure neural tissue or 
rupture. 
</P>
<P>
	At the University of California Medical Center in Los Angeles,  
she underwent embolization, in which doctors inject a glue-like 
substance to cut the blood flow to the tangled vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	``For three weeks she didn't get any better,'' said her  
neurosurgeon, John Frazee. ``I was having discussions with her 
family about the chances of her recovering. ... I didn't think she 
would wake up to take care of herself, let alone take care of her 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-May, the family was about to remove life support. Then  
she moved. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw that, I knew she was not gone. That was a sign for  
me,'' Hernandez said. ``That's where my faith came in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intensive care continued, including a procedure to drain fluid  
from her brain in early June, just before she slowly began to 
regain consciousness and respond to simple commands. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, on June 9, she awoke. Six days later, she delivered  
twins. Arizandy Leann was released from the hospital Saturday and 
Brianna Angel was expected to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lopez, who underwent further brain surgery last week, is  
slowly recovering, Frazee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've given up making predictions,'' Frazee said. ``The fact  
that she is continuing to rapidly improve after this surgery leads 
me to be hopeful that she can do normal things. It will take 
several months for that to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one knows for sure,'' he added, ``but that's certainly  
possible.''

<HEADLINE> Delta No. 1 at Bumping Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines ranks first among major carriers  
when it comes to bumping passengers involuntarily from overbooked 
flights, according to government data. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures released Tuesday by the Transportation Department show  
the number of passengers bumped involuntarily by Delta soared 
during the first three months of 1999, The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based airline had 8,144 involuntary bumpings from  
January through March, nearly as many as the other nine major 
carriers combined. Southwest had the second highest with 1,938 
involuntary bumpings. 
</P>
<P>
	Involuntary bumpings occur when airlines overbook flights to  
guard against passengers who don't show up, and then can't find 
enough volunteers to give up their seats and take a later flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta's rate of involuntary bumpings was 3.33 per 10,000  
passengers in the first quarter, worst in the industry, according 
to the figures. TWA was second worst, with a rate of 2.56 per 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta spokesman Bill Berry said a pilot sickout at American  
Airlines in February may have led to the increased bumpings as 
Delta tried to absorb stranded travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't want to use excuses,'' Berry said. ``The hard fact  
is, we're by no means satisfied, and we have a high-level team 
working on changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said Delta had ordered new computer software to help  
manage overbooking, but that it had been delayed, adding to the 
bumping problem. The software won't be used until later this year, 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Are Mostly Lower / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices were mostly lower Wednesday in quiet  
trading as demand slipped due to a slew of upcoming corporate bond 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/8 point,  
or $1.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 6.04 percent from Tuesday's 6.03 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Treasurys ended lower for the second straight day, as  
investors prepared for a number of upcoming offerings by corporate 
and agency issuers. Among those companies selling debt are Ford 
Motor Co. and its Ford Motor Credit Co. financing unit, which are 
expected to price up to $7.5 billion in debt later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for corporate bonds lowers demand for government bonds  
because corporate offerings generally have higher yields. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged, and intermediate maturities were unchanged to down 
3/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
rose to 4.64 percent while the discount fell 0.05 percentage point 
to 4.52 percent compared with their auction price late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields were 4.70 percent, as the discount fell 0.03  
percentage point to 4.53 percent from their auction rate Tuesday. 
One-year yields slipped to 5.00 percent as the discount fell 0.03 
percentage point to 4.76 percent from Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged at 4.94 percent from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/16 point to 118 17/32. The average 
yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.55 percent from late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Feds Charge Boeing With Interfering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is accusing Boeing Co. of  
interfering with enforcement of affirmative action and 
nondiscrimination requirements for federal contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints filed by the Labor Department against the  
Seattle-based aircraft maker and defense contractor claim that 
Boeing refused federal inspectors access to records and facilities 
in Seattle, Wichita, Kan., and Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said her agency ``must -- and is  
entitled to -- have reasonable access to the premises and records of 
companies which benefit from doing business with the federal 
government. Denying us that access cannot -- and will not -- be 
tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing officials said the company is trying to be cooperative  
but called some of the government's requests ``unreasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The company has been and is cooperating with the agency in a  
number of ongoing audits and investigations and will continue to do 
so,'' said Boeing spokesman Peter Conte. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that Boeing has withheld data from the agency,  
it has done so based upon its good-faith belief that the request is 
either unreasonable or exceeds the scope of the Office of Federal 
Contracting Compliance Programs' authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department charges were filed on Tuesday with federal  
administrative law judges, who offer a first avenue of recourse for 
government agencies outside the normal court system. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency contends that Boeing has disrupted its investigation  
of a class-action complaint alleging race discrimination filed by 
an employee of a commercial aircraft facility in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The employee is among black Boeing workers who filed a lawsuit  
contending they were treated with hostility and were passed over 
for promotions that went to less-qualified white workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two government complaints charge Boeing with failure  
to cooperate in routine compliance reviews at commercial aircraft 
and military space and defense facilities in Wichita and at a 
training facility in Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	With $11 billion in government business last year and 230,000  
workers nationwide, Boeing is the second-largest defense contractor 
after Lockheed Martin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal contractors that interfere with nondiscrimination or  
affirmative action rules enforced by Labor's Office of Federal 
Contract Compliance Programs can have contracts canceled or be 
barred from doing future business with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Conte said Boeing officials hope the dispute can be resolved  
informally. ``If necessary, however, Boeing is prepared to defend 
its positions vigorously and believes it will ultimately prevail,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Heat Toll Hits Poor, Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For most people heat waves merely mean  
discomfort or inconvenience, but they can also kill by the 
thousands -- mostly poor and elderly victims with bodies unable to 
cope with the temperature or wallets unable to afford the costs of 
cooling. 
</P>
<P>
	Only winter's cold kills more people, year after year, than  
heat. Tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes are less 
deadly, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1979 through 1996, a yearly average of 381 people died of  
heat in the United States, the federal Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention in Atlanta said. It calculated 6,864 heat deaths in 
that time span. 
</P>
<P>
	And the heat wave now baking much of the nation promises to add  
to the toll. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 40-year period from 1936 through 1975, almost 20,000  
people were killed in the United States by the effects of heat and 
solar radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	A sizzling July in 1901 baked the Midwest, claiming more than  
9,500 lives, according to a report in NOAA, the former magazine of 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That easily 
exceeds the death toll of 6,000 from a hurricane a year earlier 
that struck Galveston, Texas, often cited as the deadliest weather 
event of the 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1906 an earthquake and fire in San Francisco claimed 452  
lives - fewer than Los Angeles-area heat waves that caused 546 
deaths in 1939, 946 in 1955, and 580 in 1963, a study in the 
journal Environmental Research found. 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe the tolls are understated, listing only those who  
succumb directly to temperature-related conditions such as 
heatstroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can know how many more deaths are advanced by heat wave  
weather, how many diseased or aging hearts surrender that under 
better conditions would have continued functioning,'' the National 
Weather Service reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Indirect casualties can be staggering, with the stress leading  
to a jump in deaths from heart attacks and other causes. During a 
1966 heat wave, the mortality rate more than doubled in New York 
City and leaped fivefold in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control noted that age is a major factor  
in succumbing to the heat; half the victims are 65 or over. 
</P>
<P>
	Some deaths can be attributed to lack of air conditioning in a  
city where the weather is usually cooler. Others can be traced to 
power outages. Many occur simply because people don't consider the 
danger of heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Many who died in the 1995 Chicago heat wave were frail,  
frightened or alone. Some died behind boarded windows, their fear 
of intruders contributing to their demise. Others lost their lives 
when no one came to check on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities are particularly dangerous in heat waves. Paving and  
buildings absorb heat and warm the temperature, and air movement is 
restricted by buildings.

<HEADLINE>  Football DT's Gift Made Into Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Daniel Huffman watches on the sidelines of a high  
school football field as movie stars film a scene in ``The Daniel 
Huffman Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too strange,'' the Florida State student says.  
</P>
<P>
	Not many 20-year-olds have movies made about them. But not many  
did what Huffman did -- give up his football career by donating a 
kidney to his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffman's act of love occurred three years ago. That was the  
summer before his senior year at high school in Rossville, Ill., 
the small town where his grandparents raised him following his 
parents' divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	His grandmother, Shirlee, badly needed a kidney transplant.  
There were fears she might die while waiting, perhaps more than a 
year for a suitable donated kidney. 
</P>
<P>
	So Daniel decided to make the donation himself, even though  
losing one of his two kidneys meant he would have to give up 
football and other contact sports forever. He was a starting 
defensive tackle on the Rossville team, and had to shelve plans to 
play in college. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, there's been a lot of good news for Huffman. His  
grandmother is now healthy, and he got a full scholarship to 
Florida State as a student trainer with the football team. That 
deal came thanks to Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden, who first heard 
Huffman's story when each of them was honored at a football awards 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Huffman is the subject of a movie being filmed in Toronto:  
``A Gift of Love: The Daniel Huffman Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is to be televised on the Showtime cable network this fall,  
although producer Daniel Paulson said it also might be released in 
movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulson said he immediately envisioned a film after reading  
about Huffman's saga. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is worried these days about young people and drugs  
and sex and violence, and President Clinton says Hollywood is not 
doing its part,'' Paulson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a movie that really goes against that grain -- it's a  
true profile in courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huffman is played by Elden Henson, one of the stars of the  
``Mighty Ducks'' movies. The grandmother is played by Debbie 
Reynolds, whose preparations included a visit to the Huffman home 
in Rossville that set the small town agog. 
</P>
<P>
	``My grandma was just completely thrilled,'' Huffman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Huffman was invited to the Toronto set this week, and has had a  
chance to meet Henson, Reynolds and others involved in the 
production. He and his fiance even were allowed to be extras in a 
scene showing fans watching a Rossville football game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a great time,'' Huffman said. ``Talking to the  
actors portraying your life -- it's unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He praised Henson's performance, offering just one  
tongue-in-cheek suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he should make the hits harder -- make me look mean.''  
</P>
<P>
	Also on hand was Bowden, who plays himself in the movie. He  
almost turned down the role to preserve his family's summer 
vacation, but decided he owed it to Huffman and to the school to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a kid -- he probably had a future in football, and he  
gave up his kidney for his grandmother,'' Bowden said. ``You don't 
see young people doing things like that -- I just never heard of 
anything more valiant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huffman, who will be a junior this fall, said he enjoys his work  
with the Florida State team, which enables him to travel with the 
squad on road games. Bowden suggested Huffman might have a future 
as a professional sports trainer, but Huffman said he is enjoying 
being an English major and might have a try as a sports publicist. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the movie, Huffman hopes it moves those who see it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it will make people think more about organ donation,''  
he said. ``They'll become more educated about it and sign organ 
donor cards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He insists his act was not as heroic as his admirers contend.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you love someone and you can help them, any way you can,  
you're going to do it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Football DT's Gift Made Into Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Daniel Huffman watches on the sidelines of a high  
school football field as movie stars film a scene in ``The Daniel 
Huffman Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too strange,'' the Florida State student says.  
</P>
<P>
	Not many 20-year-olds have movies made about them. But not many  
did what Huffman did -- give up his football career by donating a 
kidney to his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffman's act of love occurred three years ago. That was the  
summer before his senior year at high school in Rossville, Ill., 
the small town where his grandparents raised him following his 
parents' divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	His grandmother, Shirlee, badly needed a kidney transplant.  
There were fears she might die while waiting, perhaps more than a 
year for a suitable donated kidney. 
</P>
<P>
	So Daniel decided to make the donation himself, even though  
losing one of his two kidneys meant he would have to give up 
football and other contact sports forever. He was a starting 
defensive tackle on the Rossville team, and had to shelve plans to 
play in college. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, there's been a lot of good news for Huffman. His  
grandmother is now healthy, and he got a full scholarship to 
Florida State as a student trainer with the football team. That 
deal came thanks to Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden, who first heard

<HEADLINE> Oneida Rejects Libbey's Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ONEIDA, N.Y. (AP) -- Oneida Ltd.'s board has rejected the latest  
buyout offer from rival glass tableware maker Libbey Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The board, which called Libbey's offer an attempt to gain inside  
information at Oneida, also announced Tuesday that it had 
authorized the repurchase of another 500,000 of its 17 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey raised its offer for Oneida to $37.50 a share, or about  
$637 million, in late June. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Libbey's third attempt since 1995 to gain control the  
world's largest silverware maker, a strong rival in making 
glassware and other table-top products. 
</P>
<P>
	Oneida board members said they rejected the proposal because it  
included ``substantial contingencies and uncertainties'' including 
concerns over financing and anti-trust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Oneida rejected the two previous offers. At the company's annual  
meeting May 26, Chief Executive Officer Peter Kallet said the 
118-year-old company wants to remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey believes the merged companies would have been more  
profitable. Libbey first approached Oneida about merging in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey, a leading glassware maker based in Toledo, Ohio, had  
revenues of $439.5 million last year with profits of $25.4 million, 
down 30 percent from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Oneida Ltd. last year had sales of $465.9 million, but after  
years of growth, profits fell 32 percent. That prompted the company 
to restructure and lay off 300 workers since January while closing 
two foreign plants.

<HEADLINE> Deaths Increase at Start of Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The number of deaths in the United States rises at the start of  
every month and drops at the end, and addicts spending their 
first-of-the-month government checks on drugs and drink probably 
account for most of the difference, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	University of California-San Diego sociologist David P. Phillips  
and colleagues reached that conclusion after analyzing nearly 32 
million electronic death certificates over 15 years. The study was 
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers suggested that addicts get aid that can be used  
only for food, clothes and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wouldn't do that for the country as a whole. But you could  
try it out for a pilot project and see if it would make any 
difference,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips found that, during an average year, there were 4,320  
more deaths in the first week of every month than in the last week 
of the preceding month. 
</P>
<P>
	That's about a 1 percent difference. But the gap widened when  
the researchers looked at killings, suicides or accidents in which 
drugs or drink played a part. 
</P>
<P>
	For every 100 such deaths at the end of a month, there were 106  
or 107 at the start. And the difference doubled, to about 14, when 
the death certificates listed both drugs and alcohol as a cause. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 106.5 homicides at the start of the month for every  
100 at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also did a breakdown by race and found that  
during the first week of the month vs. the last week, there were 
nearly 29 extra homicides, suicides and accidents involving 
substance abuse among minorities, compared with 10 extra such 
deaths among whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Welfare, Social Security and veterans benefit checks are sent  
out at the start of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	The study ``really highlights the extraordinary toll of  
substance abuse,'' said Lisa Najavits, a professor of psychology at 
Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips got the idea for his study from a 1995 report on 105  
schizophrenic cocaine addicts treated at a Los Angeles veterans 
hospital. They were most likely to test positive for cocaine, to 
have their worst psychiatric symptoms and to need psychiatric 
hospitalization during the first week of each month, and least 
likely during the last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wondering if the findings apply to the general population,  
Phillips and his colleagues looked at deaths from 1973 through 
1988. (The electronic death data provided by the National Center 
for Health Statistics after 1988 include only the month of death, 
not the date.) 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said some people may object that giving addicts  
``in-kind'' aid rather than money is treating them like children. 
</P>
<P>
	``But for people who do have drug and alcohol habits, that  
person is not making the decision himself how to use the money. His 
habit is making that decision for him,'' he said. ``Why should one 
feed his habit by giving him extra money for it?''

<HEADLINE> Ore. Authorities Taped Kinkel Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A sheriff's office taped jailhouse  
conversations between a school-shooting suspect and his pastor, 
despite having been found in violation of the U.S. Constitution in 
a similar case several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lane County Sheriff's office in Eugene said Tuesday it taped  
three conversations between pastor Albert Gaines and Kip Kinkel, 
16, who is charged with shooting to death his parents and then 
opening fire at his high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Two students were killed at Thurston High School in Springfield  
on May 21, 1998, and two dozen others were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane County District Attorney F. Douglass Harcleroad said he had  
not signed off on the recordings, which were done with family 
members or friends of Kinkel's present. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never authorized, approved or sanctioned the taping of  
a clergy person talking to Mr. Kinkel nor has any of my staff,'' 
Harcleroad wrote in a July 2 letter to a circuit judge. ``The 
sheriff's office employees acted on their own ... I am deeply 
disturbed and frustrated that this incident has occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the tapes will not be used in the case against Kinkel.  
</P>
<P>
	The taping comes three years after law-enforcement authorities  
were criticized for illegally recording a jailhouse confession 
between triple-murder suspect Conan Wayne Hale and his priest. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hale was later convicted and the tapes were never used  
in his trial, the surreptitious taping brought widespread 
condemnation from religious leaders and free-speech advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Lane County agreed to pay $25,000 to settle a claim  
brought by the Rev. Timothy Mockaitis, who argued that his civil 
rights had been violated by the recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	Harcleroad was found to have violated the U.S. Constitution when  
he authorized the recordings. Hale was sentenced to death in the 
killing of three teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled that the recordings violated the  
Fourth Amendment, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the 
Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court ruling bars taping of conversations with  
clergy only ``when such members are serving their professional 
capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's office sometimes records conversations between  
inmates and visitors that take place in a secure booth. Sheriff's 
officials said they assumed the rules allowed them to record 
conversations that are social in nature, including when a clergyman 
is involved. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Capt. Paul Sachet, Gaines had said his visit was a  
social one. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Castagna, executive director and legal counselor of the  
Oregon Catholic Conference, said the nature of a conversation could 
quickly turn to legally protected subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the sheriff starts up the tape recorder, you can't tell  
what direction their visit will take,'' Castagna said.

<HEADLINE>  Rivera Passes Up All-Star Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- New York Yankees reliever Mariano Rivera, who was  
picked by manager Joe Torre for the American League All-Star game, 
took himself off the squad for undisclosed personal reasons 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said Cleveland right-hander Charles Nagy would take  
Rivera's place on the AL roster. 
</P>
<P>
	During a brief news conference in the visitors' clubhouse at  
Tiger Stadium, Rivera said he had been planning for some time to 
fly home to Panama to tend to personal business. He declined to 
elaborate, but said it didn't involve his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor for me to be taken on the All-Star team,'' said  
Rivera, who is fourth in the AL with 24 saves. ``But, I've got to 
take care of this problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts, because I wanted to be there (July 13 in Boston).  
But, I spoke to Joe and he understands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre confirmed that he had known of Rivera's decision for more  
than 24 hours. He said he called the right-hander into his office 
before Tuesday night's 9-8 victory over Detroit in 10 innings. 
Rivera told him then that he couldn't accept, yet his name was 
released with the rest of the squad anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was troubled that he had to do this,'' Torre said. ``But we  
cleared it with the American League office. He'd been needing to 
take care of this, and there as no other time he could do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera, who will leave for Panama after the Yankees game with  
the Mets on Sunday, said he would return in time for the resumption 
of the regular season July 15 when the Yankees play the Atlanta 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that I have to go there,'' Rivera said. ``I need to  
go there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera made his 32nd appearance of the season Tuesday night,  
suffering only his second blown save in 23 opportunities before 
getting credit for the win. Bobby Higginson tied it at 8 with two 
outs in the ninth with a solo homer, the first yielded by Rivera 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said Nagy, who is 10-4, had been close to making the AL  
squad all along. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was right there in the voting,'' Torre said. ``I pretty  
much went with the manager's sheets, right down the line.''

</P>
<P>
	Rivera, who will leave for Panama after the Yankees game with  
the Mets on Sunday, said he would return in time for the resumption 
of the regular season July 15 when the Yankees play the Atlanta 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that I have to go there,'' Rivera said. ``I need to  
go there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera made his 32nd appearance of the season Tuesday night,  
suffering only his second blown save in 23 opportunities before 
getting credit for the win. Bobby Higginson tied it at 8 with two 
outs in the ninth with a solo homer, the first yielded by Rivera 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said Nagy, who is 10-4, had been close to making the AL  
squad all along. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was right there in the voting,'' Torre said. ``I pretty  
much went with the manager's sheets, right down the line.''

<HEADLINE> Case Against Gay Journalist Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A judge Wednesday dismissed the case  
against a gay journalist accused of using the Internet to solicit 
sex from a teen-ager. The journalist had argued that he was merely 
doing research for a story. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second day of Bruce Mirken's trial, Judge Rudolph R.  
Loncke dismissed the charge that Mirken attempted to perform a lewd 
and lascivious act on a child. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge agreed with the defense that there was insufficient  
evidence against Mirken, 42, who would have faced up to four years 
in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This prosecutor's case was a fraud from day one,'' Mirken  
said. ``They knew they didn't have a case and yet they put it on 
anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirken later cursed at the prosecutor, who did not respond.  
</P>
<P>
	Police started investigating Mirken after he answered an  
electronic message they posted in a chat room, posing as a boy 
named Anthony. Anthony's message said he was looking for an adult 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirken was arrested last July in a Sacramento park where he went  
to meet who he thought would be the 13-year-old Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
	He was instead met by an undercover police officer taking part  
in a sting operation that had tracked Mirken's e-mail and telephone 
conversations with investigators masquerading as the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirken, whose stories about gay and lesbian culture have  
appeared in publications across the country, contends he 
corresponded with the boy hoping to write an investigative story 
about troubled gay youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said, however, that recorded conversations and  
e-mail records between Mirken -- who used the screen name 
``Luvboys343'' -- and the boy were sexually charged and filled with 
flirtatious questions such as, ``Do you skinny-dip?'' and ``Does 
your mother come home during lunch?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely disappointed and saddened that this court would  
take this matter out of the sound judgment of the jury,'' 
prosecutor Perry Sims said.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Sinks on Little Demand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sugar futures sank more than 6 percent Wednesday on the Board of  
Trade of the City of New York as new supplies from Brazil and 
Europe saw few takers. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, palladium futures rose sharply, as did copper.  
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures continued their quick retreat from a rally staged  
last month as heavy Russian buying tapped available supplies of 
refined white sugars in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Importers had worked to beat the Aug. 1 imposition of tariffs  
meant to protect the national sugar beet industry. Prices had 
rallied nearly 40 percent since May on the buying from Russia, the 
world's largest importer. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors now are turning to fundamental supply and demand  
concerns. Brazil, the world's largest producer, is harvesting 
another bumper crop and supplies are beginning to come to market. 
Other key producers also brought in plentiful production this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar for October delivery fell .37 cent, or 6.4 percent, to  
5.37 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures rose sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
as news of a potential mine strike in Canada reinforced ideas 
supplies may be shrinking more quickly than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Falconbridge was trying to avert a strike Thursday at its Kidd  
Creek copper and zinc plant in northern Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	While a union strike at the mine normally would have little  
effect on production, market participants have been aggressive 
buyers in recent weeks as major producers reduce operations in a 
bid to lift prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The output cutbacks are expected to help balance the  
supply-demand equation that had been continually worsening against 
the backdrop of weaker construction demand in Asia and Europe and 
oversupply. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts noted that Asian demand also is on the rise amid a mild  
recovery underway there. Copper is used in wiring and plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
	September copper rose 2.4 cents to 78.60 cents a pound. Prices  
earlier in the session rose as high as 78.70, the loftiest level in 
10 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures bounced higher on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange amid speculation Russia, the world's largest exporter, 
will not make large-scale shipments of the industrial metal until 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia for a brief period earlier this year shipped supplies to  
Western manufacturers of automobiles and jewelry, but shipments 
ground to a halt after the government in May imposed a 5 percent 
duty on exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The government now says those duties won't be lifted at least  
until January, according to press reports. That might make it 
unprofitable to resume metals shipments, investors bet. Russia 
produces nearly two-thirds the world's supply of palladium, a metal 
that is seeing rising use especially in the production of catalytic 
converters for cleaner-burning autos. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium for September delivery rose $6 to $321.15 an ounce.

<HEADLINE> All-Star Debut Gets Extra $250,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero is getting a $250,000 raise  
for making the NL All-Star team for the first time. Only he won't 
see the money for another four years. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the Montreal Expos outfielder has a unique clause  
in his contract that contains an escalator clause for the final 
season of the deal in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the $28 million, five-year contract he signed last  
Sept. 1, Guerrero gets $1 million this year, $3.5 million next 
year, $6 million in 2001 and $8 million in 2002. The deal called 
for a $9.5 million salary in 2003, but states it could go up in 
$250,000 increments to as much as $11.5 million for various awards 
and honors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the raise, Guerrero was among 43 players  
receiving bonuses for making the All-Star game, getting an extra 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. got the highest bonus, $125,000.  
Griffey $50,000 for making the AL team and another $75,000 bonus 
for finishing first among all major leaguers in fan voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore's Cal Ripken Jr., an All-Star for the 17th consecutive  
season, and Boston's Jose Offerman each earned $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the $26 million, four-year contract he signed with  
the Red Sox during the offseason, Offerman would get a $250,000 if 
he makes the All-Star team again during the contract and an 
additional $500,000 if he makes it a third time. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty players will get $50,000 each, and another 19 will get  
$25,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles outfielder Gary Sheffield receives $20,000 and  
Chicago White Sox outfielder Magglio Ordonez gets $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen players don't get any bonus money: Paul Byrd, Jeromy  
Burnitz, Sean Casey, David Cone, Alex Gonzalez, John Jaha, Derek 
Jeter, Brian Jordan, Barry Larkin, Pedro Martinez, Kevin Millwood, 
Dave Nilsson, Rafael Palmiero, Mariano Rivera, Jose Rosada, Sammy 
Sosa, Bernie Williams and Jeff Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas outfielder Juan Gonzalez missed out on a $50,000 bonus by  
saying he wouldn't go to next Tuesday night's game at Boston's 
Fenway Park unless he was elected to start.

<HEADLINE> Mourners Remember Former Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Mourners who gathered to pay their  
respects to Ricky Byrdsong on Wednesday evening said the former 
Northwestern coach's reach far exceeded the bounds of the 
basketball floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Family, friends, neighbors and others whose lives were touched  
by Byrdsong filed through the First Presbyterian Church, 
remembering a man who was dedicated to his family, the community 
and the players he coached. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a sadness in Skokie, a sadness in our hearts and a  
sadness in our homes,'' said Marie Lones, a neighbor of Byrdsong in 
the suburb of Skokie where he was gunned down last Friday in front 
of two of his three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Current and former basketball players, coaches and athletic  
directors attended, as well as mourners from as far away as Detroit 
and Arizona, where Byrdsong also coached. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany, former Michigan  
coach Steve Fischer and Eastern Kentucky coach Scott Perry, 
godfather of Byrdsong's son, Ricky Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Webber, the former Northwestern president who hired  
Byrdsong, recalled the coach enthusiastically discussing his plan 
to work with youths in the community. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of coaches would say that, but Ricky meant it,'' Webber  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaiah McKinnon, a professor at the University of Detroit, was  
on the selection committee that hired Byrdsong in 1988. McKinnon 
had the task of informing Byrdsong of his father's death after the 
job interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had such dignity and composure at such a terrible time,''  
he said. ``I knew we did the right thing in hiring him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong went from Detroit to Northwestern, where he took the  
Wildcats to only their second postseason basketball appearance in 
school history. 
</P>
<P>
	He compiled an 87-165 coaching record, including 34-78 in four  
seasons at Northwestern. He was fired at the end of the 1996-97 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some mourners were drawn to Wednesday's service by outrage over  
the circumstances of Byrdsong's death. Authorities said the 
ex-coach, who was black, was a victim of a white supremacist who 
went on a shooting rampage last weekend, killing one other person 
and wounding nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here to show our support and to protest the violence in  
our society,'' said Rabbi Ira Youdovin, who identified himself as 
the executive vice president of the Chicago Board of Rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong, who was 43 at the time of his death and working for an  
insurance company, is survived by his wife, Sherialyn, and three 
children.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Jeff Green has a warning for Casey Atwood.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's always next week,'' he said, insisting Atwood took the  
low road in more ways than one to his record-breaking Diehard 250 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood, the 18-year-old Tennessee driver, powered under Green  
with a last-lap, hit-and-run move Sunday to become the youngest 
winner in NASCAR Busch Series history. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took a cheap shot,'' Green said. ``That was intentional, to  
do that on the last lap. ... The other top guys don't drive that 
way, but he does. I just hope he can sleep good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood's Chevrolet tapped the left rear of Green's as they  
entered the third turn on The Milwaukee Mile. Green slipped wide 
through the turn, and Atwood went inside to win the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was going to try me on the outside and I would've  
given it to him,'' Green said. ``If he could pass me on the 
outside, he deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put me in the same situation, I probably would've run second.  
I wouldn't turn him around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can drive just like that toward him next week,'' said Green,  
who will have that chance next in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on July 17. 
``I hope it comes down to us the last lap again. I promise I'll do 
the same thing to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood downplayed the incident.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not many last laps when two cars are battling like  
that where contact doesn't happen,'' he said. ``It wasn't anything 
where I was trying to wreck him. I just wanted my first win pretty 
bad.''

	 *FLYING HIGH:* Jimmy Kite is a fast qualifying run away from  
realizing his boyhood dream of racing at Atlanta Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indy Racing League driver, preparing for the Kobalt  
Mechanics Tools 500 on July 17, got his first taste of big-time 
racing 10 years ago, watching a NASCAR race at the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since that first day, I dreamed about racing there,''  
Kite said. ``We lived just down the road from the track, so it was 
kind of natural that it would become a special place to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He feels like he has the home-field advantage.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll sleep in my old bed, in my old bedroom, then get up the  
next day and go race at Atlanta Motor Speedway,'' said the 
23-year-old driver. ``How can it get any more cool than that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kite, in his first season with McCormack Motorsports, missed the  
race last year because Team Scandia skipped the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``My emotions were probably a lot like someone who has missed  
the Indianapolis 500, because to me the Atlanta race was the most 
important event on the schedule,'' Kite said. ``Knowing I was so 
close, but so far away, I just couldn't stand it.''

All-Star game, and the answer comes right out of the third turn.

	``I'm picking the American League . . . unless they invert the  
field after the fifth inning,'' John Andretti said when pressed for 
a prediction on the game Tuesday night in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The field is inverted -- with heat winners sent toward the rear --  
in The Winston, NASCAR's annual no-holds-barred all-star event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say anything that's even close to similar ends right after  
the National Anthem,'' Sterling Marlin said. ``Now, if those boys 
were beating each other with baseball bats, then they'd be closer 
to what our bodies feel like after running The Winston.''

Derrick Walker Racing, which fields the CART entry of Gil de 
Ferran.

	``We've had a winning partnership with Valvoline since 1992,''  
Walker said. ``Unfortunately, Valvoline's business plans don't 
include primary team sponsorship in CART in 2000.''

<P>
	De Ferran, a winner June 20 in Portland, Ore., is second in the

<HEADLINE>  Italian Wins Tour de France Stage 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOIS, France (AP) -- In the town where Joan of Arc plotted her  
attack on the English at Orleans, Mario Cipollini of Italy won the 
fastest stage in the history of the Tour de France today. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off a stone bridge spanning the Loire River, the Italian  
surged past Germany's Erik Zabel in a photo finish to win the 
fourth stage of cycling's showcase race. 
</P>
<P>
	A favorable tailwind, cool weather, a relatively straight course  
and wide, flat roads all contributed to the record average speed of 
31.290 mph, breaking the 1993 mark of 30.707 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Stuart O'Grady finished third, followed by Tom  
Steels, the Belgian who won the two previous stages. Estonia's Jaan 
Kirsipuu was fifth but kept the leader's yellow jersey he captured 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 121-mile route took the riders through flat roads from the  
town of Laval on the Mayenne River to Blois in the Loire Valley, 
home to a castle of French kings. The castle is also where Joan of 
Arc prepared for her siege of Orleans in 1429. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Tuesday's third stage, two riders broke from the pack  
early and held a long lead. Gianpaolo Mondini of Italy and Anthony 
Morin of France survived an early breakaway by 10 riders. They 
built a lead of more than six minutes over 62 miles before the pack 
started gaining late in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The final sprint went down to a photo finish, and Zabel was  
deprived of a stage win on his 29th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the overall standings, O'Grady moved up to second place, 16  
seconds behind. Steels, who wants to be wearing the yellow jersey 
when the race nears his home country later in the week, was third 
at 21 seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
	In fourth place was Lance Armstrong, the American making a  
gallant comeback from testicular cancer, 24 seconds behind. Zabel 
was in fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong plans to wait for Sunday's time trial and then the  
mountain stages before making his real challenge. But this week, in 
the early, flat stages, it is the sprinters like Cipollini who are 
in command. 
</P>
<P>
	In winning in 3 hours, 51 minutes, 45 seconds, the 32-year-old  
Italian captured his ninth career Tour de France stage victory, and 
his first this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the perfect sprint,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He paid tribute to his teammates on the Saeco team, such as Gian  
Matteo Fagnini and Mario Scirea, who worked mightily to get him 
into proper position for the final sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	Cipollini is ninth in the overall standings, 44 seconds behind  
Kirsipuu. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, this year's Tour has had little of the controversy that  
enveloped last year's race when a drug scandal almost scuttled the 
entire event. 
</P>
<P>
	Manolo Saiz, sports director of the ONCE team, who was initially  
banned from this year's Tour for involvement in the drug scandal 
but then was reinstated, said in Le Monde on Wednesday that he 
thought that ``90, if not 99, percent of the riders in this year's 
Tour de France are clean.''

<HEADLINE> Excess Military Property Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly $2.7 billion in excess military  
property, including sensitive weapons parts, cannot be accounted 
for after being marked for disposal or sale, according to records 
examined by congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon says the problem is more clerical than criminal,  
though it acknowledges having no record of final disposal for about 
13 percent of military surplus property in fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office report cites only one incident  
where military personnel determined a likely theft -- the 
disappearance of a $424 camera lens. Most of the disappearances 
apparently were due to faulty record-keeping, problems with data 
entry into computers or other clerical failures, the GAO concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the property listed as not received by disposal  
offices was items which should have received special military 
handling - such as communications equipment, aircraft components 
and gun parts, the GAO report said in reporting on its examination 
of in-transit records. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was the third in a series of congressional inquiries  
into problems with disposal of surplus military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	A report last year found that some of the $22 billion worth of  
equipment sold in fiscal 1997 may have caused the leaking of 
sensitive military technology to U.S. and foreign buyers. A year 
earlier, a GAO report found billions of dollars worth of property 
being destroyed that might have been sold for civilian use without 
compromising security or flight safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Pentagon efforts to reform its complex system for  
disposing of surplus property, problems persist, the new report 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Management controls over excess property being shipped to  
disposal are not working effectively, leaving the property 
vulnerable to loss or undetected theft,'' said the report sent to 
Rep. Floyd Spence, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. 
Copies also went to Defense Secretary William Cohen and to heads of 
the armed service branches. 
</P>
<P>
	The report included a response from Deputy Under Secretary of  
Defense Roger W. Kallock, who said the department concurs with its 
conclusions and is addressing its recommendations for closer 
control of excess military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon ``believes the property is not being lost and that  
most record discrepancies are due to administrative errors,'' the 
report notes, but it adds that the administrative problems are 
``systemic and widespread.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one instance, GAO investigators examined 191 sample shipments  
of sensitive military property which were sent for disposal but 
recorded as not received by disposal offices. They were able to 
determine final status of only 114 of the shipments, which were 
received but not recorded because of a backlog. 
</P>
<P>
	They found no trace of the remaining 77 shipments which included  
a wiring assembly used in encrypted electronic communications, 
optical magnifying devices for 25-millimeter guns and components 
for the Bradley fighting vehicle and other weapons systems, the GAO 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each military service is responsible for determining its own  
excess property, which may include unusable parts of weapons 
systems or machinery and such saleable items as photographic 
supplies, hand tools, shop equipment, and clothing. The Defense 
Logistics Agency carries out disposal, which may include transfer 
to other federal agencies, donation to state or local governments 
or sale to the general public. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Italian Wins Tour de France Stage 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOIS, France (AP) -- In the town where Joan of Arc plotted her  
attack on the English at Orleans, Mario Cipollini of Italy won the 
fastest stage in the history of the Tour de France today. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off a stone bridge spanning the Loire River, the Italian  
surged past Germany's Erik Zabel in a photo finish to win the 
fourth stage of cycling's showcase race. 
</P>
<P>
	A favorable tailwind, cool weather, a relatively straight course  
and wide, flat roads all contributed to the record average speed of 
31.290 mph, breaking the 1993 mark of 30.707 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Stuart O'Grady finished third, followed by Tom  
Steels, the Belgian who won the two previous stages. Estonia's Jaan 
Kirsipuu was fifth but kept the leader's yellow jersey he captured 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 121-mile route took the riders through flat roads from the  
town of Laval on the Mayenne River to Blois in the Loire Valley, 
home to a castle of French kings. The castle is also where Joan of 
Arc prepared for her siege of Orleans in 1429. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Tuesday's third stage, two riders broke from the pack  
early and held a long lead. Gianpaolo Mondini of Italy and Anthony 
Morin of France survived an early breakaway by 10 riders. They 
built a lead of more than six minutes over 62 miles before the pack 
started gaining late in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The final sprint went down to a photo finish, and Zabel was  
deprived of a stage win on his 29th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the overall standings, O'Grady moved up to second place, 16  
seconds behind. Steels, who wants to be wearing the yellow jersey 
when the race nears his home country later in the week, was third 
at 21 seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
	In fourth place was Lance Armstrong, the American making a  
gallant comeback from testicular cancer, 24 seconds behind. Zabel 
was in fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong plans to wait for Sunday's time trial and then the  
mountain stages before making his real challenge. But this week, in 
the early, flat stages, it is the sprinters like Cipollini who are 
in command. 
</P>
<P>
	In winning in 3 hours, 51 minutes, 45 seconds, the 32-year-old  
Italian captured his ninth career Tour de France stage victory, and 
his first this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the perfect sprint,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He paid tribute to his teammates on the Saeco team, such as Gian  
Matteo Fagnini and Mario Scirea, who worked mightily to get him 
into proper position for the final sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	Cipollini is ninth in the overall standings, 44 seconds behind  
Kirsipuu. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, this year's Tour has had little of the controversy that  
enveloped last year's race when a drug scandal almost scuttled the 
entire event. 
</P>
<P>
	Manolo Saiz, sports director of the ONCE team, who was initially  
banned from this year's Tour for involvement in the drug scandal 
but then was reinstated, said in Le Monde on Wednesday that he 
thought that ``90, if not 99, percent of the riders in this year's 
Tour de France are clean.''

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Contain Western Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Utah (AP) -- The largest fire burning in the West, a  
61,400-acre blaze feeding on pinyon pine, juniper and cheat grass 
in central Utah, is contained and expected to be declared 
controlled by late today. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire twice drove residents of Eureka and Mammoth from their  
homes over the weekend, but no one was injured and only three 
abandoned shacks burned. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 420 firefighters had been working on the fire and they  
were expected to be released beginning today, said fire information 
officer Jerry Rohnert. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, a 9,000-acre fire near Genola, 52 miles south of Salt  
Lake City, was 90 percent contained and control was projected for 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Hesperia, Calif., a blaze in the San Bernardino National  
Forest forced about 70 people to evacuate their homes but they were 
allowed to return late Tuesday. The fire was 80 percent contained 
today after burning through 2,800 acres of brush, said Bill Peters 
of the California Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire near Interstate 15, southeast of Los Angeles, had  
destroyed sheds, trailers, vehicles and a mobile home, said 
national forest spokeswoman Karen McKinley. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado, lighter wind and a little rain helped crews  
complete containment lines around 50 percent of a blaze west of 
Grand Junction. The fire had spread through more than 5,000 acres 
of sage, pinyon pine and juniper. 
</P>
<P>
	No towns or homes were threatened, officials said.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Campaign Costs Taxpayers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign committee  
will pick up many of the costs of her travels around New York 
State, but not all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	While the campaign committee plans to pay for her travels around  
the state as she gauges support for a Senate run, federal taxpayers 
will pick up the tab for security. Accommodations and other 
expenses for the Secret Service aides accompanying Mrs. Clinton 
would continue to be the federal government's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign would pay the costs of political aides accompanying  
the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign committee also would reimburse the federal  
government for the cost of airplane tickets for Mrs. Clinton and 
her political aides when Mrs. Clinton flies to the state to 
campaign. The cost is the rate for comparable commercial airfares, 
according to federal election law.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's Soccer League Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A study into the feasibility of starting a  
women's professional soccer league in the United States is being 
developed by U.S. Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Federation president S. Robert Contiguglia said Wednesday that a  
business plan is in the works to put together a league. There is no 
top-level professional soccer outlet for American women at home, 
and few leagues around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. Soccer has been at the forefront of women's athletics for  
many years,'' Contiguglia said. ``We have implemented a number of 
progressive women's programs to ensure the continued success of 
women's soccer, and we are moving into this project with the same 
mindset ... to try and produce the best possible plan to entice 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the governing body of the sport, U.S. Soccer's role is to  
encourage dialogue and the eventual development of a business plan 
for potential investors, but not to directly fund or operate a 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funds have been committed by John Hendricks, founder of the  
Discovery Channel, to develop the business plan and present it to 
potential investors by early 2000. Mark Abbott, the chief operating 
officer of Major League Soccer, is drafting the plan. He played a 
similar role for MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	Federation officials have discussed the plan's development with  
members of the U.S. women's team, other participants in the World 
Cup and sponsors in the women's soccer community. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many elements that need to be in place before you  
can proceed with a start-up project like this,'' Contiguglia said. 
``It's important to remember that this is just the first step in 
the process.''

<HEADLINE> Disney, Katzenberg Settle Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Not with a bang but a squeak, the Walt  
Disney Co. and Jeffrey Katzenberg quietly settled their messy, 
high-profile Hollywood divorce for an undisclosed amount, both 
sides revealed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement of the contract dispute was reached Tuesday  
afternoon, as Katzenberg was calling his final witnesses and Disney 
was about to begin its case in the trial before a retired state 
judge, sitting as a mediator. It returned the dispute to where it 
began: behind closed doors, at the highest level of movie business 
dealmaking, away from the eyes of curious movie fans and nervous 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, which still must be approved by a Superior  
Court judge, neither side would comment on the details. At trial, 
Katzenberg had said he was owed a bonus worth as much as $580 
million as a going-away perk when he left as studio boss in 1994; 
Disney put the figure as low as $119 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg has reportedly already received $117 million in a  
partial settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly why they settled when they did wasn't known, but the  
trial was headed toward a particularly delicate point for Disney. 
The company, which has been battered on Wall Street, was about to 
put on evidence suggesting the future value of some of its most 
prized properties, from ``The Lion King'' to ``Sister Act,'' wasn't 
as bright as Katzenberg was suggesting. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner was scheduled to  
make a return trip to the witness stand Monday, as a hostile 
witness for Katzenberg. In an embarrassing courtroom performance in 
May, Eisner conceded he may have said of the diminutive Katzenberg: 
``I hate the little midget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the bitterness of the trial, the settlement was  
announced in a joint statement on Disney's Mickey Mouse letterhead, 
in which both sides praised their lawyers and expressed 
satisfaction with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am glad that we were able to come to an acceptable  
settlement,'' Eisner said, adding, ``the time has come to put this 
matter behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg praised his legal team and said, ``I am very pleased  
that we were able to finally resolve this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg, who left Disney in 1994 after he was denied a  
promotion, filed suit claiming the company owed him a 2 percent 
bonus against future profits of all films and merchandise produced 
during his 10-year tenure as head of the animation and live-action 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney had argued Katzenberg forfeited that bonus because he  
left two years before the end of his six-year contract. Katzenberg 
went on to become one of the founders of DreamWorks with Steven 
Spielberg and David Geffen and now oversees its animation division, 
a Disney competitor, which last year released ``The Prince of 
Egypt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the partial settlement, Disney acknowledged it did owe  
Katzenberg something, though the exact amount and the particular 
products that fell under the bonus were to be worked out in 
mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney also agreed in the partial settlement, according to  
sources, to give Katzenberg two sums: $77.5 million and $40 
million. The $77.5 million amount was to be deducted from the final 
bonus figure determined in the second phase; the $40 million was to 
be untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	Midway into the second phase of mediation, retired Superior  
Court Judge Paul Breckenridge ruled May 19 that Disney did breach 
its contract, a technical but important legal finding because it 
meant the company owed Katzenberg a potentially huge interest 
payment in addition to the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit has proven to be not only expensive for Disney, but  
a major embarrassment, as the bad blood between Eisner and 
Katzenberg became painfully public. Observers have long wondered 
why a deal wasn't reached much sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner's testimony in May turned out to be a public relations  
disaster for Disney. Proving a prickly witness, Eisner was forced 
to acknowledge that he probably once made the now infamous 
``midget'' crack about Katzenberg in discussions with the co-author 
of Eisner's autobiography.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Torture-Killer Executed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLEFONTE, Pa. (AP) -- A man condemned for kidnapping and  
torturing six women, including a retarded woman whose body parts he 
fed to his other shackled victims, was executed by injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Heidnik, 55, was a disabled Army veteran who made a fortune  
in the stock market and ordained himself bishop of his own church. 
He abducted, imprisoned and raped six women in the basement of his 
Philadelphia home in 1986 and 1987; two of them died. He was put to 
death at Rockview state prison Tuesday as four sisters of victims 
looked on. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should have got the same thing that he dished out to a lot  
of people's families,'' said Carolyn Johnson, whose sister, Deborah 
Johnson Dudley, died when Heidnik touched live electric wires to 
her chains as she stood in a water-filled pit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Lindsay, the retarded victim, died while shackled by her  
arm to a rafter. The women who survived Heidnik's torture said he 
dismembered her body, ground up the flesh with dog food and fed it 
to the others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that he was a coward then and he's a coward now,'' said  
Lindsay's sister, Tracey Lomax. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the first prisoner to be put to death in Pennsylvania  
since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers representing Heidnik's daughter pressed appeals in  
federal court until the end, contending that it was illegal to 
execute him because he was not mentally competent. The courts 
refused to block the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state has executed an extremely mentally ill and psychotic  
man,'' defense attorney Kathy Swedlow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidnik himself had declined to pursue any appeals since he was  
sentenced in 1988. He believed he was innocent and that his 
execution would draw protests leading to the end of capital 
punishment. But only a couple of protesters showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidnik was found out when Josefina Rivera, a prostitute,  
escaped. He picked her up in 1986 and after they had sex, choked 
her until she passed out. When she came to, she was in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next four months, Rivera watched as the other five  
women arrived and were tortured. Three were prostitutes. Heidnik 
was white; all his victims were black. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Gov. Tom Ridge, who was swept into office in 1995  
partly on a pledge to speed up the signing of death warrants that 
had languished under his Democratic predecessor, Robert Casey, said 
Heidnik's punishment was just. 
</P>
<P>
	``So horrible were his deeds, a jury of 12 Pennsylvanians  
determined unanimously that he must forfeit his life,'' Ridge said 
in a statement. ``Tonight he paid that price. In doing so, he 
suffered far less than the women he tortured and killed.''

	LONDON (AP) -- Prince Naseem Hamed's flyweight title fight in the  
United States Oct. 2 could be switched to November if Mike Tyson 
makes his comeback bout in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The WBO featherweight champion is expected to fight WBC champion  
Cesar Soto of Mexico, probably at Las Vegas, in his third bout in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Soto's promoter, Bob Arum, said the unification bout could be  
switched to Nov. 6, a week before the expected heavyweight 
championship rematch between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said Hamed's handlers want a rematch guarantee if he loses  
to Soto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they want an immediate rematch, but that's contrary to  
the rules of the organizations,'' Arum said. ``That is something 
that has got to be sorted out.''

<HEADLINE> Fungus Hurting Soybean Plants / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	URBANA, Ill. (AP) -- Glen Hartman opens what looks like a giant  
refrigerator and pulls out a tray of soybean plants sprouting under 
fluorescent lights in white tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the plants look healthy and strong; others are droopy  
with yellow and brown leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just the way Hartman wants it.  
</P>
<P>
	The plant pathologist is combing through soybean collections at  
the University of Illinois, trying to find plants that are 
naturally resistant to two diseases that have hit Illinois farmers 
hard in recent years -- sudden death syndrome and white mold. 
</P>
<P>
	Sudden death syndrome is caused by a fungus that lives in the  
soil and affects the plant's roots. It causes the leaves to yellow 
and pods to fall off prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	White mold, also known as sclerotinia stem rot, is also caused  
by a fungus, but it affects the plant during flowering and grows 
into the stem. Anything above the affected part of the stem dies. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were virtually unheard of in Illinois 10 years ago. But  
sudden death syndrome was observed in 90 percent of the counties in 
the state in 1998. Both diseases can severely hurt yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartman, who is with the U.S. Agriculture Department Research  
Service unit at the UI, is screening three collections. 
</P>
<P>
	The first is of soybean genetic material from around the world  
gathered at the USDA's Soybean Germplasm Collection, housed at the 
university. These soybeans are similar to what was domesticated in 
China thousands of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also testing wild annual progenitors of today's  
domesticated soybeans and a group of wild perennial relatives of 
the soybean that were collected by UI geneticist Ted Hymowitz on 
trips over the past 25 years to secluded spots in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartman has found some promising results, especially in the wild  
perennials -- although crosses between soybeans and their perennial 
relatives are long and difficult, meaning it could be five years or 
more before farmers can buy resistant varieties. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	TIFTON, Ga. (AP) -- A federal agricultural official says U.S.  
farmers are lagging in making the switch to conservation tillage, a 
type of farming that cuts growers' costs, reduces erosion and 
enhances the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	David Schertz, head agronomist for the National Resources  
Conservation Service, urged about 80 scientists and others 
attending the 22nd Annual Conservation Tillage Conference on 
Wednesday to do a better job of persuading farmers to make the 
switch. 
</P>
<P>
	Schertz noted that conservation tillage was used on 25 percent  
of the nation's planted acres in 1989. That jumped to 35 percent in 
1993, but it grew only slightly from 1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	With conservation tillage, farmers use winter cover crops such  
as clover to enrich the soil. They minimize plowing to reduce 
erosion and cut labor and fuel costs. And they leave at least 30 
percent of the residue from the previous crop on the ground to 
increase soil moisture, reduce runoff and add organic matter. 
Conservation tillage is sometimes referred to as ``no till'' 
farming.

<HEADLINE> Longshoremen Shut Oakland Docks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- A work stoppage has halted most activity  
at the port of Oakland and caught management officials off-guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's action apparently originated with Local 10 of the  
International Longshore Workers Union in San Francisco. The port 
here includes 12 cargo terminals serving 33 shipping lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Should the stoppage spread to other West Coast ports, it could  
idle thousands of workers who help ship and process cargo at inland 
warehouses and cost the nation billions of dollars in lost 
commerce, association officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of our customers are able to conduct business,'' said  
Port of Oakland spokeswoman Roberta Bradley. ``I understand it 
stemmed from local issues but may affect national negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Management officials said they haven't heard from union  
officials since a meeting last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Pacific Maritime Association, which represents  
management at all West Coast ports in the talks, made their offer 
on Saturday, just before negotiations ended for the Fourth of July 
holiday, with an understanding they would resume this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't heard from the union,'' said Phil Resch, the  
association's senior vice president. ``We have called all day today 
to talk to the international and they have not returned our 
calls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials, whose members have been working without a  
contract since Thursday, did not return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A recorded message at the union's office in San Francisco tells  
workers the ``negotiating committee has decided to continue to meet 
with the employers hour-to-hour as long as progress is being made 
on our remaining demands ... The rank-and-file should continue to 
work unless directed otherwise by the negotiating committee.'' The 
message is dated last Friday, prior to the company's latest offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Work stopped in Oakland when employees arriving for the 7 a.m.  
shift Tuesday demanded that an additional person, known as a 
signalman, be added to crews. The signalman's job is to ensure 
safety by helping crane operators keep track of cargo container 
movements on the dock. 
</P>
<P>
	Each crew already had one or two signalmen assigned, and the  
workers were told their request was illegal, but the crews still 
refused to work, Resch said. About 1,000 longshore workers and 
clerks remained off the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers had been scheduled to unload five ships, which  
remained at the docks Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's busiest ports, there  
were minor slowdowns at some terminals, but work was not seriously 
affected. There was no report of slowdowns in San Diego or Seattle, 
Resch said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Port of Los Angeles, a few terminal operators reported  
that work was slow, but union workers still handled a large volume 
of cargo, said spokeswoman Barbara Yamamoto. Long Beach officials 
did not return a call placed after business hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hearing it was just sporadic. It was pretty much  
business as usual,'' said Yamamoto. ``There weren't any reports of 
ships not being worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The association and union leaders have been negotiating behind  
closed doors since May to work out a contract that would affect 
about 14,700 union members on the West Coast. The current contract 
expired on Thursday, but both sides agreed to continue talking. 
</P>
<P>
	The association's offer included a 32 percent boost in pension  
benefits to current future retirees and a 15 percent raise for 
those currently retired. Officials would not describe the 
association's pay offer. Association President Joseph Miniace 
Miniace said it would make West Coast workers ``among the highest 
compensated union workers in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pay in 1998 averaged $99,000 for workers, $117,617 for clerks  
and $156,251 for foremen, according to the association. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of safety concerns to stop work also has been an issue  
in the talks. The current contract allows union members to stop 
work whenever they perceive a safety problem. The association has 
sought to eliminate that option, arguing that the union 
rank-and-file has used it to stage unauthorized work stoppages and 
slowdowns.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Child Abuse Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In the case of a child beaten to death, the  
state's highest court has ruled that a stepparent is responsible 
for protecting stepchildren even against biological parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Appeals said Lisa Carroll can be charged in the  
1996 death of Shanaya Jones because she was aware of abuse by the 
girl's father and did nothing to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll had argued that she could not be charged with  
endangering the welfare of a child because she was not the 
biological parent, guardian, or paid caregiver to 3-year-old 
Shanaya at the time of the girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
	But court ruled 6-0 on Tuesday that she was the ``functional  
equivalent'' of Shanaya's parent during a 10-day period when the 
child was living with her father, Carl Jones, who was also 
Carroll's husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie Ward, executive director of Statewide Youth Advocacy,  
hailed the ruling as a valuable precedent for fighting child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many more children in stepparent families today,''  
she said. ``This ruling sends a message that you are responsible if 
you are a stepparent in a family to ensure the safety of the child 
in that household.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Judge Judith Kaye said state law defines a ``person  
legally responsible'' for the welfare of a child to include the 
child's custodian, guardian or ``any other person responsible for 
the child's care at the relevant time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll met that definition when she was in the household where  
Shanaya was mistreated, Kaye wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be incongruous for biological parents and guardians,  
but not a stepmother who assumes the primary care taking role 
during the child's visits, to be liable for endangering the welfare 
of a child,'' Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanaya died from injuries including bruises, cuts, abrasions  
and hemorrhages. Several of her ribs were fractured and a lung was 
punctured. She was also starved and dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
	The child was apparently abused by her father because she would  
not eat, court papers said. He was released from state prison in 
April after serving 22 months of a 4-year sentence for criminally 
negligent homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	If tried and convicted of endangering the welfare of a child,  
Carroll faces up to one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney  
Robert Morgenthau, said prosecutors hadn't seen the ruling and 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Berko, Carroll's lawyer, said he was disappointed with  
the decision. It represents an ``undue expansion'' of the law to 
include stepparents in cases such as Shanaya's death, he said.

<HEADLINE> Opryland Hotel Lays Off 160 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Opryland Hotel is laying off 160 of its  
4,600 employees, Gaylord Entertainment Co. announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the layoffs were done to redirect savings into  
new, undisclosed opportunities and expand existing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Those laid off include both managerial and hourly employees in  
several departments. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, shares of Gaylord dropped 87 1/2 cents, or 3 percent,  
to $28.87 1/2 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hotel occupancy, which consistently outstrips the  
hospitality industry, continues ahead of last year's pace, and our 
service level will remain high,'' said Dave Jones, president and 
chief executive officer of the Opryland Hospitality Group, part of 
Nashville-based Gaylord. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,884-room hotel relies heavily on conventions, which  
represent 80 percent of its business. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaylord also owns the Grand Ole Opry country music show near the  
hotel. It formerly owned the Opryland USA theme park, which closed 
after the 1997 season because of declining attendance. Gaylord is a 
minority owner of the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaylord broke ground last week on a 1,400-room Opryland Hotel in  
Orlando, Fla., which is to open in 2002. The company expects to 
break ground next year on a 1,500-room hotel in Grapevine, Texas, 
which is scheduled to open in 2003.

	Fla. Jury Finds Tobacco Cos. Liable

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The jury in the nation's first class-action lawsuit  
by smokers ever to go to trial found that cigarette makers produced 
a defective product that causes emphysema, lung cancer and other 
illnesses in a ruling that could expose the industry to billions of 
dollars in damages. The verdict today affects as many as half a 
million Florida smokers and the heirs of those who died. The jury's 
decision could prove to be the industry's most dire courtroom loss 
yet, since the plaintiffs are seeking at least $200 billion.

uncertainty into the market. The Dow Jones industrial average

	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- President Clinton today declared that  
the United States can no longer afford to ignore poverty and 
unemployment among American Indians. Visiting Oglala Sioux on the 
Pine Ridge Reservation, Clinton seemed almost disbelieving as 
Geraldine Blue Bird explained her living situation in a house and a 
nearby trailer. Tribal President Howard Salway said Blue Bird's 
Igloo neighborhood -- a collection of foam-green shacks with 
crumbling porches -- is typical of housing conditions on the

	House Republicans Propose Tax Cuts

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With stock ownership at an all-time high,  
House Republicans proposed today to cut the top tax rate on capital 
gains from 20 percent to 15 percent. The White House immediately 
criticized the idea as a favor for wealthy investors, but GOP 
leaders point to recent research estimating that 84 million people 
now own stock or participate in mutual funds -- an increase of 170 
percent from 1970. For people who pay income taxes in the 15 
percent rate, the capital-gains tax would drop from 10 percent to 
7.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Member of Supremes Loses Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An original member of The Supremes has lost  
an appeal of her trademark suit against three women who perform as 
Former Ladies of the Supremes. 
</P>
<P>
	The rights to the group's name are owned by Motown, and not by  
former members such as Mary Wilson, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said Motown had allowed Former Ladies of the Supremes  
-- and another spin-off group, Sounds of the Supremes -- to keep 
their names, and there was nothing Wilson could do about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's suit claimed the groups were misleading members of the  
public into believing they were the authentic Supremes. The court's 
response wasn't surprising, said Walter Allan, lawyer for Former 
Ladies of the Supremes -- Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne and Jean 
Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
	``She really didn't have a case and she shouldn't really have  
taken an appeal,'' Allan said. Wilson's lawyer, Allen Hyman, 
declined comment, saying he hadn't seen the ruling.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Cmte Surprised by Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In Marla Messing's wildest dreams, the Rose  
Bowl would be filled on July 10, just like nearly every other 
stadium was when the United States played a Women's World Cup game. 
</P>
<P>
	And in those dreams, clearly the two best teams in the  
tournament would be playing for the championship. One of those 
squads, from the host United States, would have captured the fancy 
of the nation, transcending what has been a history-making event. 
</P>
<P>
	Hey Marla, stop dreaming. It all came true.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last two weeks have been an absolutely exhilarating  
experience,'' Messing, president of the organizing committee, said 
Wednesday. ``As big as I thought this tournament could be, it has 
been bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have established the FIFA Women's World Cup as a  
world-class, world-caliber, stand-alone event like no other in 
sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unquestionably, this has been the most successful women's sports  
events ever staged. More than 650,000 tickets have been sold. 
Organizers spent more than $30 million, but will make a tidy 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Most significantly, women's soccer has established itself as a  
coming sport -- perhaps not in countries where cultural and societal 
limitations are placed on what women can achieve, but certainly in 
many of the nations that participated. Led by the United States, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a stupendous tournament,'' FIFA spokesman Keith  
Cooper said. ``It's the level of enthusiasm, which is partly due to 
the success of the American team and the media reaction. If others 
are smart, they should think this stuff is hot and learn from USA 
'99 and see how the game has gained respectability and 
popularity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television ratings have been strong, with the biggest audience  
yet almost certain for the China-United States final. No American 
men's soccer game, not even the World Cup second-round match 
against Brazil, grabbed the headlines as has the women's run to the 
title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been like a cultural shift,'' Messing said, ``and the way  
the tournament caught fire, we've tipped into something. We think 
this will be a seminal moment, that people will look back in 20 
years and say, `That event is responsible for the development of 
women's sports.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament has been such a success that it could scare off  
bidders for the future. Cooper acknowledged that Australia is the 
only nation to submit a plan to play host to the 2003 Women's World 
Cup. He admitted FIFA isn't expecting much interest from elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a hard act to follow, it is an impossible act to  
follow,'' Cooper said. ``We shouldn't be so foolish as to think 
this will happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messing believes it can happen again -- and again.  
</P>
<P>
	``The tangible result will be that the FIFA Women's World Cup  
will be a significant property,'' she said. ``I believe all around 
the world we have inspired girls to get involved in soccer, in 
other sports. They've seen us celebrate these women on a world 
stage. We've captured the imagination of the U.S. public probably 
like no other team since the 1980 U.S. hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I can't think of another stand-alone women's event that  
has been as big as this, by all barometers we use to judge 
events.''

<HEADLINE> Toyota To Shed Seniority Pay System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Looking to boost its bottom line, Toyota Motor  
Corp. is breaking from Japanese corporate tradition by scrapping 
its seniority-based wage system in favor of one base on 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The change, expected to be implemented in October, is intended  
to encourage employees to work harder by rewarding them for their 
achievements, Toyota spokesman Tomomi Imai said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this will improve our company's performance,'' Imai  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota, like most large Japanese companies, has traditionally  
given management-track workers automatic pay raises as they got 
older. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers will still receive these regular pay raises under the  
new system. The amount they get, however, will be based on 
performance instead of age, Imai said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will ask its labor union to agree to the new payment  
plan in August, and once in place, about 20,000 of Toyota's 70,000 
employees in Japan will be affected, Imai said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the new system will only affect lower-level  
managers. Top Toyota executives are already paid on a merit-based 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker's announcement comes as Japanese companies across  
the board are scrambling for ways to increase productivity and 
innovation through new management styles and drastic labor cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, corporate giants like Mitsubishi Electric  
Corp. and Sony Corp. have announced plans to slim operations and 
cut thousands of workers -- straying from Japan's long tradition of 
lifetime employment. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, many electronics and computer companies have  
adopted performance-based pay scales to spur creative thinking 
among engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even major appliance-maker Hitachi, long criticized as  
inflexible, has slashed its work force and adopted a casual dress 
policy -- something company officials say is to emphasize ``respect 
for the individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota is the first of Japan's automakers to completely abolish  
its seniority-based wage system. Many, however, say it may not be 
the last. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen all kinds of companies adopting this kind of  
policy,'' said Satoko Hiwatari, who studies labor trends for 
Nikkeiren, an influential business group. ``Everything is pointing 
in this direction.''

<HEADLINE> Paroled Suspect Arrested in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A prison parolee accused of stabbing two  
teen-age girls and leaving them for dead was arrested Wednesday 
after passersby spotted him lying on a city plaza bench and 
recognized his tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Paul Gatson, 22, was the subject of an intense police  
manhunt after the attack Monday, two days after he was released 
from San Quentin prison. The girls were each stabbed more than 15 
times and left in a ditch to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were in critical condition on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Passersby at the Nations Plaza spotted Gatson on Wednesday  
afternoon because of his tattoo, a star on the back of his shaved 
head, said San Francisco police spokesman Sherman Ackerson. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for the citizens coming forward and calling  
police, he wouldn't be in custody,'' Ackerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson was paroled Saturday after serving time for possession of  
stolen property. He has also been convicted of grand theft, lying 
to a police officer and being under the influence of 
methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were an 18-year-old girl from Fremont and a  
15-year-old girl from Reno, Nev., who had been visiting relatives. 
Their identities were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Gatson and an 18-year-old accomplice later arrested  
met the teen-agers near a high school. The girls were threatened 
with knives and a gun and forced to withdraw about $200 from an 
automated teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The group then drove to Palomares Canyon, about 30 miles  
southeast of San Francisco, police said. There, each woman was 
stabbed and the younger victim was shot in the face with a large 
caliber handgun.

<HEADLINE>  Moroccan Sets New Mile Run Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Hicham El Guerrouj smashed the world record in the  
mile with a time of 3 minutes, 43.13 seconds at the Golden Gala 
meet Wednesday, fighting off Kenya's Noah Ngeny, who also beat the 
old mark. 
</P>
<P>
	In becoming the first Moroccan to hold one of track and field's  
most hallowed records, El Guerrouj shaved 1.26 seconds off the mark 
of 3:44.39 set by Noureddine Morceli of Algeria on Sept. 5, 1993, 
at Rieti, Italy. Ngeny was timed in 3:43.40. 
</P>
<P>
	This was only the third time in 18 years the record was broken.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight year that El Guerrouj set a world  
record at the Golden Gala meet, and each time he erased a mark held 
by Morceli. Last year, he cracked the 1,500-meter record with 
3:26.00. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rome is a magic track for me,'' El Guerrouj said. ``I can't  
compare this year with last year. It's another El Guerrouj. I was 
more concentrated, but the public was the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans supported El Guerrouj, shouting and applauding noisily  
as he rushed to the record. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj ran a victory lap, waving a Moroccan flag to the  
cheering fans. He dedicated the race to his family and to King 
Hassan of Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to bring some happiness to my family, as my uncle  
died recently,'' he said. ``I hope God continues to give me 
strength because I want to be the strongest in the world at all 
distances between 1,500 and 5,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Britain's Sebastian Coe reduced the record to 3:47.33 in  
1981, the mark stood until 1985, when another Briton, Steve Cram, 
lowered it to 3:46.32. Cram's time held for eight years until 
Morceli clipped nearly two seconds off it. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj, 24, has been almost unbeatable the past four years.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he won 12 of 13 races at a mile or 1,500 meters, losing  
only in the Olympic 1,500 final when he fell just before the bell 
lap and Morceli went on to win the gold medal. Later that season, 
he ended Morceli's four-year winning streak at 1,500 meters, 
winning the IAAF Grand Prix final. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj won 14 of 15 races in 1997, losing only at one mile  
in the Grand Prix final. Last year, he won all 12 races, including 
one at 2,000 meters, and just missed world records at the mile with 
3:44.60 and 2,000 meters with 4:48.36. He is undefeated this year. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Moroccan Sets New Mile Run Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Hicham El Guerrouj smashed the world record in the  
mile with a time of 3 minutes, 43.13 seconds at the Golden Gala 
meet Wednesday, fighting off Kenya's Noah Ngeny, who also beat the 
old mark. 
</P>
<P>
	In becoming the first Moroccan to hold one of track and field's  
most hallowed records, El Guerrouj shaved 1.26 seconds off the mark 
of 3:44.39 set by Noureddine Morceli of Algeria on Sept. 5, 1993, 
at Rieti, Italy. Ngeny was timed in 3:43.40. 
</P>
<P>
	This was only the third time in 18 years the record was broken.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight year that El Guerrouj set a world  
record at the Golden Gala meet, and each time he erased a mark held 
by Morceli. Last year, he cracked the 1,500-meter record with 
3:26.00. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rome is a magic track for me,'' El Guerrouj said. ``I can't  
compare this year with last year. It's another El Guerrouj. I was 
more concentrated, but the public was the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans supported El Guerrouj, shouting and applauding noisily  
as he rushed to the record. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj ran a victory lap, waving a Moroccan flag to the  
cheering fans. He dedicated the race to his family and to King 
Hassan of Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to bring some happiness to my family, as my uncle  
died recently,'' he said. ``I hope God continues to give me 
strength because I want to be the strongest in the world at all 
distances between 1,500 and 5,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Britain's Sebastian Coe reduced the record to 3:47.33 in  
1981, the mark stood until 1985, when another Briton, Steve Cram, 
lowered it to 3:46.32. Cram's time held for eight years until 
Morceli clipped nearly two seconds off it. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj, 24, has been almost unbeatable the past four years.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he won 12 of 13 races at a mile or 1,500 meters, losing  
only in the Olympic 1,500 final when he fell just before the bell 
lap and Morceli went on to win the gold medal. Later that season, 
he ended Morceli's four-year winning streak at 1,500 meters, 
winning the IAAF Grand Prix final. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj won 14 of 15 races in 1997, losing only at one mile  
in the Grand Prix final. Last year, he won all 12 races, including 
one at 2,000 meters, and just missed world records at the mile with 
3:44.60 and 2,000 meters with 4:48.36. He is undefeated this year.

	Some Nuke Plants Still Need Y2K Work  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A third of the nation's atomic power plants  
still have additional work to complete on non-safety computer 
systems to be fully ready handle the Y2K computer bug, the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission says. Sixty-eight plants indicated that all 
their computer systems that support safe plant operation are ``Y2K 
ready,'' the agency said. The other 35 plants reported that they 
have additional work to complete and provided schedules for 
completing the work, it said. Critics of the utility industry have 
said they fear the bug might cause the nation's power grids to 
crash when clocks strike midnight on Jan. 1, leading to blackouts.

	Tobacco Cos. Liable in Fla. Case  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A landmark lawsuit by smokers yielded a verdict  
Wednesday that could cost the tobacco industry billions in damages. 
Jurors found the companies liable for making a defective product 
that causes emphysema, lung cancer and other illnesses. They will 
return in the next phase to determine damages. Their decision could 
prove to be the industry's most dire courtroom loss yet, since the 
plaintiffs are seeking at least $200 billion. This case was filed 
in 1994 on behalf of as many as 500,000 sick Florida smokers and 
the heirs of those who died.

	Interviews With Racist Aired on TV

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chilling words videotaped by a racial shooting  
suspect left journalists pondering today whether broadcasting 
Benjamin Smith's message would explain his hatred or spread it. 
NBC's ``Today'' show and ABC's ``Good Morning America'' aired 
interviews by the 21-year-old white supremacist, blamed by 
authorities for a two-state shooting spree that killed two and 
wounded nine. It ended Sunday with Smith's suicide. In the ABC 
interview, conducted by a student documentary filmmaker, Smith said 
a racial holy war was inevitable.

she would be a ``strong and effective advocate'' for New Yorkers. 
The first lady plunged into her race for the Senate by brushing 
aside criticism of her outsider status. ``What I am for is maybe as 
important, if not more important, than where I am from,'' she said. 
Mrs. Clinton said she will address questions about what she

west coast Swedish city and was being evacuated early Thursday, the 
national news agency TT reported. Merchant ships and helicopters 
were near the scene shortly before dawn to aid the rescue. The 
Princess Ragnhild, which was traveling from Kiel, Germany, to Oslo, 
Norway, is owned by the Color Line. The ship suffered a fire in the

after passersby spotted him lying on a city plaza bench and 
recognized his tattoo. Donald Paul Gatson, 22, was the subject of 
an intense police manhunt after the attack Monday, two days after 
he was released from San Quentin prison. The girls were each 
stabbed more than 15 times and left in a ditch to die. The victims, 
who were in critical condition early Wednesday, had improved 
dramatically and were no longer in critical, Fremont Det. Dennis 
Madsen said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup of Recent Editorials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	July 3  
</P>
<P>
	The (Portland) Oregonian, on Medicare:  
</P>
<P>
	The growing economy has provided President Clinton with an  
opportunity to do something to help the elderly, and the naysayers 
are already picking the proposal apart. 
</P>
<P>
	In a revised budget that projects much-larger-than-expected  
revenue surpluses, Clinton has proposed adding prescription drug 
coverage to Medicare. The proposed benefit is admittedly modest -- 
$1,000 a year -- and requires a $24 monthly premium payment. 
</P>
<P>
	But he had scarcely cleared his throat before the critics  
launched into all the things they think are wrong with the idea. 
It's enough to make you gag. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverage for medicine is a long-sought-after benefit for the  
elderly. Earlier this year, U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., outlined a 
more modest plan he was working on with Sen. Olympia Snowe, 
R-Maine. Theirs would begin with prescription coverage for the most 
vulnerable seniors, those who must choose between food and 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	At least they're proposing solutions, not simply whining. ...  
</P>
<P>
	The critics should stop carping and come up with some proposals  
of their own. 

</P>
<P>
	June 30  
</P>
<P>
	The Index-Journal of Greenwood, S.C., on Clinton's tax plan:  
</P>
<P>
	Too ambitious. That's how Republican and Democratic lawmakers  
alike described President Clinton's proposal to expand Medicare so 
that all 39 million Americans covered could get prescription drug 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Republican Sen. Phil Gramm noted that two-thirds of Micare  
recipients already have prescription coverage, either through the 
Medicaid program for the poor or through private Medigap policies. 
That leaves about 15 million beneficiaries with no coverage. ... 
</P>
<P>
	There shouldn't be one member of Congress who doesn't understand  
that Clinton would make every American dependent upon government if 
he could get away with it. 

</P>
<P>
	July 3  
</P>
<P>
	Denton (Texas) Record-Chronicle, on political gender gap:  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens, a Republican from Alaska, has whale blubber  
where his brains ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
	He said this week that women want to spend money on ``touchy  
feely'' things and that makes them less supportive of defense 
spending than men, which is bad for the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Has Sen. Stevens ever run into Madeleine Albright or Kay Bailey  
Hutchison during his stint in Washington? We're not going to argue 
with Sen. Stevens' premise if, by ``touchy feely,'' he means such 
frippery as health care, education, quality of life for the 
elderly, and civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	It is true that the majority of women do exhibit an interest in  
topics relating to the health and welfare of individuals, families 
and communities. And that's just why we need them active at all 
levels of public life. The feminine point of view has been almost 
entirely absent from the power groups that directed most of human 
history, and we haven't been better for it. 

</P>
<P>
	July 1  
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Enquirer, on the Supreme Court and disability:  
</P>
<P>
	Certain government agencies think airlines should hire extremely  
nearsighted pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity  
Commission also thought a supermarket chain should hire a partially 
blind truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected those ``rights'' and  
restricted the definition of disability to restore legitimacy to 
the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Two pilots with 20/200 vision sued because United Airlines  
refused to hire them. The court rejected their claim. 
</P>
<P>
	A Kansas truck driver who failed a Department of Transportation  
vision test was fired and also sued. The court rejected his claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is currently trying to force Exxon to hire former  
alcoholics and drug addicts unless Exxon can prove it would pose a 
``direct threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The oil company paid billions for hiring a former alcoholic who  
ran a supertanker aground in Alaska, causing a notorious oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruling should curb excess by federal agencies.  
Further abuse of the ADA will repeal protections for genuinely 
disabled Americans. 

</P>
<P>
	June 30  
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Herald, on U.S. refugee policy:  
</P>
<P>
	Ugly is the word that comes to mind, followed by shameful and  
sad and senseless. With the unblinking stare of live television, 
countless numbers of viewers witnessed the arbitrary and too-often 
cruel application of U.S. refugee policy. ... 
</P>
<P>
	This drama unfolded just a few hundred yards off the beach of  
Surfside when the Coast Guard was alerted to the plight of six 
Cuban men in a tiny wooden boat paddling toward shore. ... 
</P>
<P>
	A shocking confrontation ensued as Coast Guard crewmen on a  
larger boat turned a water cannon on the refugees; a second Coast 
Guardsman unnecessarily doused one of the six Cubans with noxious 
spray as the refugee was treading water. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But also subject to review should be the U.S. refugee policy  
that caused this ugly scene, guiding the Coast Guard's action. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The difference between freedom and a return to tyranny was the  
ability to touch the sand on Surfside's beach. That's the law. 
There must be a better way, for the sake of those seeking freedom 
and for the sake of our Coast Guard, which shouldn't be made to act 
as guards for Castro's jail. 

</P>
<P>
	July 1  
</P>
<P>
	San Diego Union-Tribune, on anthrax vaccine:  
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon's decision to inoculate American military personnel  
against highly lethal anthrax contamination is firmly supported by 
potential battlefield threats and sound medical science. Defense 
Secretary William Cohen should not abandon this necessary program 
because of the tiny minority of soldiers, airmen, sailors and 
Marines who have refused to take the vaccine based on 
unsubstantiated claims about its safety. 
</P>
<P>
	There is ample evidence Iraq has developed an array of  
biological weapons, including anthrax, which can be spread over a 
battlefield in dustlike spores. Once inhaled, anthrax toxins cause 
internal bleeding and, in 90 percent of cases, death if left 
untreated. 
</P>
<P>
	The military services would be derelict if they failed to  
protect U.S. personnel from the anthrax threat, especially when a 
vaccine is readily available to counter it. Moreover, it would 
undermine good order and discipline ... if the Pentagon allowed 
some personnel to refuse the vaccine. 

</P>
<P>
	July 2  
</P>
<P>
	Quad-City Times of Davenport, Iowa, on Holbrooke nomination:  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being a good senator who looks out for the  
interests of Iowans, Chuck Grassley is a man of ethics and high 
principles. Even when he takes what others consider to be the wrong 
course of action, he does so for all the right reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	So it is with his decision to place a hold on the nomination of  
Richard Holbrooke for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley says he'll invoke a Senate rule that allows one senator  
to delay such nominations unless the State Department rescinds a 
decision to transfer one of its employees who has been critical of 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	What does that transfer have to do with Holbrooke?  
</P>
<P>
	Nothing.  
</P>
<P>
	The employee, Linda Shenwick, until recently worked as a senior  
civil service employee at the U.S. mission to the United Nations in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley questions whether her transfer to a lesser job in  
Washington was in retaliation for her efforts to reveal alleged 
waste and mismanagement at the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
	So now he's calling for negotiations with the State Department  
on resolving her case. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke ... doesn't deserve to have his job put on ice over an  
issue he's uninvolved in and is incapable of resolving. 

</P>
<P>
	July 5  
</P>
<P>
	Der Bund of Bern, Switzerland, on Northern Ireland:  
</P>
<P>
	Tony Blair's timetable didn't work: the British prime minister  
had set his ``final deadline'' for the Northern Ireland parties so 
that the Protestants would have signed up to the provincial 
government before the beginning of the summer marching season. 
Instead of that, the arguments over the realization of the peace 
agreement have heated up. 
</P>
<P>
	The Unionists are crashing into it not only with their  
determined columns of marchers but also with heavy verbal attacks 
that their loyalty to Great Britain should be forbidden in this 
way. Blair has ``betrayed'' them with the proposal to create the 
government first and then to begin the disarming of the Catholic 
IRA underground army.'' 

</P>
<P>
	July 6  
</P>
<P>
	Die Welt of Berlin, on new Israeli government:  
</P>
<P>
	The path was arduous, the coalition negotiations dragged on.  
Ehud Barak succeeded at the last moment to gather his men from all 
possible parties to unite behind him in a government coalition, 
which with 75 of 120 parliament seats finally holds a solid 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice of his colleagues already indicates Barak's course.  
The future government chief took partners -- whether orthodox or 
secular, whether right or left -- who are willing to level things 
with the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak will quickly now start negotiations with Syria (if that  
isn't already being done secretly), speedily come together with 
Arafat, and rapidly improve the disturbed stand with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In short he will do everything that was not, or only slightly  
possible, with the Likud. With interior policies Barak will 
certainly have it more difficult. Schas and his rigid rightist 
religious nationalists partners will force him to replace the 
announced course of secularism with a decisive either or policy. 

</P>
<P>
	July 6  
</P>
<P>
	Le Figaro of Paris, on Algeria's decision to grant amnesty to  
Islamic militants: 
</P>
<P>
	Is Abdelaziz Bouteflika in a position to win his bet? ... He  
came to power in the worst conditions. ... He represented a 
detestable past, that of the FLN, which, with its Marxist 
wheeler-dealer police regime, exploited the country to its bones. 
</P>
<P>
	In the blink of an eye, Mr. Bouteflika has changed his regime.  
... He has pleaded for a market economy and denounced corruption. 
... And he has held his hand out to terrorists repenting 
fundamentalism. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Will Algeria finally be able to turn the page? Mr. Bouteflika  
cannot fail. At a time when the terrorists are showing signs of 
weakness, his policy of reconciliation ... is beginning to bear 
fruit. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the wounds must be healed. That is Mr. Bouteflika's  
mission. But he will only succeed if he ... completely follows a

	Asahi Shimbun of Tokyo, on development aid:  
</P>
<P>
	The government has entered the final phase of putting together a  
medium-term policy on official development assistance, which will 
serve as the guideline for Japan's economic aid to poor countries 
in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's official assistance to other countries has exceeded 1.5  
trillion yen ($12.5 billion) this fiscal year. Japanese aid has 
been larger than that of any other countries for eight consecutive 
years. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Government ministries concerned with official development  
assistance only seem to care about protecting their vested 
interests in the allocation of assistance money. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, moreover, there have been increased calls to  
use the assistance as leverage for achieving immediate diplomatic 
goals, such as votes for the developing countries at the United 
Nations. If the Japanese government is too shortsighted, it would 
soon lose interest in the developing world. And international trust 
in Japan would only dwindle.

	The Jordan Times of Amman, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Albanian and Serb leaders in Kosovo are trying desperately to  
heal wounds and bring their respective communities into terms with 
new realities. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have condemned the atrocities committed by Belgrade  
but called on Kosovars not to vent their anger by avenging the 
crimes against humanity committed by Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	If in fact the war launched by Belgrade against the Kosovars was  
the making of a ultranationalist Serbs and did not enjoy grassroots 
support, then the task of reconciliation should not be too 
difficult. If on the other hand, the Serbs militancy enjoyed public 
support, then the mission of bringing the two peoples together 
could be very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The international community should press ahead with the  
objective of democratization in Yugoslavia as soon as possible. A 
democratic Yugoslavia would readily accept to grant the Kosovars 
the right to determine their future.

<HEADLINE> ESPN Scores High With Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On a day devoted to barbecues and fireworks,  
ESPN managed to set a record for soccer coverage when the U.S. 
women beat Brazil on the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was watched in 2.9 million homes. It was the largest  
number of households to watch a soccer telecast on the cable 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	The viewership topped the 1994 men's World Cup game between the  
United States and Colombia. That game attracted 2.7 million homes 
and had a 4.3 cable rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's 2-0 victory over Brazil posted a 3.8 cable rating.  
</P>
<P>
	The victory nearly doubled the 2.19 mark that the women  
registered in their quarterfinal win over Germany, which was also 
on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	The semifinal boosted ESPN's overall Women's World Cup ratings  
to a 1.5 in seven telecasts, with an average of 1.1 million 
households. ESPN2 has a .5 mark in 23 telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 men's World Cup had a .94 rating in 27 ESPN telecasts  
and a .5 mark on 23 games shown on ESPN2. However, many games were 
shown at poor times for American viewers because the tournament was 
in France. Also, the United States finished last in the 32-team 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN averaged a 1.6 rating in 34 telecasts for the 1994 men's  
World Cup, which was held in the United States. However, the only 
U.S. game broadcast by the cable network was the game against 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	The American women's tournament-opening win over Denmark last  
month was watched in 1.7 million homes on ABC. Their victory 
against Nigeria was seen in 1.4 million homes on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States advanced to the quarterfinals last Sunday with  
a win against North Korea. The game received a 1.96 rating and was 
seen in 1.3 million homes. It was the highest rating for any soccer 
match on ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program. Each cable point represents 766,000 
homes on ESPN and 644,000 homes on ESPN2.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Wohlers Has Elbow Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Reliever Mark Wohlers, determined to keep  
alive his faltering baseball career, has had major reconstructive 
elbow surgery and hopes to pitch for the Cincinnati Reds next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Atlanta Braves closer never played for the Reds after  
they acquired him in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Wohlers had the operation Tuesday in Birmingham,  
Ala. Orthopedic surgeon James Andrews and Reds team physician 
Timothy Kremchek grafted a tendon from Wohlers' left forearm into 
his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	He agreed to the reconstructive surgery in hopes of rescuing his  
career after a magnetic resonance imaging test detected the torn 
ligament last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers felt a burning sensation after throwing a pitch during  
his minor league rehabilitation assignment two weeks ago and became 
concerned when the elbow didn't improve. That led to the MRI 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers got the final three outs in the Braves' World Series  
championship in 1995, but suddenly lost his ability to throw 
strikes last season. Since his trade to Cincinnati, he had been 
pitching in the minor leagues in hopes of regaining his control and 
working his way back to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	His elbow injury has thrown his playing future into doubt.  
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers set a Braves record with 39 saves in 1996 and had 33 the  
following season. He pulled a muscle in his left side early last 
year and lost his control in May. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sent to the Braves' Triple-A Richmond affiliate twice to  
try to regain his control, but never found it. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Braves tried to send him back to the minors, he  
declined the assignment, prompting the trade to the Reds. The 
Braves agreed to pay Wohlers' $5.2 million salary this season and 
the $800,000 buyout for next year, the last on his contract.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Sues Boeing for $750M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Hyundai's aerospace affiliate has sued  
Boeing Co. for $750 million, accusing the aircraft giant of 
bad-faith dealings in Hyundai's contract to supply wings for a new 
Boeing passenger jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai Space &AMP; Aircraft Co. said Boeing and a subsidiary  
stalled on parts deliveries, made thousands of design changes, 
failed to provide skilled workers, fabricated performance 
requirements and falsely accused Hyundai of contract violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose was to induce Hyundai to walk away from the contract  
so a Boeing subsidiary could take over the wing supplies, the South 
Korean company said Tuesday in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boeing's interference has thwarted (Hyundai's) efforts to  
expand its commercial aerospace business,'' the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman John Thom said Wednesday the company would not  
comment on an ongoing suit. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Hyundai was one of 16 major suppliers for the 717 jet, a  
twin-engine, 100-seat plane designed for short-haul trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai entered the contract in 1996 with McDonnell Douglas  
Corp., which Boeing took over in 1997. A McDonnell Douglas 
subsidiary in Canada, now a Boeing subsidiary, was a subcontractor. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit said Hyundai spent more than $300 million to build a  
manufacturing plant in Seosan, South Korea, and Boeing promised to 
provide trained workers but never did. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's Toronto subsidiary, which is supposed to provide parts  
for the wings, regularly ships them late and often sends the wrong 
parts, the suit said. It said Boeing and a subsidiary have imposed 
more than 4,000 design changes on Hyundai and its subcontractors in 
less than three years, drastically increasing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	After one Boeing subsidiary failed to deliver wing assemblies to  
Hyundai last October, Boeing withdrew part of its order to Hyundai, 
said another Boeing company would handle that part of the project, 
and demanded that Hyundai pay the extra production costs, the suit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Boeing's design changes and delays, Hyundai's  
subcontractors have threatened to end their agreements with Hyundai 
unless they received substantial price increases, Hyundai said.

<HEADLINE> China's Fu Mingxia Wins Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- For much of the  
evening, it was like Fu Mingxia had never left. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutting through the water's surface with the same, nearly  
splashless entries that earned her three Olympic gold medals before 
her 1996 retirement, the diminutive diver made her return to 
international competition a success Wednesday by winning the 
10-meter platform title in the University Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Fu triumphed on the strength of three brilliant efforts against  
the backdrop of a gray-blue sky at Palma's new Son Hugo swimming 
and diving complex. Her fifth and last dive, though, was shaky and 
made the final margin tight. 
</P>
<P>
	She finished with 522.390 points to beat Chinese teammate Wang  
Rui by 0.390. Canada's Anne Montminy took the bronze with 504.930. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not very satisfied with today's performance. I expected  
to do better,'' Fu, 21, said through a translator. ``It's a little 
bit difficult to come back to competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her form suggested she could be a factor in the 2000 Sydney  
Olympics if she opts to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just did what she needed to win today,'' Fu's trainer, Fen  
Yu, said. ``I think she'll be ready'' for Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere Wednesday, Ukraine upset the defending champion  
American team 81-70 in women's basketball to earn a top seed for 
Friday's quarterfinals. The United States (2-1) still advances to 
the final eight, along with host Spain, Lithuania, Portugal, 
Taiwan, Russia and Canada. The United States men, winners of five 
straight gold medals, beat Lithuania 97-88 in preliminary round 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	At the pool, Mark Warkentin of the United States captured his  
fourth gold medal with a comfortable victory in the 400-meter 
freestyle. He'll aim to join the handful of athletes who have won 
as many as five golds in a single University Games by winning the 
1,500 freestyle on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	His was one of seven American medals in the pool. Amy Balcerzak  
gave the team its other gold in the 100 breaststroke, edging 
teammate and 1996 Olympic champion Amanda Beard. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's top individual performance came from Adam Pine, who  
studies at Nebraska. He took the 100 butterfly in 53.81, and half 
an hour later anchored Australia's victory in the men's 4x100 
freestyle relay. Italy was second and the United States third, the 
first relay the Americans have failed to win here. 
</P>
<P>
	In diving, Katherine Pesek of the United States was 10th behind  
the 5-foot-2 Fu, who will also compete in the 3-meter springboard 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fu's platform and springboard golds in the Atlanta Games made  
her the first woman in 36 years to win both Olympic events. She 
added those to her platform gold from the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Fu, who was 12 when she won her first world title, quit the  
sport shortly after Atlanta, although she had to petition the 
government for permission. 
</P>
<P>
	She now studies economics at Beijing's prestigious Qinghua  
University. 
</P>
<P>
	China has an advantage in training over American college divers,  
who are restricted by the NCAA in how many hours they can work out. 
That has helped the Chinese dominate the sport since the 1984 
Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Deaths Increase at Start of Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Addicts spending their first-of-the-month government checks on  
drugs and drink probably explain why the number of deaths in the 
United States rises at the start of every month and drops at the 
end, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	University of California-San Diego sociologist David P. Phillips  
and colleagues reached that conclusion after analyzing nearly 32 
million electronic death certificates over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers suggested that addicts get aid that can be used  
only for food, clothes and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wouldn't do that for the country as a whole. But you could  
try it out for a pilot project and see if it would make any 
difference,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips found that, during an average year, there were 4,320  
more deaths in the first week of every month than in the last week 
of the preceding month. 
</P>
<P>
	That's about a 1 percent difference. But the gap widened when  
the researchers looked at killings, suicides or accidents in which 
drugs or drink played a part. 
</P>
<P>
	For every 100 such deaths at the end of a month, there were 106  
or 107 at the start. And the difference doubled, to about 14, when 
the death certificates listed both drugs and alcohol as a cause. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 106.5 homicides at the start of the month for every  
100 at the end, according to the study was published in today's New 
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also did a breakdown by race and found that  
during the first week of the month vs. the last week, there were 
nearly 29 extra homicides, suicides and accidents involving 
substance abuse among minorities, compared with 10 extra such 
deaths among whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Welfare, Social Security and veterans benefit checks are sent  
out at the start of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	The study ``really highlights the extraordinary toll of  
substance abuse,'' said Lisa Najavits, a professor of psychology at 
Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips got the idea for his study from a 1995 report on 105  
schizophrenic cocaine addicts treated at a Los Angeles veterans 
hospital. They were most likely to test positive for cocaine, to 
have their worst psychiatric symptoms and to need psychiatric 
hospitalization during the first week of each month -- and least 
likely during the last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wondering if the findings apply to the general population,  
Phillips and his colleagues looked at deaths from 1973 through 
1988. (The electronic death data provided by the National Center 
for Health Statistics after 1988 include only the month of death, 
not the date.) 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said some people may object that giving addicts  
``in-kind'' aid rather than money is treating them like children. 
</P>
<P>
	``But for people who do have drug and alcohol habits, that  
person is not making the decision himself how to use the money. His 
habit is making that decision for him,'' he said. ``Why should one 
feed his habit by giving him extra money for it?''

<HEADLINE> Gonzalez OK With Fans' All-Star Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Let Juan Gonzalez stew.  
</P>
<P>
	And bake, boil, simmer, do the slow burn or a fast flambe. Like  
it matters. Like anybody beside Gonzalez' relatives cares anymore 
whether he's really steamed enough to stay away from next week's 
All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, baseball announced the eight starting position  
players for the American League team as voted on by its fans. 
Gonzalez, who plays for Texas, came in fifth among outfielders, 
trailing leading vote-getter Ken Griffey of Seattle and the 
Cleveland Indians' trio of Manny Ramirez, Kenny Lofton and David 
Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect the fans, '' Gonzalez said, ``but if they don't vote  
for me, I don't want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As threats go, this one lacks the immediacy of, say, global  
warming. Even as All-Star sulks go, it comes in a very distant 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty years ago, then-Cardinals shortstop Garry Templeton, like  
Gonzalez, was having a monster first half. He was leading the 
entire National League in hits and everybody at his position in 
nearly every offensive category. But as the balloting drew near the 
close, Templeton remained mired in fourth, behind Larry Bowa, Dave 
Concepcion and a fast-improving shortstop he would soon swap cities 
with, Ozzie Smith, who was then playing in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Templeton told the fans to bump him to No. 1 or watch him spend  
the three-day break in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I ain't starting,'' he warned, ``I ain't departing.''  
</P>
<P>
	The fans didn't relent, and neither did Templeton. Despite being  
named Bowa's backup by NL manager Tommy Lasorda, he refused to show 
up at the 1979 game. A year later, Smith made the first of 12 
consecutive All-Star appearances and a total of 15. Templeton was 
invited back exactly once more, in 1985. Today, he's remembered as 
much for his pouting as his playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Templeton, Gonzalez has a legitimate beef.  
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, his numbers through Monday -- a .316 average, 23  
home runs and 77 RBIs -- are nearly identical to those put up by 
Griffey and Ramirez, and considerably better than what either 
Justice or Lofton have posted. 
</P>
<P>
	For another, the balloting was run like a Chicago ward-heeler's  
dream. The opportunities to vote early and often were abundant in 
Cleveland, which had 22 home games during the election period, 
compared to just eight for Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Gonzalez' teammate, Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez,  
still managed to edge out the Indians' Sandy Alomar. What that 
proves is that Gonzalez, like Templeton before him, has failed to 
grasp the most important point. Whether we're talking about 
sanctioning votes at the United Nations, wet T-shirt contests in 
bars or balloting for the All-Star game, what we're deciding, 
finally, is popularity. Which is not always a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice in the past, the results have been maddening enough for  
baseball to step in and reserve the vote for itself. The first time 
came in 1935, just two years after the midsummer classic game made 
its debut, and the league's managers kept the privilege for 
themselves until 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	The second time fans lost the vote was in 1957, when the good  
burghers of Cincinnati put Reds in all eight starting positions and 
forced then-comissioner Ford Frick's hand. To give you some idea of 
how audacious the ballot-box stuffing was that year, consider the 
players Frick named to replace three of the ``elected'' Cincinnati 
starters. Their names were Stan Musial, Willie Mays and Hank Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	So where does Gonzalez go from here?  
</P>
<P>
	If he's smart, first to the All-Star game and then back to work.  
Already, the fans in Oakland booed Gonzalez every chance they got 
Tuesday night. In that same way, they will know where to find him 
when it's his time for praise as well. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, they made right one of the great injustices in  
All-Star balloting history. In 1970, even as commissioner Bowie 
Kuhn ordered the vote returned to the fans, baseball held onto the 
nominating process. At every position each ballot listed just six 
names, except for outfield. There were 18 outfielders nominated in 
the NL that year, but Rico Carty's name was not among them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves outfielder was recovering from a serious  
illness and had played just 104 games the season before. But Carty 
still managed to hit .342 in 1969, and when he tore off a 31-game 
hit streak in the first half of 1970, the ballots looked woefully 
inadequate, even though names like Aaron, Mays, Roberto Clemente, 
Lou Brock and Billy Williams filled the outfield slots. 
</P>
<P>
	And so the fans wrote the happy ending themselves. More than a  
half-million scribbled Rico Carty's name in the margin, making him 
the first write-in candidate ever to start the All-Star game. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Charge Dropped Against NYC Cop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An attempted murder charge was dismissed against  
a police officer who shot an unarmed squeegee man in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Supreme Court Judge John Collins on Tuesday dismissed the charge  
against Officer Michael Meyer, 29, along with a lesser charge, 
criminal use of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer could get 25 years in prison on each of two remaining  
counts of first-degree assault in the June 1998 shooting of Antoine 
Reid on an expressway off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer was off duty and driving home from a baseball game when  
Reid tried to wash his windshield for a handout. Meyer bolted from 
his car and shot Reid once in the stomach with a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said Meyer was provoked into shooting Reid, a  
drug and alcohol abuser who had been arrested seven times at the 
corner where the shooting occurred -- once for an armed robbery in 
which the squeegee was the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid is suing the city for $100 million.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Suspect Warned of Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Racial shooting rampage suspect Benjamin Smith  
warned in a recent video that violence and terrorism was 
``inevitable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The video was shown today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,''  
which told viewers ABC News had purchased it. 
</P>
<P>
	The network didn't disclose how much it paid but ABC News  
spokeswoman Sonya McNair said later it was made by a student 
documentary filmmaker working on a project on white supremacy 
groups in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC said the video was recorded three weeks ago. Smith is seen  
driving his car in Peoria and tossing pamphlets out the window 
while complaining of police harassment and the ``Jewish 
occupational government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To want to live in a world where blacks have power over  
whites, where Jews are in control, I think that's a sickness and 
I'd like to eradicate that sickness. In some ways it's inevitable -- 
racial holy war,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told his interviewer that he was involved in what he  
called ``a life or death struggle for the future of our race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities blame the 21-year-old white supremacist for a  
two-state shooting spree that began Friday in the Chicago area and 
ended Sunday with his suicide in southern Illinois. Two other 
people were killed and nine were wounded in Illinois and Indiana -- 
all of them black, Jewish or of Asian descent. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Today'' show broadcast portions of its own interview  
with Smith on Tuesday and today. The network did not pay for the 
interview, which was acquired through something of a lucky break.

	A student intern at ``Today'' had interviewed Smith for a school  
project at Indiana University in September 1998. He retrieved the

<HEADLINE> Businesses in Poor Areas Struggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Leon Singleton's South Los Angeles hair salon  
has been looted by rioting mobs and battered by an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most difficult time came later, when the 61-year-old  
entrepreneur applied for a loan to rebuild. Three banks and three 
finance companies turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say it was the biggest challenge because I didn't think I  
could get a loan,'' Singleton said in an interview. ``At my age I 
was like washed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singleton, who eventually got a loan through a redevelopment  
agency, said his problem is not unique among minority 
small-business owners in America's economically blighted 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	He and others hope things will improve when President Clinton  
visits South Los Angeles on Thursday to discuss a plan to bring a 
mix of private and public investment to the nation's poor 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit is part of a national tour designed to focus attention  
on America's chronically underserved towns and cities. 
</P>
<P>
	In coming to the South LA, Clinton also is returning to an area  
he first visited as a candidate in May 1992, a few days after the 
city was decimated by three days of rioting that left 55 people 
dead and 720 buildings destroyed or damaged by fire. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's visit is important not only for the money Clinton is  
proposing to invest, but because it could help convince more banks 
and corporations that they can make money by doing business in 
underserved communities, local leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really applaud what he is doing. I think if there's any  
constructive criticism, we all wish this kind of bully pulpit had 
been used earlier,'' said John Bryant, founder of Operation Hope, a 
private foundation that has partnered with banks to arrange $45 
million in home and business loans for residents of South and East 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will find that things have changed in South LA since his  
first visit. After the riots, banks and federal redevelopment 
programs have made millions of dollars in loans and grants to local 
businesses, and many damaged areas have been rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	And while residents welcome the government's help, there is a  
thriving spirit of free-enterprise and self-reliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza mall, boosted by a Magic  
Johnson movie theater and its proximity to affluent black 
neighborhoods, is booming with an occupancy rate of more than 90 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, retailers have opened new stores. Three banks,  
Washington Mutual, Wells Fargo and Hawthorne Savings, partnered 
with Operation Hope to open banking centers where residents can 
apply for loans and take classes on managing their finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a spirit of self-reliance that has built on itself  
since 1992,'' Bryant said. ``That I can't rely on anybody else to 
take care of me but me. ... What people are basically saying now is 
give me a hand up, not a hand out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The improvements, however, have been spotty. Many neighborhoods  
such as Singleton's, in the heart of South LA, still struggle with 
crime and unemployment. Singleton got his loan through the 
Community Financial Resource Center, where officials were eager to 
stop the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency arranged for a $40,000 loan to repair the shop that  
Singleton opened in 1969. Since rebuilding, Singleton has made just 
enough money to cover his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, he thinks of moving out. He stays to show young  
people that free enterprise is a better route than crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've got to leave something. I shouldn't just walk  
away,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Community leaders credit Clinton with fostering an environment  
that has helped minority-owned businesses survive and grow. And 
programs such as the one Clinton is proposing could help if it 
actually reaches entrepreneurs who create jobs, said Patricia 
Means, publisher of Turning Point magazine, a publication that 
focuses on African-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be less reliance on government involvement,  
more on private sector involvement,'' she said. ``We have seen in 
the past that there are so many strings attached to government 
involvement, usually the programs are written so that only a small 
percentage of people can take advantage of them.''

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Supremacist Gun Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- A man was charged today with illegally  
selling guns used by a white supremacist who went on a deadly 
shooting spree. An affidavit said that the alleged dealer's records 
had been seized last week -- the day before the shootings began. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald R. Fiessinger, 64, of the central Illinois town of Pekin,  
was scheduled to appear in federal court today on charges that he 
sold the guns to Benjamin Smith without a license, according to 
Sharon Paul, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in 
Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 21, killed himself Sunday as police tried to arrest him,  
ending a string of shootings in Illinois and Indiana from Friday to 
Sunday that killed two people and wounded nine others -- all of them 
black, Jewish or of Asian descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiessinger had been under investigation for illegal gun sales  
before the shooting spree, according to Jerry Singer, special agent 
for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The guns allegedly sold to Smith last month were among ``dozens  
of guns'' that Fiessinger is charged with selling illegally, Singer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an affidavit by Daniel Volk, agent with the federal  
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Fiessinger advertised 
weapons in the classified section of a local newspaper. Based on 
those ads, two undercover ATF agents arranged to buy weapons from 
Fiessinger on Thursday -- only days after he allegedly sold the guns 
to Smith and the day before the series of shootings began. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Thursday evening, federal agents recovered 27 firearms,  
$330 in cash and records of firearms sales during a search of 
Fiessinger's home, the affidavit said. Volk said Fiessinger told 
him that he thought he was keeping the required federal and state 
records for firearms but knew that he should have obtained a 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	After the weekend's shootings, Fiessinger called Volk on Tuesday  
and told him he remembered selling Smith the two guns found with 
his body, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiessinger said Smith told him he was going to use the guns for  
hunting. He also said he didn't know of Smith's white supremacist 
beliefs or potential for violence, according to the affidavit. The 
affidavit wasn't clear on whether Smith's name had been in the 
records seized the previous Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities began investigating Fiessinger as an illegal  
guns dealer after a handgun he bought was seized from another 
person during a traffic stop, Volk said. Records showed Fiessinger 
had bought 65 handguns legally from one Pekin store, the Old 
Prairie Trading Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked today to comment about the affidavit, Old Prairie owner  
Robert Hayes sounded surprised and said he had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had been rejected by a regular gun dealer last month  
because a background check showed that an ex-girlfriend who says he 
had abused her had taken out a protection order against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Dave Sanders, a spokesman for the Illinois State Police,  
said the state issued Smith the gun owner's ID card June 18. That 
background check didn't turn up the protection order because the 
order had Smith's middle initial and other details wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith tried to buy two 9 mm handguns and a shotgun on June 23 at  
Heights Gun and Hunter Supplies in Peoria Heights, Singer said. 
After the second background check led to his rejection, Smith 
bought a Bryco .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun on June 26 and 
.22-caliber pistol on June 29 from the unlicensed dealer, Singer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's experience and the devastation he wrought has renewed  
the debate over gun control just weeks after Congress considered -- 
but did not agree on -- new restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This unfortunately hits home the point that we have to start  
regulating the secondary market as well,'' including gun shows, 
unlicensed gun dealers and sales over the Internet, said Lisa Morel 
Las, the director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The arguments echo those in the wake of the April massacre at  
Columbine High School in Colorado and the recent debate in 
Congress: Gun control activists say the case demonstrates the 
inadequacy of the nation's gun laws, while the gun lobby says the 
problem is lax enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association argues the system broke down even  
before Smith stepped out of the store and into the world of illegal 
gun dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits convicted felons and anyone under such an  
order from purchasing a firearm. Smith's application was denied at 
the gun shop, and the NRA says he should also have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities say it's not that simple. Singer said that a  
denial can trigger an investigation, but authorities simply do not 
have enough information to make an immediate arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a member of a white supremacist group called the World  
Church of the Creator, distributed hate literature while he was a 
student at the University of Illinois and later a student at 
Indiana University in Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say his holiday rampage included shootings in  
Chicago, two of its suburbs, three Downstate Illinois cities and 
Bloomington. Killed were former Northwestern University basketball 
coach Ricky Byrdsong and Won-Joon Yoon, a South Korean doctoral 
student at Indiana University. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are trying to determine Smith's motive and if he had  
any outside assistance. FBI agent Doug Garrison said Matt Hale, the 
supremacist group's leader, would not be implicated in the spree 
simply for his beliefs.

<HEADLINE> Mazda Recalling New Minivan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Mazda Motor Corp. has recalled the first of its  
new 2000 MPV minivans because they were fitted with a wrong 
combination of engine parts, which could cause a fuel leak. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall announced Wednesday came just days after the  
redesigned MPV went on sale at some dealers. Only 87 of the 
affected minivans reached consumers, most on the West Coast, and 
each owner has been contacted by phone to get the necessary 
repairs, Mazda spokesman Brian Betz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the vehicles were in dealer, port or distribution  
inventories and were being fixed, said Duke Hale, vice president of 
customer service for Mazda North America operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the minivans were built with the wrong combination of  
lower intake manifold, fuel injector and fuel rail assembly, which 
could cause a rough idle or a fuel leak. Mazda said it was unaware 
of any leaks arising from the mistake, however.

<HEADLINE> Doyle Is a Favorite in Senior Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- For a budding golf star, Allen  
Doyle is about as low key as they come. 
</P>
<P>
	He has an unorthodox swing that looks more like a slap shot in  
hockey. Upon graduating from the senior tour qualifying school, he 
went all out and bought himself a truck. He didn't even turn pro 
until he was 46 and did so partly to make a few extra bucks to pay 
for his daughters' college. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there he sat, with three senior tour victories and more than  
$1 million already in the bank this year, talking about his role as 
one of the favorites in the U.S. Senior Open, which starts 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am legitimate, I think,'' Doyle said. ``I wouldn't mind  
seeing the fairways a little tighter. Then I might be a little more 
confident of my chances. But I am capable. There is not anything 
that anybody would like more than me than to win the U.S. Senior 
Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle has been sensational in his first full season on the  
senior tour, one of the few areas in sports where it's an advantage 
to be a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	He ranks second in earnings to Bruce Fleisher, also a senior  
rookie, and his three victories include one of the majors, a 
2-stroke win at the PGA Seniors Championship at Palm Beach Garden, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	His other victories came at the ACE Group Classic and the NFL  
Golf Classic. And the more he wins, the higher he has to set his 
goals. Doyle had started out on the modest side, hoping only to 
finish among the top 31, which would have automatically qualified 
him for next year's Tour, and maybe win a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have been thrilled with that,'' he said. ``After you  
win once, you change your goal to top 20 and two wins. After you 
win again, then you want a fourth win and you want top five.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having played in the U.S. Open several times as an amateur,  
getting that fourth win in the Senior Open would be special. He'll 
be among 156 golfers playing the 6,888-yard, par-72 Des Moines Golf 
and Country Club course, which is the site of a major tournament 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher, who has won four tournaments in his first year as a  
senior, also is entered, and so is defending champion Hale Irwin, 
who after a slow start this year has won three of his last five 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the field include Larry Nelson, No. 3 on the money  
list; Vicente Fernandez, last year's runner-up; Graham Marsh, 
winner of The Tradition this year; and Christy O'Connor, coming off 
a victory in the State Farm Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll have to contend with a course that will put a premium on  
approach shots and putting. The golfers have found the undulating 
greens to be especially challenging in their practice rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anyone that thinks they are just going to tear this  
golf course up is wrong,'' said Arnold Palmer, who at 69 is the 
tournament's oldest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor suggested that a guy could be in contention without  
breaking par. Irwin won last year at Riviera near Los Angeles at 
1-over-par. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't mind sitting here at about 2-over (on Sunday),''  
said O'Connor, whose victory last Sunday was his first on the 
senior tour. ``I would be very, very happy. I'd let the rest of the 
field play. I think if it blows any, I would be very, very 
comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle said it will be important to stay patient and not get  
frustrated by a couple of bad shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to handle it properly and realize there is a long way  
to go,'' he said. ``It's not so much the guy who makes the most 
birdies that is going to win, but the guy who makes the fewest 
bogeys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin, the top player on the tour last year, is trying to become  
the third to win back-to-back titles in the Senior Open. He won 
last year after opening with a 77, the highest one-round score for 
a winner in the history of the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly this championship, from a career perspective, will  
always be at the top of my list,'' Irwin said. ``I would love to 
repeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Open will be the biggest golf event staged in Iowa and  
already has been a stunning success at the gate. The tournament was 
sold out in advance for the first time and the practice rounds drew 
crowds of 25,000 Monday, 27,000 Tuesday and 29,000 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin was amazed at the large gallery on Monday, when the  
temperatures climbed into the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was probably the biggest crowd I have seen on a Monday  
anywhere in a tournament,'' he said. ``It was an unbelievable 
display of support and enthusiasm.''

<HEADLINE> Mercedes-Benz, Lexus Score High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Midsize sport utility vehicles from Mercedes-Benz  
and Lexus performed the best in the latest sport utility vehicle 
crash tests performed by an insurance industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said Wednesday that  
it gave its ``best pick'' rating to the 1999 Mercedes-Benz M-class 
and Lexus RX300, based on its frontal offset crash test in which 
the vehicles were driven at 40 mph into a deformable barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest test, six 1999 SUVs with new designs were rated.  
The worst performer was the Mitsubishi Montero Sport, which was 
rated poor for a major collapse of the driver-passenger 
compartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a huge difference between the best and worst  
performers,'' said Brian O'Neill, institute president. 
</P>
<P>
	Other models tested were the popular Jeep Grand Cherokee, which  
was rated marginal; and the Dodge Durango and Land Rover Discovery 
II, which were rated acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute's tests are particularly demanding because just  
the driver's side of a vehicle strikes the barrier, forcing a 
relatively small portion of the vehicle to absorb the crash energy. 
The federal government's crash tests involve driving vehicles into 
a rigid barrier with the full width of the front end making 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill said the Mercedes' frame held up particularly well,  
keeping the occupant compartment intact with little or no 
intrusion. By contrast, the instrument panel in the Montero Sport 
was pushed toward the driver dummy, reducing the space available 
for the safety belt and air bag to prevent injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, intrusion into the foot well contributed to the  
likelihood of serious leg injuries in the Montero Sport, O'Neill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi spokesman Kim Custer said the Montero Sport meets or  
exceeds federal safety standards. The government does not use a 
frontal offset crash test, but Custer said the institute's results 
showed that vital areas of the body -- the head, neck and chest -- 
were protected in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has not yet tested the '99 Montero Sport.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill said vehicle designs are being improved to provide  
stronger protection for the occupant compartment as a result of 
crash tests performed in the United States and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two best performers are among the newest designs in the  
vehicle group we tested,'' O'Neill noted. ``This likely had a lot 
to do with their good performances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest test results, combined with earlier tests for nine  
other models with still-current designs, provide ratings for the 
most popular midsize SUVs on the market. Among the models tested 
earlier, only the Toyota 4Runner earned the same good overall 
rating as the Mercedes and Lexus SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute notes that the energy a vehicle must absorb in a  
crash test increases with the vehicle's weight, so its tests are 
more demanding of heavier vehicles such as SUVs. But occupants of 
SUVs and other heavier vehicles in real-world, two-vehicle crashes 
typically fare better than people in cars. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The institute's test results are available on the World Wide Web  
at www.highwaysafety.org. NHTSA's test results are available at 
www.nhtsa.dot.gov.

<HEADLINE> Inhaled Drug Effective Against Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- A drug inhaled once a day proved  
effective in helping to prevent two common flu strains, researchers 
reported today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the study, University of Michigan epidemiologist  
Dr. Arnold Monto, said current flu vaccines remain the best defense 
against the flu, but they require two to four weeks to take effect 
after getting the shot. 
</P>
<P>
	His research found that inhaling Relenza, known generically as  
zanamivir, works against both the Type A and B strains of 
influenza. 
</P>
<P>
	Monto found that more than two-thirds of adults who used the  
drug for four weeks avoided the flu, compared with a group that 
received a placebo. It was even more effective at stopping flu with 
fever, working 84 percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The study followed 1,107 students at the University of Michigan  
and the University of Missouri during the 1997 flu season. They 
kept diaries to note any flu symptoms and rate their severity. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's numbers are small because that flu season was a  
relatively mild one. Only 34 of 554 people assigned to receive a 
placebo came down with flu compared with 11 of 553 people who took 
Relenza. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common side effects were headache, nasal symptoms, sore  
throat, coughing and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza, made by GlaxoWellcome Inc. and available in Europe, is  
awaiting approval for sale as a flu treatment in the United States. 
A Food and Drug Administration committee has asked for more proof 
about the drug's effectiveness and questioned whether consumers 
could use inhalers. 
</P>
<P>
	An editorial accompanying the JAMA report raised the same issue,  
saying that without careful supervision, it ``could prove 
befuddling to the first-time user.''

<HEADLINE> How To Recognize Heat Illnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Heat kills by taxing the human body beyond its abilities.  
Recognizing the symptoms and reacting properly can save lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The human body tries to maintain a constant temperature. When  
cooling is needed, it tries to dissipate excess heat by moving 
blood to the skin and by evaporating sweat. 
</P>
<P>
	When it's too hot for the blood's heat to dissipate through the  
skin, and so humid evaporation is reduced, trouble can set in. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's the National Weather Service's rundown of heat-related  
illnesses: 
</P>
<P>
	--Sunburn: Redness and pain; in severe cases swelling of the  
skin, blisters, fever, headaches. Ointments can help mild cases. If 
blisters break, apply a dry sterile dressing. Serious, extensive 
cases should be seen by a physician. 
</P>
<P>
	--Heat cramps: Painful spasms, usually in the muscles of legs and  
sometimes abdomen, heavy sweating. Firm pressure on cramping 
muscles, or gentle massage, can relieve spasms. Give sips of water. 
If nausea occurs, discontinue water. 
</P>
<P>
	--Heat exhaustion: Heavy sweating, weakness; cold, pale and  
clammy skin; weak pulse, while body temperature may be normal. 
Victim may faint and vomit. Get the victim out of the sun. Have him 
lie down and loosen clothing. Apply cool, wet cloths. Fan or move 
victim to air-conditioned room. Give sips of water. If nausea 
occurs, discontinue water. If vomiting continues, seek immediate 
medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
	--Heatstroke or sunstroke: High body temperature (106 degrees or  
higher), hot, dry skin, rapid and strong pulse, possible 
unconsciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	Heatstroke is a severe medical emergency. Summon medical  
assistance immediately or get the victim to a hospital. Delay can 
be fatal. If waiting for the arrival of emergency assistance, move 
the victim to a cooler environment, reduce temperature with cold 
bath or sponging. Do not give fluids.

<HEADLINE> DuPont To Close Six Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- DuPont will close six plants in the wake  
of its $1.8 billion takeover in March of Herberts, a leading 
European manufacturer of automotive and industrial paints. 
</P>
<P>
	The consolidation will eliminate 500 manufacturing positions and  
800 corporate, marketing and staff positions, DuPont said 
Wednesday. The plants to be closed are located in Caieiras, Brazil; 
Piobesi, Italy; Dagenham, England; Ocoyoacac, Mexico; Porto, 
Portugal; and Saffle, Sweden, the company announced.

<P>
	Production will be shifted to the remaining 40 plants.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to minimize staff redundancies in our merged  
organization,'' said Louis F. Savelli, president of DuPont 
Performance Coatings. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont formed its Performance Coatings unit following the  
acquisition of Herberts, making it the world's leading manufacturer 
of automotive coatings and the third-largest coatings supplier, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to automotive coatings such as finishes and primers,  
the division produces industrial coatings, inks used in ink-jet 
printers, and specialty colorants. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, DuPont said its Performance Coatings division would  
have annual sales of more than $3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the consolidation will be included in the accounting  
for the Herbert acquisition and will not result in any charges to 
1999 earnings, DuPont said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of DuPont fell 81 1/4 cents to close at $69.93 3/4 on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Siemens Investing in Internet Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Industrial giant Siemens plans to use  
profits from the sale of two units to finance acquisitions of U.S. 
Internet companies, a Siemens spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Siemens announced earlier this year it would launch public  
offerings of stock in its Siemens Matsushita Components, and its 
semiconductor business, Infineon Technologies, between October and 
next March. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman did not identify potential buying targets.  
</P>
<P>
	Siemens has declined to estimate potential profits for the  
initial public offerings. But analysts value Infineon at between 
10-20 billion marks, or $5.5-$11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	While the group has not set a date yet for the offerings,  
company officials say Infineon stock could begin trading as early 
as Oct. 12-14.

<HEADLINE> Cleamons to rejoin Jackson, Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jim Cleamons, who won four NBA championship  
rings as an assistant under Phil Jackson at Chicago, will rejoin 
his former boss with the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, lured out of retirement by the Lakers last month, had  
said that he wanted to hire some of his former Bulls staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleamons also played for the Lakers for one season, on their NBA  
title-winning team in 1971-72. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers spokesman John Black said Wednesday that Cleamons had  
agreed to take the job, and it was hoped that a contract would be 
worked out over the next several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleamons, 50, played in the NBA for nine years. He had a brief  
turn as a coach, going 20-78 in 1 1/2 seasons with the Dallas 
Mavericks before being fired in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson also is believed to be pursuing former Bulls assistants  
Jimmy Rodgers and Tex Winter.

<HEADLINE> South Pole Researcher To Get Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Air Force jet flying into an area of  
absolute darkness and extreme cold will parachute emergency medical 
supplies to an American research station at the South Pole next 
week, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplies are for the treatment of a 47-year-old woman who is  
part of a small group staying through the winter at the 
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station operated by the National Science 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who was not identified, is a U.S. citizen employed by  
Antarctic Support Associates, an Englewood, Colo., firm that 
provides logistical support for NSF researchers at the South Pole 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
	NSF director Karl A. Erb said that the woman recently discovered  
a lump in one breast. Medical experts received information about 
the patient through a satellite link, said Erb, and decided that 
the woman could be treated with airdropped medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Pole is now in the midst of its winter. Temperatures  
of minus-80 degrees are common. The sun never rises during this 
season so the pole is in absolute darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	Erb said the conditions make the parachute drop of supplies ``a  
challenging flight for both the aircrew and the aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the NSF said that nobody has ever been rescued  
from the South Pole during the winter and that the last airdrop was 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A C-141 Starlifter from McChord Air Force Base in Tacoma, Wash.,  
will attempt the airdrop Monday, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Voice Actor Plays Woody Woodpecker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``I am the red M&AMP;M,'' Billy West says  
proudly. He's not delusional. 
</P>
<P>
	West is the scarlet candy's TV commercial voice. He's also the  
reborn Woody Woodpecker and Fry in the prime-time animated series 
``Futurama.'' And he has given the gift of the gab to both Ren and 
Stimpy and to a variety of Nickelodeon's wee ones. 
</P>
<P>
	In a new golden age of animation, West is among the golden  
voices. Whether he's called on to revive smarty-pants Woody or 
breathe personality into a chocolate tidbit, the 47-year-old 
performer is an acoustic ace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'm really lucky because my voice goes all over the  
place,'' he said. ``I'm able to go to the basement and I'm also 
able to go up to the stratosphere. It's like having an instrument 
that's flexible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's artistry in the pipes, sure. But there's more at work  
here: How do you decide what an inanimate object like snack food 
might sound like? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you can make a mistake by trying to bring too much  
science to something like that,'' West replies. ``It's pure 
fantasy. ... It's your job to be unafraid and to try stuff and to 
let someone else be the judge of what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The M&AMP;M's voice, for instance, is kind of a ``wise guy me,''  
West says. Then he playfully demonstrates in booming tones: ``You 
have to imagine that I'm sort of a candy-coated Leonardo 
DiCaprio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Revisiting a classic character in ``The Woody Woodpecker Show''  
(part of Fox Kids' Saturday morning lineup) works different 
muscles. The rat-a-tat-tat delivery and laugh originated with Mel 
Blanc, one of animation's venerable voices and a West hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have some nuances that keep the character rooted  
in its original foundation,'' West said. He has license to play 
with the character's sound a bit, but he knows that such 
assignments are not the path to cartoon immortality. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be the next Mel Blanc by running around doing Mel  
Blanc's voices. You have to take every opportunity to attach your 
name to something you had a hand in fashioning,'' West said. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is not to say he has a star complex. In a decidedly  
anonymous line of acting -- ``Most people don't know what I look 
like, which is fine by me,'' he says -- West is simply eager to work 
steadily and to add to his credits, minor or major. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love things the way they are because it's exactly what I  
dreamed of doing when I was really small,'' he said. As a youngster 
in Detroit, he was intrigued by TV cartoons and the versatile 
actors behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd watch a Hanna-Barbera cartoon or a Warner Bros. cartoon  
and I'd hear upwards of 15 to 20 voices. And then I'd read the 
credits and under 'Voices' I'd see two names. That's it. And that 
signified to me that these were very weird, strange people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was something really cool about that, to be off the  
map.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other actor-comedians who played multiple roles also were ``huge  
influences,'' he said, rattling off the names of Jerry Lewis, Danny 
Kaye and ``Your Show of Shows'' star Sid Caesar. 
</P>
<P>
	Expecting radio to be his creative outlet, West began working at  
WBCN in Boston in 1980, with carte blanche to construct comedy bits 
and funny commercials. He moved to New York City and station WXRK 
in 1989, figuring he had reached the pinnacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he was relegated to promoting contests and endlessly  
reciting ``New York's home of classic rock 'n' roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the same mindless, Novocain, brain-numbing pieces of  
information over and over again, and I was losing my mind,'' West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he found an improbable savior.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right down the hall was Howard Stern, who was just beginning  
to bust the walls of conventional radio. ... He was some firebrand 
on the loose. I thought, 'This is nuts. This is great.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	West joined Stern's wayward team as a part-time ``utility  
infielder,'' doing off-the-wall characters and impressions of 
politicians and others who ventured into the shock jock's merciless 
sights. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern succeeded by breaking radio's musty rules, West said.  
``Howard's show was all unscripted, and he was the first person I 
ever met who didn't play records to hide behind music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After West tried unsuccessfully to join the show full-time, and  
at the urging of his wife, Violet, he decided on a change. He had 
already begun doing commercial and series work and gambled that 
more could be had in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, West came West and got a ``couple of series. Then it  
turned into 10 series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A single show can mean several voices. In ``Futurama,'' the  
30th-century satire from ``The Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening, 
West plays a 147-year-old mad scientist, an alien crustacean and a 
pompous star-ship captain as well as Fry, a young slacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Futurama'' and the rest of Fox's Tuesday night all-animated  
lineup reflect a craze for cartoonry that is keeping voice actors 
like West busy -- and optimistic that this is only the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm beginning to think all prime-time programming will become  
animated,'' he said. ``People just want different. I don't think 
they care that it's animated.''

<HEADLINE> Cycle Jump Too Extreme For ESPN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- It looks as if Travis Pastrana was too  
extreme for ESPN's ``X Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-year-old from Annapolis, Md., celebrated his victory in  
the motorcycle stunt competition by soaring triumphantly into the 
San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where organizers of the offbeat games drew the line. ESPN  
has refused to pay Pastrana his $10,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just having a good time. And yes, I was really surprised  
by the reaction when I got out,'' Pastrana said. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN used Pastrana's prize money to hire a salvage crew to pull  
the motorcycle from the bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was dangerous,'' X Games spokesman Chris Stiepock said.  
``He was putting people and the bay at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jump, witnessed by thousands of fans at Pier 30 near the Bay  
Bridge, took place at the close of the Moto X motorcycle stunt 
event. Pastrana, youngest of nine competitors, had already locked 
up first place with his near-perfect first routine. 
</P>
<P>
	According to witnesses, Pastrana revved his motorcycle, rode up  
a 4-foot-high dirt berm on the edge of the pier and flew 20 feet 
into the air and into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment I was really pumped up,'' he said. ``The crowd  
was going nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two boats hired by Pastrana's manager were waiting -- one to pick  
him up and one to retrieve the motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana was quickly plucked from the water, but the motorcycle  
could not be found. X Games organizers ended up hiring a salvage 
vessel, which spotted the bike and hauled it from the bay five 
hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost immediately, ESPN officials went into a closed-door  
huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided he could keep the gold medal,'' Stiepock said,  
``but we withheld the prize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stiepock said part of the prize money went to pay for the  
salvage operation, and the balance would be donated to a charity 
involved in bay cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, ESPN decided not to televise footage of the jump.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure exactly what it is they're upset about,'' said  
Peter Fox, vice president of Fox Racing of Morgan Hill, which 
sponsored Pastrana. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, who was aboard one of the two rescue boats, said the stunt  
had been arranged hours in advance and that ESPN producers and 
directors, who instructed a camera crew to get into position, knew 
about it but did not tell Pastrana to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana said in an interview with KCBS radio on Wednesday that  
people jokingly told him before the race that jumping into the bay 
might not be a good idea, but he was never seriously told not to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize that it was that big a deal,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fox said he feels so bad about the withheld prize that he is  
paying Pastrana the $10,000 out of his own pocket.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Lighthouse Arriving Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- On the road for three weeks, the Cape  
Hatteras Lighthouse was due to arrive Wednesday at its new home, a 
safe 1,600 feet from the rough Atlantic surf. 
</P>
<P>
	Unpacking and settling in will take several more weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Pushed by hydraulic jacks along a set of rails and rollers, the  
nation's tallest lighthouse had to cover an easy 156 feet Wednesday 
to reach the edge of the steel-reinforced concrete pad on which it 
will sit. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the move began June 17, the 208-foot spiral-striped tower  
has traveled 2,900 feet diagonally from its old home, where it 
stood on a badly eroded cliff a precarious 150 feet from the 
Atlantic's booming waves. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service decided to spend $10 million to move  
the 4,800-ton landmark before it tumbled into the sea. Others 
feared the move itself would cause the 129-year-old brick tower to 
crack or fall over, but the lighthouse appeared to be in good 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next phase of the project, crews will build a new  
foundation of up to 140,000 bricks, a job expected to take two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The lighthouse once guided ships in the treacherous waters off  
Cape Hatteras, known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic. But with the 
advent of electronic and satellite navigation, the beacon is seldom 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service plans to re-light the lighthouse's twin beacons  
on Labor Day and reopen it to the public next Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken and Sandy Gold of Beloit, Wis., marveled at the epic  
project. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like I was telling my grandson, who is 4: Some old things  
are really good and some aren't,'' Mrs. Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was expected to take four to six weeks, but it took  
only three because the contractors came up with a quick way of 
attaching and unattaching the jacks without bolting and unbolting 
them.

<HEADLINE>  Moroccan Sets New Mile Run Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Hicham El Guerrouj smashed the world record in the  
mile with a time of 3 minutes, 43.13 seconds at the Golden Gala 
meet Wednesday, fighting off Kenya's Noah Ngeny, who also beat the 
old mark. 
</P>
<P>
	In becoming the first Moroccan to hold one of track and field's  
most hallowed records, El Guerrouj shaved 1.26 seconds off the mark 
of 3:44.39 set by Noureddine Morceli of Algeria on Sept. 5, 1993, 
at Rieti, Italy. Ngeny was timed in 3:43.40. 
</P>
<P>
	This was only the third time in 18 years the record was broken.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight year that El Guerrouj set a world  
record at the Golden Gala meet, and each time he erased a mark held 
by Morceli. Last year, he cracked the 1,500-meter record with 
3:26.00. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rome is a magic track for me,'' El Guerrouj said. ``I can't  
compare this year with last year. It's another El Guerrouj. I was 
more concentrated, but the public was the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans supported El Guerrouj, shouting and applauding noisily  
as he rushed to the record. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj ran a victory lap, waving a Moroccan flag to the  
cheering fans. He dedicated the race to his family and to King 
Hassan of Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to bring some happiness to my family, as my uncle  
died recently,'' he said. ``I hope God continues to give me 
strength because I want to be the strongest in the world at all 
distances between 1,500 and 5,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Britain's Sebastian Coe reduced the record to 3:47.33 in  
1981, the mark stood until 1985, when another Briton, Steve Cram, 
lowered it to 3:46.32. Cram's time held for eight years until 
Morceli clipped nearly two seconds off it. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj, 24, has been almost unbeatable the past four years.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he won 12 of 13 races at a mile or 1,500 meters, losing  
only in the Olympic 1,500 final when he fell just before the bell 
lap and Morceli went on to win the gold medal. Later that season, 
he ended Morceli's four-year winning streak at 1,500 meters, 
winning the IAAF Grand Prix final. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj won 14 of 15 races in 1997, losing only at one mile  
in the Grand Prix final. Last year, he won all 12 races, including 
one at 2,000 meters, and just missed world records at the mile with 
3:44.60 and 2,000 meters with 4:48.36. He is undefeated this year. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj won the 1997 world outdoor 1,500 championship and  
the 1995 and 1997 world indoor 1,500 titles. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his first breakthrough in 1994, running 3:33.61 for  
1,500 meters at Nice, France, with little form in this event, even 
though he had taken the bronze medal for 5,000 meters at the 1992 
World Junior Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Marion Jones extended her four-year unbeaten streak  
in the women's 200 meters, world record-holder Maurice Greene set a 
meet record in the men's 100 and Michael Johnson beat a powerful 
field in the men's 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, undefeated in the 100, 200 and 400 this year, easily won  
the 200 in 22.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the 1997 world champion, won in 9.85, only .06 seconds  
off the world record of 9.79 he set last month. He beat Dennis 
Mitchell and Bruny Surin. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, recently bothered by a quadriceps injury and competing  
in his first 200 in six weeks, beat Obadele Thompson of Barbados 
and Ato Boldon of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, in 19.93. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a bitter defeat for Boldon, who ran a season best of  
19.86 at Athens last month and had been faster than Johnson this 
season. Boldon was timed in 20.14, behind Thompson's 20.12. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson missed both the USA Championships and the opening Golden  
League meet because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners included Allen Johnson in the men's 110-meter  
hurdles, Kenyan-born Wilson Kipketer of Denmark in the men's 800, 
Gabriela Szabo of Romania in the women's 3,000, and Bernard 
Barmasai of Kenya in the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Johnson, the Olympic and two-time world champion, beat  
American teammates Mark Crear and Larry Wade in 13.01, the season's 
second-fastest time. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, the 1997 world champion, set a season best of 1:42.79.  
He sprinted to victory in the final 200 meters at Olympic Stadium 
on a hot night. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, Johnson and Jones also had won their races in the  
opening meet of the seven-meet Golden League series at Oslo last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100-meter race does not count for the Golden League series.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, El Guerrouj, Jones and Ethiopian distance runner  
Haile Gebrselassie shared the $1 million Golden League jackpot.

strength because I want to be the strongest in the world at all 
distances between 1,500 and 5,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Britain's Sebastian Coe reduced the record to 3:47.33 in  
1981, the mark stood until 1985, when another Briton, Steve Cram, 
lowered it to 3:46.32. Cram's time held for eight years until 
Morceli clipped nearly two seconds off it. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj, 24, has been almost unbeatable the past four years.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he won 12 of 13 races at a mile or 1,500 meters, losing  
only in the Olympic 1,500 final when he fell just before the bell 
lap and Morceli went on to win the gold medal. Later that season, 
he ended Morceli's four-year winning streak at 1,500 meters, 
winning the IAAF Grand Prix final. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj won 14 of 15 races in 1997, losing only at one mile  
in the Grand Prix final. Last year, he won all 12 races, including 
one at 2,000 meters, and just missed world records at the mile with 
3:44.60 and 2,000 meters with 4:48.36. He is undefeated this year. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj won the 1997 world outdoor 1,500 championship and  
the 1995 and 1997 world indoor 1,500 titles. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his first breakthrough in 1994, running 3:33.61 for  
1,500 meters at Nice, France, with little form in this event, even 
though he had taken the bronze medal for 5,000 meters at the 1992 
World Junior Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Marion Jones extended her four-year unbeaten streak  
in the women's 200 meters, world record-holder Maurice Greene set a 
meet record in the men's 100 and Michael Johnson beat a powerful 
field in the men's 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, undefeated in the 100, 200 and 400 this year, easily won  
the 200 in 22.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the 1997 world champion, won in 9.85, only .06 seconds  
off the world record of 9.79 he set last month. He beat Dennis 
Mitchell and Bruny Surin. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, recently bothered by a quadriceps injury and competing  
in his first 200 in six weeks, beat Obadele Thompson of Barbados 
and Ato Boldon of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, in 19.93. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a bitter defeat for Boldon, who ran a season best of  
19.86 at Athens last month and had been faster than Johnson this 
season. Boldon was timed in 20.14, behind Thompson's 20.12. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson missed both the USA Championships and the opening Golden  
League meet because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners included Allen Johnson in the men's 110-meter  
hurdles, Kenyan-born Wilson Kipketer of Denmark in the men's 800, 
Gabriela Szabo of Romania in the women's 3,000, and Bernard 
Barmasai of Kenya in the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Johnson, the Olympic and two-time world champion, beat  
American teammates Mark Crear and Larry Wade in 13.01, the season's 
second-fastest time. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, the 1997 world champion, set a season best of 1:42.79.  
He sprinted to victory in the final 200 meters at Olympic Stadium 
on a hot night. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, Johnson and Jones also had won their races in the  
opening meet of the seven-meet Golden League series at Oslo last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100-meter race does not count for the Golden League series.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, El Guerrouj, Jones and Ethiopian distance runner  
Haile Gebrselassie shared the $1 million Golden League jackpot.

<HEADLINE> A Break in East's Heat Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The heat wave that has brought sweaty misery and  
even death eased today as a cool front moved through the East, but 
a power outage in upper Manhattan left tens of thousands of people 
in the dark overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Record highs and power demands were set again Tuesday as  
utilities scrambled to keep electricity flowing around flaming 
transformers and melting power lines. But the forecast for today 
was for an end to triple-digit temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like somebody's thrown buckets of hot water in your  
face,'' said Pat Renaghan, an elevator operator in a subway station 
at 168th Street in New York City. ``Sometimes when you take the 
elevator down, the air feels so thick you feel like you could chew 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 68,000 electricity customers above 155th Street in  
Manhattan were without power through the night, Con Edison 
spokesman Joe Petta said. The outage also affect subway service in 
the area this morning. There were a handful of attempted store 
break-ins and nine arrests in the affected area, police said. Fire 
trucks with portable lights illuminated the streets overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The electric company, Consolidated Edison, ``is there and gets  
paid to make sure that doesn't happen,'' said a frustrated Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani. ``They've got to be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other scattered outages, usually briefer, affected hundreds of  
thousands of customers across the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The welcome cold front moving in from the Midwest arrived in  
deadly fashion Tuesday, triggering violent storms in upstate New 
York and New England. 
</P>
<P>
	A camper in Lake George, N.Y., died when he was struck by a tree  
snapped by the storms. In Hatfield, Mass., a man was killed and two 
people were hurt when a branch fell on their car during the fierce 
winds. Another man was killed when a tree fell on his car in 
Sanbornton, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	The intense heat already had contributed to at least 17 other  
deaths: seven in Pennsylvania, three in New York City, three in New 
Jersey, two in Massachusetts and two in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Today was expected to be markedly less humid and slightly  
cooler, with highs in the 70s and 80s in much of New England and in 
the 90s farther south. 
</P>
<P>
	High temperature records started falling again before the sun  
even reached its peak Tuesday, as Atlantic City, N.J., hit 98 
before noon, with humidity of about 40 percent. The mercury hit 
record highs of 102 at Newark, N.J., 101 in New York, 102 in 
Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and 103 at Washington's Reagan National 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials in Philadelphia, New York and Washington sent  
thousands of summer-school students home because many buildings had 
no air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	A generator failure at a Dagsboro, Del., power plant belonging  
to Conectiv led to rolling blackouts that affected about 400,000 of 
the utility's 1 million customers in New Jersey, Delaware and 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York City, many office workers were advised to leave  
early, only to be stalled by some subways and commuter rail lines 
that were hit with scattered outages. More than a dozen schools 
were opened to provide air-conditioned places to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember hotter days than the last several and  
particularly hotter nights,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of other utility customers elsewhere in the region  
lost power, either to the crippling demands caused by the heat wave 
or storms that toppled trees and downed lines. To some, the nasty 
weather was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a thermometer in my house and it was about 92  
degrees,'' said Denise Dubreuil of North Adams, Mass. ``Then the 
storm came, and it cooled it down to 74. ... It was awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relief, however small, was welcome to Timothy Hearn, who  
spent Monday painting a house in Cherry Hill, N.J., and almost 
passed out in the heat. After a nearly sleepless night, he admitted 
himself Tuesday to a hospital where his body fluids were being 
replenished intravenously. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just felt like the end of the world,'' Hearn said from in  
his hospital bed at Temple University Hospital.
