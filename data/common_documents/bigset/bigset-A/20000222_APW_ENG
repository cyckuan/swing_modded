<HEADLINE> Romanowskis in SI Swimsuit Issue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski and his wife,
Julie, are baring a little skin in this year's Sports Illustrated swimsuit
issue.
</P>
<P>
	The Romanowskis posed together, with Bill in white football pants with no shirt
and his first Broncos Super Bowl ring prominently displayed on his right ring
finger, and Julie in a silver bikini.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saving this bikini and showing it to my grandkids when I'm 80 because I
trained my fanny off for this picture,'' Julie Romanowski said in a photo
caption for the spread. ``It was like I was training for my Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
	Daniela Pestova is the cover model for this year's issue, which also features
some photos in 3-D and includes a pair of tinted glasses. The issue goes on sale
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	Other couples posing in the magazine are Ben and Julie Crenshaw, Junior and
Gina Seau, Jason and Joumana Kidd, Gabrielle Reece and Laird Hamilton, and Glen
and Christina Rice.
</P>
<P>
	The Romanowskis' picture was shot in July, after they were selected from a list
of 60 married athlete couples to appear in the swimsuit issue.
</P>
<P>
	As part of their contract with Sports Illustrated, the Romanowskis had to keep
their involvement with the issue secret.
</P>
<P>
	``This was great fun for both of us and really exciting to be part of,'' Julie
said. ``Not telling any of our friends for all these months has been the hard
part.''
</P>
<P>
	The couple are in New York for a Tuesday night swimsuit issue party featuring
models, athletes and celebrities.
</P>
<P>
	``If Bill's head turns once Tuesday night, I'll kill him,'' Julie said with
typical Romanowski intensity. ``But who knows. Maybe this will go so well, Bill
can quit his day job, go be Mr. Mom and I'll go out and be the supermodel.''

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Premier Rejects Resignations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Four Cabinet members from the ruling
coalition in the Serb half of Bosnia handed in their resignations Monday, but
the republic's pro-Western premier refused to accept them.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the move by the four Socialist Party members, the collapse of
Premier Milorad Dodik's 2-year-old moderate government is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   The move ``will not jeopardize institutions in the Republika Srpska,'' said
Krstan Simic, a close ally of Dodik and a member of Bosnian Serb parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the republic's constitution, a minister cannot step down until
the premier has named a replacement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Socialists, who represent the Bosnian branch of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's party, decided Sunday to quit the coalition because of
Dodik's ``unprincipled behavior,'' according to a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Socialists, who are upset because Dodik fired two party officials, hold
10 seats in the 83-seat parliament and five of 20 Cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Dodik and his allies still hold a majority in parliament, with 43 seats.
</P>
<P>
	   Svetozar Mihajlovic, vice president of the Serb National Alliance, another
coalition party member, told the Bosnian news agency Onasa he suspected that
Milosevic's government in neighboring Yugoslavia had substantial, ``maybe even
decisive influence'' on the Socialist Party's decision to withdraw from the
coalition.

<HEADLINE> An imagined magic bullet against racial profiling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Bill Bradley and Al Gore offered minority voters a
magic bullet against racial profiling Monday that does not exist within a
president's authority.
<P>
	   Bradley challenged the vice president in a debate for not persuading
President Clinton to issue an executive order against racial profiling -
generally defined as when police stop motorists based on their race.
</P>
<P>
	   And Gore vowed that if he becomes president, "the first civil rights act of
the 21st century will be a national law outlawing racial profiling."
</P>
<P>
	   But the problem is not one that can be remotely solved by a presidential
order, or indeed by a president at all, experts say.
</P>
<P>
	   "It sounds good," said David Bositis, senior political analyst at the Joint
Center for Political and Economic Studies, a black think tank. But, "There's
virtually nothing that a president of the United States can do."
</P>
<P>
	   An executive order affecting only federal law enforcement agencies may be
conceivable but state and local police are overwhelmingly the ones that pull
motorists aside - not the likes of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   "Probably 99 percent of racial profiling takes place on the highways,"
Bositis said. "The federal government does not police the highways."
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, the Supreme Court has invalidated attempts to use statistical
information - such as data on how many black people are stopped by police, or
executed by states - to shape how criminal justice is applied.
</P>
<P>
	   That fact also complicates other proposals heard in the debate as both
candidates stressed the need to reduce racial disparities in the justice system.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley promised to "pass the Racial Justice Act" aimed at reducing the
disproportionate use of the death penalty against blacks and tackling other
racial disparities. "I will not at the end of the day compromise it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bositis said that because the Supreme Court has held that racial data
cannot impact the course of criminal justice, Washington can't do much, short of
getting rid of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's absolutely minimal support for that in the Congress," he said.
"They'd be lucky if they got 100 votes" in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   As for racial profiling, the American Civil Liberties Union is campaigning
against the problem and fighting it in court. But the solutions it is proposing
are not as simplistic as a presidential order.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the ACLU is urging states to take legislative action and is
supporting a federal bill that would encourage the collection of information
quantifying racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   These complexities were only hinted at in the debate.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why doesn't he walk down the hall now and have President Clinton issue an
executive order?" Bradley asked rhetorically of his opponent, repeating a
question from an earlier debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley gave a taste of the nuances when he said: "I would issue an
executive order that would eliminate racial profiling at the federal level. I
would try to pass a law to get information gathered at local levels so that we
could see how the police departments are acting. I would make sure that the
Justice Department was involved."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore obliquely referred to a president's true weapon against racial
profiling - the bully pulpit.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that we have to make certain that, in this country, not only will
driving while black never be allowed to be a crime," he said, "but we just have
to say that we are going to become one people and prevent these incidents,
partly by putting as much energy into education as we do into incarceration."
</P>
<P>
	   Bositis said that to extent the federal government can do anything to
alleviate racial profiling, it would be to the benefit of Arab-Americans more
than blacks, because federal officers often give undue scrutiny to
Arab-Americans at airports.

<HEADLINE> Texas Inmates Take Officer Hostage  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRACZYK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) -- Two death row inmates who were part of a botched
escape in 1998 took a female guard hostage Monday in a new prison that was
supposed to be more secure.
</P>
<P>
	   The guard was taking one inmate back to his cell at about 4:15 p.m. when he
and another inmate overpowered her, said Texas Department of Criminal Justice
spokesman Larry Fitzgerald. One inmate had somehow jimmied his cell door,
Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
	   The guard, Jeanette Bledsoe, was handcuffed with one leg shackled. She was
seated on the floor in a small cage-like room adjacent to death row in the
Terrell unit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have no place to go. Officers have sealed off the area,'' Fitzgerald
said. ``She has not been threatened or harmed in any way, but it is a tense
situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   In talks with negotiators, they complained it takes six months to make
changes in visitation lists. They also want to be allowed out of their cells for
longer than one hour a day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Basically it's complaints about conditions in the prison,'' Fitzgerald
said.
</P>
<P>
	   One inmate had a makeshift knife; the other had a 2-foot long piece of metal
used to open the dinner door on each prison cell.
</P>
<P>
	   Ponchai Wilkerson, 24, was condemned for the robbery and shooting of a
Houston jewelry store clerk. Howard Guidry, 22, is on death row for shooting a
woman in a murder-for-hire plot.
</P>
<P>
	   Death row inmates are being relocated to the more modern and secure Terrell
unit from the Ellis unit near Huntsville due to an escape attempt by seven
inmates there in 1998. One inmate made it out but drown in a creek about a mile
from the prison. The two inmates who took the hostage Monday participated in the
botched escape.

<HEADLINE> China Threatens Unification or War  </HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES HUTZLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- With a month to go in Taiwan's presidential election
campaign, China warned Monday that it might attack the island if Taiwanese
leaders indefinitely refuse to talk unification.
</P>
<P>
	   The threat, delivered in a policy paper from China's Cabinet, was intended
to increase the pressure on Taiwan's three presidential candidates. Although
there was no immediate reaction from Taiwan's government or the candidates'
camps, policy toward China has been at the center of the campaign, which ends
March 18.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mainland Affairs Council, which handles Taiwan's China policy, planned
to have a news conference later Tuesday after the council has had an opportunity
to review the report.
</P>
<P>
	   China's renewed threats helped cause Taiwan's stock market to close sharply
lower Tuesday, analysts said. The jittery market, which ended down 1.8 percent,
has been extremely sensitive in the past to China's saber-rattling.
</P>
<P>
	   Chao Chun-shan, a professor at National Chengchi University in Taipei, said
the policy paper was a disappointment for Taiwanese. In recent months, the
candidates have done a lot of creative thinking about how to improve relations
with China, and Beijing responded by repeating its old line with a new threat,
Chao said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The presidential candidates have to feel disappointed and the voters have
to feel disappointed,'' Chao said.
</P>
<P>
	   Already this month, China sailed its newly acquired, heavily armed
Russian-built destroyer through the Taiwan Strait. And Chinese President Jiang
Zemin over the weekend toured military bases in southern China that would be the
ones used in any invasion of Taiwan, the Hong Kong media reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Such tactics, and Monday's heated words from the State Council, were ominous
reminders that Taiwan and China remain antagonists in an unfinished,
seven-decade civil war. Although democratic Taiwan has relinquished its claim to
the communist mainland, China considers the island a rebel province.
</P>
<P>
	   China has long vowed to wage war if Taiwan declared independence outright or
foreign forces meddle. The policy paper from the State Council added Taiwanese
foot-dragging over unification talks to the list of provocative circumstances
that would compel China to attack.
</P>
<P>
	   If any of those three situations arose, ``then the Chinese government will
be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of force, to
... fulfill the great cause of reunification,'' the document said.
</P>
<P>
	   It included a warning to the United States to scale back arms sales to
Taiwan -- once a close ally whose defense Washington must by law assist -- and
``not to stand in the way of the reunification of China.''
</P>
<P>
	   China's new Taiwan policy statement was not all barbs. It reiterated that
force was a last resort and offered to hold talks as equals with any Taiwanese
politicians so long as they recognized the island as part of ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Taiwan's last presidential campaign four years ago, China tested missiles
and staged intimidating war games to deter pro-independence Taiwanese and the
United States sent warships to counter the threats. It was the closest the sides
had come to armed confrontation since the late 1950s.

<HEADLINE> Clinton campaign complains about Giuliani "hypocrisy"  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's campaign committee is
returning a contribution it accepted from a source he had earlier criticized
Senate rival Hillary Rodham Clinton for tapping.
<P>
	   At issue is a $750 September donation to the New York City mayor's campaign
committee from a political action committee linked to the Loral Space and
Communications company.
</P>
<P>
	   After being informed of the donation by a reporter Monday, Giuliani campaign
spokeswoman Kim Serafin said "it is our intention to return that money."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, the Giuliani campaign issued a news release complaining
about "the Clinton campaign's funny-money machine" and "the reemergence of the
same cast of characters at the center of the worst finance abuses that marred
the 1996 presidential campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   As evidence of that, the Giuliani camp cited "Bernie Schwartz of Loral Space
and Communications, which is currently under Justice Department investigation
over the illegal transfer of missile technology to China. Donated to Mrs.
Clinton $40,000."
</P>
<P>
	   Federal election records show the Clinton campaign and related committees
received the $40,000 from Loral chief Bernard Schwartz and his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, Schwartz has been one of the Democratic Party's biggest
donors.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rudy Giuliani has cornered the market on hypocrisy," Clinton campaign
spokesman Howard Wolfson said. "Soon the mayor will accuse us of arresting the
homeless and cutting $7 billion from city schools."
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton camp has been critical of the mayor's push to have homeless
people arrested who refuse to leave the streets and for his attacks on the New
York City school system.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest Clinton attack served to highlight the extensive research that
each is doing on the other's voluminous fund-raising reports that were filed
with the Federal Election Commission at the end of last month. Over the final
six months of last year, Republican Giuliani raised $8.8 million for the Senate
race while Democrat Clinton raised about $8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the recent $750 donation from the Loral Spacecom Civic
Responsibility Fund, the Clinton campaign said Giuliani's mayoral campaign
committee received $750 from Schwartz in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Giuliani camp, citing Clinton's FEC report, has complained
that she has reimbursed the federal government just $34,000 as of the end of
last year for political trips to New York on government aircraft. The mayor's
aides have said she should pay more than $300,000 more than that to cover the
real costs of such travel. Her aides have said they have reimbursed the federal
government for everything they are required to.

<HEADLINE> Group once allied with Pataki now running anti-Pataki ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A group whose backing of George Pataki in 1994 was
helpful in making him governor is running advertisements suggesting he has lost
touch with his conservative roots.
<P>
	   The television and radio ads from Change-New York look and sound like
something that would come from Democrats seeking to drive the Republican
governor from office, and not erstwhile supporters of Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   But Change-New York has come to the conclusion that the Pataki of the 1994
campaign and his first two years in office is not the Pataki who now occupies
the Executive Mansion, spokesman Brian Backstrom said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that there is a mentality, 'Tax cuts? We've done those. Hold the
line on spending? We've done that,"' Backstrom said. "We thought we were in this
for a marriage. We only got the honeymoon."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's mandate from voters dating back to his defeat of liberal Democrat
Mario Cuomo was clear, Backstrom said: "To behave in a fiscally prudent and
tax-cutting manner as long as he's in office, not just the moment."
</P>
<P>
	   The group is particularly angered about a $400 million increase on state
cigarette taxes approved by Pataki and the state Legislature in December as well
as a proposed 2000-01 state budget from the governor that Change-New York
believes would increase spending by twice the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not the behavior of fiscal conservatives," Backstrom contended.
"One of the reasons we felt a media campaign was warranted was this latest round
of tax hikes and excessive spending was not a blip on the radar screen, but the
next giant step of an intentional move leftward."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the group knows it is "deliberately
distorting the facts" with an ad which says upstate New York, if taken as a
separate state, has had job growth ranked 49th nationally since Pataki has
become governor.
</P>
<P>
	   "Upstate is growing jobs faster than many places, such as Illinois, Ohio,
North Carolina and Pennsylvania," McKeon said. "In fact, upstate has more jobs
now than ever before. It's a far cry from the final years of the Cuomo
administration. New Yorkers are not going to be fooled by these misleading ads."
</P>
<P>
	   The group has two anti-Pataki TV ads, one showing scenes of Niagara Falls
and other flowing waters and criticizing Pataki for proposing a fee on water
hookups. The money was to have gone to fund water-quality programs in the state,
though Pataki's office indicated the governor was backing off the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The other TV ad says: "While Wall Street is booming, upstate New York is
being left behind." If upstate is treated as a separate state, the commercial
says it would be 49th in the country in job creation since Pataki became
governor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor Pataki," the ad implores, "stop hiking our taxes. Get back to
cutting them."
</P>
<P>
	   Backstrom said the ads are running in major upstate New York television
markets. He declined to say how much the group was paying for the commercials,
how long they will run or if others are in the works. He said the group will
stop airing the "water tax" commercial in light of Pataki's decision to back off
that proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno called the ads "very, very
one-sided" and "unfair." He complained they make no reference to the tax cuts
enacted under Pataki, estimated as having a cumulative savings for taxpayers of
a highest-in-the-nation $29 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said he was also taken aback by the source of the criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were his biggest supporter in the first election (in 1994) so that's
why this is so surprising," he said on WROW-AM radio in Albany. "These ads are
almost vindictive."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the members of Change-New York's board are two financiers who have
contributed generously to Pataki's campaigns in the past, Richard Gilder and
Bruce Kovner.
</P>
<P>
	   Backstrom said top Change-New York officials were angered when Pataki failed
to show up for a scheduled meeting with them to discuss his taxing and other
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki insists his budget increases general fund spending by just over 2
percent or about the rate of inflation, but the overall increase when all funds
are factored in would be more than 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> No. 10 Oklahoma St. 84, Missouri 72  </HEADLINE>
    By R.B. FALLSTROM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Desmond Mason had 25 points and nine rebounds as
Oklahoma State held off a furious late rally by Missouri for an 84-72 victory
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Montonati added 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Cowboys (22-3, 11-2
Big 12), who have won eight of nine and moved into first place in the
conference. Oklahoma State overcame a season-high 24 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cowboys seemingly pulled away by hitting 10 of their first 12 shots
after the break, leading by as many as 20 points. The gap was still 14 when the
Cowboys had a shot clock violation with 2:30 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Missouri hit five 3-pointers the rest of the way, and trailed by only four
after Kareem Rush connected with 51 seconds to go. Oklahoma State escaped when
Mason answered with a dunk after a length-of-court pass.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyon Dooling had 19 points for Missouri (16-9, 9-4). The Tigers have lost
three in a row at home for the first time since 1992-93, with all the games
against ranked opponents. Oklahoma State, which also got 21 points from Joe
Adkins and 12 from Glendon Alexander, had been 2-26 at the Hearnes Center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Big 12's top defense stifled the Tigers until the late going. Missouri
began 1-for-13 and shot 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Kareem Rush, who averaged 25 points last week, was held to 13. Clarence
Gilbert, averaging 13 points, missed his first eight shots and finished 1-for-11
with three points.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason hit a 3-pointer just before the halftime buzzer for a 28-23 lead and
he had two more baskets in the opening 1:33 of the second half to help Oklahoma
State open the gap. Alexander's 3-pointer gave Oklahoma State 10 baskets in 12
shots to start the half and a 54-37 lead with 11:18 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma State had a surprisingly tough time in the first half considering
Missouri's horrid start. The Cowboys shot 48 percent, held Missouri to 28
percent shooting and had a 19-11 rebounding advantage, but hurt themselves with
13 turnovers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> No. 9 Duke 59, Clemson 44  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- Lauren Rice scored 17 points and Duke held Clemson
scoreless over the final 2:59 en route to a 59-44 victory Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Clemson (16-10, 7-7 Atlantic Coast Conference) closed within six at 50-44 on
Erin Batth's layup with 2:59 left, but Duke (22-4, 11-3) held the Tigers
scoreless after that.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the final stretch, the Blue Devils never led by more than 11. Krista
Gingrich's 3-pointer gave Duke a 38-27 with 13:10 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Clemson used a 13-7 run over the next 6:54 to close within five at 45-40,
the closest margin of the second half. Duke's Georgia Schweitzer's ended the run
with a 3-pointer from the right wing, then added a free throw to give Duke a
nine-point lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Duke's missed free throws allowed Clemson to stay in the game. The Blue
Devils missed seven free throws in the second half and hit just 16-of-25 for the
game.
</P>
<P>
	   Schweitzer added 14 points for Duke. Batth led Clemson with 14 points and 11
rebounds, and Chrissy Floyd scored 10 points.

<HEADLINE> Jagr Out With Injured Hamstring  </HEADLINE>
    By ALAN ROBINSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Pittsburgh Penguins star Jaromir Jagr, the NHL's leading
scorer, injured his right hamstring Monday night against Tampa Bay and will be
sidelined indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr, held scoreless for a season-high third consecutive game, heard his
hamstring "crack" as he became tangled with the Lightning's Todd Warriner near
the offensive blue line with 12 seconds left in the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr would not estimate how long he might be out, but was told the injury
can sideline a player for as long as a month. Such a layoff could seriously
jeopardize Jagr's chances of winning a fourth NHL scoring title.
</P>
<P>
	   "How severe, I don't know," Pittsburgh coach Herb Brooks said. "But it
doesn't look too good."
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr was held without a shot in 14 shifts, totaling 16 minutes, in the 2-1
loss to Tampa Bay. It wasn't exactly the kind of game he wanted to play in
former Czech Olympic coach Ivan Hlinka's debut behind the Penguins bench.
</P>
<P>
	   "They played very well against Jagr," said Hlinka, who is the associate
coach for now but will soon take over the Penguins.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr seemed especially down after the game, answering questions with one or
two word answers before leaving hurriedly to catch the team bus. The Penguins,
currently seventh in the Eastern Conference playoff race, play Tuesday at the
New York Rangers and Thursday at the Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr, whose speed and size usually enable him to deal with teams that try to
muscle him, absorbed two unusually hard hits in the first period, one each from
Pavel Kubina and Gordie Dwyer, before getting injured in the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we shocked the Jagr line. Petr (Svoboda) and I know him very well
and know what we have to do against him," Kubina said. "He took a bunch of hits,
took no shots and after the second period was done."
</P>
<P>
	   Like Jagr, Svoboda and Kubina are from the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr leads the NHL with 85 points and is second to Florida's Pavel Bure with
37 goals despite his recent slump. Before his scoreless streak, he had a goal
and two assists in three games.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr managed to hold onto his league scoring lead despite missing five games
earlier in the season, one for a thigh muscle injury and four with an injured
stomach muscle from Jan. 19-25. He expected to miss as much as two weeks of play
after injuring the stomach muscle, only to return after about a week's layoff.

    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Armen Gilliam converted a layup off an assist from
John Stockton with 2.2 seconds left Monday night to give the Utah Jazz a 96-94
come-from-behind victory over the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah got the ball with 18.2 seconds left and the score tied after an
offensive foul call on Bimbo Coles. Stockton dribbled the ball high, came off
Karl Malone's screen on the right side and found a wide-open Gilliam under the
basket.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta lobbed the ball to Dikembe Mutombo on the ensuing play, but Utah had
a foul to give and Olden Polynice committed it before Mutombo could shoot. With
one second left, Jim Jackson missed a 3-point attempt.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone led all scorers with 25 points, including eight in the fourth
quarter. Jeff Hornacek added 17, including 13 in the third quarter when the Jazz
trimmed Atlanta's four-point lead to one.
</P>
<P>
	   Isaiah Rider led the Hawks with 22 points, including five in the final five
minutes to give Atlanta a lead of as much as 94-88 with 2 minutes left. Jackson
added 15 points, and Mutombo put in 12 points and grabbed 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone scored four of the Jazz's next six points before Gilliam's
game-winner.

<HEADLINE> Clinton campaign complains about Giuliani "hypocrisy"  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's campaign committee is
returning a contribution it accepted from a source he had earlier criticized
Senate rival Hillary Rodham Clinton for tapping.
<P>
	   At issue is a $750 September donation to the New York City mayor's campaign
committee from a political action committee linked to the Loral Space and
Communications company.
</P>
<P>
	   After being informed of the donation by a reporter Monday, Giuliani campaign
spokeswoman Kim Serafin said "it is our intention to return that money."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, the Giuliani campaign issued a news release complaining
about "the Clinton campaign's funny-money machine" and "the reemergence of the
same cast of characters at the center of the worst finance abuses that marred
the 1996 presidential campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   As evidence of that, the Giuliani camp cited "Bernie Schwartz of Loral Space
and Communications, which is currently under Justice Department investigation
over the illegal transfer of missile technology to China. Donated to Mrs.
Clinton $40,000."
</P>
<P>
	   Federal election records show the Clinton campaign and related committees
received the $40,000 from Loral chief Bernard Schwartz and his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, Schwartz has been one of the Democratic Party's biggest
donors.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rudy Giuliani has cornered the market on hypocrisy," Clinton campaign
spokesman Howard Wolfson said. "Soon the mayor will accuse us of arresting the
homeless and cutting $7 billion from city schools."
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton camp has been critical of the mayor's push to have homeless
people arrested who refuse to leave the streets and for his attacks on the New
York City school system.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest Clinton attack served to highlight the extensive research that
each is doing on the other's voluminous fund-raising reports that were filed
with the Federal Election Commission at the end of last month. Over the final
six months of last year, Republican Giuliani raised $8.8 million for the Senate
race while Democrat Clinton raised about $8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the recent $750 donation from the Loral Spacecom Civic
Responsibility Fund, the Clinton campaign said Giuliani's mayoral campaign
committee received $750 from Schwartz in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Giuliani camp, citing Clinton's FEC report, has complained
that she has reimbursed the federal government just $34,000 as of the end of
last year for political trips to New York on government aircraft. The mayor's
aides have said she should pay more than $300,000 more than that to cover the
real costs of such travel. Her aides have said they have reimbursed the federal
government for everything they are required to.

<HEADLINE> Group once allied with Pataki now running anti-Pataki ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A group whose backing of George Pataki in 1994 was
helpful in making him governor is running advertisements suggesting he has lost
touch with his conservative roots.
<P>
	   The television and radio ads from Change-New York look and sound like
something that would come from Democrats seeking to drive the Republican
governor from office, and not erstwhile supporters of Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   But Change-New York has come to the conclusion that the Pataki of the 1994
campaign and his first two years in office is not the Pataki who now occupies
the Executive Mansion, spokesman Brian Backstrom said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that there is a mentality, 'Tax cuts? We've done those. Hold the
line on spending? We've done that,"' Backstrom said. "We thought we were in this
for a marriage. We only got the honeymoon."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's mandate from voters dating back to his defeat of liberal Democrat
Mario Cuomo was clear, Backstrom said: "To behave in a fiscally prudent and
tax-cutting manner as long as he's in office, not just the moment."
</P>
<P>
	   The group is particularly angered about a $400 million increase on state
cigarette taxes approved by Pataki and the state Legislature in December as well
as a proposed 2000-01 state budget from the governor that Change-New York
believes would increase spending by twice the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not the behavior of fiscal conservatives," Backstrom contended.
"One of the reasons we felt a media campaign was warranted was this latest round
of tax hikes and excessive spending was not a blip on the radar screen, but the
next giant step of an intentional move leftward."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the group knows it is "deliberately
distorting the facts" with an ad which says upstate New York, if taken as a
separate state, has had job growth ranked 49th nationally since Pataki has
become governor.
</P>
<P>
	   "Upstate is growing jobs faster than many places, such as Illinois, Ohio,
North Carolina and Pennsylvania," McKeon said. "In fact, upstate has more jobs
now than ever before. It's a far cry from the final years of the Cuomo
administration. New Yorkers are not going to be fooled by these misleading ads."
</P>
<P>
	   The group has two anti-Pataki TV ads, one showing scenes of Niagara Falls
and other flowing waters and criticizing Pataki for proposing a fee on water
hookups. The money was to have gone to fund water-quality programs in the state,
though Pataki's office indicated the governor was backing off the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The other TV ad says: "While Wall Street is booming, upstate New York is
being left behind." If upstate is treated as a separate state, the commercial
says it would be 49th in the country in job creation since Pataki became
governor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor Pataki," the ad implores, "stop hiking our taxes. Get back to
cutting them."
</P>
<P>
	   Backstrom said the ads are running in major upstate New York television
markets. He declined to say how much the group was paying for the commercials,
how long they will run or if others are in the works. He said the group will
stop airing the "water tax" commercial in light of Pataki's decision to back off
that proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno called the ads "very, very
one-sided" and "unfair." He complained they make no reference to the tax cuts
enacted under Pataki, estimated as having a cumulative savings for taxpayers of
a highest-in-the-nation $29 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said he was also taken aback by the source of the criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were his biggest supporter in the first election (in 1994) so that's
why this is so surprising," he said on WROW-AM radio in Albany. "These ads are
almost vindictive."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the members of Change-New York's board are two financiers who have
contributed generously to Pataki's campaigns in the past, Richard Gilder and
Bruce Kovner.
</P>
<P>
	   Backstrom said top Change-New York officials were angered when Pataki failed
to show up for a scheduled meeting with them to discuss his taxing and other
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki insists his budget increases general fund spending by just over 2
percent or about the rate of inflation, but the overall increase when all funds
are factored in would be more than 5 percent.

<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A Temple University tailback was in critical but stable
condition after being stabbed outside a dormitory Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Elmarko Jackson, 21, from Sharon, Pa., was stabbed several times in the neck
chest and arm at about 6 p.m. on the North Philadelphia campus, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson had been seen arguing with a man, believed to be another student,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson, a sports-management major in his senior year, was taken to Temple
University Hospital. He was out of surgery Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "Police are questioning a possible suspect who was seen with him outside the
residence hall this afternoon," university spokesman George Ingram said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police found the knife believed to have been used in the attack in a pile of
trash around the corner.
</P>
<P>
	   School security had been increased recently and high-powered lights were
installed on the campus, which sits in a high-crime area of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   University president Peter Liacouras stood outside the White Hall dorm where
the attack took place, talking with concerned students.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't get used to violence. I don't know enough about the situation to
say any more than that except that we just pray that the injured person will be
all right," Liacouras said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson, who has played on the football team for three years, was declared
academically ineligible to play in the season finale against Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was bound to go to the NFL next year. When we heard it was him, we were
all shocked," said teammate Danny Culic.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets 123, Kings 117, OT  </HEADLINE>
    By AARON J. LOPEZ AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Antonio McDyess had 29 points and 13 rebounds, and the Denver
Nuggets hit 12 3-pointers Monday night in a 123-117 overtime victory over the
Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Van Exel added 27 points and 15 assists for the Nuggets, who overcame
an early 19-point deficit and a career-best performance by Sacramento shooting
guard Predrag Stojakovic.
</P>
<P>
	   Stojakovic, starting in place of ailing Nick Anderson, scored a career-high
30 points -- including 11 straight at one stretch of the fourth quarter. Chris
Webber had 25 points and 15 rebounds for the Kings, who lost their second
straight overtime game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nuggets got a balanced offensive attack with four players scoring more
than 20 points as Chris Gatling and Bryant Stith each scored 21 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver, which trailed by double figures for much of the game, didn't take
its first lead until McDyess made two free throws 1:37 into overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kings never led again as Raef LaFrentz hit Denver's 12th 3-pointer of
the night for a 119-115 lead with 1:29 remaining, and McDyess followed a
Sacramento turnover with an easy basket in the lane 16 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
	   Stith tied the game at 108 on a 3-pointer, his fourth of the game, with 38.6
seconds left. The Kings turned the ball over on their next possession, and Stith
missed a long 3-point try at the end of regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   After watching Sacramento turn away every challenge, the Nuggets used a 12-2
run to pull within a point with 6:02 left. Stojakovic responded with a pull-up
jumper, a layup and two 20-foot shots in a 90-second span to give the Kings a
101-92 lead with 4:06 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver made its final charge behind back-to-back 3-pointers by Van Exel and
Stith's 3-pointer in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
	   Jon Barry, averaging eight points a game, hit three 3-pointers and had 14
points in the second quarter as the Kings took a 13-point halftime lead.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In an unprecedented move, the union representing Los
Angeles police officers called Monday for an independent review of the ongoing
police corruption probe.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles Police Protective League, which represents about 9,500
officers, joins a growing number of groups and officials calling for an
independent review of wrongdoing within the department's Rampart station.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The police union never before has called for civilian oversight, but this
scandal is so deep that the situation begs for a third-party and active public
participation to take part in this,'' said Geoffrey Garfield, a union spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 11 officers have been relieved of duty, and 40 convictions have
been overturned as a result of the scandal in which anti-gang officers at the
Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart station beat, framed and shot innocent
people. Dozens of other criminal cases are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The police union and the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California planned to support a motion Tuesday by City Councilman Joel Wachs
seeking an independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The union also has asked University of Southern California law professor
Erwin Chemerinsky to review the department's Board of Inquiry report on the
scandal. The board, which was convened by Chief Bernard Parks, is due to release
its report March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal broke last fall when former Rampart station Officer Rafael Perez
began telling of corruption in the station's anti-gang unit in exchange for a
lighter sentence for stealing cocaine from an evidence room.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 50,000 Ethnic Albanians Protest  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- French and British troops fired tear
gas to push back thousands of ethnic Albanians trying to force their way across
a bridge into the Serb-controlled side of this ethnically divided city.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters at the bridge were the lead group of up to 50,000 ethnic
Albanians who marched on this northwestern Kosovo industrial city.
</P>
<P>
	   About 4,000 Serbs were waiting on the north side of the bridge, determined
to battle the Albanians themselves to keep them from entering their part of
Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   The Albanian group, numbering between 6,000 and 10,000, managed to breach
French positions on the approach to the bridge over the Ibar River, and more
French troops rushed to the bridge and began firing volleys of tear gas in
five-minute intervals.
</P>
<P>
	   British troops blocked the bridge with armored vehicles and pushed away
ethnic Albanian men who tried to climb over the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   By the 6 p.m. start of a daily 12-hour curfew, crowds on both sides were
dispersing.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign that the Serbs were prepared for a showdown, some Serb women and
children began evacuating the city, and a local Serb leader, Nikola Kabasic,
told a Belgrade radio station that the Serbs were bringing in reinforcements
from neighboring villages to defend their part of the city if NATO cannot
control the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   No American troops were involved in the scuffles at the bridge. On Sunday,
U.S. troops taking part in a weapons search in the Serb part of the city
withdrew to the ethnic Albanian south bank after Serbs pelted them with stones.
</P>
<P>
	   The commander of the embattled, NATO-led Kosovo Force, German Gen. Klaus
Reinhardt, congratulated the troops for showing restraint in the face of
escalating tensions, which threaten to engulf this city and perhaps the entire
province in a new round of bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The key thing really was to prevent an escalation in which somebody fired
on the other one,'' Reinhardt said. ``It would have been a disaster. My soldiers
were very reasonable. They used just the amount of power needed and did not
overreact.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kosovska Mitrovica is the most ethnically tense city in Kosovo because it
contains the largest Serb community remaining in the province. Most Kosovo Serbs
fled following the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops in June and the arrival of
NATO-led peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Richard
Holbrooke, blamed the Yugoslav government for fomenting trouble in Kosovska
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there is no question who's responsible for it. It's Belgrade,''
Holbrooke told reporters at the United Nations. ``The leadership in Belgrade is
fomenting trouble north of the Mitrovica bridge.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 9,000 Serbs who remain here fear that if the 90,000 ethnic Albanians
living across the river are allowed free access to the north side, they will
launch reprisal attacks such as occurred elsewhere in Kosovo after Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic halted his crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists and withdrew his troops from the province.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the price for ending the 78-day NATO bombing campaign that began
last year after Milosevic rejected a Western-dictated peace plan for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The recent tensions began after a grenade attack on a U.N. bus Feb. 2 killed
two elderly Serbs just south of the city. That triggered a round of revenge
attacks that have left nine dead and scores injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of an ethnic explosion mounted Monday as tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians set out from the provincial capital Pristina on a 25-mile march to
Kosovska Mitrovica. Different NATO officials gave varying estimates of the crowd
size -- ranging from 25,000 to 50,000.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. police and NATO-led troops accompanied the demonstrators and U.S.
military vehicles and soldiers lined the road into the center of town to prevent
the protesters from entering the city center, though thousands did manage to
break through to the bridge.
</P>
<P>
	   The ethnic Albanian leader of the city, Bajram Rexhepi, said Albanian
organizers decided to return the marchers to their homes because the crowd ``got
out of control.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mitrovica needs peace and dialogue,'' Rexhepi said. ``I am against any
incidents at the bridge and those who organize them are against law and order.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, meanwhile, the Yugoslav ambassador to Russia accused the
Americans of violating the U.N. resolution which established the Kosovo mission
by upgrading the giant Camp Bondsteel near the town of Urosevac.
</P>
<P>
	   Borislav Milosevic, brother of the Yugoslav president, said the construction
violates Belgrade's sovereignty over the province and indicates the Americans
plan to remain in Kosovo indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Criticizes John McCain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Vietnam has criticized Republican presidential
candidate John McCain for claiming he was tortured during 5 1/2 years as a
prisoner of war in the infamous ``Hanoi Hilton'' and using derogatory
terminology for Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain's words and statements, which lack goodwill, have hurt the
Vietnamese and Asian peoples,'' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh
said in a statement issued Monday in response to queries from Hanoi-based
foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
	   E-mails have circulated in the Asian-American community criticizing McCain
for calling Asians ``gooks.'' The Arizona senator said he has used the term for
his prison guards.
</P>
<P>
	   He also has released medical records in which the Navy commander talked of
being mistreated so badly while a prisoner of war that he tried twice to hang
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Vietnam has consistently denied torturing any prisoners of war. Most of the
``Hanoi Hilton'' prison has been torn down, but a section has been kept and
turned into a museum with photos showing POWs relaxing. Some POWs have said the
scenes were staged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In relations with countries that once had been hostile with Vietnam, it is
our policy to temporarily put the past aside, look forward to the future and
cooperate for mutual development,'' Thanh said. ``We think the U.S. side
understands this.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. war of aggression has seen numerous crimes and sufferings brought
upon Vietnamese people. It is the Vietnamese people who have the right to speak
about these things. It was a sad chapter in the history of relations between the
two countries.''
</P>
<P>
	   Relations between Vietnam and the United States were normalized five years
ago, and the two countries have been negotiating a bilateral trade deal. On
April 30, Vietnam will mark the 25th anniversary of the end of the war.

<HEADLINE> Texas Inmates Take Officer Hostage  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRACZYK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) -- Two death row inmates who were part of a botched
escape in 1998 took a female guard hostage Monday in a new prison that was
supposed to be more secure.
</P>
<P>
	   The guard was taking one inmate back to his cell at about 4:15 p.m. when he
and another inmate overpowered her, said Texas Department of Criminal Justice
spokesman Larry Fitzgerald. One inmate had somehow jimmied his cell door,
Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
	   The guard, Jeanette Bledsoe, was handcuffed with one leg shackled. She was
seated on the floor in a small cage-like room adjacent to death row in the
Terrell unit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have no place to go. Officers have sealed off the area,'' Fitzgerald
said. ``She has not been threatened or harmed in any way, but it is a tense
situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   In talks with negotiators, they complained it takes six months to make
changes in visitation lists. They also want to be allowed out of their cells for
longer than one hour a day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Basically it's complaints about conditions in the prison,'' Fitzgerald
said.
</P>
<P>
	   One inmate had a makeshift knife; the other had a 2-foot long piece of metal
used to open the dinner door on each prison cell.
</P>
<P>
	   Ponchai Wilkerson, 24, was condemned for the robbery and shooting of a
Houston jewelry store clerk. Howard Guidry, 22, is on death row for shooting a
woman in a murder-for-hire plot.
</P>
<P>
	   Death row inmates are being relocated to the more modern and secure Terrell
unit from the Ellis unit near Huntsville because of an escape attempt by seven
inmates there in 1998. One inmate made it out but drowned in a creek about a
mile from the prison. The two inmates who took the hostage Monday participated
in the botched escape.

<HEADLINE> Some top foreign-born students may not graduate under Regents plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Three of the top 10 students in a Buffalo high
school may not graduate because of the state's tough new English Regents.
<P>
	   My Tuyen Huynh, of Vietnam, Ali Salem, of Yemen, and Madeline Hernandez, of
Puerto Rico, along with 14 other seniors at Grover Cleveland High School are
concerned they can't score 55 percent or higher on the state's tough, six-hour
English Regents exam. They'll need to pass in order to graduate in June with
their class, even though Salem and Hunynh spoke no English when they arrived in
America three years ago, reports The Buffalo News.
</P>
<P>
	   This year the state is requiring for the first time that seniors pass the
test to graduate. That's an aspect of the state's raising of academic standards
that is a major concern for teachers and principals who have foreign-born
students in classes.
</P>
<P>
	   The test threatens timely graduation even for solid students like Hunynh,
who scored a 94 on the state Regents economics exam and has been accepted at the
University at Buffalo to study computer engineering. She and Salem haven't taken
the test yet, but could in April or June. Hernandez missed passing by 2 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "They may have some knowledge of the literature in their own language, but
don't know much about a Poe, a Hemingway, a Shakespeare or a Chaucer," said
Benjamin L. Randle Jr., the principal at Grover Cleveland. "These are very, very
bright kids, but you're putting large obstacles in their way. That, to me, is
unfair."
</P>
<P>
	   But state education officials said it would be unfair to ask less of
students who are new to this country, or to offer them watered-down diplomas
that do not prepare them for college, work or productive citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's one of our major issues," said Roseanne DeFabio, an assistant
commissioner in the State Education Department. "These really are the skills the
kids need to tackle all the opportunities we want them to have when they leave
school."
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign-born students take exams in most courses including Regents economics
and history in their native languages with a translator's help. That doesn't
happen with the English Regents.
</P>
<P>
	   School districts already have the option of giving students with limited
English skills nine hours or more to complete the two-day Regents English exam
usually limited to six hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Other accommodations are being considered, state officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Al MacInnis completed St. Louis' comeback from a
two-goal deficit Monday night when he scored with 1:49 remaining as the Blues
extended their club-record road winning streak to eight with a 4-2 victory over
the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
	   Jochen Hecht scored an empty-net goal, his eighth, with 54 seconds remaining
as the Blues won their fourth in a row and 10th in 11 contests.
</P>
<P>
	   MacInnis' goal, his eighth, sailed over the left shoulder of Anaheim goalie
Dominic Roussel, beating him on the glove side from 45 feet out.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blues' Michal Handzus tied it 2-2 with 11:17 to go on a fine individual
effort, skating down right wing, slicing inside of defenseman Ruslan Salei and
beating Roussel from 30 feet. The goal was Handzus' 17th.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Mighty Ducks scored twice 45 seconds apart early in the second
period, Marty Reasoner cut the deficit to 2-1 at 11:32 of the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Finley, skating near the boards, shot from the left wing. Reasoner
picked up the rebound and poked a shot past the sprawling Roussel. The goal was
Reasoner's sixth.
</P>
<P>
	   Salei gave Anaheim a 2-0 edge with a 20-foot slap shot from the slot 3:19
into the second for his fourth goal. Ted Donato redirected a shot by Fredrik
Olausson past St. Louis goalie Roman Turek for Anaheim's first goal, 2:34 into
the period. Donato's goal was his ninth.
</P>
<P>
	   Anaheim squandered a two-man advantage for a span of 1:13 late in the
second, failing to get a shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mighty Ducks were without leading scorer Paul Kariya, out with a bruised
right foot.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Down at Midday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen Tuesday morning
amid continued bullish sentiment toward the greenback. Japanese stocks fell.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 111.62 yen at late morning, up 1.04 yen from late Monday
in Tokyo and also above its late London level of 111.22 yen overnight. U.S.
markets were closed Monday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which rose some 140 points
early the session, finished the morning down 50.79, or 0.26 percent, to
19,492.96. On Monday, the average closed down 245.28 points, or 1.23 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher as investors in Europe were
buying the U.S. currency in early Asian trading Tuesday after a quiet session
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said Japanese exporters probably bid up the dollar later in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar in recent weeks has been gaining ground against the yen amid
sentiment that Japan's economic recovery is not as firm as previously thought.
</P>
<P>
	   Favorable prospects for U.S. economic growth coupled with low inflation were
in turn among positive factors supporting the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 110.80 yen, up from 109.37 yen
late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started slightly higher following Monday's steep
fall but gradually moved into negative territory as selling pressure mounted
ahead of the end of Japan's fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese companies in recent years have started unwinding the
cross-shareholding issues they hold in other companies prior to the end of each
fiscal year, which ends March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors also remained cautious over uncertainty about the direction of New
York markets. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 295.05 points,
or 2.8 percent, to close at 10,219.52.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 23.63 points, or 1.41 percent, to 1,657.09. The TOPIX closed
down 39.05 points, or 2.27 percent, the day before.

Texas Inmates Take Officer Hostage
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) -- Two death row inmates who were part of a botched
escape in 1998 took a female guard hostage Monday in a new prison that was
supposed to be more secure. The guard was taking one inmate back to his cell at
about 4:15 p.m. when he and another inmate overpowered her, said Texas
Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Fitzgerald. One inmate had
somehow jimmied his cell door, Fitzgerald said. "They have no place to go.
Officers have sealed off the area," he said. "She has not been threatened or
harmed in any way, but it is a tense situation."

Gore, Bradley Spar in Harlem Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an angry Harlem debate, Al Gore accused Bill Bradley of
attack tactics that "divide us as Democrats," while the challenger described the
vice president as a sometime conservative with a suspect record on affirmative
action. The tone of the argument on the stage of the historic Apollo Theater was
set at the start, when the presidential rivals agreed that they'd both take
steps against racial profiling -- and immediately tried to turn the question
against each other. The 90-minute debate -- the candidates ninth presidential
debate -- was televised by CNN. The largely black audience cheered, applauded,
jeered, sometimes booed. Neither candidate was spared the raucous reactions.

China Warns of Taiwan Attack

	   BEIJING (AP) -- China warned Monday that it might attack Taiwan if the
island's leaders indefinitely refuse to talk unification. The threat, which came
a month before Taiwan's presidential election campaign, was intended to increase
the pressure on Taiwan's three presidential candidates. Although there was no
immediate reaction from Taiwan's government or the candidates' camps, policy
toward China has been at the center of the campaign. Already this month, China
sailed its newly acquired, destroyer through the Taiwan Strait.

angrily denied that he had abused an ex-girlfriend. Fox TV canceled a
rebroadcast of the show after learning that a restraining order was issued in
1991 against Rick Rockwell because an ex-girlfriend accused him of hitting and
threatening to kill her. "At no time have I ever struck any of my girlfriends,

<HEADLINE> Jury to hear closing arguments in Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Was Amadou Diallo's death by 41 police bullets a
mistake or murder?
<P>
	   After hearing nine days of testimony in the trial of four police officers
who killed the unarmed Diallo on his Bronx doorstep, a jury will soon have to
try to answer that question.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors and defense attorneys were to begin making closing arguments
today in the racially charged trial. The jury could start deliberating on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Defendants Sean Carroll, 37, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and
Richard Murphy, 27 - all white - have pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder
charges in the killing of Diallo, 22, a black West African immigrant. Their
trial was moved to Albany after the shooting sparked protests and allegations of
widespread police abuse of minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted of murder, the officers face a maximum sentence of 25 years to
life in prison. However, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi opened the door for
a compromise verdict last week by ruling that jurors will be able to convict on
less serious charges such as second-degree manslaughter, which has a minimum
penalty of probation.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the defendants cornered the victim in the elevator-size
vestibule of his apartment building at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999, then, without
warning, unleashed a "wall of lead." The victim was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers were in street clothes as they searched Diallo's neighborhood
for armed suspects. They contend they had good reason for stopping him and for
firing in self-defense with their rapid-fire semiautomatics.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony last week, the officers told a similar story: Diallo ignored
repeated orders by Carroll and McMellon to stop for questioning after they got
out of their unmarked car, badges out. He darted into his dimly lighted
vestibule and pointed a black object they were certain was a gun. He also
remained upright as they fired a continuous volley lasting less than 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Boss testified last week that when he first spotted Diallo, he thought, "My
God, I'm gonna die." Carroll wept on the stand while he recalled the shock of
realizing the black object "was just a wallet. ... I said, 'Where's the
(expletive) gun?"'
</P>
<P>
	   But several prosecution "ear witnesses," mainly neighbors of Diallo,
testified they never heard the officers' voices before sporadic gunfire erupted.
A coroner who autopsied the victim told jurors his wounds showed that he was
either falling or flat on his back when most of the bullets hit.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon were the first to shoot, squeezing off all 16 rounds
from their guns. Boss fired five times and Murphy four while backing up their
partners, leading to speculation they have the best chance at acquittal.

<HEADLINE> Sotheby's announces new chairman, president  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The chairman and president of Sotheby's have stepped
down amid pressure from the U.S. Justice Department, clients and shareholders
over alleged antitrust violations.
<P>
	   A. Alfred Taubman has resigned as chairman of Sotheby's Holdings Inc. and
will be replaced by former Columbia University President Michael Sovern, the
auction house's board of directors said in a news release Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Taubman, who acquired the company in 1983, retains his controlling interest
in the company and a seat on its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   "While this clearly is not an easy decision for me, I have determined that
it is time for me to step down from my role as chairman," Taubman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diana D. Brooks will be replaced as president and chief executive officer of
Sotheby's by William Ruprecht, who has been managing director of Sotheby's North
and South America since 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am very proud of the achievements and initiatives that Sotheby's has
undertaken in recent years, and I am confident that in the future it will build
upon its great franchise and reputation for excellence," Brooks said. "My
decision is a very difficult one, but I have taken it in the best interests of
the company and of my colleagues."
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Justice began an investigation in 1997 into auction houses
including Sotheby's and its main rival, Christie's, focusing on alleged
price-fixing in the commissions paid to sellers.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, Christie's replaced its longstanding 10 percent commission to
sellers with a sliding scale of 2 percent to 10 percent, and Sotheby's soon
adopted a similar policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits collusion in such arrangements as
illegal restraint of trade, punishable by fines and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
	   Sotheby's has also been hit with several civil lawsuits from clients
charging collusion between the two auction houses and shareholder class action
complaints alleging failure to disclose the alleged agreements and their impact
on Sotheby's financial conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis Kaplan, a federal judge in Manhattan, has scheduled a hearing for
Wednesday to begin consolidating the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Sotheby's said it "has recently met with the Department of Justice in order
to discuss a prompt and appropriate resolution of this investigation, which will
allow the company to put this difficult matter behind it."
</P>
<P>
	   Christie's announced last month that in return for immunity from prosecution
it was cooperating with the federal investigation and turning over information
to the Department of Justice.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Look To Mich. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAGINAW, Mich. (AP) -- Pointing toward Tuesday's second key primary clash in
four days, John McCain accused George W. Bush of waging a campaign of
``character assassination.'' The front-runner aimed his public barbs at Bill
Clinton and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   In the heart of auto country, Bush cited comments Gore made years ago in a
book critical of the internal combustion engine. ``I look forward to him
campaigning up here and saying, 'My vision for America is one where you won't be
working,''' Bush said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the Texas governor's public focus on the general election, his
campaign continued to run television commercials critical of McCain in advance
of Tuesday's Michigan primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The two campaigns also traded charges of phoning voters to criticize their
rivals. Surrogates for the candidates contacted voters as well, including in a
recording by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, who attacked a McCain campaign
official as a ``vicious bigot who wrote that conservative Christians in politics
are anti-abortion zealots, homophobes and would-be censors.''
</P>
<P>
	   Legitimate pollsters were out in force, and some said the race was very
close, within the margin of the poll's own sampling error. One even gave McCain
a slight lead, based on his big advantage among Democrats and independents who
said they will vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes were high for both men, but higher for McCain, whose campaign can
ill afford another setback like the one in South Carolina last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, McCain was hoping for a Michigan victory to restart his campaign
momentum and the flow of contributions that followed his big win in the leadoff
New Hampshire primary. McCain's home state of Arizona is voting Tuesday, too,
but most eyes are on Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll have a double win tomorrow evening,'' McCain told more than 1,000
who crammed into a gym at the University of Arizona at Tucson to welcome him
home early Tuesday. ``We'll win because our cause is just.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has said that even if he loses, he'll stay in the race at least until
March 7. That's when California, New York, Ohio and many other states vote in
the biggest night of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
	   At a morning appearance Monday before an overflow crowd in Traverse City,
McCain used some of his harshest words to date in describing the Bush operation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reject this negative campaigning. Reject this character assassination,''
he said. ``Reject the low road to the presidency and support the high road.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush slapped McCain only when asked by reporters during the day. Questioned
about the Arizona senator's promise to break the ``iron triangle'' of lobbyists,
money and legislation, Bush said, ``He talks about the iron triangle in
Washington D.C. He's been ringing that iron triangle like a dinner bell'' -- a
reference to McCain's fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, though, Bush sought to give the impression of a man
looking ahead to the fall campaign, not someone struggling with the nitty-gritty
of a determined primary challenger.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech to the Economic Club of Detroit, he touted education reform, a
biennial budget, tax reform and steps to reduce frivolous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know we're talking about great economic times but no generation should
ever take prosperity for granted,'' he said. ``My job as your future president
is not to think about the Dow Jones today. My job is to look down the road.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for Clinton, he accused the president of missing opportunities for
expanded overseas trade and said, ``I'm going to seize the moment when I become
president.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush made a morning stop at an elementary school, where students were
dressed as presidents to mark the federal holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the school library, Bush listened to a speech by Jaclyn Romero, 9, who
was dressed as former president Bush, and by Lauren Fendt, who was dressed as
John Quincy Adams, who followed his father's footsteps into the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a chance there may be another father and son,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also traveled to a high school, where he likened himself to the Star
Wars character, Luke Skywalker, ``trying to get out of the Death Star. ...
They're all against me, (Michigan) Governor Engler, Governor Bush, all the
governors, all the senators. But we're gonna kill 'em, right, we're gonna get
'em.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush indeed traveled during the day with Engler, one of numerous GOP
governors around the country who helped establish the Texas chief executive as
front-runner in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was joined at his stops by state Sen. Joe Schwarz, who proudly told
audiences he was the only member of his party in the Legislature to break ranks
and join the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was defeated handily in South Carolina after he first launched
negative ads against Bush. When McCain's internal polling showed an erosion of
support, he then stopped, leaving the field clear for the attacks against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan is different: McCain has refrained from attacking Bush in campaign
commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   His hopes for victory lie in his appeal for crossover votes from
independents and some Democrats drawn to his message of reform. But his aides
are worried about the impact of Bush's commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We already have reports of push polls, negative mail pieces; it's hard to
miss the false TV ads,'' Schwarz said in a statement issued by the campaign.
``We're not going to let Bush get away with this shadow campaign in Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
	   In rebuttal, the Bush campaign said McCain's operation was making negative
calls, including one that warns voters not to be ``fooled by George Bush's
negative smear campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign denied any knowledge of the Robertson call, aimed at
former senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, McCain's national campaign
chairman. Rudman angered leaders of the religious right in 1995 by defending
retired Gen. Colin Powell against their attacks over abortion.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phones Change Bangladesh Towns  </HEADLINE>
   By FARID HOSSAIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOLARPAR, Bangladesh (AP) -- Sitting outside her mud-walled hut, Jamirunnesa
dials her Nokia cell phone to inquire about the latest poultry prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Monir Chowdhury, a neighbor, arrives panting to take a long distance call
from his brother working in Malaysia. Later, village doctor Tofazzal Hossain
comes to use the phone to arrange an appointment with a specialist in the city
for one of his patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamirunnesa runs a mobile phone service, the only phone for the 5,000 people
in the farming village of Jolarpar, 20 miles north of Dhaka, the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   She bought it a year ago with help from a bank that makes small loans to
poor women to start home-based businesses -- an example of the ``microcredit''
projects discussed at a conference last week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides serving her neighbors for a fee, the phone helps the 38-year-old
mother of four earn a profit from the poultry farm she runs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are buyers who want to cheat me. But they can't because I've got the
phone, which comes in handy to know at what rate the chickens are selling in the
markets,'' Jamirunnesa says, waving her handset.
</P>
<P>
	   In Bangladesh, even ordinary telephones are still a luxury. Less than 1
percent of the 125 million people have a phone of any kind. The country's
100,000 mobile phones are usually for the urban rich.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamirunnesa, who like many Bangladeshis uses only one name, bought the phone
with a loan of 18,000 takas ($360) from Grameen Bank, which specializes in
helping the poor get a start in business.
</P>
<P>
	   Grameen Bank, established in 1976 by Muhammad Yunus, then a university
economics teacher, is the pioneer of microcredit as a way of building the
economies of developing nations. Since its founding, it has lent $2 billion to
2.3 million Bangladeshis, most of them poor rural women.
</P>
<P>
	   GrameenPhone, the bank's telecommunications subsidiary, is one of four
commercial cellular phone companies in Bangladesh, but the only one to extend
its service to the mostly illiterate countryside.
</P>
<P>
	   It draws the operators of its public phone service from borrowers who
already have established good credit and demonstrated business talent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A telephone is no longer a luxury for villagers,'' said Mehbub Chowdhury,
who heads the marketing of the mobile phones. ``It's a tool for economic
growth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jamirunnesa, who has had almost no formal education, averages a monthly
profit of $50 from the phone service -- twice Bangladesh's per capita income.
</P>
<P>
	   When she took her first loan 10 years ago, her family could not afford three
meals a day, a situation faced by about half of all Bangladeshis.
</P>
<P>
	   She used the money to buy a cow and quickly repaid the loan by selling milk.
Then three years ago, she borrowed $200 to start a poultry farm.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, with the additional revenue from the phone business, she has acquired a
piece of farm land, bought two electric fans for her hut, and is banking some of
her earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ten years ago, we had lost all hopes. Today, I find life worth living,''
says Jamirunnesa, wearing one of several new cotton saris in her wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the first village mobile phone was introduced in 1997, GrameenPhone
has set up phone-service operators in 1,114 villages and plans to reach an
additional 886 villages this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The company conducts a one-day training course for the operator. The only
condition is that at least one family member must recognize the English alphabet
used on the phone dial.
</P>
<P>
	   By giving the franchise to poor women, the service also has a social impact
by challenging the traditional control of wealthier landowners over rural
economies and politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are some rich people who come to us demanding that they be given a
cell phone,'' said Abdus Sabir, a Grameen Bank official who heads the operation
in Jamirunnesa's region. ``We tell them, 'The phone is exclusively for the poor,
not for the rich.'''

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Rise Boost for Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL COONEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The last time the government pushed up gasoline
prices by cutting fuel subsidies, Indonesians took to the streets in bloody
riots that ousted President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly two years later, even with oil prices soaring, Indonesia's new
reformist government is considering reducing subsidies once again to meet
demands from international lenders for a more market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, no one expects a recurrence of the social unrest of 1998, but many
people are still uneasy because the country already is plagued by sectarian and
separatist violence and is struggling to recover from Asia's economic slump.
</P>
<P>
	   The more than doubling of world oil prices over the last year is a two-edged
sword for Indonesia, which is a member of OPEC. As the producer of 6 percent of
the world's oil supply, it is profiting from the runup in prices set off by
OPEC's agreement a year ago to hold down production.
</P>
<P>
	   But with prices up, reducing fuel subsidies would hit poor Indonesians hard.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts believe OPEC will come under increasing pressure -- especially from
the United States and other industrialized nations heavily dependent on oil --
to raise production and thus pressure prices downward.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a move would have a detrimental effect on Indonesia's economy, which is
struggling to recover from its worst recession in a generation. Last month, 20
percent of the country's exports were from its oil and gas industry, bringing in
billions of desperately needed dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   In Indonesia's 2000 state budget, the government assumed the price of oil
would be $18 a barrel. At its present level around $30, President Abdurrahman
Wahid's government has the money it needs to implement reform programs and help
kickstart the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a windfall for the government,'' said Raden Pardede, an economics
analyst at the state-owned securities group Danareksa Securitas. ``But in budget
terms, it's a real challenge to maintain the oil subsidy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesia spent $4 billion last year on fuel subsidies. And even though the
skyrocketing oil price means a boost in revenue, the government is having to
shell out even more to maintain the subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   So it is now thinking about reducing the amount by which it subsidizes
gasoline prices, a move that would result in an immediate rise in the price of
gasoline at the pump. It is 49 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   The subsidy reduction is due to the International Monetary Fund, which has
conditioned future loans on a reduction in government economic subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   Pardede said the government was planning to offset the increase in gasoline
costs to the poor by maintaining its heavy subsidies on kerosene, a popular fuel
for cooking.
</P>
<P>
	   But not everyone believes the government will be able to maintain stability
and reduce fuel subsidies. Many lawmakers have come out in opposition to the
plan in recent weeks, saying it would have a detrimental effect on society and
the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the government does on subsidies, the rise in oil prices is
allowing Indonesia's economy to start catching up with neighboring Malaysia and
Singapore, which both expect economic growth of 5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the Indonesian government predicted the economy would grow 4
percent this year. That would be the first increase since the economy collapsed
during the Asian currency crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil boon won't last, though. Indonesia exports 1.5 million barrels of
oil a day now, but its fields are predicted to begin running dry around 2015 and
it will become a net importer.

   By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- In one of the biggest demonstrations here in
years, 85,000 Puerto Ricans heeded the calls of religious leaders and marched in
silence to protest the planned resumption of U.S. Navy bombing on the island of
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We Want Peace!'' banners they carried demanded.
</P>
<P>
	   They also waved portraits of Jesus and the U.S. territory's single-star red,
white and blue flag as they filled a mile-long stretch of San Juan's Las
Americas Expressway. Hundreds of police cordoned off the highway and watched
without interfering.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``Peace for Vieques'' march was called by religious leaders to repudiate
an agreement between Gov. Pedro Rossello and President Clinton to resume limited
training with dummy bombs on Vieques, the Navy's prize Atlantic fleet bombing
range. Police Chief Pedro Toledo estimated the crowd at 85,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are showing the consensus in Puerto Rico's heart in favor of peace and
justice,'' said San Juan Archbishop Roberto Gonzalez Nieves.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers said the protest was nonpolitical, though many members of this
U.S. territory's tiny Independence Party participated.
</P>
<P>
	   Church leaders' increasing involvement in anti-Navy protests has angered
many pro-statehood politicians. They fear the protests could harm efforts to
make Puerto Rico -- recipient of $11 billion in federal funds annually -- the
51st U.S. state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is anti-American, anti-Navy and does not contribute to the serious work
that Gov. Rossello has done to obtain the Navy's exit,'' said House speaker
Edison Misla Aldarondo.
</P>
<P>
	   Many bristled at the criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even though we're veterans and have done our service, I want to tell the
president of the United States that we want peace for Vieques,'' said Modesto
Santiago Alvarado, 72, a U.S. Army veteran of Korea and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and Rossello agreed last month to allow the Navy to resume limited
training using inert bombs. The pact calls for a referendum, likely to be held
in 2001, that will give Vieques residents two choices:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Resume exercises, including the use of live bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Exercises with dummy bombs and a withdrawal by the Navy by May 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossello's opponents criticized him for abandoning a pledge to stop all
bombings on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, Sen. Frank Murkowski announced he would present a bill in March
that could jeopardize the Vieques compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   Murkowski said the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, of which
he is chairman, would hold hearings on a measure allowing the Navy to keep half
its property on Vieques. The other half, used for storing weapons, would be sold
to the island's 9,400 residents.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision on whether to continue military exercises would be delayed,
Murkowski said, adding he expected Vieques residents to reject Clinton's offer
of $50 million in return for continued bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that is an unfortunate and disagreeable proposal,'' Murkowski,
R-Ala., told reporters in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that even if exercises stop, the Navy needs to retain control of the
range because the bombs, mines and shells scattered across it over nearly 60
years have made it uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Navy has polluted it, and I don't know if it can ever be cleaned up,''
he said. ``If those lands are turned over ... the Navy would be exposed to
endless liability.''

<HEADLINE> Why Do Mosquitoes Love People?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whether it's a summer evening stroll, a fishing trip or a
picnic in the park, more than likely those whiny little devils -- mosquitoes --
are going to find you.
</P>
<P>
	   Agriculture Department scientists are trying to learn why.
</P>
<P>
	   Humans give off hundreds, maybe thousands, of natural scents that bugs find
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
	   "So far, we have found more than 340 different chemical scents produced by
human skin, and some of these attract mosquitoes," says Ulrich R. Bernier, a
chemist with USDA's Agricultural Research Service.
</P>
<P>
	   "Scientists have known for years that lactic acid present on human skin is a
mosquito attractant. So far, this is true for only a handful of species, one of
which is the yellowfever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Finding what attracts
mosquitoes will ultimately help us find ways to control them," Bernier says in
the February issue of Agricultural Research magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernier works at the ARS Center for Medical, Agricultural,and Veterinary
Entomology's Mosquito and Fly Research Unit in Gainesville, Fla. There, he and
his colleagues are testing individual scents and combinations for attractiveness
to different mosquito species.
</P>
<P>
	   Mosquitoes are placed in one side of a cage divided by a screen. An
attractant is pumped in to see if mosquitoes will come to the screen.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernier says it's difficult to find an attractant because it appears that
multiple compounds are needed to attract mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1997, Bernier has been combining different blends and screening them
at different levels to see which blends draw mosquitoes best. A promising scent
is later combined and tested in a blend.
</P>
<P>
	   With some blends, he says, "We can get about 90 percent of the mosquitoes in
the cage to come to the mixture. This is impressive considering my own arm and
hand attract only about 70 percent of them."
</P>
<P>
	   "We still don't have a perfect blend," Bernier notes. "But, we're a lot
closer than we've ever been." Several promising blends, for which Bernier has
filed a patent, are combinations of human-produced odors with and without lactic
acid.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1968, Gainesville scientists discovered lactic acid is an attractant for
the yellowfever mosquito. At that time, carbon dioxide (CO2) was also thought to
be necessary to attract mosquitoes. Bernier says what might be the single most
important discovery about these blends is they don't use CO2, unlike most other
blends or attractants. All of the specific chemical combinations he's isolated
for both the yellowfever mosquito and Anopheles albimanus, a tropical mosquito
that spreads malaria, don't need the CO2.
</P>
<P>
	   ARS entomologist Daniel L. Kline found something else: mosquitoes love dirty
socks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wore the socks for 12 hours on three consecutive days. When I wasn't
wearing the socks, I put them in a sealed plastic bag," Kline says. "I also
found mosquitoes love Limburger cheese. Interestingly enough, the main
ingredient in the cheese is a bacterium that can be found on the human foot."
</P>
<P>
	   Donald R. Barnard, leader of the Gainesville research unit, says, "We expect
attractant-enhanced traps to eventually surpass pesticides in effectiveness. We
hope to develop stand-alone traps that can be used by homeowners or livestock
producers."
</P>
<P>
	   "One day we hope to develop systemic repellents that can be taken orally or
devices that can be worn to neutralize the attractive effects of a person to a
mosquito," he adds.

<HEADLINE> David Letterman Returns to Work  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Heart surgery didn't exactly turn David Letterman into a
softy.
</P>
<P>
	   On his first "Late Show" since his surgery, Letterman was predictably full
of jokes about it -- even saying he had a quintuple, rather than a double,
bypass because the hospital had a special on it.
</P>
<P>
	   But after inviting his six doctors and two nurses from New York-Presbyterian
Hospital on stage, Letterman briefly fought back tears.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was five weeks ago today that the men and women right here saved my
life," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   That didn't mean the doctors were immune from a few jabs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I couldn't have been more proud when these guys carved their initials in
me," the 52-year-old comic said, referring to a New York obstetrician who
recently etched his initials into a woman's abdomen after delivering her baby by
Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
	   The show, shown Monday night, was taped last Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking thinner but otherwise healthy, Letterman reached down twice and
touched his toes before his monologue. He promised to show his scar but didn't.
</P>
<P>
	   "After what I've been through," he said, "I'm just happy to be wearing
clothes that open in the front."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman said one of his doctors had been given a hard time when the
comedian joked that his cholesterol was 680 before the surgery. In reality, his
cholesterol was 170 -- but his father's death from a heart attack also made him
a risk for heart disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before his surgery, Letterman said: "My career flashed before my eyes.
I'm telling you something. It was mostly awkward silences."
</P>
<P>
	   He described a heart bypass as a procedure that involves surgically creating
new paths for blood to flow to his heart.
</P>
<P>
	   "A bypass is what happened to me when I didn't get the 'Tonight Show,"' he
said, a reference to NBC's decision seven years ago to pick Jay Leno over him to
replace Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Seinfeld walked onstage during Letterman's monologue.
</P>
<P>
	   "What are you doing here?" Seinfeld asked. "I thought you were dead."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm on CBS," Letterman replied. "I ain't dead. Why don't you go on home to
your wife?"
</P>
<P>
	   Robin Williams, who appeared in surgical scrubs, and "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" host Regis Philbin were Letterman's first guests. Letterman first
revealed on the air that he needed heart tests during a chat with Philbin.
</P>
<P>
	   One concession to his health: it was Letterman's first show in which he
wasn't sipping regular coffee.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh, God, I hate decaffeinated coffee ... It's like low-alcohol gin. What's
the point?" he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman still needs to take things slow as he recovers. Bill Cosby fills
in as "Late Show" guest host tonight, with Letterman returning to work
Wednesday. Kathie Lee Gifford, Philbin's talk show partner, is Thursday's
substitute. Letterman expects to work on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Nicotine May Help Brain Disease  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The same nicotine that makes cigarettes so addictive may
also have a good side. Researchers say it shows promise against Parkinson's
disease and a variety of other brain conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   In a variety of studies reviewed Monday, doctors said the evidence is
mounting that nicotine can relieve symptoms by changing the way brain uses
message-carrying chemicals called neurotransmitters.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers are testing nicotine patches for neurological diseases in both
children and the elderly, and drug companies are competing to develop nicotine
substitutes that have fewer side effects.
</P>
<P>
	   At a conference Monday, doctors said the field's first gold-standard study
-- one in which dummy treatments are rigorously compared with the real thing --
suggests the patch shows promise in children with Tourette's syndrome, a strange
affliction in which victims may have violent urges and shout obscenities, and
exhibit a spate of tics.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, nicotine has many drawbacks, including its unsavory reputation as the
addictive grabber in cigarettes. Some experts believe nicotine's real future is
in fake forms of the drug.
</P>
<P>
	   "The problem with nicotine is that it is nicotine. You're asking parents to
put their kids on nicotine," said Dr. Paul R. Sanberg of the University of South
Florida, who has tested the drug on more than 100 young Tourette's patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Typically, doctors treat Tourette's with Haldol, a powerful tranquilizer
that is also used against schizophrenia. In the latest study, Sanberg and
colleagues combined nicotine patches and Haldol in 70 children, half of whom got
dummy patches.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found those on nicotine did better and were able to control their
symptoms with lower than usual doses of Haldol. "The data suggest that a
low-dose nicotine patch may be useful in Tourette's syndrome," said Sanberg.
</P>
<P>
	   He and others experimenting with nicotine described their research at a
conference sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicotine patches and gum are available in drugstores without prescriptions.
They are intended to help smokers wean themselves off cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers cautioned that smoking is a bad way to get medical nicotine.
Besides the obvious cancer risk, drug levels spike much higher in cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   They also say more research is needed before nicotine patches become routine
to treat diseases. However, Sanberg said that if Tourette's patients cannot
control their symptoms with standard drugs, a low-dose patch might be worth
trying.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicotine has been tested for many years in small-scale experiments against
Alzheimer's disease and more recently against Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's
causes tremors, rigid limbs and a shuffling walk, and like Alzheimer's, it may
also result in problems with memory and thinking.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Paul Newhouse of the University of Vermont tried nicotine patches on 15
Parkinson's patients. Although there was no comparison group, his pilot study
suggested that nicotine substantially improved their movement and relieved their
mental difficulties.
</P>
<P>
	   Newhouse also tested a synthetic form of nicotine, Abbott Laboratories'
ABT-418, on six Alzheimer's patients. Despite its small size, Newhouse said
patients showed "a significant improvement in verbal learning and memory" on
standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Since no drug firms have exclusive rights to nicotine, researchers say
companies have little interest in paying for studies to prove its health
benefits. However, several are working on nicotine substitutes that can be
patented. These drugs could be more precisely targeted against specific
disorders, carry fewer side effects and be available as pills rather than
patches.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicotine is thought to work by regulating the brain's levels of
message-carrying chemicals, such as dopamine and acetylcholine. Researchers say
they see no sign that patients get hooked on the patch. The main side effects
are nausea and itching around the patch.
</P>
<P>
	   Another drawback of the patch is the possibility it might trigger heart
attacks, as the much higher nicotine in cigarettes can. Sanberg said that in his
studies, children's heart rates rise about 10 percent, but they show no other
obvious heart effects.

<HEADLINE> Jury to hear closing arguments in Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Was Amadou Diallo's death in a barrage of 41 police
bullets a mistake or murder?
<P>
	   After hearing nine days of testimony in the trial of four police officers
who killed the unarmed Diallo on his Bronx doorstep, a jury will soon have to
try to answer that question.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors and defense attorneys were to begin making closing arguments
today in the racially charged trial. The jury could start deliberating on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Defendants Sean Carroll, 37, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and
Richard Murphy, 27 - all white - have pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder
charges in the killing of Diallo, 22, a black West African immigrant. Their
trial was moved to Albany after the shooting sparked protests and allegations of
widespread police abuse of minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted of murder, the officers face a maximum sentence of 25 years to
life in prison. However, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi opened the door for
a compromise verdict last week by ruling that jurors will be able to convict on
less serious charges such as second-degree manslaughter, which has a minimum
penalty of probation.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the defendants cornered the victim in the elevator-size
vestibule of his apartment building at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999, then, without
warning, unleashed a "wall of lead." The victim was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers were in street clothes as they searched Diallo's neighborhood
for armed suspects. They contend they had good reason for stopping him and for
firing in self-defense with their rapid-fire semiautomatics.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony last week, the officers told a similar story: Diallo ignored
repeated orders by Carroll and McMellon to stop for questioning after they got
out of their unmarked car, badges out. He darted into his dimly lighted
vestibule and pointed a black object they were certain was a gun. He also
remained upright as they fired a continuous volley lasting less than 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Boss testified last week that when he first spotted Diallo, he thought, "My
God, I'm gonna die." Carroll wept on the stand while he recalled the shock of
realizing the black object "was just a wallet. ... I said, 'Where's the
(expletive) gun?"'
</P>
<P>
	   But several prosecution "ear witnesses," mainly neighbors of Diallo,
testified they never heard the officers' voices before sporadic gunfire erupted.
A coroner who autopsied the victim told jurors his wounds showed that he was
either falling or flat on his back when most of the bullets hit.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon were the first to shoot, squeezing off all 16 rounds
from their guns. Boss fired five times and Murphy four while backing up their
partners, leading to speculation they have the best chance at acquittal.

<HEADLINE> Bradley opens 2-week sprint to March 7 primaries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - From the stage at the Apollo Theatre to a ballroom at
Adelphi University, Bill Bradley opened a furious two-week sprint to the March 7
primaries, accusing Al Gore of being a closet conservative with a past as
"poster boy" for the National Rifle Association.
<P>
	   The vice president, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential
nomination, countered in an angry Harlem debate Monday night: "You're sounding a
little desperate because you're trying to build yourself up by tearing everybody
else down."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who lost to Gore in Iowa and New Hampshire, has two weeks to stage
a comeback in the balloting in more than a dozen states. He used his ninth
campaign debate with Gore to debut a more aggressive strategy of highlighting
inconsistencies in Gore's record, stretching back to his years as a Tennessee
congressman.
</P>
<P>
	   Unfurled in patches Monday night, Bradley's new offensive was to be unveiled
in full today in an address at Adelphi University on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning Wednesday, Bradley will spend a whopping six days in Washington
state working toward what spokesman Eric Hauser called a "momentum boosting" win
in the state's nonbinding primary Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who is backed by the Democratic Party establishment, accused Bradley
of attack tactics that "divide us as Democrats." He was taking today off at home
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he was an advocate of affirmative steps to open opportunities for
blacks, and to improve education as well, calling them "the best reparation" for
slavery.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley argued Gore was concealing a more right-leaning record. "Calling
attention to the fact that he was a conservative Democrat before he was Bill
Clinton's vice president is simply truth-telling," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a conservative Democrat, did not support national health insurance,
(had) an 84 percent right-to-life voting record and was the poster boy for the
NRA."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, for all the clatter about Gore's veracity, Bradley volunteered this
answer when an analyst for CNN, which broadcast the 90-minute debate, asked
whether Gore had "the trustworthiness, the intellectual honesty" to make a good
president: "The people will make this decision. My view also is that if Al were
the nominee, I would support him."
</P>
<P>
	   Neither rival was spared from jeers and boos by the raucous and largely
black audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those in the crowd were Whoopi Goldberg (Gore supporter), film
director Spike Lee (for Bradley) and O.J. Simpson defense attorney Johnnie
Cochran (alliance unclear).
</P>
<P>
	   "It was heartwarming to see two candidates fight over us rather than take us
for granted," said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who added that he will probably make an
endorsement next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates used the forum, centered on urban and minority issues, to
appeal to non-white voters - who are expected to account for anywhere between 20
percent and 35 percent of New York's Democratic primary turnout.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls give Gore a prohibitive lead among minority voters, much of it
inherited from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, who will star in a TV ad for Bradley to be shown in New York, said he
was concerned that black voters are blindly supporting Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right or wrong, black people think President Clinton can do no wrong. But I
don't think that means we should automatically transfer that allegiance from
Clinton to Al Gore," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching across the three feet separating their lecterns, Bradley held out a
sheaf of papers he said documented five votes by Gore between 1979 and 1981 to
preserve the tax-exempt status of colleges that racially discriminate.
</P>
<P>
	   In those votes, Gore split with members of the Congressional Black Caucus,
including New York Rep. Charlie Rangel, a leading Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore refused to take the papers and explained away the votes as "a vote on
quotas."
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, he challenged Bradley to explain a 1995 vote that Gore described as
a rejection of expanding minority ownership of broadcast outlets.
</P>
<P>
	   "What you see is an elaborate what I call 'Gore dance,"' Bradley said. "It
is a dance to avoid facing up to your conservative record."
</P>
<P>
	   "The problem is these attacks don't solve any problems," Gore said. "They do
divide us as Democrats. They distract us from the real enemy, the right wing
extremists, Confederate flag-waving Republicans," Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Report on Medical Mistakes Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants hospitals to tell patients and
the government how often they kill or seriously injure those in their care.
</P>
<P>
	   Hospitals nationwide would have to disclose serious and deadly mistakes if
Congress adopts a White House plan developed in response to a report last year
that estimated medical mix-ups kill as many as 98,000 Americans each year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also planned today to order several new requirements that do not
need congressional approval, including an immediate mandatory reporting
requirement for the 500 Defense Department-administered hospitals that serve an
estimated 8 million people. And the Health Care Financing Administration will
require error reduction plans this year in all 6,000 hospitals that participate
in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration has a year to develop new standards to help
prevent medical mistakes caused by sound-alike drug names or look-alike
products. The agency will also come up with new standards for labels that
highlight common problems such as errors in dosage size.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House wants all hospitals to report errors within three years, but
cannot force compliance without legislation from Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   There already are plans in Congress to respond to the Institute of Medicine
report on medical mistakes that could short-circuit the White House plan by
requiring faster or more comprehensive reporting.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., predicted a bipartisan medical error bill will
pass this year, and two Senate committees are holding hearings.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House sees its plan as a compromise between patient advocates who
want full disclosure of medical mistakes and representatives of doctors and
hospitals who fear more disclosure means more lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House wants a mandatory national reporting system, administered by
the states, that would collect information about preventable deaths and major
injuries by hospital and type of problem. Names of individual doctors or other
health care workers would not be public.
</P>
<P>
	   Hospitals would not have to report less serious mistakes or close calls,
although the White House hopes they would do so voluntarily, a senior White
House official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole idea here is to not blame people,'' said the White House
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Obviously, we have a problem in
medical errors, and we have to acknowledge it. Acknowledging it is the first
step, but we can't make it punitive.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president's proposed budget for next year includes $33 million to
improve the reporting system for medical mistakes at the FDA.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposed budget also includes $20 million for new research on
reducing medical errors and to create a new patient safety clearinghouse. The
new study center would fund research on patient safety nationwide and promote
ways to apply the findings.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, head of the Washington-based Public Citizen's Health
Research Group, said the White House approach does not go far enough. Hospitals
can still mask the true level of mistakes by failing to perform enough
autopsies, and patients deserve a full accounting, Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To be silent on this major source of finding out the nature of mistakes
both in diagnoses and treatment is just irresponsibility,'' Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other end of the argument is Dr. Nancy Dickey, immediate past
president of the American Medical Association. She said there is no evidence
that hospitals are safer in states with reporting systems in place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are opposed to mandatory reporting,'' Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighteen states already have some kind of mandatory reporting system.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the Institute of Medicine, a private organization chartered by
Congress to advise the government on scientific matters, estimated that medical
mistakes kill between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans each year. The institute said
it found flaws in the way hospitals, clinics and pharmacies operate.
</P>
<P>
	   The mistakes ranged from botched surgeries to misunderstandings over dosages
and effects of prescription drugs.

Clinton: Hospitals Must Report Medical Mistakes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants hospitals to tell patients and
the government how often they kill or seriously injure those in their care.
Hospitals nationwide would have to disclose serious and deadly mistakes if
Congress adopts a White House plan developed in response to a report last year
that estimated medical mix-ups kill as many as 98,000 Americans each year.
Clinton also planned Tuesday to order several new requirements that do not need
congressional approval, including an immediate mandatory reporting requirement
for the 500 Defense Department-administered hospitals that serve an estimated 8
million people.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Settlement talks in the Microsoft Corp. antitrust lawsuit
are going so poorly that the trial judge is moving ahead with plans for final

Jackson didn't see any need to delay the last round of arguments, set for
Tuesday, to accommodate ongoing secret negotiations in Chicago between
government lawyers and Microsoft officials. Though sources indicate little
progress, negotiations are aimed at averting an agonizingly slow appeals battle
that could wind through the federal courts for years.

Texas Inmates Take Officer Hostage

	   LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) -- Two death row inmates who were part of a botched
escape in 1998 took a female guard hostage Monday in a new prison that was
supposed to be more secure. The guard was taking one inmate back to his cell at
about 4:15 p.m. when he and another inmate overpowered her, said Texas
Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Fitzgerald. One inmate had
somehow jimmied his cell door, Fitzgerald said. "They have no place to go.
Officers have sealed off the area," he said. "She has not been threatened or
harmed in any way, but it is a tense situation."

Gore, Bradley Spar in Harlem Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an angry Harlem debate, Al Gore accused Bill Bradley of
attack tactics that "divide us as Democrats," while the challenger described the
vice president as a sometime conservative with a suspect record on affirmative
action. The tone of the argument on the stage of the historic Apollo Theater was
set at the start, when the presidential rivals agreed that they'd both take
steps against racial profiling -- and immediately tried to turn the question
against each other. The 90-minute debate -- the candidates ninth presidential
debate -- was televised by CNN. The largely black audience cheered, applauded,
jeered, sometimes booed. Neither candidate was spared the raucous reactions.

a month before Taiwan's presidential election campaign, was intended to increase
the pressure on Taiwan's three presidential candidates. Although there was no
immediate reaction from Taiwan's government or the candidates' camps, policy
toward China has been at the center of the campaign. Already this month, China
sailed its newly acquired, destroyer through the Taiwan Strait.

<HEADLINE> After-School Programs Growing in US  </HEADLINE>
   By MELANIE CARROLL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The buses at Public School 27 have long gone, but
fifth-grader Shanna Holmes is still in a classroom, busily creating an elaborate
pop-up greeting card.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10-year-old is one of 235 children in the Crossroads After-School
Program at the Brooklyn school. When she and her classmates master cutting milk
cartons into cards, they will teach the technique to residents at a nearby home
for mentally handicapped adults.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's fun,'' Shanna said of the program. ``I like staying in school after
school. It's a lot better than being at home. At home all I do is watch TV and
be alone.''
</P>
<P>
	   After-school programs like that at Public School 27 are a growing trend
nationwide, spurred on by charity foundations which, in turn, get help from
community groups and government.
</P>
<P>
	   Free after-school programs are popular with parents, especially as the
number of working mothers increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Socorro Perez, a mother of second- and seventh-grade boys, said she had
problems helping them with their homework -- her first language is Spanish --
before enrolling them in the program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's helped them a lot,'' she said. ``Before they stayed at home.
Sometimes I had to contact a friend to help with the English homework.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government has become an enthusiastic supporter of after-school
programs. This year it allocated $454 million to help support centers in 1,600
rural and inner-city schools in 49 states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's been exponential growth in after-school programs,'' says Adrienna
de Kanter, a special adviser to the U.S. Department of Education. ``It's been a
silent revolution.''
</P>
<P>
	   At P.S. 27 in New York, principal Marilyn Fuenes says the after-hours
program has given her school -- and its students -- a new spirit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Two years ago, nothing was happening. The kids couldn't play. They would
go to school and then go home,'' she said. ``Now the school has come to life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shanna's low-income, dockside neighborhood has one of the city's largest
public-housing projects, and 97 percent of P.S. 27 students receive free school
lunches.
</P>
<P>
	   The Crossroads program at P.S. 27 is a partnership between Good Shepherd
Services, a neighborhood community group, and The After-School Corporation,
which provided the funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Philanthropist George Soros started the corporation in April 1998, pledging
up to $125 million over five years to create after-school programs in New York
City public schools, the nation's largest district.
</P>
<P>
	   The corporation has created nearly 100 after school programs for 26,000
children. This school year, its budget is $36 million, with more than $25
million coming from private and public coffers. Operating for three hours from
Monday through Friday, the programs cost about $1,000 each year per child.
</P>
<P>
	   The Crossroads programs are designed to enrich learning and 45 minutes are
devoted to homework, but they have a wide range of recreational activities, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes you have to take the reins off a little,'' says John Powell, 24,
a volunteer in the P.S. 27 program.
</P>
<P>
	   In one classroom on a winter's afternoon, first- and second-graders thump
drums, knock wooden sticks together and bang tambourines on their hips, keeping
time with a music teacher.
</P>
<P>
	   Down the hall, second graders in theater class shriek with excitement as
they transform themselves into Pikachus, a character from the popular Pokemon
cartoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The smallest often get help from bigger kids -- part of the volunteer
Counselor-in-Training program, which pairs sixth- and seventh-graders with
first- or second-graders.
</P>
<P>
	   Mentor Emanuel Turner said he often feels like a teacher and guidance
counselor as he helps a second-grade ``buddy'' read. He is learning patience,
too, since his charge would rather run around than do homework.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Soros' corporation, the Education Department does not create the
programs single-handedly. Almost all after-school programs are a collaboration
between the government, private groups and community organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Political leaders have noticed the trend. During his State of the Union
address in January, President Clinton said he wanted to more than double funding
for after-school and summer-school programs to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore also has spoken favorably about the after-school
idea, and Republican hopeful George W. Bush has said he wants to reverse federal
rules that prevent churches and synagogues from being part of the after-hours
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Negron, who runs an after-school program in New York's Washington
Heights neighborhood, said he's not surprised to see politicians speaking out on
after-school opportunities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's no coincidence that it's an election year,'' he said. ``For parents
it's a hot issue.''

<HEADLINE> Ga. House OKs Lethal Injection Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By RUSS BYNUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Georgia House has voted overwhelmingly to replace
electrocution with lethal injection, a step toward ending a practice used since
the state stopped hanging inmates in 1924.
</P>
<P>
	   The 162-10 vote came Monday as legislators wondered whether the U.S. Supreme
Court is preparing to outlaw the electric chair. Similar concerns in Florida
prompted a recent switch to lethal injection there; the state is to have its
first execution by that method Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Georgia bill becomes law, Alabama and Nebraska would be the only
states that use electrocution as the sole means of execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. E.C. Tillman, a preacher who has ministered to condemned inmates, said
he sponsored Georgia's bill to fulfill a promise to try to move the state away
from what he called a ``barbaric method.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Lethal injection, to me, would be a more humane way,'' Tillman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the debate centered on whether Georgia should abolish the death
penalty altogether, rather than change execution methods. An attempt to end
capital punishment was defeated after several lawmakers, mainly black Democrats,
defended executions as a necessary evil.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The death penalty is hard. It's cruel. But it's a necessity,'' said Rep.
Lawrence Roberts, a convenience store owner. ``There's nothing (else) to prevent
robbers and killers from coming in, maiming and killing my employees.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Joe Heckstall said constituents urged him to vote to abolish capital
punishment because they feel it unfairly affects blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ain't going to make excuses for African-American criminals, white
criminals, Hispanic criminals,'' Heckstall said. ``If you commit an atrocity, I
don't care what your socioeconomic background is. I don't feel sorry for you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others argued that the risk of executing the innocent is too great to
justify capital punishment. Rep. Ben Allen said Georgia should at least put a
moratorium on executions, as Illinois has done, to study the fairness of the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The switch to lethal injection would apply to death row inmates convicted of
crimes committed May 1 and thereafter. The 127 inmates now on death row in
Georgia would still die by electrocution, unless the state or U.S. Supreme Court
strikes down that method.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes declined to comment on the lethal injection bill
other than to say he supports the death penalty, said Joselyn Butler, his
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume, Georgia has
put 23 inmates to death.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court dropped a challenge to Florida's death penalty law after
the state switched from electrocution to lethal injection last month. The court
is preparing to hear an Alabama case.
</P>
<P>
	   A bill before the Nebraska Legislature would switch the state's execution
method from electrocution to lethal injection, but it's uncertain when it will
be considered.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reformers Win Parliament Seats  </HEADLINE>
   By AFSHIN VALINEJAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- An influential reform leader has said that talks with
the United States would not be a ``sin,'' a view shared by many reformist
candidates set to take control of Iran's next Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks with the United States, a more liberal press and increased personal
freedoms are expected to be among the issues discussed in the next Parliament,
which resumes in June.
</P>
<P>
	   Moderates look set to wrest the legislative body from hard-line control for
the first time since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution ousted the pro-U.S. shah and
brought the Muslim Shiite clergy to power.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. relations with Iran broke off during the revolution, when demonstrators
seized the U.S. Embassy and held 52 Americans captive until January 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not to talk with any country is not a virtue, and to talk is not a sin,''
Abdollah Nouri, a former interior minister, told reporters Monday when asked his
opinion on opening talks with the United States. Iran has not had relations with
the United States in over two decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Nouri was impeached by hard-liners in 1998 and jailed in November on charges
of religious dissent and advocating better ties with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   He was let out of jail on a four-day furlough on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Nouri was considered a consensus candidate among the reformers for the post
of Parliament speaker until his incarceration, which was believed to be an
attempt by the hard-liners to prevent him from taking part in the elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Exceeding even their own expectations, reformists have won more than 70
percent of the votes in Friday's legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
	   They garnered 137 of the 191 parliament seats announced as of late Monday.
Conservatives have won 44 seats, independents 10, and 69 are to be decided in
run-offs. Results from the capital had not yet been officially announced, but
reformists candidates were leading in 26 of Tehran's 30 seats. Some 83 percent
of Iran's 38.7 million electorate voted.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Iranians, who welcome increased ties with the West and more political
and social reforms, voted for the reformists in the hopes of ending decades of
international isolation and strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
	   But the conservative clergy consider the United States Iran's archenemy.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of Iran's population of 62 million are under 25, and many
were born after the revolution. The youth, along with women, were the driving
force behind President Mohammad Khatami's landslide victory in May 1997 and were
also responsible for his allies' parliamentary victory.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tehran, more than 55 percent of the electorate voted for Mohammadreza
Khatami, the younger brother of the president and head of the Islamic Iran
Participation Front, the largest reform group.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also has called for people-to-people exchanges with the United
States, but stopped short of calling for talks.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the top five vote-getters in Tehran is Nouri's younger brother,
Alireza, who has said that the issue of ties with the United States should be
decided in a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahmad Borqani, another leading candidate in favor of talks with the United
States, said one of the first things the reformist groups will do is form
alliances with each other to have increased influence.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservatives, shocked by the extent of their defeat, have on the most part
refused to comment about the election results.
</P>
<P>
	   Two hard-liners, Ali Zadsar and Ahmed Rasouli-Nejad, who were involved in
the impeachment of Nouri and in a failed attempt to impeach Culture Minister
Ataollah Mohajerani, lost their seats in the towns of Jiroft and Damavand.
</P>
<P>
	   Former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who had been allied with the
hard-liners, was falling short of the 25 percent needed to win a seat outright
in Tehran but still could qualify for a runoff.
</P>
<P>
	   What remains to be seen now is whether the hard-liners will continue to use
their key powers to block the reformists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Guardian Council, made up of 12 clerics and lawyers, must approve all
bills passed by Parliament. And Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader,
has the final word. He heads the armed forces, judiciary, and state-run radio
and television.

<HEADLINE> Sotheby's announces new chairman, president  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The chairman and president of Sotheby's have stepped
down amid pressure from the U.S. Justice Department, clients and shareholders
over alleged antitrust violations.
<P>
	   A. Alfred Taubman has resigned as chairman of Sotheby's Holdings Inc. and
will be replaced by former Columbia University President Michael Sovern, the
auction house's board of directors said in a news release Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Taubman, who acquired the company in 1983, retains his controlling interest
in the company and a seat on its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   "While this clearly is not an easy decision for me, I have determined that
it is time for me to step down from my role as chairman," Taubman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diana D. Brooks will be replaced as president and chief executive officer of
Sotheby's by William Ruprecht, who has been managing director of Sotheby's North
and South America since 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am very proud of the achievements and initiatives that Sotheby's has
undertaken in recent years, and I am confident that in the future it will build
upon its great franchise and reputation for excellence," Brooks said. "My
decision is a very difficult one, but I have taken it in the best interests of
the company and of my colleagues."
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Justice began an investigation in 1997 into auction houses
including Sotheby's and its main rival, Christie's, focusing on alleged
price-fixing in the commissions paid to sellers.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, Christie's replaced its longstanding 10 percent commission to
sellers with a sliding scale of 2 percent to 10 percent, and Sotheby's soon
adopted a similar policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits collusion in such arrangements as
illegal restraint of trade, punishable by fines and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
	   Sotheby's has also been hit with several civil lawsuits from clients
charging collusion between the two auction houses and shareholder class action
complaints alleging failure to disclose the alleged agreements and their impact
on Sotheby's financial conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis Kaplan, a federal judge in Manhattan, has scheduled a hearing for
Wednesday to begin consolidating the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Sotheby's said it "has recently met with the Department of Justice in order
to discuss a prompt and appropriate resolution of this investigation, which will
allow the company to put this difficult matter behind it."
</P>
<P>
	   Christie's announced last month that in return for immunity from prosecution
it was cooperating with the federal investigation and turning over information
to the Department of Justice.

<HEADLINE> Bradley opens 2-week sprint to March 7 primaries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - From the stage at the Apollo Theatre to a ballroom at
Adelphi University, Bill Bradley opened a furious two-week sprint to the March 7
primaries, accusing Al Gore of being a closet conservative with a past as
"poster boy" for the National Rifle Association.
<P>
	   The vice president, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential
nomination, countered in an angry Harlem debate Monday night: "You're sounding a
little desperate because you're trying to build yourself up by tearing everybody
else down."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who lost to Gore in Iowa and New Hampshire, has two weeks to stage
a comeback in the balloting in more than a dozen states. He used his ninth
campaign debate with Gore to debut a more aggressive strategy of highlighting
inconsistencies in Gore's record, stretching back to his years as a Tennessee
congressman.
</P>
<P>
	   Unfurled in patches Monday night, Bradley's new offensive was to be unveiled
in full today in an address at Adelphi University on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning Wednesday, Bradley will spend a whopping six days in Washington
state working toward what spokesman Eric Hauser called a "momentum boosting" win
in the state's nonbinding primary Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who is backed by the Democratic Party establishment, accused Bradley
of attack tactics that "divide us as Democrats." He was taking today off at home
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he was an advocate of affirmative steps to open opportunities for
blacks, and to improve education as well, calling them "the best reparation" for
slavery.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley argued Gore was concealing a more right-leaning record. "Calling
attention to the fact that he was a conservative Democrat before he was Bill
Clinton's vice president is simply truth-telling," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a conservative Democrat, did not support national health insurance,
(had) an 84 percent right-to-life voting record and was the poster boy for the
NRA."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, for all the clatter about Gore's veracity, Bradley volunteered this
answer when an analyst for CNN, which broadcast the 90-minute debate, asked
whether Gore had "the trustworthiness, the intellectual honesty" to make a good
president: "The people will make this decision. My view also is that if Al were
the nominee, I would support him."
</P>
<P>
	   Neither rival was spared from jeers and boos by the raucous and largely
black audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those in the crowd were Whoopi Goldberg (Gore supporter), film
director Spike Lee (for Bradley) and O.J. Simpson defense attorney Johnnie
Cochran (alliance unclear).
</P>
<P>
	   "It was heartwarming to see two candidates fight over us rather than take us
for granted," said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who added that he will probably make an
endorsement next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates used the forum, centered on urban and minority issues, to
appeal to non-white voters - who are expected to account for anywhere between 20
percent and 35 percent of New York's Democratic primary turnout.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls give Gore a prohibitive lead among minority voters, much of it
inherited from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, who will star in a TV ad for Bradley to be shown in New York, said he
was concerned that black voters are blindly supporting Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right or wrong, black people think President Clinton can do no wrong. But I
don't think that means we should automatically transfer that allegiance from
Clinton to Al Gore," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching across the three feet separating their lecterns, Bradley held out a
sheaf of papers he said documented five votes by Gore between 1979 and 1981 to
preserve the tax-exempt status of colleges that racially discriminate.
</P>
<P>
	   In those votes, Gore split with members of the Congressional Black Caucus,
including New York Rep. Charlie Rangel, a leading Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore refused to take the papers and explained away the votes as "a vote on
quotas."
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, he challenged Bradley to explain a 1995 vote that Gore described as
a rejection of expanding minority ownership of broadcast outlets.
</P>
<P>
	   "What you see is an elaborate what I call 'Gore dance,"' Bradley said. "It
is a dance to avoid facing up to your conservative record."
</P>
<P>
	   "The problem is these attacks don't solve any problems," Gore said. "They do
divide us as Democrats. They distract us from the real enemy, the right wing
extremists, Confederate flag-waving Republicans," Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Letterman's back - and his heart seems into it  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Heart surgery didn't exactly turn David Letterman into a
softy.
<P>
	   On his first "Late Show" since his surgery, Letterman was predictably full
of jokes about it - even saying he had a quintuple, rather than a double, bypass
because the hospital had a special on it.
</P>
<P>
	   But after inviting his six doctors and two nurses from New York-Presbyterian
Hospital on stage, Letterman briefly fought back tears.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was five weeks ago today that the men and women right here saved my
life," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   That didn't mean the doctors were immune from a few jabs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I couldn't have been more proud when these guys carved their initials in
me," the 52-year-old comic said, referring to a New York obstetrician who
recently etched his initials into a woman's abdomen after delivering her baby by
Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
	   The show, shown Monday night, was taped last Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking thinner but otherwise healthy, Letterman reached down twice and
touched his toes before his monologue. He promised to show his scar but didn't.
</P>
<P>
	   "After what I've been through," he said, "I'm just happy to be wearing
clothes that open in the front."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman said one of his doctors had been given a hard time when the
comedian joked that his cholesterol was 680 before the surgery. In reality, his
cholesterol was 170 - but his father's death from a heart attack also made him a
risk for heart disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before his surgery, Letterman said: "My career flashed before my eyes.
I'm telling you something. It was mostly awkward silences."
</P>
<P>
	   He described a heart bypass as a procedure that involves surgically creating
new paths for blood to flow to his heart.
</P>
<P>
	   "A bypass is what happened to me when I didn't get the 'Tonight Show,"' he
said, a reference to NBC's decision seven years ago to pick Jay Leno over him to
replace Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Seinfeld walked onstage during Letterman's monologue.
</P>
<P>
	   "What are you doing here?" Seinfeld asked. "I thought you were dead."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm on CBS," Letterman replied. "I ain't dead. Why don't you go on home to
your wife?"
</P>
<P>
	   Robin Williams, who appeared in surgical scrubs, and "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" host Regis Philbin were Letterman's first guests. Letterman first
revealed on the air that he needed heart tests during a chat with Philbin.
</P>
<P>
	   One concession to his health: It was Letterman's first show in which he
wasn't sipping regular coffee.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh, God, I hate decaffeinated coffee," he said. "It's like low-alcohol gin.
What's the point?"
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman still needs to take things slow as he recovers. Bill Cosby fills
in as "Late Show" guest host tonight, with Letterman returning to work
Wednesday. Kathie Lee Gifford, Philbin's talk show partner, is Thursday's
substitute. Letterman expects to work on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Continue To Bicker  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- The pulse of the Republican presidential race quickened
today, with voters going to the polls in GOP contests in Michigan and Arizona,
and Sen. John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush trading fresh charges of negative
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to the Arizona senator accused religious broadcaster Pat Robertson of
making calls on Bush's behalf implying that former Sen. Warren Rudman, McCain's
national campaign chairman, was ``a vicious bigot.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rudman angered leaders of the religious right in 1995 by defending retired
Gen. Colin Powell against their attacks over abortion. He subsequently wrote
about the controversy in a book, saying there were many ``bigots'' in the
religious right movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush camp denied any connection, but Michigan Gov. John Engler chastised
McCain for mailing postcards urging Democrats to vote in the Republican primary
-- and noting they could switch back in future elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Engler, a supporter of the Texas governor, said the tactic was aimed at
allowing the opposition to pick the GOP candidate who will face Al Gore or Bill
Bradley in November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the first time in American politics that we've had a Republican
candidate seeking hardcore Democrats to come into our primary and then go back
later,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
	   The back-and-forth highlighted the stakes not only in terms of delegates --
there are 58 up for grabs in Michigan and 30 in Arizona -- but also in terms of
political survival.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining McCain and Bush on the ballots was former Reagan administration
official Alan Keyes, who is mired in single digits in the polls. He urged
Michigan voters to reject Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Is this the kind of country ... where you're going to hand out the most
important responsibility ... based upon the family someone is born to?'' he
asked a cheering, foot-stomping crowd of about 2,000 in Grand Rapids on Monday.
``Republicans, wake up. The standard is not good in business, and it's not good
in politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Polls taken after the GOP contest Saturday in South Carolina showed McCain
running close to Bush in Michigan, and with a slight lead in one survey.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan pollster Ed Sarpolus said McCain had gained among women in his
polling. American Research Group pollster Dick Bennett said his interviewers
picked up anger among Democrats and independents about Bush's South Carolina
win, and they are key to McCain's narrow lead in his poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Non-Republicans backed McCain by more than 4-to-1 in the ARG poll, while
Republicans backed Bush by 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Both pollsters agreed that the turnout of Republicans versus non-Republicans
was key.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush scored a needed win Saturday, but McCain was hoping to split or sweep
today's voting to stave off doubts that his 18-point win in New Hampshire's GOP
primary was a fluke.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain predicted a double win today. ``We'll win because our cause is
just,'' he said at a late-night rally Monday at the University of Tucson after
he flew back to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if he loses today, McCain has said he'll stay in the race at least
until March 7, when California, New York, Ohio and many other states vote on the
biggest night of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
	   Before leaving Michigan, he used harsh language to describe the Bush
operation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reject this negative campaigning. Reject this character assassination,''
he told an audience Traverse City. ``Reject the low road to the presidency and
support the high road.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, Bush answered back only in response to questions from
reporters. Highlighting his focus on the future, he was leaving Michigan before
the polls closed for Missouri and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about McCain's reformist pledge to break the ``iron triangle'' of
lobbyists, money and legislation, Bush took a dig at his opponent's fund
raising, telling reporters in Detroit: ``He talks about the iron triangle in
Washington D.C. He's been ringing that iron triangle like a dinner bell.''
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, though, Bush sought to give the impression of a man
looking ahead to a fall campaign against Gore -- not someone doing battle with a
determined primary challenger.
</P>
<P>
	   That is not to say that aides and supporters in both camps didn't exchange
blows.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point Monday, Engler showed reporters a postcard mailed out by
McCain's campaign. It reminded Michigan Democrats of the GOP primary and urged
them to vote for McCain, adding, ``Even if you vote in Tuesday's Republican
primary, you can still participate in future Democratic Party political
activity.'' Michigan's Democratic presidential contest is next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky complained about Robertson's
recorded telephone message, which was received by one of the senator's Michigan
loyalists.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the campaign was not behind the call.

<HEADLINE> Cops Union Calls for Outside Review  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL CHAVEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In an unprecedented move, the union representing Los
Angeles police officers called Monday for an independent review of the ongoing
police corruption probe.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles Police Protective League, which represents about 9,500
officers, joins a growing number of groups and officials calling for an
independent review of wrongdoing within the department's Rampart station.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The police union never before has called for civilian oversight, but this
scandal is so deep that the situation begs for a third-party and active public
participation to take part in this,'' said Geoffrey Garfield, a union spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 11 officers have been relieved of duty, and 40 convictions have
been overturned as a result of the scandal in which anti-gang officers at the
Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart station beat, framed and shot innocent
people. Dozens of other criminal cases are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, an LAPD disciplinary panel recommended that Capt. Richard Meraz
be suspended for 20 days for failing to disclose everything he learned after an
alleged beating at the Rampart station.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Command accountability is a key issue,'' said Capt. Gregory Meyer, who
headed the Board of Rights panel that voted 2-1 for the suspension.
</P>
<P>
	   It is up to Chief Bernard Parks to determine what punishment the 35-year
veteran officer should receive.
</P>
<P>
	   The police union and the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California planned to support a motion Tuesday by City Councilman Joel Wachs
seeking an independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The union also has asked University of Southern California law professor
Erwin Chemerinsky to review the department's Board of Inquiry report on the
scandal. The board, which was convened by Parks, is due to release its report
March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal broke last fall when former Rampart station Officer Rafael Perez
began telling of corruption in the station's anti-gang unit in exchange for a
lighter sentence for stealing cocaine from an evidence room.
</P>
<P>
	   One city official has estimated the tainted convictions will cost the city
at least $125 million in lawsuit awards. The widening scandal has threatened to
wreck the city budget and could affect city services as the lawsuits continue to
mount.
</P>
<P>
	   The state attorney general's office said last week it would take a larger
role in the investigation and the FBI has contacted the LAPD about taking part
in the probe.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Debate in Harlem  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- From the stage at the Apollo Theatre to a ballroom at
Adelphi University, Bill Bradley opened a furious two-week sprint to the March 7
primaries, accusing Al Gore of being a closet conservative with a past as
``poster boy'' for the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential
nomination, countered in an angry Harlem debate Monday night: ``You're sounding
a little desperate because you're trying to build yourself up by tearing
everybody else down.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who lost to Gore in Iowa and New Hampshire, has two weeks to stage
a comeback in the balloting in more than a dozen states. He used his ninth
campaign debate with Gore to debut a more aggressive strategy of highlighting
inconsistencies in Gore's record, stretching back to his years as a Tennessee
congressman.
</P>
<P>
	   Unfurled in patches Monday night, Bradley's new offensive was to be unveiled
in full today in an address at Adelphi University on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning Wednesday, Bradley will spend a whopping six days in Washington
state working toward what spokesman Eric Hauser called a ``momentum boosting''
win in the state's nonbinding primary Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who is backed by the Democratic Party establishment, accused Bradley
of attack tactics that ``divide us as Democrats.'' He was taking today off at
home in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he was an advocate of affirmative steps to open opportunities for
blacks, and to improve education as well, calling them ``the best reparation''
for slavery.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley argued Gore was concealing a more right-leaning record. ``Calling
attention to the fact that he was a conservative Democrat before he was Bill
Clinton's vice president is simply truth-telling,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a conservative Democrat, did not support national health insurance,
(had) an 84 percent right-to-life voting record and was the poster boy for the
NRA.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, for all the clatter about Gore's veracity, Bradley volunteered this
answer when an analyst for CNN, which broadcast the 90-minute debate, asked
whether Gore had ``the trustworthiness, the intellectual honesty'' to make a
good president: ``The people will make this decision. My view also is that if Al
were the nominee, I would support him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Neither rival was spared from jeers and boos by the raucous and largely
black audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those in the crowd were Whoopi Goldberg (Gore supporter), film
director Spike Lee (for Bradley) and O.J. Simpson defense attorney Johnnie
Cochran (alliance unclear).
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was heartwarming to see two candidates fight over us rather than take
us for granted,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who added that he will probably
make an endorsement next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates used the forum, centered on urban and minority issues, to
appeal to non-white voters -- who are expected to account for anywhere between
20 percent and 35 percent of New York's Democratic primary turnout.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls give Gore a prohibitive lead among minority voters, much of it
inherited from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, who will star in a TV ad for Bradley to be shown in New York, said he
was concerned that black voters are blindly supporting Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Right or wrong, black people think President Clinton can do no wrong. But
I don't think that means we should automatically transfer that allegiance from
Clinton to Al Gore,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching across the three feet separating their lecterns, Bradley held out a
sheaf of papers he said documented five votes by Gore between 1979 and 1981 to
preserve the tax-exempt status of colleges that racially discriminate.
</P>
<P>
	   In those votes, Gore split with members of the Congressional Black Caucus,
including New York Rep. Charlie Rangel, a leading Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore refused to take the papers and explained away the votes as ``a vote on
quotas.''
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, he challenged Bradley to explain a 1995 vote that Gore described as
a rejection of expanding minority ownership of broadcast outlets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What you see is an elaborate what I call `Gore dance,''' Bradley said.
``It is a dance to avoid facing up to your conservative record.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem is these attacks don't solve any problems,'' Gore said. ``They
do divide us as Democrats. They distract us from the real enemy, the right wing
extremists, Confederate flag-waving Republicans,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Experts Rebuke Racial Profiling Vows  </HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN WOODWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley spoke in their latest debate as
if the stroke of a presidential pen could stop police from pulling drivers over
because of their race.
</P>
<P>
	   The complexities of racial profiling were barely hinted at as the vice
president and former New Jersey senator competed for the support of minorities
with bold -- and sometimes overreaching -- claims about fighting discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley challenged the vice president for not persuading President Clinton
to issue an executive order against racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   And Gore vowed that if he becomes president, ``the first civil rights act of
the 21st century will be a national law outlawing racial profiling.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the problem is not one that can be remotely solved by a presidential
order, or indeed by a president at all, experts say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It sounds good,'' said David Bositis, senior political analyst at the
Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a black think tank. But,
``There's virtually nothing that a president of the United States can do.''
</P>
<P>
	   An executive order affecting only federal law enforcement agencies may be
conceivable but state and local police are overwhelmingly the ones that pull
motorists aside -- not FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Probably 99 percent of racial profiling takes place on the highways,''
Bositis said. ``The federal government does not police the highways.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, the Supreme Court has invalidated attempts to use statistical
information -- such as how many blacks are stopped by police or executed by
states -- to shape how criminal justice is applied.
</P>
<P>
	   That fact also complicates other proposals heard in the debate as both
candidates stressed the need to reduce racial disparities in the justice system.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the debate from Harlem on Monday night ``had the largest number of
engaged, contested claims,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a specialist in
political communications who has been monitoring the series of presidential
debates for their veracity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was almost as if each candidate had decided up front that no claim by
the other person was going to stand,'' she said. That could have made for ``a
very confusing debate for citizens.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the debate:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bradley denied proposing a special prosecutor to look into Democratic
fund-raising in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked Sunday on ABC whether he would support such a prosecutor to get
to the bottom of fund-raising controversies, he said: ``Yes, I think that it
would be very important to get to the bottom of it. I think a special prosecutor
is one way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jamieson said: ``It is a Clintonesque use of language to interpret that as
not calling for a special prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- Gore said Bradley went 14 months before making a speech on education
policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Gore might have been counting since the beginning of 1999 and up to
Bradley's recent speech rounding out his policy on public schools, Bradley made
at least two speeches heavy on education last year.
</P>
<P>
	   His anti-poverty speech in October, less than two months after he formally
began his campaign, spelled out plans to beef up early childhood education and
recruit new teachers for public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   As for racial profiling, the American Civil Liberties Union is campaigning
against it and fighting it in court. But the solutions it is proposing are not
as simplistic as a presidential order.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the ACLU is urging states to take legislative action and is
supporting a federal bill that would encourage the collection of information
quantifying racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why doesn't he walk down the hall now and have President Clinton issue an
executive order?'' Bradley asked rhetorically of his opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley gave a taste of the nuances when he said: ``I would issue an
executive order that would eliminate racial profiling at the federal level. I
would try to pass a law to get information gathered at local levels so that we
could see how the police departments are acting. I would make sure that the
Justice Department was involved.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore obliquely referred to a president's true weapon against racial
profiling -- the bully pulpit -- but in a way that would require decoding from
his audience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that we have to make certain that, in this country, not only will
driving while black never be allowed to be a crime,'' he said, ``but we just
have to say that we are going to become one people and prevent these incidents,
partly by putting as much energy into education as we do into incarceration.''

<HEADLINE> Court Asked To Keep Hubbell Plea  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whitewater prosecutors are asking the Supreme Court to
preserve presidential friend Webster Hubbell's guilty plea to a misdemeanor tax
charge, in a case that seeks to clarify the reach of some grants of immunity
from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors want the justices to rule they could use documents against
Hubbell that he was forced to produce under a limited grant of immunity.
Hubbell's lawyers say the grant of immunity means the documents he turned over
were ``hopelessly tainted'' and therefore could not be used as evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   After today's argument, a decision is expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   The Constitution's Fifth Amendment protects people from having to testify
against themselves, but it does not protect them from having to turn over
documents, new independent counsel Robert W. Ray said in court papers. Ray took
over the independent counsel's job from Kenneth Starr last October.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubbell's lawyers argue that ``the immunity statute was never designed to be
used as a means for obtaining evidence against the person who is immunized,''
according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   A lower court ruled largely against prosecutors and set a standard it
acknowledged would have made the case against Hubbell extremely difficult to
prove.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubbell was the former No. 3 official at the Justice Department early in
President Clinton's first term and has been a friend of the president and his
wife Hillary Rodham Clinton since their Arkansas days.
</P>
<P>
	   He pleaded guilty to the tax charge last June, but on condition that his
plea would be dismissed if the Supreme Court upheld the lower court ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Therefore, Hubbell's plea will remain in place only if the justices rule for
the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   The misdemeanor tax charge alleged that Hubbell evaded paying taxes on some
of the hundreds of thousands of dollars in income he received from friends of
the Clintons in 1994 when he was being investigated by Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax charge, filed in April 1998, was based partly on Hubbell's financial
papers that he was required to give to prosecutors under limited immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubbell argued that using the papers to prosecute him would violate his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. A federal judge agreed and
dismissed the tax charge.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia revived the
charge but said prosecutors could use the documents only by showing they
previously had ``reasonably particular knowledge'' of their existence.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors contend they should be allowed to use the documents' contents as
long as they did not seek to show they came from Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubbell's lawyers said the immunity law was designed to let prosecutors get
documents to use against someone else, not against the person granted immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   Not affected by today's case is Hubbell's guilty plea to a felony charge
involving legal work for a savings and loan at the center of the investigation
known as Whitewater, which involved the real estate dealings of then-Arkansas
Gov. Bill Clinton and his wife during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubbell was sentenced last June to a year of probation after entering pleas
that wrapped up the Whitewater phase of Starr's work.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubbell previously served 16 months in prison for bilking his former
Arkansas law firm and its clients. That charge resulted from an earlier
investigation by Starr.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is U.S. vs. Hubbell, 99-166.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Democrats Backing McCain  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY BARKS HOFFMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Autoworker Sheila McCaulley proudly considers herself a
Democrat through and through -- one with a vote ready to cast today in
Michigan's Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaulley -- ``I am a Democrat -- a Democrat all the way'' -- said she
planned to vote for John McCain. Not because she likes McCain, but because she
despises Republican Gov. John Engler, an ardent, visible backer of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush in the GOP presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it will send a message to Engler to vote for McCain, I will,''
McCaulley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her views of Engler are shared by many in predominantly black, mostly
Democratic Detroit, where the governor's decision to turn control of the public
schools over to a board appointed by the mayor drew widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He just took over our school board. We got no say at all,'' said
McCaulley, 46.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroiters also object to Engler's decisions to merge the Detroit Recorder's
Court into the Wayne County courts and to sign a bill doing away with
requirement that city workers live within city boundaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a lifetime Detroiter, I feel real disrespected at this point,'' said
Carol Banks, 39, as she handed out leaflets urging passers-by to vote for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the only way we're going to send a message is to let him know that
our votes do count.''
</P>
<P>
	   Polls have shown McCain and Bush in a close race in Michigan, with Bush
doing better among Republicans and McCain pulling in support from independents
and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic turnout for the Republican primary was expected to be higher than
usual. Still, pollsters such as Ed Sarpolus of Lansing-based EPIC/MRA say most
of those choosing McCain are genuine supporters, not those trying to make a
point with Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroiter Hyland Gear, a retired IBM manager who shares a military
background with McCain, truly likes the U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I vote for the person I think is the best for the job, and I think McCain
is the best for the job,'' said Gear, who has voted only twice before for a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Gear said he served a combined 14 years in the Army and Air Force and
admires McCain for what he went through as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It shows the kind of character this guy has,'' said Gear, 67.
</P>
<P>
	   But state Rep. Lamar Lemmons III, a Detroit Democrat helping to lead the
anti-Engler, pro-McCain movement in the city, made clear his position as he took
the campaign to several Detroit churches on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Should he get it, we're not going to be with John McCain in the fall,''
Lemmons said at the Second Canaan Missionary Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to be with Bill Bradley or Al Gore or whoever the Democratic
nominee is,'' Lemmons said to choruses of ``that's right'' from the
congregation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Bill McCullum, pastor at Bride of Christ church, said the strategy
was necessary ``to show the governor we are completely dissatisfied with his
lack of support for southeast Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Engler has used the Democrats' pro-McCain strategy as a wake-up call to
Republicans to get out and vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your help is urgently needed because some of Al Gore's leading supporters
here in Michigan ... plan to interfere with our February 22 primary,'' Engler
wrote recently to Bush supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter DeMarco, spokesman for McCain's Michigan campaign, skirted the
question of whether McCain welcomes the votes of Democrats who have no intention
of backing him in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're happy to have votes from all voters in Michigan, be they Republican,
Democratic, independent, Libertarian, vegetarian,'' DeMarco said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Mall would siphon 28 percent of downtown sales  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - New Haven's central business district would lose
28 percent of its sales to the proposed mall at Long Wharf, according to a study
being prepared for the state Department of Economic and Community Development.
<P>
	   The mall would also siphon off shoppers from businesses in North Haven,
Orange, Hamden, Milford and Southbury, according to the report obtained by The
Hartford Courant. Even the Brass Mill Center in Waterbury, some 20 miles away,
would lose 8 percent of its sales, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The report contradicts a draft report issued by the development agency last
year that said the mall would have no significant effect on the economy or the
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the first hard evidence that's been provided by the state itself as
to the economic impact on downtown New Haven. It confirms what we've suspected,"
said Steve Ecker, a lawyer whose clients include New Haven business owners who
oppose the mall.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now they have to justify using taxpayer money to destroy downtown New Haven
and put those taxpayers out of business," Ecker said.
</P>
<P>
	   New Haven Corporation Counsel Thayer Baldwin said a study that estimates
transfers of sales shouldn't apply to New Haven's atypical downtown.
</P>
<P>
	   "People don't go downtown to shop; they go downtown for Yale, for galleries,
museums, entertainment, to work and to live, and they shop while they're there,"
Baldwin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Even if the 28 percent were true, which I don't believe, that would be a
loss to downtown of about $30 million of sales a year," he said. But the mall
would mean $300 million in sales per year, 3,000 jobs and $6 million a year in
property taxes, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   James Watson, a spokesman for the economic development agency, said he has
not seen the report and couldn't comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The economic agency hired the Connecticut Economic Resource Center, a
nonprofit organization that is a partnership of state government and utilities,
to conduct the study.
</P>
<P>
	   The report is expected to be turned over to the economic development agency
in a few days.

Bush, McCain Continue To Bicker
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- The pulse of the Republican presidential race quickened
Tuesday, with voters going to the polls in GOP contests in Michigan and Arizona,
and Sen. John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush trading fresh charges of negative
campaigning. Aides to the Arizona senator accused religious broadcaster Pat
Robertson of making calls on Bush's behalf implying that former Sen. Warren
Rudman, McCain's national campaign chairman, was "a vicious bigot." Rudman
angered leaders of the religious right in 1995 by defending retired Gen. Colin
Powell against their attacks over abortion.

Iran Reform Leader: U.S. Talks Possible

the United States would not be a "sin," a view shared by many reformist
candidates set to take control of Iran's next Parliament. Talks with the United
States, a more liberal press and increased personal freedoms are expected to be
among the issues discussed in the next Parliament, which resumes in June.

Ga. House OKs Lethal Injection Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Georgia House has voted overwhelmingly to replace
electrocution with lethal injection, a step toward ending a practice used since
the state stopped hanging inmates in 1924. The 162-10 vote came Monday as
legislators wondered whether the U.S. Supreme Court is preparing to outlaw the
electric chair. Similar concerns in Florida prompted a recent switch to lethal
injection there; the state is to have its first execution by that method
Wednesday. If the Georgia bill becomes law, Alabama and Nebraska would be the
only states that use electrocution as the sole means of execution.

Clinton: Hospitals Must Report Medical Mistakes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants hospitals to tell patients and
the government how often they kill or seriously injure those in their care.
Hospitals nationwide would have to disclose serious and deadly mistakes if
Congress adopts a White House plan developed in response to a report last year
that estimated medical mix-ups kill as many as 98,000 Americans each year.
Clinton also planned Tuesday to order several new requirements that do not need
congressional approval, including an immediate mandatory reporting requirement
for the 500 Defense Department-administered hospitals that serve an estimated 8
million people.

Final Microsoft Arguments To Begin

courtroom arguments before his verdict. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson didn't see any need to delay the last round of arguments, set for
Tuesday, to accommodate ongoing secret negotiations in Chicago between
government lawyers and Microsoft officials. Though sources indicate little
progress, negotiations are aimed at averting an agonizingly slow appeals battle
that could wind through the federal courts for years.

Texas Inmates Take Officer Hostage

	   LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) -- Two death row inmates who were part of a botched
escape in 1998 took a female guard hostage Monday in a new prison that was
supposed to be more secure. The guard was taking one inmate back to his cell at
about 4:15 p.m. when he and another inmate overpowered her, said Texas
Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Fitzgerald. One inmate had
somehow jimmied his cell door, Fitzgerald said. "They have no place to go.
Officers have sealed off the area," he said. "She has not been threatened or
harmed in any way, but it is a tense situation."

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Purchasing System Flawed  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An electrical bell that cost $714 and a $350 ball bearing
show that changes in the Pentagon's purchasing system haven't erased all traces
of the wildly inflated prices that caused acute embarrassment to the military
more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been improvements: It's less likely under the new purchasing
rules that a warplane will be stuck on the ground for want of a crucial part, an
Associated Press review found. But a Defense Department buying system that
brings faster deliveries and fewer burdens on contractors isn't always cheaper
-- proved by the purchase of a $76 screw.
</P>
<P>
	   Military purchasing today is supposed to resemble that of corporate America.
Speed and volume discounts are emphasized, while detailed product specifications
and cost analyses are usually scrapped.
</P>
<P>
	   Some defense officials worry that too much emphasis is being placed on
speed, forcing purchasing officers to shy away from demanding cost figures from
contractors for fear it might slow down orders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there's a real morale problem,'' said Robert Lieberman, the
Pentagon's assistant inspector general for auditing. ``I think as a practical
matter, people are going to cut corners. They will be criticized severely for
slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
	   An Air Force expert on military purchases, Maj. Joe Besselman, studied the
new Pentagon buying system and found that officials made good bargains on volume
purchases but still got gouged on smaller orders.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, using wholesale commercial prices as a guide, he found a
15-cent O-ring gasket was purchased by DOD for $30, a 40-cent electronic part
known as a diode cost taxpayers $4.50 and a 60-cent transistor went for $7.60.
He also found that the same turbine blades bought for $19.80 cost $63.70 when
not part of a high-volume purchase. And a jet engine part cost $251 in volume,
but $768 when just 15 were bought.
</P>
<P>
	   Such examples have led a watchdog group in Washington to conclude the
Clinton administration's reinventing government program -- which has endorsed
the emphasis on speed over cost analysis -- placed too much price-setting powers
in the hands of Pentagon contractors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The defense industry succeeded beyond its wildest dreams,'' the Project on
Government Oversight concluded. ``Unfortunately, the defense industry took the
wisdom of the Reinventing Government campaign and pushed it much too far.''
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials dismiss the criticism, saying they have reshaped a
purchasing system that in the 1980s made headlines for buying $435 hammers and
$640 airplane toilet cover.
</P>
<P>
	   The critics have ``tied our learning to do business smarter with giving away
the farm,'' said Stan Z. Soloway, a top Defense acquisition official. ``That's
just nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
	   Soloway said 30-day delivery times for items have been halved. Large volume
discounts are negotiated. And chocolate chip cookies are bought in normal
packages, eliminating silly military specifications that in the past required
that a cookie's ``diameter at its greatest dimension shall be not less than 2
5/16 inches.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new concept is to buy commercial products whenever possible, bargaining
hard for the best price while eliminating detailed specifications and company
cost analyses that in the past drove up prices.
</P>
<P>
	   In the old system, the Pentagon would make contractors divulge and justify
their actual costs for products made to exact specifications. Now, defense
contracting officials are prevented under the law from learning a company's
costs for producing any product deemed to be commercially available.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of demanding cost analyses, defense officials simply try to
negotiate the best price, buying in bulk.
</P>
<P>
	   Besselman's review found success stories with commercial purchases of
electronic items, computer software and engines. He found the Defense Department
paid $99.9 million for 831,000 items for which private companies would have paid
$188.7 million at wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
	   But the inspector general, the agency internal watchdog, found several
examples of waste in purchases where defense officials were too willing to
accept a contractor's description of a product as commercially available and did
not demand cost figures. In those cases, the Defense Department was either the
sole or primary user of the item.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general's examples of inflated prices include:
</P>
<P>
	   --$714 for an electrical bell worth just $47.
</P>
<P>
	   --$251 for a compressor seal with a ``fair and reasonable'' price of just
$59.
</P>
<P>
	   --$350 for a ball bearing that should have cost $48.
</P>
<P>
	   --$76 for a single screw that had been priced earlier at 57 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   --$1,236 for fan assemblies worth $675.
</P>
<P>
	   Soloway, the deputy defense undersecretary for acquisition reform, said such
examples of inflated prices are part of ``a learning process, not a case of the
government getting ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said DOD purchasing officers have been ``steeped in a culture, they've
been taught to do things based on a certain set of rules, checklists and so
forth and to essentially avoid really taking innovative business approaches.''
</P>
<P>
	   Soloway encourages innovation and hard bargaining. The top concern of
Pentagon contract negotiators, he said, is that congressional and Defense
auditors will ``come down on them like a hammer'' for making a mistake, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dick Dalton, a spokesman for one of the Pentagon's bigger contractors,
Boeing Co., said DOD contracting officers now frequently browse through the
company's online catalog to see if any of the 4.6 million aircraft parts
available to commercial airlines might fit their needs, he said.

Ga. House OKs Lethal Injection Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Georgia House has voted overwhelmingly to replace
electrocution with lethal injection, a step toward ending a practice used since
the state stopped hanging inmates in 1924. The 162-10 vote came Monday as
legislators wondered whether the U.S. Supreme Court is preparing to outlaw the
electric chair. Similar concerns in Florida prompted a recent switch to lethal
injection there; the state is to have its first execution by that method
Wednesday. If the Georgia bill becomes law, Alabama and Nebraska would be the
only states that use electrocution as the sole means of execution.

Clinton: Hospitals Must Report Medical Mistakes

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants hospitals to tell patients and
the government how often they kill or seriously injure those in their care.
Hospitals nationwide would have to disclose serious and deadly mistakes if
Congress adopts a White House plan developed in response to a report last year
that estimated medical mix-ups kill as many as 98,000 Americans each year.
Clinton also planned Tuesday to order several new requirements that do not need
congressional approval, including an immediate mandatory reporting requirement
for the 500 Defense Department-administered hospitals that serve an estimated 8
million people.

Jackson didn't see any need to delay the last round of arguments, set for
Tuesday, to accommodate ongoing secret negotiations in Chicago between
government lawyers and Microsoft officials. Though sources indicate little
progress, negotiations are aimed at averting an agonizingly slow appeals battle
that could wind through the federal courts for years.

<HEADLINE> GOP Makes Little Headway in Suits  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Once again this year, House Republicans are pushing
through legislation to protect businesses from costly, pernicious lawsuits. And
once again, there is almost no chance their determination to enact change will
succeed.
</P>
<P>
	   Legal reform was a cornerstone of the ``Contract With America'' campaign
manifesto that guided Republicans after they seized control of the House five
years ago. Their inability to overcome opposition from the White House,
Democrats and their powerful trial lawyer and consumer group allies has been an
abiding frustration.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996 President Clinton vetoed a far-reaching bill limiting punitive
damage awards in cases involving faulty products. Two years later the Senate
came close, but eventually failed to pass a more modest bill covering small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   This year Republican leaders have shifted to a strategy similar to one they
are employing for tax cuts: Instead of putting forth one giant bill that has no
chance of escaping a veto, they are pursuing smaller bills they hope will be
more palatable to the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The party is taking ``an incremental and pragmatic way by focusing on a few
narrowly crafted reforms,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., whose bill to set a
$250,000 punitive damage cap on awards against companies with fewer than 25
employees passed the House last week.
</P>
<P>
	   As with taxes, ``we want to take one bite out of the apple at a time,'' said
Pete Jefferies, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House, however, has shown no more inclination to accept narrow
measures than a broad one. It says the president will veto Rogan's bill because
it could seriously undermine the rights of victims to be compensated for
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, a veto threat hangs over a bill the House passed last fall that
would curb what some say are abuses in class-action lawsuits. Also facing a veto
is a bill passed this month that would prevent workers injured by aging
equipment from suing the manufacturer if the piece of machinery was more than 18
years old.
</P>
<P>
	   The House Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, is in an uphill struggle to find
an acceptable formula for processing asbestos claims and putting a cap on
punitive damage in asbestos cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate over liability lawsuits dates back to the 1960s when state courts
expanded the rights of claimants, ruling that they can make a case against a
defendant who sold a product that caused damage without proving that the
defendant was negligent or involved in intentional wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Business groups say this has been a windfall for trial lawyers -- noting
that in 1998 there were eight jury verdicts topping $100 million -- and a
serious drag on economic growth. Supporters of the small business bill in the
House said 20 percent of small businesses refrain from expanding or hiring new
workers because they fear being sued.
</P>
<P>
	   Trial lawyers and consumer groups argue that stories of a system out of
control are overblown. Tom Bantle of Public Citizen's Congress Watch said there
are only about 15 product liability punitive damage awards a year. ``We don't
really think there is a huge problem out there.''
</P>
<P>
	   They also argue that it's ill-advised to change a system that has made the
nation a safer place to live and work. ``All of these tort reform measures are
corporate welfare, shifting the burden of responsibility and the cost of injury
caused by a company to the victim and the taxpayer,'' said Carlton Carl,
spokesman for the Association of Trial Lawyers of America.
</P>
<P>
	   Victor Schwartz, general counsel of the American Tort Reform Association,
says he feels the battle for change has shifted. The big threat now, he says, is
an effort by the federal government to regulate through litigation. He cites the
Justice Department's lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have had some success. In 1995, Congress overrode Clinton's veto
of legislation limiting claims against security firms when stocks change in
value.
</P>
<P>
	   And the president has stated his support for ``common sense'' litigation
reform. Last year, for example, he signed a bill giving suppliers of raw
materials for medical devices some protections from lawsuits. After lengthy
discussions with lawmakers, Clinton also signed a bill to limit what some people
feared would be a deluge of Y2K computer-related lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of change say it may take a new president to get any more. They
point to Republican hopeful Gov. George W. Bush's push for lawsuit limits in his
home state of Texas.

<HEADLINE> Some Stores To Get Irradiated Meat  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Beef that is irradiated to kill deadly bacteria will
begin appearing in some stores as early as March as processors start testing the
public's reaction to the treated meat.
</P>
<P>
	   New rules that allow the irradiation of raw beef, pork and lamb take effect
today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We view this as a consumer choice issue. The consumer will ultimately
determine the success,'' said Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for the nation's
biggest beef processor, IBP Inc., which plans to begin test-marketing irradiated
hamburger patties next month.
</P>
<P>
	   No. 2 Excel Corp. plans to start shipping treated beef to its food service
customers the first week of March.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, irradiated meat is likely to be most popular with hospitals and
nursing homes, because of the danger E. coli poses to patients with weakened
immune systems. But its use there could generate interest from consumers, said
Tim Willard, a spokesman for the National Food Processors Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Christine Bruhn, director of the Center for Consumer Research at the
University of California-Davis, said the public is ready to try the meat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most people are ready. They are sick and tired of hearing of cases of
food-borne outbreaks,'' said Bruhn.
</P>
<P>
	   The meat is expected to cost an extra three to five cents per pound but the
price is likely to drop as it becomes more widely available.
</P>
<P>
	   Irradiation has long been allowed for poultry, as well as fruits, vegetables
and spices. It is seldom used on poultry, partly because the primary pathogens
aren't as dangerous as E. coli, and chicken processors haven't thought it was
worth the expense, say industry experts. One big recall for E. coli, however,
can devastate a meatpacker financially.
</P>
<P>
	   The irradiation is done by three methods -- gamma rays, X-rays, or electron
beams. In addition to eliminating E. coli, the treatment can significantly
reduce levels of other pathogens, including listeria, salmonella and
campylobacter. The food isn't radioactive, and while there is a slight loss of
nutrients, the food is largely unchanged, according to the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   FDA also is considering allowing irradiation for hot dogs, luncheon meats
and other ready-to-eat products.
</P>
<P>
	   Special labels are required, carrying the international symbol of
irradiation, known as a ``radura,'' and a statement that they were treated. The
symbol, colored green on a white background, depicts two leaves resting in a
semicircle, with a green dot above it beneath a broken-lined semicircle.
</P>
<P>
	   E. coli O157 can cause serious illness and sometimes death, especially in
children and the elderly. An estimated 73,480 people are infected every year,
and about 600 cases are fatal, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an extra layer of food safety,'' said Mark Klein, a spokesman for
Excel, which blasts beef carcasses with steam to kill E. coli. ``We definitely
view it as an additional tool and not a replacement for other technologies or
food safety programs.''
</P>
<P>
	   A smaller, Florida-based processer, Colorado Boxed Beef Co., plans to sell
irradiated meat through grocery chains in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had to recall 359,000 pounds beef products in November 1998
because of possible contamination with the deadly E. coli bacteria, and Florida
officials have been promoting irradiation heavily.

<HEADLINE> NYC Police Shooting Case Nears End  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Was Amadou Diallo's death at the hands of New York City
police a mistake or murder?
</P>
<P>
	   Closing arguments were to begin today in the trial of four white officers
accused of killing the unarmed black immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   Defendants Sean Carroll, 37, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and
Richard Murphy, 27, have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder charges in the
February 1999 death of Diallo, 22.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was moved to Albany after the shooting sparked protests and
allegations of widespread police abuse of minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted of murder, the officers face a maximum sentence of 25 years to
life in prison. However, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi opened the door for
a compromise verdict last week by ruling jurors will be able to convict on less
serious charges such as second-degree manslaughter, which carries a minimum
penalty of probation.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege officers cornered Diallo in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building before unleashing a ``wall of lead.'' Forty-one shots were
fired, and Diallo was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers were in street clothes as they searched Diallo's neighborhood
for armed suspects. They contend they had good reason for stopping him, and for
firing in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony last week, the officers all told a similar story: Diallo
ignored repeated orders by Carroll and McMellon to stop for questioning after
they got out of their unmarked car, badges out.
</P>
<P>
	   They said he darted into the dimly lit vestibule and pointed a black object
they were certain was a gun, and that he also remained upright during a
continuous volley that lasted about 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Boss testified that when he first spotted Diallo, he thought, ``My God, I'm
gonna die.'' And Carroll wept on the stand while he recalled the shock of
realizing the black object ``was just a wallet.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Diallo's neighbors, testifying for the prosecution, said they didn't
hear officers' voices before sporadic gunfire erupted. And a coroner who
performed Diallo's autopsy told jurors that wounds showed he was either falling
or flat on his back when most of the rounds hit.

<HEADLINE> Texas Inmates Take Officer Hostage  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRACZYK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) -- Two death row inmates who were part of a botched
escape in 1998 took a female guard hostage Monday in a new prison that was
supposed to be more secure.
</P>
<P>
	   The guard was taking one inmate back to his cell at about 4:15 p.m. when he
and another inmate overpowered her, said Texas Department of Criminal Justice
spokesman Larry Fitzgerald. One inmate had somehow jimmied his cell door,
Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
	   The guard, Jeanette Bledsoe, was handcuffed with one leg shackled. She was
seated on the floor in a small cage-like room adjacent to death row in the
Terrell unit. The situation was unchanged early Tuesday, more than nine hours
after Bledsoe was taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have no place to go. Officers have sealed off the area,'' Fitzgerald
said. ``She has not been threatened or harmed in any way, but it is a tense
situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   In talks with negotiators, the inmates complained it takes six months to
make changes in visitation lists. They also want to be allowed out of their
cells for longer than one hour a day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Basically it's complaints about conditions in the prison,'' Fitzgerald
said.
</P>
<P>
	   One inmate had a makeshift knife; the other had a 2-foot long piece of metal
used to open the dinner door on each prison cell.
</P>
<P>
	   Ponchai Wilkerson, 28, was condemned for the robbery and shooting of a
Houston jewelry store clerk. Howard Guidry, 23, is on death row for shooting a
woman in a murder-for-hire plot.
</P>
<P>
	   Death row inmates are being relocated to the more modern and secure Terrell
unit from the Ellis unit near Huntsville because of an escape attempt by seven
inmates there in 1998. One inmate made it out but drowned in a creek about a
mile from the prison. The two inmates who took the hostage Monday participated
in the botched escape.

   DETROIT (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain on the same ticket?
</P>
<P>
	   It seemed a distant possibility for a moment Monday when Bush answered a
reporter's question about whether his rival for the GOP presidential nomination
would make a good running mate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush thought he was asked about another John -- his supporter, Michigan Gov.
John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've always said, 'Should the person be president, do we share the same
philosophy and does he like me?' And I think the man fills those three
categories, but nevertheless, I haven't put lists together,'' Bush said, giving
his usual answer to queries about potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
	   When pressed on whether he thought McCain fit the third category -- of
liking him -- press secretary Karen Hughes stepped in to correct Bush's
misinterpretation of the question.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Oh, you said John McCain, or John Engler?'' Bush asked, Engler standing at
his side.
</P>
<P>
	   When told the question was about McCain, he said, ``Oh, let me start over.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush then apologized to McCain, saying he did not want to demean the senator
by talking about him in terms of being a running mate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As long as he's a viable presidential candidate, he deserves the respect
and ought not to be talked about in terms of the vice presidency,'' Bush said.

<HEADLINE> Pet DNA Stored for Future Cloning  </HEADLINE>
    By MATT CRENSON AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Not long ago, Richard Denniston found himself suffering the same anguish
that millions of other pet owners have faced.
</P>
<P>
	   His little Scottish terrier had a brain tumor, and it would be only a matter
of time before the dog died. Like most in his shoes, Denniston just wanted to
end the pain.
</P>
<P>
	   However, he took it one step further.
</P>
<P>
	   An expert in mammalian reproductive physiology, Denniston collected a tiny
skin sample from the dog and took it to his laboratory at Louisiana State
University, where he cultured it and froze it in liquid nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
	   From that idea, Denniston started Lazaron BioTechnologies, which will save
pet DNA for $500, plus a monthly storage fee of $10, until cloning Fido becomes
a reality.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks mostly to the largess of an anonymous California multimillionaire,
that day may not be so far off.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will happen," says Mark Westhusin, a Texas A&AMP;M professor of veterinary
physiology leading a dog cloning team. "It could happen extremely soon if
everything worked out."
</P>
<P>
	   Most experts put successful dog cloning a year to five years down the road.
The cost is bound to be prohibitively expensive at first, but it would
eventually come down to a few thousand dollars, says Carol Bardwick, the
president of Canine Cryobank in San Marcos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been putting up cells since Dolly made her debut," Bardwick says.
</P>
<P>
	   Dolly, the sheep which started it all, was the first clone ever produced
from an adult mammal cell. When her existence was first announced in 1997, most
biologists believed that cloning was decades in the future if it was possible at
all.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, cattle, goats, mice and monkeys have been cloned in labs, and
pets are likely to be next.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really believe that the technology is going to become available for many
species in the near future," Denniston says.
</P>
<P>
	   At least four companies are hoping to cash in on that technology -- Lazaron,
Canine Cryobank, perPETuate of Newington, Conn., and Genetic Savings and Clone
of College Station, Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   When a pet owner contacts a gene bank, it will send a DNA collection kit. A
veterinarian performs a routine skin biopsy, immerses the sample in a special
transport medium and sends it to the gene bank.
</P>
<P>
	   At the bank, the skin cells are placed in a growth medium that causes them
to divide a few times. Then they're frozen in liquid nitrogen at minus 376
degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
	   Genetic Savings and Clone was founded by A&AMP;M's Westhusin and Lou Hawthorne,
a documentary film producer, when a wealthy friend of Hawthorne's heard about
Dolly and wanted to know if dogs could be cloned.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawthorne learned the process was a possibility, albeit a costly one.
</P>
<P>
	   The friend -- who insisted his identity remain a secret -- gave the
go-ahead, and Hawthorne hired a scientific advisory board. In March 1998, he
awarded Westhusin a $2.4 million grant for dog cloning research.
</P>
<P>
	   Dog cloning may be more appropriate, oddly enough, to lovable mutts than
high-quality purebreds, says Princeton University cloning authority Lee Silver.
</P>
<P>
	   Because mutts are unique and irreproducible creatures, cloning would be the
only way to get anything like the original dog, Silver says.
</P>
<P>
	   A purebred, on the other hand, is a consistent product, genetically designed
by years of careful breeding to come out the same every time.
</P>
<P>
	   Westhusin says there are still one or two major research issues to iron out.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, dogs are very stingy with their eggs, producing a batch only
once every six months to a year. That means that until they can induce dogs to
come into heat, the researchers only have a few eggs a week to work with.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the DNA keeps coming.
</P>
<P>
	   "Certainly some of our customers are crazy," Hawthorne says. "But far more
of them are simply crazy about their animals."

<HEADLINE> Philbin Apparently Feeling Deprived  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe it's Regis Philbin who wants to be a millionaire now,
if he isn't already.
</P>
<P>
	   The host of television's most popular show, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"
isn't happy that ABC hasn't rewarded him for the work.
</P>
<P>
	   He didn't exactly pick a quiet place to let this be known: he mentioned it
during a guest slot on David Letterman's first "Late Show" since heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   "How's your little quiz show doing?" Letterman asked Philbin. "Are you
making a lot of dough?"
</P>
<P>
	   "No, I'm not," Philbin replied.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those pantywaists at ABC are not paying you what you're worth?" Letterman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think so," Philbin said, then quickly tried to change the subject
back to Letterman's bypass operation.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reply to a phone message and a page left for ABC
representatives on Monday. The show aired Monday, but was filmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Philbin signed on as "Millionaire" host last year, when it was supposed to
be a limited summer replacement series. He even privately campaigned for the job
after being intrigued by the British version of the game show.
</P>
<P>
	   It quickly became a television phenomenon that now runs three times a week
in prime time, sometimes more. Philbin's question to contestants, "is that your
final answer," is a national catchphrase.
</P>
<P>
	   "Millionaire" is single-handedly responsible for ABC's leap past CBS and NBC
into first place in the prime-time ratings this season.
</P>
<P>
	   During an interview in October before "Millionaire" became a regular series,
Philbin said he had signed a five-year contract to be host. At the time, he said
he had not sought to renegotiate with ABC.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Ricans Protest Navy Accord  </HEADLINE>
   By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- In one of the biggest demonstrations here in
years, 85,000 Puerto Ricans heeded the calls of religious leaders and marched in
silence to protest the planned resumption of U.S. Navy bombing on the island of
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We Want Peace!'' banners they carried demanded.
</P>
<P>
	   They also waved portraits of Jesus and the U.S. territory's single-star red,
white and blue flag as they filled a mile-long stretch of San Juan's Las
Americas Expressway. Hundreds of police cordoned off the highway and watched
without interfering.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``Peace for Vieques'' march was called by religious leaders to repudiate
an agreement between Gov. Pedro Rossello and President Clinton to resume limited
training with dummy bombs on Vieques, the Navy's prize Atlantic fleet bombing
range. Police Chief Pedro Toledo estimated the crowd at 85,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are showing the consensus in Puerto Rico's heart in favor of peace and
justice,'' said San Juan Archbishop Roberto Gonzalez Nieves.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers said the protest was nonpolitical, though many members of this
U.S. territory's tiny Independence Party participated.
</P>
<P>
	   Church leaders' increasing involvement in anti-Navy protests has angered
many pro-statehood politicians. They fear the protests could harm efforts to
make Puerto Rico -- recipient of $11 billion in federal funds annually -- the
51st U.S. state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is anti-American, anti-Navy and does not contribute to the serious work
that Gov. Rossello has done to obtain the Navy's exit,'' said House speaker
Edison Misla Aldarondo.
</P>
<P>
	   Many bristled at the criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even though we're veterans and have done our service, I want to tell the
president of the United States that we want peace for Vieques,'' said Modesto
Santiago Alvarado, 72, a U.S. Army veteran of Korea and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and Rossello agreed last month to allow the Navy to resume limited
training using inert bombs. The pact calls for a referendum, likely to be held
in 2001, that will give Vieques residents two choices:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Resume exercises, including the use of live bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Exercises with dummy bombs and a withdrawal by the Navy by May 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossello's opponents criticized him for abandoning a pledge to stop all
bombings on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, Sen. Frank Murkowski announced he would present a bill in March
that could jeopardize the Vieques compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   Murkowski said the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, of which
he is chairman, would hold hearings on a measure allowing the Navy to keep half
its property on Vieques. The other half, used for storing weapons, would be sold
to the island's 9,400 residents.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision on whether to continue military exercises would be delayed,
Murkowski said, adding he expected Vieques residents to reject Clinton's offer
of $50 million in return for continued bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that is an unfortunate and disagreeable proposal,'' Murkowski,
R-Alaska, told reporters in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that even if exercises stop, the Navy needs to retain control of the
range because the bombs, mines and shells scattered across it over nearly 60
years have made it uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Navy has polluted it, and I don't know if it can ever be cleaned up,''
he said. ``If those lands are turned over ... the Navy would be exposed to
endless liability.''

<HEADLINE> Search finds missing snowmobiler's body  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MINETTO, N.Y. (AP) - An autopsy is scheduled today for a junior high
school teacher who died in 20 feet of icy river.
<P>
	   Kip L. Kelsey, 28, died sometime after he drove along the Oswego River late
Saturday or early Sunday as he was returning home after a day of snowmobiling
with friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelsey had illegally crossed the Minetto bridge on his snowmobile and then
took a risky route along the partially frozen Oswego River toward Fulton, police
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelsey attempted to skim over a 100-yard expanse of open water, State
Trooper Joseph Saarie told the Syracuse Herald-Journal. But his skis apparently
caught the edge of the ice, sending him and the sled under water.
</P>
<P>
	   State police divers found the body Monday evening in 20 feet of water about
300 feet from shore. They found his snowmobile in the same spot the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The other snowmobilers said Kelsey had consumed alcohol on Saturday,
according to state police Sgt. Dale R. Crisp.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday morning, friends found Kelsey's helmet on a patch of ice atop the
river. Divers located the snowmobile in the river Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Rough terrain along the icy river made the search difficult. State police
used a front-end loader to dump sand over a steep bluff so rescuers had better
footing as they carried down heavy rafts and other equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Divers had to fight swift currents, Crisp said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelsey, who had an infant daughter with his girlfriend, was a popular
technology teacher at Fulton Junior High School, where he taught for the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Three weeks earlier, Kelsey had shattered his left ankle in a snowmobile
accident and he was still wearing a cast during his last ride.

<HEADLINE> Federal prosecutors try to strip dentist of license  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Federal prosecutors plan to push for the revocation
of a dentist's license today in U.S. District Court.
<P>
	   Last fall, prosecutors accused Dr. Tejbir Oberoi, of Amherst, of giving his
patients painful unnecessary dental procedures and cheating the health care
system out of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Oberoi allegedly submitted claims to MetLife, Blue Cross and Blue
Shield, Aetna and other insurers for expensive procedures that he did not
perform.
</P>
<P>
	   Oberoi, who operates Khalsa Dental and Implant Center in Buffalo, pleaded
innocent in October before U.S. Magistrate Judge Carol Heckman. He said the
billing problems were simple mistakes.
</P>
<P>
	   But authorities claim the alleged fraud was widespread. Four months later,
Oberoi is still practicing dentistry in his downtown Buffalo clinic and
authorities claim he is still committing crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the 157 fraud counts against Oberoi is the allegation that he billed a
Cheektowaga widow for 550 dental visits over a 12-year period, including
numerous gum surgeries, root canals, tooth implants and crowns that were
unnecessary and, in many cases, performed incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
	   Another claim against him is that when a woman drove her sister to the
clinic for dental treatment, Oberoi followed the driver out to her car and
convinced her that she, too, must come in for a root canal.

<HEADLINE> Fox Scraps 'Multimillionaire' Show  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN FOX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ENCINITAS, Calif. (AP) -- The honeymoon is over for "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire."
</P>
<P>
	   Fox had already canceled tonight's scheduled rebroadcast of last week's hit
show after learning abuse allegations against the bridegroom. A restraining
order was issued in 1991 against Rick Rockwell because an ex-girlfriend accused
him of hitting and threatening to kill her.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox has now scrapped the program.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the end for this show. We are not doing another one," Mike Darnell,
a Fox executive who devised the marry-a-millionaire concept, said in today's New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell, who returned to his house alone after his Caribbean honeymoon,
angrily denied the abuse allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   "At no time have I ever struck any of my girlfriends, ever, for any reason,"
Rockwell, 42, told KGTV on Sunday night outside his home in Encinitas, a coastal
city 25 miles north of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know, relationships have ups and downs, but getting physical for me is
not an option," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell emerged again Monday evening with a considerably brighter demeanor,
laughing with reporters as he passed out 10 large cheese and pepperoni pizzas.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would love to talk about all this stuff but I'm so busy. I have to feed
all of you," a jovial Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to say where his wife, Darva Conger, 34, was or what their
situation was.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's doing great. We talked a couple of minutes ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the future of their marriage, he replied: "I don't know what's
going to happen about that, but I think she's a great person."
</P>
<P>
	   Conger could not be reached Monday. A phone message left at her home was not
returned and a receptionist at the Thousand Oaks hospital where she worked as an
emergency room nurse said she was no longer employed there.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 22 million people tuned in to "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?" on Feb. 15. Fifty women competed as if they were in a
combination of "The Dating Game" and a beauty pageant, parading in bathing suits
and wedding gowns and answering questions about their tastes.
</P>
<P>
	   After the group was pared down to five finalists, Rockwell selected Conger,
a Gulf War veteran, to be his wife. A Las Vegas judge married them on the spot.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ensuing week, critics have blasted the show as tasteless and
demeaning.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, people who know Rockwell, a real estate investor and former standup
comedian, have questioned just how rich he is and whether the whole thing was a
publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox executives denied that the pair were acquainted before the program.
Rockwell also denied to KGTV that he knew Conger and that the marriage was a
stunt.
</P>
<P>
	   "False rumors," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   When Rockwell spoke with a reporter from KGTV, he read from a statement to
address abuse allegations leveled in a 1991 restraining order application filed
in Los Angeles County by Debbie Goyne.
</P>
<P>
	   She described herself as his former fiancee and said she lived with Rockwell
for 18 months. Goyne accused Rockwell of shoving and slapping her, twice
entering her home without permission and vandalizing her car after she broke off
their engagement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Recently, he said he would find me and kill me," her court papers alleged.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge issued a restraining order prohibiting Rockwell from coming within
100 yards of Goyne for six months. It was unclear whether Rockwell was in court
to defend himself when the order was issued.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell said that the relationship with Goyne "ended poorly" but that he
would never hit a woman. He acknowledged that he didn't tell Fox about the
restraining order.
</P>
<P>
	   "I considered it a closed chapter in my life," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Darnell said the production company did a security check of Rockwell and "he
came up clean."
</P>
<P>
	   "He was actually specifically asked if there was anything else we should
know about his past," Darnell told the Times. "He signed an affidavit that
everything he told us was true."

<HEADLINE> 'American Beauty' Interests Marietta  </HEADLINE>
    By CHAD ROEDEMEIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- "American Beauty" never reveals the exact location of
its achingly generic setting. The homogeneous homes, strip malls and SUVs could
be anywhere.
</P>
<P>
	   But many residents of this conservative suburb just across the Chattahoochee
River from Atlanta suspect there's more than a little of Marietta up there on
the screen.
</P>
<P>
	   Folks here aren't just paranoid. After all, screenwriter Alan Ball, who
received one of the film's eight Academy Award nominations, grew up in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's so real it makes some people uncomfortable," said Corky Pratt,
technical director at Theatre in the Square in Marietta. "I think it's a great
depiction of suburban life."
</P>
<P>
	   Marietta is perhaps best known as the headquarters of former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich. Exactly how much of Marietta seeped into "American Beauty" is
unclear. Ball said some of his inspiration came from observing his family and
neighbors while growing up here, but he insists Marietta wasn't the model for
the satire.
</P>
<P>
	   "American Beauty" tells the story of Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man
sedated by life in the suburbs. Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey, hates his job
and can't understand his petty, grasping wife.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never intended the movie to be an indictment of suburbia," Ball told The
Associated Press last week. "There are plenty of well-adjusted, healthy,
spiritual people living in the suburbs."
</P>
<P>
	   But the suburbs weren't the happiest place for Ball. His parents moved to
Marietta in the late 1950s just before he was born. His mother suffered from
depression and his father had troubles of his own, Ball said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times, Ball described his
Marietta neighbors as "shut down and living in total denial," a theme that turns
up in his movie. "To me, it was a town I had to get out of."
</P>
<P>
	   Ball left to pursue his writing career, but he also wanted to leave because
he felt his homosexuality wasn't always accepted in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
	   "Marietta is not exactly the most friendly place for gay people," Ball told
the AP. "I would rather be in a place where no one cares, as opposed to a place
where people are going to define me by that one aspect of my personality."
</P>
<P>
	   Marietta is the seat of Cobb County, whose commissioners passed a resolution
in 1993 condemning the "gay lifestyle." That prompted Olympic officials to move
all its events out of the county in 1996, even the ceremonial torch run.
</P>
<P>
	   Just this week, a downtown Marietta restaurant displayed a sign saying,
"John Rocker for President," a reference to the Atlanta Braves pitcher who said
he didn't want to ride on a subway in New York next to, among others, "some
queer with AIDS."
</P>
<P>
	   But even if some of "American Beauty" has its roots in Marietta, residents
here may still have reason to cheer. The film is the favorite to win several
Oscars, including best original screenplay for Ball.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're just so proud of him and his work and his accomplishments," said
Marietta Mayor Ansley Meaders, who has not seen the movie. "That's just a
wonderful honor for him and for our community."

<HEADLINE> Britain Overhauls Transplant System  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The government said Tuesday it is reorganizing the national
body that arranges organ transplants after an investigation found a liver and
kidneys were accepted from a man whose relatives insisted they go only to a
white person.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, by a panel led by a senior Department of Health official,
criticized senior managers of the U.K. Transplant Support Service Authority, or
UKTSSA, and department officials for allowing the family to make such a
condition.
</P>
<P>
	   "Racism of any kind is appalling," said Health Minister Philip Hunt. "The
government is totally against any kind of condition being attached to organ
donation."
</P>
<P>
	   The then Health Secretary Frank Dobson ordered a report after the case was
reported in a newspaper last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Health official Chris Kelly reported that after the man was declared brain
dead at a hospital in Sheffield, northern England, in July 1998, a local UKTSSA
coordinator wrongly agreed to accept the organs on the basis that they go only
to white recipients.
</P>
<P>
	   They were later transplanted into three white patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelly said that the organs likely would have gone to the same recipients
even if the donor's family had not made the condition.
</P>
<P>
	   But in searching for suitable matches, the coordinator breached protocol by
not informing a unit where two children with "Asian-sounding names" were waiting
for transplants, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The unit said later it would not have accepted the organs because of
clinical considerations.
</P>
<P>
	   Lord Hunt said UKTSSA would be renamed UK Transplant and be given added
responsibilities to improve organ donation rates and improve awareness of donor
cards.
</P>
<P>
	   It will also receive government funding to support local coordinators and
train them to operate efficiently and correctly, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of 1999, 5,396 people were waiting for transplants. But a
shortage of donors meant that only 2,410 transplants were carried out.

<HEADLINE> Jury hears closing arguments in Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The officers involved in the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo had an obligation to stop the West African immigrant as he stood
in the vestibule of his Bronx building because he was acting suspiciously, a
defense attorney said during closing arguments today.
<P>
	   Attorney James Culleton said he expected prosecutors to argue that Diallo
had a right to stand in front of his home and was not doing anything wrong.
However, he asked jurors to remember a neighbor's testimony that Diallo had been
peering out and looking up and down the street.
</P>
<P>
	   "On Feb. 4, 1999, these four police officers, they didn't know who Mr.
Diallo was. They didn't know he lived in that building," said Culleton, who
represents Officer Richard Murphy. "And they had an obligation, following proper
police procedure, to stop, to walk up to Mr. Diallo and ask, 'Who are you?' and
'Why are you in this area?"'
</P>
<P>
	   "Mr. Diallo was alone. It was a cold night and it was 12:40 a.m. in the
morning," the attorney said. "Would you, or would you expect any police officer
in the Bronx, Albany or anywhere else in the United States, do anything less?"
</P>
<P>
	   Culleton urged the jurors to listen carefully to the judge's charges on
"proper police conduct."
</P>
<P>
	   "The police officers did nothing wrong in stopping their vehicle this
night," he said. "This case is really about what happened after they got out of
the vehicle. It's about an incident that escalated and resulted in a tragedy in
a few seconds."
</P>
<P>
	   He reminded jurors that prosecutors admitted police had the right to stop
people who are acting suspiciously and ask them what they were doing, which is
what he said the four officers did the night of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why Mr. Diallo acted the way he did to this simple request to talk, we'll
never know," Culleton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy, 27, and co-defendants Sean Carroll, 37, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth
Boss, 28 - all white - have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder in the
killing of Diallo, 22, a black West African immigrant. Their trial was moved to
Albany after protests and allegations of widespread police abuse of minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted of murder, the officers face a maximum sentence of 25 years to
life in prison. However, State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi opened the
door for a compromise verdict last week by ruling that jurors would be able to
convict on less serious charges such as second-degree manslaughter, which has a
minimum penalty of probation.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the defendants cornered the victim in the elevator-size
vestibule of his apartment building at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999, then, without
warning, unleashed 41 bullets - a "wall of lead." The victim was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers were in street clothes as they searched Diallo's neighborhood
for armed suspects. They contend they had good reason for stopping him and for
firing in self-defense with their rapid-fire semiautomatics.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony last week, the officers told a similar story: Diallo ignored
repeated orders by Carroll and McMellon to stop for questioning after they got
out of their unmarked car, badges out. He darted into his dimly lighted
vestibule and pointed a black object they were certain was a gun. He also
remained upright as they fired a continuous volley lasting less than 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Boss testified last week that when he first spotted Diallo, he thought, "My
God, I'm gonna die." Carroll wept on the stand while he recalled the shock of
realizing the black object "was just a wallet. ... I said, 'Where's the
(expletive) gun?"'
</P>
<P>
	   But several prosecution "ear witnesses," mainly neighbors of Diallo,
testified they never heard the officers' voices before sporadic gunfire erupted.
A coroner who autopsied the victim told jurors his wounds showed that he was
either falling or flat on his back when most of the bullets hit.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon were the first to shoot, squeezing off all 16 rounds
from their guns. Boss fired five times and Murphy four while backing up their
partners, leading to speculation they have the best chance at acquittal.

<HEADLINE> Court To Study Traffic Stops  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide whether police
routinely can set up traffic checkpoints and stop motorists in hopes of catching
people who sell or use illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices will review a federal appeals court ruling that said
checkpoints where Indianapolis police detained most motorists for about three
minutes likely amounted to unreasonable and unlawful seizures.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is the scope of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment and its
protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.
</P>
<P>
	   Police generally need a court warrant or a reason to suspect someone of a
crime before detaining them for several minutes. But in past rulings, the
nation's highest court allowed police to set up sobriety checkpoints aimed at
randomly detecting inebriated motorists and border roadblocks to intercept
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the checkpoints formerly used by
Indianapolis are different. ``The city concedes that its proximate goal is to
catch drug offenders in the hope of incapacitating them, and deterring others,
by criminal prosecution,'' the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
	   If Indianapolis police had reason to believe a terrorist was driving toward
the city in a car packed with dynamite, they could block all roads and stop
thousands of drivers ``without suspecting any one of them with criminal
activity,'' the appeals court said. ``But no such urgency has been shown here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The city began its ``narcotics checkpoints'' operation in the summer of
1998. A predetermined number of cars are pulled over at one time and drivers are
asked to show police their licenses and car registration while drug-sniffing dog
walks around the parked cars.
</P>
<P>
	   In the program's first four months, police conducted six roadblocks in
high-crime areas and stopped 1,161 vehicles. The stops led to 104 arrests, 55 of
them on drug-related charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Indianapolis residents, James Edmond and Joell Palmer, challenged the
program in a lawsuit that called the police tactics unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal trial judge ruled that the city was not violating any rights, but
a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit court reversed that ruling by a 2-1 vote
last July.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court said the trial judge may find another reason to uphold the
checkpoint program, which has been suspended. ``The high hit rate of
Indianapolis' roadblock scheme suggests ... areas of the city in which drug use
approaches epidemic proportions. If so, the roadblocks may be justified,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on today, city officials said federal and state courts
are deeply divided over the legitimacy of such initiatives. They urged the
justices ``to restore predictability and rationality to the rules that guide''
encounters between police and citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   But lawyers for the program's challengers said most courts have barred
police from setting up checkpoints ``whose sole purpose is to investigate
criminal activity.'' Courts are deeply split only over those checkpoint programs
that combine routine traffic-law regulation and drug interdiction, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Indianapolis vs. Edmond, 99-1030.

<HEADLINE> Court Studies School Sports Issue  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today said it will decide whether some
high school athletic associations can be sued for allegedly violating their
members' rights.
</P>
<P>
	   The court agreed to hear arguments by a private high school in Tennessee
whose lawyers say it can sue the state athletic association because the
association acted on behalf of the state government.
</P>
<P>
	   The Brentwood Academy, a private religious school in Brentwood, Tenn., was
described in court papers as ``something of a high school football powerhouse.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, rival football coaches alleged that Brentwood violated rules of the
Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association. The school was accused of
providing football tickets to two middle school athletes and of inviting some
boys to join the football team for spring practice while they were still in the
eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
	   The athletic association bars members from using ``undue influence ... to
secure or retain a student for athletic purposes.'' The association decided that
the incidents violated its rules and put Brentwood on probation for four years,
banned it from tournaments for two years and fined it $3,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The school sued the association under a federal civil rights law, and a
federal judge issued an order barring enforcement of the recruiting rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, saying the athletic
association could not be sued under the civil rights law because its decision
was not government action. The civil rights law provides remedies only for
government violations of people's rights.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on today, Brentwood's lawyers said the athletic
association was controlled by public school principals.
</P>
<P>
	   The athletic association's lawyers said it was a private organization whose
rules are intended to keep schools from ``treating school-aged children as
athletes first and students second.''
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Brentwood Academy vs. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic
Association, 99-901.

<HEADLINE> Pork Tongue Blamed for Listeria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PARIS (AP) -- Officials said Tuesday that pork tongue in gelatin was the
likely culprit in a listeria epidemic that has killed seven people in France.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominique Gillot, the deputy minister for health and social action, advised
everyone against eating the product "while waiting for formal confirmation."
</P>
<P>
	   Since the end of November, the bacteria, which most often flourishes in
cheese and meat products, has contaminated 23 people, killing seven of them and
leading to one abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany has called the poisonings an "epidemic."
</P>
<P>
	   A 74-year-old man hospitalized in Grenoble since Thursday with listeria is
an unrelated case, local officials there said Tuesday -- not part of the
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement from the Labor Ministry said that epidemiological tests have
pointed to pork tongue in gelatin as "very likely the main mode of transmission"
of the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria.
</P>
<P>
	   It said, however, that no brand name had been identified and that tests were
continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   The pork tongue "was eaten by the majority of people" who contracted the
illness and were questioned, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   A bacteriological investigation of the food chain is in progress, the
ministry statement said, and should allow for confirmation of the initial
findings in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
	   Healthy people rarely contract listeriosis, which can cause high fever,
severe headaches, neck stiffness and nausea. It can be potentially fatal to
people with weak immune systems -- infants, the elderly, chemotherapy patients
and people with HIV infections or other chronic diseases. Listeriosis, which can
take up to eight weeks to incubate, can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths.

<HEADLINE> Court Sidesteps Elian Gonzalez Case  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, rejecting an unusual request, today
stayed out of the controversy over whether 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez should be
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, without comment, turned down the appeal of an Arizona man, no
relative of the young shipwreck survivor, that asked the justices to ``cut
short'' legal and political maneuvering and order the boy immediately returned
to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert A. Hirschfeld, a disbarred lawyer from Phoenix, filed his request
directly to the Supreme Court, bypassing lower courts. He said he is founder of
the National Congress for Fathers and Children and an advocate of ``preservation
of the father-child bond.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the subject of heated debate since he was found clinging to
an inner tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast. His mother and 10 others traveling
with him drowned during their effort to leave Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the boy sent back to
his father in Cuba, but Elian's relatives in Miami are suing the U.S. government
to keep him in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, support in Congress for legislation to make Elian an American
citizen has fizzled.
</P>
<P>
	   Hirschfeld's petition to the Supreme Court said, ``Time is of the essence in
accomplishing the lawful return of the boy to his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Delays in sending the boy back to Cuba ``could achieve such an extended
isolation of Elian from his father, that it eventually would be claimed that the
father-son relationship had ceased to exist,'' Hirschfeld said.
</P>
<P>
	   He asked the justices to use their authority to keep someone from being held
unlawfully, saying such power can be used ``when a noncitizen child is
involuntarily brought into the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Hirschfeld vs. Rodriguez, 99-1222.

<HEADLINE> Challenge to Electric Chair Rejected  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal that called
death in Alabama's electric chair a type of ``cruel and unusual punishment'' the
Constitution forbids.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, turned away Alabama death row inmate Robert Lee
Tarver's contention that his state's ``antiquated'' electric chair exposes him
to a risk of ``excessive burning, disfigurement and ... pain and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
	   Today's brief order means state officials are free to set a new execution
date for him. It is unclear whether the court will use some other case to review
the legitimacy of electrocutions -- and whether such review will be granted
before Tarver dies in the chair.
</P>
<P>
	   Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen
G. Breyer voted to hear arguments in Tarver's case, but five votes are needed to
grant such review.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas voted against Tarver.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama officials had urged the nation's highest court to reject his appeal,
saying death in the electric chair is almost painless and instantaneous.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarver was to have been electrocuted earlier this month but the justices
ordered his execution delayed just hours before it was to take place.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama is just one of three states that use the electric chair as their
sole means of execution. The other two are Georgia and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   The Georgia House voted overwhelmingly Monday to phase out electrocution and
execute inmates by injection. Legislators said they feared the Supreme Court
would ban the electric chair. That legislation now goes to the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The court last month canceled its review of Florida's use of the electric
chair after the state Legislature passed new legislation providing for death by
injection as the primary means of execution. Gov. Jeb Bush signed it into law.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court never has found any specific form of execution to be
unconstitutional but Tarver's appeal argued that ``a national consensus has
emerged rejecting'' electrocution. Florida joined Kentucky and Tennessee in
moving away from electrocutions in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-eight states have death penalty laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mutilation, burns and botched executions characterize Alabama's use of the
electric chair,'' Tarver's appeal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 98 death row inmates executed across the nation in 1999, 94 were
killed by injection. Three were executed and one was killed by cyanide gas.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarver, 52, was convicted of the 1984 robbery and murder of Hugh Kite
outside the bait shop and grocery Kite owned in Cottonton, near the Georgia
line. Prosecutors said Tarver shot Kite several times and stole his wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The cases are Tarver vs. Alabama, 99-8043 and 99-8044.

<HEADLINE> Michael Ross penalty hearing to begin today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - Twelve jurors and five alternates prepared
today to decide whether admitted serial killer Michael Ross should spend his
life in prison or be executed for the murders of four teen-age girls.
<P>
	   The retrial of Ross' penalty phase - his guilt is no an issue - got off to a
slow start, with New London Superior Judge Thomas Miano outlining the rules of
his courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the victims' families and a handful of victims rights advocates
attended the first day of the trial, as did a number of reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross, 40, already is serving two life sentences for killing two women in
Windham County. He's also admitted to killing two women in New York, but he has
not been prosecuted for these deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   When Ross was convicted in 1987 of four killings in New London County and
sentenced to death, he became the first inmate on the state's death row since
the U.S. Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Ross' case has taken wild twists through the legal system that
have infuriated the victims' families and set new precedents for how death
penalty cases are treated.
</P>
<P>
	   The case has been before the state Supreme Court three times. Ross is before
his fourth Superior Court judge and second prosecution team.
</P>
<P>
	   He's also been through two sets of defense lawyers, and for a while, the
Cornell University graduate with an IQ of 122 represented himself.
</P>
<P>
	   He asked to be executed in 1994 before his first Supreme Court appeal - an
appeal that is automatic in death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The high court upheld the conviction but overturned the death sentence
because prosecutors withheld from the jury a letter written by a psychiatric
expert. In it, the expert cast doubt on his earlier claim that Ross did not
suffer from a disorder that would make him incapable of handling violent sexual
impulses.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, Ross tried to sign his life away in a deal with prosecutors, saying
he wanted to spare his victims' families another grueling trial. Miano rejected
the pact as illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   In November 1998, Ross tried to kill himself with an overdose of
prescription medicine. Ross also has asked to be castrated and went on a hunger
strike in protest of the appeals process that has delayed his execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross had spent his years in prison writing everything from letters to
reporters and op-ed pieces to an article that was published in The Journal of
Psychiatry &AMP; Law.

	   His pen has been silent for more than a year since Miano issued a gag order.
The order also bars prosecutors, defense attorneys and possible witnesses,
including relatives of Ross' victims, from speaking about the case outside of
court.
</P>
<P>
	   Some relatives of Ross' victims are expected to testify at the hearing about

were especially cruel and that Ross was indifferent to his victims' suffering.
Prosecutors also argue Ross was in control of his actions and killed his victims
so they could not send him back to jail, as did a 1982 assault victim in Ohio

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks dropped in early trading today, continuing last
week's big decline. Computer and telecommunications shares were mostly higher on
earnings and acquisition news.

<HEADLINE> Ex-New York Mob Boss Loses Appeal  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former mob boss Vittorio ``Vic'' Amuso, who once ran the
third largest of New York City's five crime families, lost a Supreme Court
appeal today.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which Amuso said federal
courts failed to fully consider his claim that he was denied effective legal
help when convicted in 1992 for 14 murders and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Amuso, former leader of the Lucchese crime family, was sentenced to life
imprisonment without parole and fined $250,000 for convictions on 54 counts of
racketeering, extortion, fraud, bribery and murder.
</P>
<P>
	   One court spoke of Amuso's ``murderous campaign'' to eliminate anyone
connected with his criminal organization suspected of disloyalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court rejected Amuso's direct appeal in 1994. He began a second
round of appeals in 1997, contending before a federal judge that his trial
lawyer, Gerald Shargel, provided ineffective assistance because of alleged
conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Shargel's potential conflicts -- he was under government investigation and
had represented some people who were possible trial witnesses -- had been
discussed before Amuso's trial, and Amuso had told the trial judge, ``I still
want him as my attorney.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers later hired by Amuso said some of the alleged conflicts had been
``unwaiveable as a matter of law.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on today, Amuso's lawyers said the consideration of his
ineffective-assistance claim was unfairly truncated by restrictions on court
review imposed by a 1996 law, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act,
which was aimed at streamlining the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Amuso vs. U.S., 99-1075.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Appeal by Pharmacies  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive the main part
of a lawsuit that accuses prescription drug manufacturers and wholesalers of
conspiring to deny price discounts to pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which the pharmacies
argued that the drug companies' actions, taken as a whole, spell out a
conspiracy aimed at charging pharmacies more than other customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The class-action lawsuit, filed on behalf of thousands of retail pharmacies,
accuses drug manufacturers and wholesalers of keeping pharmacies from buying
brand-name drugs at the discounted prices offered to hospitals, nursing homes
and health-maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   The pharmacies said they pay an average 10 percent to 25 percent more than
other brand-name drug customers. They also said the drug makers and sellers
agreed during the early 1990s to rely on the Consumer Price Index to set price
increases for pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug companies argued that hospitals and HMOs have the leverage to
negotiate discounts because their use of approved-drug lists meant they could
decide not to buy certain drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Because pharmacies have to stock virtually all types of drugs to serve their
customers, they do not have the same negotiating leverage, the drug companies
contended.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge in Chicago ruled for the drug makers and wholesalers last
year, and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals generally agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug manufacturers can legally charge higher prices to some customers so
long as they do not conspire to do so, the appeals court said. It added that the
pharmacies provided evidence of such an agreement only with regard to the claim
that prices for pharmacies were pegged to the CPI.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court ordered a lower court to resolve other issues to determine
whether the CPI claim should go to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on today, the pharmacies' lawyers said the appeals
court's ruling ``has opened a safe harbor where sellers may engage in a plain
form of price collusion.'' The 7th Circuit court should have considered the drug
companies' actions as a whole instead of as separate issues, the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug companies' lawyers said the appeal was premature and that the lower
court ruled correctly.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is HJB vs. Amerisource Corp., 99-786.

<HEADLINE> Starr Defends Lewinsky Investigation  </HEADLINE>
   By DON BABWIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Former Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr
says President Clinton is the reason his investigation dragged on for years and
cost tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could all have been avoided very easily, very readily,'' Starr said
Monday at a question-and-answer session with Northwestern University journalism
students. ``It could all have been (avoided) simply by saying, 'There was this
activity, I shouldn't have done it, let's get it behind us as reasonably as we
can.'''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Clinton has ``this unfortunate side, this unwillingness to come to
grips with the situation that would have spared everyone all the angst ... by
coming to grips with it and to say `here it is' as opposed to dragging the
country through it and then suggesting that it's all the law officer's fault.''
</P>
<P>
	   Starr said the public did not always get an accurate picture of what was
going on with the investigation that led to Clinton's impeachment because news
reports were at times incomplete and therefore misleading.
</P>
<P>
	   As an example, he said the media did not provide accurate reports of the
trial of former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker in large part because reporters did
not cover the trial ``day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Starr sounded gracious when talking about first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
saying her statement that his investigation was part of a vast right-wing
conspiracy was ``sort of an understandable defense mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Starr's successor as independent counsel, Robert Ray, is closing out the
six-year, $50 million investigation that led to the convictions of 14 people. In
addition to Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky, Starr's office looked into the purge
of the White House travel office and the White House's improper gathering of FBI
background files on employees and presidential appointees from Republican
administrations.

<HEADLINE> Animals Studied As Quake Predictors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Chinese and Japanese scientists exchanged views Tuesday on the
possibilities of using animal behavior to predict earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
	   Yoshihiro Hayashi, a professor of veterinary science at Tokyo University who
helped organized the seminar, acknowledged that the conventional scientific
wisdom is that earthquakes can't be predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that the question of whether animal behavior can be used to
foretell quakes is almost impossible to prove scientifically, and such findings
may even do more harm than good by setting off panic if publicized prematurely.
</P>
<P>
	   "But it is an interesting possibility. Animals have evolved to avoid
dangers," Hayashi said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Zheng Guorong, vice director of the earthquake department in Tangshan in
Hebei Province in northern China, presented findings about fish that jumped out
of the water as well as moles, bugs and hibernating animals popping out from the
ground right before an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
	   Zheng and another Chinese researcher, Wang Anbin, told the gathering that
they were able to use animal behavior along with other observed natural changes
to predict several earthquakes in China.
</P>
<P>
	   A handful of Japanese scientists are also carrying out studies on how
animals act before earthquakes. Mitsuaki Ota, a professor at Azabu University
who has done research with dogs, also attended the seminar.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the week, the Chinese scientists gave a similar presentation in
Kobe, the city devastated by a quake that killed more than 6,000 people in 1995.

<HEADLINE> California Franchise Tax Law KO'd  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- California unfairly taxes out-of-state businesses under a
franchise tax law in place since 1955, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously
today.
</P>
<P>
	   The court struck down the law, saying it discriminated against interstate
commerce and allowed the state to indirectly tax income it has no authority to
tax directly.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision is a victory for Hunt-Wesson Inc., which had challenged the
franchise tax law's impact on the California taxes it had to pay for the three
years 1980-82.
</P>
<P>
	   The eventual impact on California's state treasury could be significant.
More than $400,000 in taxes and more than $1 million in interest was at stake
for Hunt-Wesson in those three years. About 40,000 other companies file returns
with the state Franchise Tax Board, which collected $5.8 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear whether today's decision entitles other
companies to seek partial refunds for taxes previously paid. It definitely will
reduce the amount of taxes collected under the law from now on.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices found fault with the law's restriction on deductions that
companies not based in California could claim for interest paid as business
expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the franchise tax law, those deductions were offset dollar for dollar
against the interest and dividend income a company received from its
subsidiaries outside California -- income the state is barred from taxing.
</P>
<P>
	   California's tax law appeared to be unique. The justices were told that no
other state counts 100 percent of such earnings against business-expense
deductions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because California's offset provision is not a reasonable allocation of
expense deductions to the income that the expense generates, it constitutes
impermissible taxation of income outside its jurisdictional reach,'' Justice
Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The provision therefore violates the due-process and commerce clauses of
the Constitution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The law seemed in trouble when the case was argued before the nation's
highest court in January. ``It's just irrational,'' Justice Antonin Scalia said
then of the tax scheme, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor told a deputy California
attorney general: ``I haven't found anything in what you said to find this
reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hunt-Wesson markets Hunt's tomato products, Wesson oil, Butterball turkey
and Swiss Miss cocoa. When the tax dispute began, the taxpayer was Beatrice
Companies Inc., which later merged with Hunt-Wesson.
</P>
<P>
	   The corporation was based in Illinois back then but since has moved to
California. It received $75 million from its out-of-state subsidiaries in the
three years in question, and state tax officials did not attempt to tax that
income.
</P>
<P>
	   But when the corporation claimed a $153 million deduction for interest paid
as a business expense, the franchise tax board said the interest paid had to be
offset by the subsidiary income. The result: a smaller deduction and a larger
tax bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Hunt-Wesson Inc. vs. Franchise Tax Board, 98-2043.

<HEADLINE> Truckers head for Washington to protest high fuel prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DEEPWATER, N.J. (AP) - Irate over rising fuel prices, dozens of truckers
headed for the nation's capital this morning in hopes of raising the federal
government's awareness of their dilemma.
<P>
	   Members of the National Owner-Operators Trucking Association sent a convoy
of more than 40 dump trucks, tractor-trailers and tractor cabs from here at
dawn.
</P>
<P>
	   They rendezvoused at a truck stop near the Delaware Memorial Bridge,
departing for Washington about 7:15. State police cars escorted the convoy from
Joe's Truck Stop on Route 40 onto Interstate-295 as they began the trip south.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other groups from Maryland were to meet them and converge on the
nation's capital by about 11 a.m. today, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 trucks traveled through Baltimore's Fort McHenry tunnel beginning
about 9:30 a.m., and were joined by about 75 more trucks in Jessup, Md.,
Maryland state police spokesman Pete Piringer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police along the route reported no major problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're going about 30-40 mph and are restricted to one lane. So far,
there's no major problems, but they are causing a bit of spectacle in Howard
County," Piringer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Hentz, a spokesman for the New Jersey group, said he expected about
300 trucks to be in the procession once it reaches the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
	   The truckers want President Clinton to repeal the federal excise tax on
diesel fuel, which Hentz said is 24 cents a gallon, until the price of fuel goes
back down to $1 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   He said diesel fuel now costs up to $2.50 a gallon in some places and that
truckers can't charge enough to meet their overhead. The price of diesel fuel
has doubled over the last year, Hentz said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a funeral procession," he said. "If you don't do something about
the cost of fuel and tolls in the next 60 days, we're buried."
</P>
<P>
	   The trucks were adorned with hand-lettered signs. Among them was one on the
back of a dump truck that read: "Thank a trucker. If you live in it, if you wear
it, if you eat it, we brought it to you."
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Cornell, 35, of Browns Mills, N.J., was among the participants. He said
he's frustrated by his inability to get ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   "The rates are less than they were 10 years ago. Everything else costs
more," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pointing to the sign on the dump truck, he said: "Like the sign says, that's
the honest to God truth."
</P>
<P>
	   Cornell said he'll sacrifice $400 by not working today and for the cost of
the fuel and tolls for the trip. But he said he thinks it's worth it to make the
point.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Nirdlinger, 35, also of Browns Mills, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully it'll prove a point and something will happen. Otherwise we'll be
turning trucks back in to the dealerships," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's convoy to Washington follows protests earlier this month in which
truckers drove their rigs around the state capitols in Trenton and Providence,
R.I. New Jersey and Pennsylvania truckers also have staged demonstrations at
port facilities in Port Newark/Port Elizabeth, N.J., and Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Riley To Propose Full-Year Teachers  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In his yearly speech on the state of American schools,
Education Secretary Richard Riley will propose extending teachers' schedules and
pay to a full year in efforts to raise the bar on teacher quality.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can no longer get teachers on the cheap anymore,'' he said in remarks
prepared for his seventh and final State of American Education address. ``I
believe school districts should begin moving to make teaching a year-round
profession over the course of the next five years and pay teachers accordingly
for these additional months.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the teacher proposal, being outlined today at Southern High School in
Durham, N.C., Riley suggests that the extra time can and should be used for
intensive teacher training and supply a workforce for students who need extra
help in summer schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Riley said he is not proposing sending children to school all year:
``Decisions about school schedules are best left up to each individual school
district.''
</P>
<P>
	   On average, teachers work under contract for 186 school days, said Kathleen
Lyons, spokeswoman for the 2.5 million member National Education Association
teachers' union.
</P>
<P>
	   The starting times range from mid-August and until June, and a teachers'
work year could be up to 10 months. And the average salary for a public school
teacher is was $40,582 for 1998-99. And the average teacher spends $400 in
out-of-pocket expenses for student supplies and works more than 50 hours a week,
though they were only paid for 36 hours, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   So the proposal is welcome: ``They are being compensated for much less than
what they are actually working. The year-round plan and increased pay would move
us toward treating teachers as professionals and compensating them as they
deserve,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   And as the nation's summer schools and after-school programs are growing to
accommodate the children who fail, many school districts already have their
teachers working 10 months or more.
</P>
<P>
	   But, Riley said, their pay is not catching up to the demands made on them.
Recent studies show that the annual income gap between experienced teachers with
masters' degrees and people in other fields with the same level of education is
at least $32,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this time of economic prosperity, with state coffers expanding, there
can be no excuse for shortchanging our students and their teachers,'' Riley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Riley, the longest-serving Education Department secretary, is also releasing
a five-year report card, highlighting progress claimed by the administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The report will show, Riley said in prepared remarks, that reading, math and
science scores are up, that girls are catching up to boys in taking math and
science courses, that high school students are taking tougher courses and
scoring better on college entrance exams such as the SAT and ACT, and that more
minority students are going on to college than ever before.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While positive things are happening, loud and negative voices tell us,
again and again, that public education is not up to the task of educating our
children,'' he said. ``Unlike some in politics, I do not get a kick out of
bashing teachers.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also critiqued calls to give public funds to children in low-performing
schools to attend private or parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Vouchers are a mistake,'' he said. ``Vouchers drain funds from public
education and they divert us from the real challenge of lifting up all of our
children.''
</P>
<P>
	   However he cautioned states to be careful in the rush to increase academic
standards with high-stakes tests tied to a child's promotion to the next grade
or high school graduation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Setting standards in January and testing in June is not realistic or
fair,'' he said. ``Promotion standards must be phased in sensibly, not rushed.
This is a step by step process.''

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Tax Refund Time Limit  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- People cannot gain more time to seek a federal income tax
refund by filing their tax return late, the Supreme Court said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The unanimous decision said the three-year time limit for seeking a refund
begins running when someone's withholding and estimated tax payments are made to
the government. The deadline does not depend on when a person's income tax
return is filed, the court said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling is a defeat for a District of Columbia man who sought a refund
when he filed his federal tax return four years late.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal tax code imposes a ceiling on the amount of a refund a taxpayer
can claim as the result of an overpayment. The code says the amount ``shall not
exceed the portion of the tax paid within the period immediately preceding the
filing of the claim, equal to three years plus the period of any extension of
time for filing the return.''
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court today that the tax is ``paid''
on the date a taxpayer's return was due -- not when the return is actually
filed.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's ruling upheld a federal appeals court decision that said David H.
Baral waited too late to seek a tax refund.
</P>
<P>
	   Baral worked in 1988 in the mail room of The Washington Post, which
submitted to the Internal Revenue Service $4,104 in tax withholding for the
year. Baral became concerned that amount might be inadequate and sent the IRS an
additional $1,100 in January 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   In April 1989, he filed a form extending his deadline to file his 1988
income tax return from April 15 until Aug. 15, 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Baral did not file his 1988 tax return until June 1993. His return
showed that he had overpaid his 1988 taxes by $1,175, and he asked the IRS to
credit the overpayment against his 1989 taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRS refused, saying Baral had missed the refund deadline of three years
plus the four-month extension.
</P>
<P>
	   Baral sued, but a federal judge and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit ruled against him. Today, the Supreme Court said
those courts were right.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Baral vs. U.S., 98-1667.

<HEADLINE> New Trial Not Always Automatic  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who win a lawsuit only to see their victory thrown
out on appeal because of improper expert testimony are not always entitled to a
new trial to prove their case, the Supreme Court ruled today.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal appeals courts can bar such people from presenting their claims in a
new trial, the justices ruled unanimously in the North Dakota case of a woman
who died in a house fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling resolves a deep split among federal appeals courts on that point.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that procedural rules for federal courts
give appellate judges such discretion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If ... the court of appeals concludes that further proceedings are
unwarranted because of the loser of the appeal has had a full and fair
opportunity to present the case, including arguments for a new trial, the
appellate court may appropriately instruct the (trial judge) to enter judgment
against the jury-verdict winner,'' Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's ruling upheld a federal appeals court ruling that barred a new trial
in a wrongful-death case filed by the son of Bonnie Weisgram, who died in a 1993
fire at her home in Fargo, N.D.
</P>
<P>
	   Her son, Chad Weisgram, sued the manufacturer of an electric baseboard in
his mother's home, blaming the blaze on an alleged defect in the heater's
thermostat. A jury awarded him $500,000 from the manufacturer, the Marley Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the verdict in February 1999
and granted judgment to Marley, barring a new trial in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court said the trial judge should not have allowed three expert
witnesses, presented by Weisgram's lawyers, to testify about alleged defects in
the heater.
</P>
<P>
	   Without that testimony, Chad Weisgram could not prove his case, the appeals
court concluded in granting judgment to Marley Co.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Supreme Court, Weisgram's lawyers argued that when a trial verdict is
thrown out because expert testimony was erroneously admitted, those who sued
should automatically be given a new trial to prove their case.
</P>
<P>
	   Weisgram's lawyers could have submitted other evidence in a new trial, the
appeal said, adding that the appeals court should not have assumed he would not
be able to prove the heater was defective.
</P>
<P>
	   Weisgram's lawyers also argued that if the Supreme Court decided he was not
automatically entitled to a new trial, the decision on whether to have a new
trial should be made by the trial judge rather than the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the Supreme Court disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Appellate authority to make this determination is no less when the
evidence is rendered insufficient by the removal of erroneously admitted
testimony than it is when the evidence, without any deletion, is insufficient,''
Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Weisgram vs. Marley, 99-161.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved sharply lower today, continuing last week's
big decline, although some software and telecommunications shares rose on
earnings and acquisition news.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped for its fourth day in a row. By
late morning, the index was down 81.28 at 10,138.24.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index was off 79.97 at 4,331.77. The

<P>
	   Stocks continued their slide after a one-day respite for the President's Day

<HEADLINE> Bradley opens two-week sprint to March 7 primaries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - From the stage at the Apollo Theatre to a ballroom at
Adelphi University, Bill Bradley opened a furious two-week sprint to the March 7
primaries, accusing Al Gore of being a closet conservative with a past as
"poster boy" for the National Rifle Association.
<P>
	   Bradley began today with a stop at the Titan Food Greek grocery in Astoria,
N.Y., sampling the feta cheese and baklava. He assured Greek-Americans that he's
"on your side" in the dispute with Turkey over Cyprus. "This is a problem we can
solve. We know what the answer is, and it's the Turkish Army has to get off
Cyprus," Bradley said, before continuing on to Adelphi University, where he
planned to launch a new offensive against the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, countered
Bradley's attacks in an angry Harlem debate Monday night: "You're sounding a
little desperate because you're trying to build yourself up by tearing everybody
else down."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who lost to Gore in Iowa and New Hampshire, has two weeks to stage
a comeback in the balloting in more than a dozen states. He used his ninth
campaign debate with Gore to debut a more aggressive strategy of highlighting
inconsistencies in Gore's record, stretching back to his years as a Tennessee
congressman.
</P>
<P>
	   Unfurled in patches Monday night, Bradley's new offensive was to be unveiled
in full today in an address at Adelphi University on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning Wednesday, Bradley will spend a whopping six days in Washington
state working toward what spokesman Eric Hauser called a "momentum-boosting" win
in the state's nonbinding primary Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who is backed by the Democratic Party establishment, accused Bradley
of attack tactics that "divide us as Democrats." He was taking today off at home
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he was an advocate of affirmative steps to open opportunities for
blacks, and to improve education as well, calling them "the best reparation" for
slavery.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley argued Gore was concealing a more right-leaning record. "Calling
attention to the fact that he was a conservative Democrat before he was Bill
Clinton's vice president is simply truth-telling," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a conservative Democrat, did not support national health insurance,
(had) an 84 percent right-to-life voting record and was the poster boy for the
NRA."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, for all the clatter about Gore's veracity, Bradley volunteered this
answer when an analyst for CNN, which broadcast the 90-minute debate, asked
whether Gore had "the trustworthiness, the intellectual honesty" to make a good
president: "The people will make this decision. My view also is that if Al were
the nominee, I would support him."
</P>
<P>
	   Neither rival was spared from jeers and boos by the raucous and largely
black audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those in the crowd were Whoopi Goldberg (Gore supporter), film
director Spike Lee (for Bradley) and O.J. Simpson defense attorney Johnnie
Cochran (alliance unclear).
</P>
<P>
	   "It was heartwarming to see two candidates fight over us rather than take us
for granted," said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who added that he will probably make an
endorsement next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates used the forum, centered on urban and minority issues, to
appeal to non-white voters - who are expected to account for anywhere between 20
percent and 35 percent of New York's Democratic primary turnout.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls give Gore a prohibitive lead among minority voters, much of it
inherited from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, who will star in a TV ad for Bradley to be shown in New York, said he
was concerned that black voters are blindly supporting Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right or wrong, black people think President Clinton can do no wrong. But I
don't think that means we should automatically transfer that allegiance from
Clinton to Al Gore," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching across the three feet separating their lecterns, Bradley held out a
sheaf of papers he said documented five votes by Gore between 1979 and 1981 to
preserve the tax-exempt status of colleges that racially discriminate.
</P>
<P>
	   In those votes, Gore split with members of the Congressional Black Caucus,
including New York Rep. Charlie Rangel, a leading Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore refused to take the papers and explained away the votes as "a vote on
quotas."
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, he challenged Bradley to explain a 1995 vote that Gore described as
a rejection of expanding minority ownership of broadcast outlets.

<HEADLINE> Hubbell Plea Goes to Supreme Court  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whitewater prosecutors asked the Supreme Court today to
preserve presidential friend Webster Hubbell's guilty plea to a misdemeanor tax
charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors should be able to use the contents of documents against people
who are forced to produce them under a grant of immunity, said attorney Ronald
J. Mann, representing the Whitewater independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hubbell's lawyer, John W. Nields Jr., said his client was indicted ``at
least in part because of the fact that under immunity he told the truth'' by
turning the documents over.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is a terrible kind of immunity,'' Nields said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Constitution's Fifth Amendment protects people from having to testify
against themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   Nields argued that Hubbell's action of turning over the documents amounted
to a statement, and that the immunity should protect him from having that
statement used against him.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Mann said that privilege does not bar prosecutors from using the
contents of the documents once they are handed over. Mann argued for new
Independent Counsel Robert W. Ray, who took over the job from Kenneth Starr last
October.
</P>
<P>
	   Some justices expressed doubts, including Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who
said, ``It was only by virtue of the production of the documents that you
learned the facts that enabled you to carry out the prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said, ``Virtually everyone has
tax records and accounting records. It is no confession to say those records
exist.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several justices questioned how turning over documents differs from being
forced to provide blood or handwriting samples or stand in a police lineup --
all of which can be required.
</P>
<P>
	   A lower court ruled largely against prosecutors and set a standard the
prosecutors acknowledged would have made the case against Hubbell extremely
difficult to prove.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubbell was the No. 3 official at the Justice Department early in President
Clinton's first term and has been a friend of the president and his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, since their Arkansas days.
</P>
<P>
	   He pleaded guilty to the tax charge last June, but on condition that his
plea would be dismissed if the Supreme Court upheld the lower court ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Therefore, Hubbell's plea will remain in place only if the justices rule for
the prosecutors. A decision is expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   The misdemeanor tax charge alleged that Hubbell evaded paying taxes on some
of the hundreds of thousands of dollars in income he received from friends of
the Clintons in 1994 when he was being investigated by Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax charge, filed in April 1998, was based partly on Hubbell's financial
papers that he was required to give to prosecutors under limited immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubbell argued that using the papers to prosecute him would violate his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. A federal judge agreed and
dismissed the tax charge.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia revived the
charge but said prosecutors could use the documents only by showing they
previously had ``reasonably particular knowledge'' of their existence.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors contend they should be allowed to use the documents' contents as
long as they did not seek to show they came from Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubbell's lawyers said the immunity law was designed to let prosecutors get
documents to use against someone else, not against the person granted immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   Not affected by today's case is Hubbell's guilty plea to a felony charge
involving legal work for a savings and loan at the center of the investigation
known as Whitewater, which involved the real estate dealings of then-Arkansas
Gov. Bill Clinton and his wife during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubbell was sentenced last June to a year of probation after entering pleas
that wrapped up the Whitewater phase of Starr's work.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubbell previously served 16 months in prison for bilking his former
Arkansas law firm and its clients. That charge resulted from an earlier
investigation by Starr.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is U.S. vs. Hubbell, 99-166.

<HEADLINE> Challenge to Electric Chair Rejected  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal that called
death in Alabama's electric chair a type of ``cruel and unusual punishment'' the
Constitution forbids.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, turned away Alabama death row inmate Robert Lee
Tarver's contention that his state's ``antiquated'' electric chair exposes him
to a risk of ``excessive burning, disfigurement and ... pain and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
	   Today's brief order means state officials are free to set a new execution
date for him. It is unclear whether the court will use some other case to review
the legitimacy of electrocutions -- and whether such review will be granted
before Tarver dies in the chair.
</P>
<P>
	   In other action, the court:
</P>
<P>
	   --Agreed in an Indiana case to decide whether police routinely can set up
traffic checkpoints and stop motorists in hopes of catching people who sell or
use illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   --Accepted for hearing a private Tennessee high school's argument that it
should be allowed to sue the state high school athletic association under
federal civil rights law in a fight over alleged recruiting violations.
Brentwood Academy contends the association was acting on behalf of the state
government.
</P>
<P>
	   --Refused to revive the main part of a lawsuit that accuses prescription
drug manufacturers and wholesalers of conspiring to deny price discounts to
pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
	   Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen
G. Breyer voted to hear arguments in Tarver's case against the electric chair,
but five votes are needed to grant such review.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas voted against Tarver.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama officials had urged the nation's highest court to reject his appeal,
saying death in the electric chair is almost painless and instantaneous.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarver was to have been electrocuted earlier this month but the justices
ordered his execution delayed just hours before it was to take place.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama is just one of three states that use the electric chair as their
sole means of execution. The other two are Georgia and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   The Georgia House voted overwhelmingly Monday to phase out electrocution and
execute inmates by injection. Legislators said they feared the Supreme Court
would ban the electric chair. That legislation now goes to the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The court last month canceled its review of Florida's use of the electric
chair after the state Legislature passed new legislation providing for death by
injection as the primary means of execution. Gov. Jeb Bush signed it into law.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court never has found any specific form of execution to be
unconstitutional but Tarver's appeal argued that ``a national consensus has
emerged rejecting'' electrocution. Florida joined Kentucky and Tennessee in
moving away from electrocutions in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-eight states have death penalty laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mutilation, burns and botched executions characterize Alabama's use of the
electric chair,'' Tarver's appeal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 98 death row inmates executed across the nation in 1999, 94 were
killed by injection. Three were executed and one was killed by cyanide gas.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarver, 52, was convicted of the 1984 robbery and murder of Hugh Kite
outside the bait shop and grocery Kite owned in Cottonton, near the Georgia
line. Prosecutors said Tarver shot Kite several times and stole his wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The cases are Tarver vs. Alabama, 99-8043 and 99-8044.

<HEADLINE> Jury hears closing arguments in Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Prosecutors failed to prove that the officers
involved in the death of Amadou Diallo acted unreasonably when they fired 41
shots at the unarmed man, defense attorneys argued today in urging a jury to
find their clients innocent.
<P>
	   Attorney Steven Brounstein said his client, Officer Kenneth Boss, believed
Diallo had a gun and was firing at fellow officers, Sean Carroll and Edward
McMellon. And he said prosecutors offered "not one scintilla of proof" to show
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   James Culleton, attorney for Officer Richard Murphy, said the prosecutors'
main argument was, "How do you fire 41 shots at someone who has no weapon? How
does that happen?"
</P>
<P>
	   But after hearing the officers' account of the seconds leading up to the
shooting, Culleton said, "You know now. You know about the chaos that was going
on."
</P>
<P>
	   The defense argued the officers believed Diallo had hit McMellon, who
actually fell backwards off a step and was not shot.
</P>
<P>
	   "They tell you he's guilty of murder. That he wasn't justified? Shame on
them," Culleton said. "Would any reasonable person have acted differently? How
could you fault him?"
</P>
<P>
	   Brounstein also referred to the prosecution's "mantra of 41 bullets" and
said, "Ken Boss did not fire 41 shots. He fired his gun five times. He perceived
a threat based on what he heard, what he observed. ... This is not a case of 41
shots."
</P>
<P>
	   Culleton said the officers followed police procedure when they stopped to
question Diallo because he was acting suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
	   "On Feb. 4, 1999, these four police officers, they didn't know who Mr.
Diallo was. They didn't know he lived in that building," said Culleton. "And
they had an obligation, following proper police procedure, to stop, to walk up
to Mr. Diallo and ask, 'Who are you?' and 'Why are you in this area?"'
</P>
<P>
	   "Why Mr. Diallo acted the way he did to this simple request to talk, we'll
never know," Culleton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Brounstein told jurors the fact that Diallo was home and did not have a gun
were "Monday morning quarterbacking arguments" offered by prosecutors desperate
to prove their case.
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't turn a mistake, a tragedy, into an injustice," Brounstein said. "I
implore you, I beg of you, to find Ken Boss not guilty of all charges. The
people have failed in their burden of proof."
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy, 27, and co-defendants Carroll, 37, McMellon, 27, and Boss, 28 - all
white - have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder in the killing of Diallo,
22, a black West African immigrant. Their trial was moved to Albany after a
judge ruled they could not get a fair trial in New York City because of the
publicity surrounding the case.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted of murder, the officers face a maximum sentence of 25 years to
life in prison. However, State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi opened the
door for a compromise verdict last week by ruling that jurors would be able to
convict on less serious charges such as second-degree manslaughter, which has a
minimum penalty of probation.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the defendants cornered the victim in the elevator-size
vestibule of his apartment building at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999, then, without
warning, unleashed a "wall of lead." The victim was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers were in street clothes as they searched Diallo's neighborhood
for armed suspects. They contend they had good reason for stopping him and for
firing in self-defense with their rapid-fire semiautomatics.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony last week, the officers told a similar story: Diallo ignored
repeated orders by Carroll and McMellon to stop for questioning after they got
out of their unmarked car, badges out. He darted into his dimly lighted
vestibule and pulled out a black object they were certain was a gun. He also
remained upright as they fired a continuous volley lasting less than 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Boss testified last week that when he first spotted Diallo, he thought, "My
God, I'm gonna die." Carroll wept on the stand while he recalled the shock of
realizing the black object "was just a wallet. ... I said, 'Where's the
(expletive) gun?"'
</P>
<P>
	   But several prosecution "ear witnesses," mainly neighbors of Diallo,
testified they never heard the officers' voices before sporadic gunfire erupted.
A coroner who autopsied the victim told jurors his wounds showed that he was
either falling or flat on his back when most of the bullets hit.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon were the first to shoot, squeezing off all 16 rounds
from their guns. Boss fired five times and Murphy four while backing up their
partners, leading to speculation they have the best chance at acquittal.

<HEADLINE> Some Stores To Get Irradiated Meat  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Beef that is irradiated to kill deadly bacteria will
begin appearing in some stores as early as March as processors start testing the
public's reaction to the treated meat.
</P>
<P>
	   New rules that allow the irradiation of raw beef, pork and lamb take effect
today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We view this as a consumer choice issue. The consumer will ultimately
determine the success,'' said Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for the nation's
biggest beef processor, IBP Inc., which plans to begin test-marketing irradiated
meat sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
	   No. 2 Excel Corp. plans to start shipping treated beef to its food service
customers the first week of March.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, irradiated meat is likely to be most popular with hospitals and
nursing homes, because of the danger E. coli poses to patients with weakened
immune systems. But its use there could generate interest from consumers, said
Tim Willard, a spokesman for the National Food Processors Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Christine Bruhn, director of the Center for Consumer Research at the
University of California-Davis, said the public is ready to try the meat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most people are ready. They are sick and tired of hearing of cases of
food-borne outbreaks,'' said Bruhn.
</P>
<P>
	   The meat is expected to cost an extra three to five cents per pound but the
price is likely to drop as it becomes more widely available.
</P>
<P>
	   Irradiation has long been allowed for poultry, as well as fruits, vegetables
and spices. It is seldom used on poultry, partly because the primary pathogens
aren't as dangerous as E. coli, and chicken processors haven't thought it was
worth the expense, say industry experts. One big recall for E. coli, however,
can devastate a meatpacker financially.
</P>
<P>
	   The irradiation is done by three methods -- gamma rays, X-rays, or electron
beams. In addition to eliminating E. coli, the treatment can significantly
reduce levels of other pathogens, including listeria, salmonella and
campylobacter. The food isn't radioactive, and while there is a slight loss of
nutrients, the food is largely unchanged, according to the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   FDA also is considering allowing irradiation for hot dogs, luncheon meats
and other ready-to-eat products. Kraft Foods Inc. and a major irradiation firm,
Titan Corp., annoucned an agreement today to work on using the technology on
processed foods.
</P>
<P>
	   Special labels are required, carrying the international symbol of
irradiation, known as a ``radura,'' and a statement that they were treated. The
symbol, colored green on a white background, depicts two leaves resting in a
semicircle, with a green dot above it beneath a broken-lined semicircle.
</P>
<P>
	   E. coli O157 can cause serious illness and sometimes death, especially in
children and the elderly. An estimated 73,480 people are infected every year,
and about 600 cases are fatal, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an extra layer of food safety,'' said Mark Klein, a spokesman for
Excel, which blasts beef carcasses with steam to kill E. coli. ``We definitely
view it as an additional tool and not a replacement for other technologies or
food safety programs.''
</P>
<P>
	   A smaller, Florida-based processer, Colorado Boxed Beef Co., plans to sell
irradiated meat through grocery chains in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had to recall 359,000 pounds beef products in November 1998
because of possible contamination with the deadly E. coli bacteria, and Florida
officials have been promoting irradiation heavily.

<HEADLINE> Who Wants To Watch Loony TV?  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Is it just me, or is TV extra loony of late?
</P>
<P>
	   Just consider the case of David Letterman. To everyone's delight, he was
back at his desk on "Late Show" Monday night after a month-long absence.
</P>
<P>
	   Except he was never gone.
</P>
<P>
	   Sure, in real life Dave went under the knife, then spent weeks convalescing
from heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   But being well (or even alive) is no precondition for being on TV. Despite
his emergency quintuple bypass Jan. 14, Letterman was never off the air. Some
nights, an old "Late Show" was rerun. Other nights, past guests came on to
reminisce about appearing with Dave, then clips of those appearances with Dave
were shown.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with Dave missing, Dave was never not there.
</P>
<P>
	   At least, until now. Although he's back for real, to ease his returnhe will
sometimes relinquish his duties to a substitute host (such as Bill Cosby, who
fills in Tuesday night).
</P>
<P>
	   Go figure: Now that Dave's back, more often than not he'll be gone.
</P>
<P>
	   An affair of another heart also has its screwy overtones. Airing last week,
"Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?" convened 50 women who wanted to be wed
in the worst way. And then one was, to a guy none of them had even glimpsed
until real estate investor/romantic fool Rick Rockwell stepped from the shadows
and popped the question. Talk about a pig in a poke!
</P>
<P>
	   The two-hour Fox special boasted "television's most-watched marriage
ceremony since Charles and Diana." And like the marriage of those royal lovers,
the nuptials of Rockwell and nurse/comely blonde Darva Conger seem star-crossed.
Fox was forced to cancel a rebroadcast of the event after learning that Rockwell
had once been accused of beating a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am humbled and embarrassed by the fact that everyone went to all this
trouble for me," Rockwell said in a happier moment, just before dropping to one
knee. Which suggests that he was blinded by the light. "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire" isn't about Rick Rockwell. It's about TV.
</P>
<P>
	   And for the eligible bachelor initially identified only as "Mr.
Multimillionaire," as well as his eventual bride and the Spurned 49, TV was
justification and reward.
</P>
<P>
	   In short, this program bears out the First Law of Television: If you search
hard enough, you can find someone to do anything you can think of ... providing
you put them on TV while they do it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Second Law of Television: Whatever it is, other people will watch.
</P>
<P>
	   Granted, the inmates of North Carolina's Davidson County Jail weren't
watching. There, no TV is allowed. Just TV stars.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're here," Deborah Norville told viewers last week, "because we want to
give you an inside look at what it's really like inside jail."
</P>
<P>
	   For "Inside Edition," the syndicated newsmagazine she anchors, Norville had
entered Davidson County Jail as an honest-to-gosh inmate. For five days. And TV
journalism was a little wackier for it.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, we're not talking Christiane Amanpour reporting from Kosovo. But you'd
never have guessed from the buildup for Deborah Behind Bars. Check the
announcer's snarling intro to her first report, then remind yourself this isn't
a "Saturday Night Live" spoof:
</P>
<P>
	   "Doing time in Cell Block A! No special treatment. Just bars. And you will
see it all. The booking. The rules. The shackles. The prison stripes.
</P>
<P>
	   "And no makeup!"
</P>
<P>
	   Over and over we were reminded that it's "the toughest jail in America," a
title granted by Sheriff Gerald Hege, the man who runs it. A law-and-order P.T.
Barnum, he, like his celebrity guest, is a TV star of sorts: Since last summer,
Hege has been the host of Court TV's jailbird chat show, "Inside Cell Block F."
</P>
<P>
	   Now he was Norville's host at the pinkest jail in America. For some reason,
Hege has had everything painted pink. On TV it looked divine.
</P>
<P>
	   But pink wasn't foremost on Norville's mind as she accepted a misspelled
name tag (NORVILL, D) and exchanged her loafers for the prison-issue
flip-flops.	   "I think the lady who booked me was more nervous than I was,"
reported Norville, posed in the doorway of her pink cell. "I heard a quiver in
her voice and I wasn't sure that she wasn't a little uncertain about this
adventure that we're only hours into."
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, Norville had to maintain the goofball pretext for this stunt: that
she was penetrating prison life as just another inmate, subject to the same
tough policies that governed everybody else.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, "Inside Edition" viewers might have quibbled that no other inmate
was attended by TV cameras and a producer as she mopped a floor or did a guest
shot on CNN's "Larry King Live."
</P>
<P>
	   During five days in the slammer, Norville took pains to find some larger
truths of jail life. Mostly what she found was a hair in her producer's food,
and that her fellow inmates were "very respectful of one another's privacy."
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike (come to think of it) her.

<HEADLINE> Cayuga verdict won't halt Onondaga claim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ONONDAGA INDIAN NATION, N.Y. (AP) - The verdict in the Cayuga Indian
Nation's land claim lawsuit will not affect the Onondaga Nation's plans to sue
New York for compensation for about 70,000 acres, says an Onondaga chief.
<P>
	   Onondaga leaders were shocked that a federal court jury awarded the Cayugas
only $37 million last week, but the tribe will proceed with its legal plans,
said Chief Irving Powless.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not too far off," he said when asked about a timeframe for the Onondaga's
claim, which will include nearly all the city of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   The Onondagas said previously that they would await the outcome of the
Cayugas' trial before filing their own claim and joining the other tribes of the
Iroquois Confederacy who have claims pending against New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The Onondagas plan to seek compensation for land which the state acquired in
treaties with them between 1790 and 1822. The Onondagas contend the land
purchases violated federal law because New York did not obtain congressional
approval as required by federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if it will delay the filing," said Joe Heath, the Onondaga's
attorney, about the Cayuga verdict. "It will clearly broaden the discussion."
</P>
<P>
	   Heath predicted the Cayuga verdict may result in the state being less
interested in settling future land claim suits out of court, however.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, this verdict may not induce them to be responsible and try
to resolve these in a fair government-to-government basis," Heath said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas had hoped the U.S. District Court jury would award them at least
$335 million to compensate for 64,015 acres in Cayuga and Seneca counties that
New York illegally acquired in 1795 and 1807.
</P>
<P>
	   An appraiser for the state of New York said the Cayugas should get no more
than $51 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Coulter, another attorney for the Onondagas, said that the jury's
verdict in the Cayuga case does not establish the amount of damages that New
York should pay the Onondagas.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't equate those. It's a different land. And it will be a different
trial and a different jury," Coulter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Heath said that the state lost in some respects in the Cayuga case even
though the verdict was low.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's important to remember what has been established in this case," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "One, that New York clearly broke federal law when it took the Cayuga land.
And, that the Cayugas reserved their right to that 64,000 acres," Heath said.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that in failing to settle out of court, the state lost its ability
to negotiate a limit on the amount of land the Cayugas can purchase, or
negotiate any jurisdictional issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have the right to reacquire all of the 64,000 acres," Heath said.
"None of the issues that concerned the people have been addressed here."

<HEADLINE> Snow capital's winter celebration will bask in sun again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Meteorologists are stumped. The National Weather
Service has no explanation. Not even triple Doppler radar can solve this
mystery.
<P>
	   Why does Syracuse's Winterfest celebration always appear to cause winter to
melt away?
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers even tried moving the date of the annual festival, which features
ice sculpting, human dogsled races, skating, chili cookoffs and other wintertime
merriment.
</P>
<P>
	   No luck. The thaw followed.
</P>
<P>
	   With temperatures expected to climb to near 50 degrees through the weekend,
the town reputed to be America's snowiest big city again faces a slushy
celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it will only help us with attendance," said Bill Cooper, chairman
of the Syracuse Winterfest Committee, trying to keep a positive outlook.
</P>
<P>
	   This will be the fifth consecutive year that the annual midwinter thaw has
coincided with the wintertime carnival. In fact, only three times in the past 12
years has the weather really been wintry with subfreezing temperatures.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers shifted the dates of Winterfest from late January to mid-January
back to late January before finally deciding in 1996 to move it to late
February.
</P>
<P>
	   The opening day of the festival that year brought 52 degrees and rainy
skies.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, the first day of Winterfest saw 63 degrees and light rain.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the temperatures stayed above freezing all week.
</P>
<P>
	   And who could forget 1999?
</P>
<P>
	   Winterfest fell in the middle of one of the warmest Februarys in Syracuse
history. The 5.7 inches of snow for the month made it the second-least snowy
February on record.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers forced to think creatively, held the human dogsled race on wheels
in 1997 and 1998 due to the lack of snow. Last year, they trucked in artificial
snow made by machine at a nearby ski resort.
</P>
<P>
	   As of Tuesday, Syracuse had up to two feet of snow on the ground in some
places. However, forecasters says a retreating jet stream will let warm, moist
air push into upstate New York for the next several days. The outlook is for
sunny skies with temperatures near 50 for Saturday for the human dogsled race.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're hoping we have quality snow left at a city parking lot or the airport
so we can truck it away and dump it ... for the race," Cooper said. "Otherwise,
we're in trouble."
</P>
<P>
	   The lack of snow could jeopardize the snow volleyball game scheduled for
Sunday in the same location.
</P>
<P>
	   Syracuse typically averages 114 inches - nearly 10 feet - of snow a year.
But it hasn't even had an average snowfall in the past three years. Currently,
the city is at 76.6 inches.
</P>
<P>
	   Its reputation has been taking a knock recently. The ultimate insult was
this year when producer Albie Hecht decided to shoot his hit comedy "Snow Day"
in Alberta, Canada, even though the story takes place in Syracuse.

<P>
	   Not enough snow in Syracuse, Hecht said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Med Mistakes Reported  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton tried to reassure doctors and hospitals
today that reporting serious and deadly medical mistakes need not lead to more
malpractice lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Hospitals nationwide would have to disclose serious and deadly mistakes if
Congress adopts a White House plan developed in response to a report last year
that estimated medical mix-ups kill as many as 98,000 Americans each year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a balanced, common sense approach based on prevention, not
punishment, based on problem-solving, not blame-placing,'' Clinton said in
announcing a plan that is controversial among doctors and insurers.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also announced several new requirements that do not need
congressional approval, including an immediate mandatory reporting requirement
for the 500 Defense Department-administered hospitals that serve an estimated 8
million people. And the Health Care Financing Administration will require error
reduction plans this year in all 6,000 hospitals that participate in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration has a year to develop new standards to help
prevent medical mistakes caused by sound-alike drug names or look-alike
products. The agency will also come up with new standards for labels that
highlight common problems such as errors in dosage size.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Taken together, these actions represent the most signficant effort our
nation has ever made to reduce medical errors,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House wants all hospitals to report errors within three years, but
cannot force compliance without legislation from Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   There already are plans in Congress to respond to the Institute of Medicine
report on medical mistakes that could short-circuit the White House plan by
requiring faster or more comprehensive reporting.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., predicted a bipartisan medical error bill will
pass this year, and two Senate committees are holding hearings.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House sees its plan as a compromise between patient advocates who
want full disclosure of medical mistakes and representatives of doctors and
hospitals who fear more disclosure means more lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House wants a mandatory national reporting system, administered by
the states, that would collect information about preventable deaths and major
injuries by hospital and type of problem. Names of individual doctors or other
health care workers would not be public.
</P>
<P>
	   Hospitals would not have to report less serious mistakes or close calls,
although the White House hopes they would do so voluntarily, a senior White
House official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole idea here is to not blame people,'' said the White House
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Obviously, we have a problem in
medical errors, and we have to acknowledge it. Acknowledging it is the first
step, but we can't make it punitive.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president's proposed budget for next year includes $33 million to
improve the reporting system for medical mistakes at the FDA.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposed budget also includes $20 million for new research on
reducing medical errors and to create a new patient safety clearinghouse. The
new study center would fund research on patient safety nationwide and promote
ways to apply the findings.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, head of the Washington-based Public Citizen's Health
Research Group, said the White House approach does not go far enough. Hospitals
can still mask the true level of mistakes by failing to perform enough
autopsies, and patients deserve a full accounting, Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To be silent on this major source of finding out the nature of mistakes
both in diagnoses and treatment is just irresponsibility,'' Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other end of the argument is Dr. Nancy Dickey, immediate past
president of the American Medical Association. She said there is no evidence
that hospitals are safer in states with reporting systems in place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are opposed to mandatory reporting,'' Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighteen states already have some kind of mandatory reporting system.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the Institute of Medicine, a private organization chartered by
Congress to advise the government on scientific matters, estimated that medical
mistakes kill between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans each year. The institute said
it found flaws in the way hospitals, clinics and pharmacies operate.
</P>
<P>
	   The mistakes ranged from botched surgeries to misunderstandings over dosages
and effects of prescription drugs.

<HEADLINE> Defense rips detective's handling of Louima inquiry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Abner Louima picked his torturer out of a police photo
array, but was unable to identify a second officer in the precinct house
bathroom when he was sodomized with a broken broom handle, a police investigator
testified Tuesday.
<P>
	   Lt. Reinaldo Daniels, who tape-recorded a hospital interview with Louima
while heading the department's internal investigation of the August 1997
incident, also admitted under defense questioning that he improperly corrected
errors in his written report.
</P>
<P>
	   The veteran detective conceded that he never showed Louima a picture of
Officer Thomas Wiese, who claims that he entered the bathroom as fellow officer
Justin Volpe stood over the Haitian immigrant, bloody stick in hand.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did he (Louima) tell you the second officer was just standing there, doing
nothing?" asked Ronald Fischetti, the attorney for defendant Charles Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," replied Daniels.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiese, 37, Schwarz, 34, and Officer Thomas Bruder, 37, are on trial in
Brooklyn federal court for conspiring to obstruct justice by concealing
Schwarz's role as the second officer who held Louima down during the broomstick
attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Last May, Volpe pleaded guilty to violating Louima's civil rights and was
sentenced to 30 years. Last week, telling the full story for the first time
under oath, Volpe said that Wiese - not Schwarz - was present, but did not
intervene.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, who already faces a possible life sentence for violating Louima's
civil rights, claims he was never in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischetti sharply questioned Daniels, a senior member of the police Internal
Affairs Bureau, on differences between his written report on the Louima
interview and the actual transcript. He suggested several times that the tape
might have been doctored, despite a tag identifying it as "original."
</P>
<P>
	   Fischetti focused on Daniels' report quoting Louima as saying the second
officer in the room was white, with a "light crew cut," and about 5 feet, 7
inches tall - a fairly accurate description of Wiese. But on the tape, the
5-foot-7 reference is to Louima's own height, not the second officer.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's my error, that's my mistake," the clearly uncomfortable Daniels
testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischetti got Daniels to admit he changed that part of his written report by
"whiting out" and typing over some words, a violation of police policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischetti showed jurors the four photo arrays, each containing six cop mug
shots, that were shown to Louima at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The victim failed to pick out Schwarz from the third array, Daniels
testified, but when he was shown the fourth and last, which contained Volpe's
mug shot, "his eyes opened up like half dollars."

<HEADLINE> State awards $6 million in open space grants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state has socked away another 26 parcels of
open space, bringing Connecticut's total of preserved land to 6,089 acres.
<P>
	   About $6 million in grants were awarded Tuesday to towns, water companies
and land preservation organizations promising to save 1,886 acres in 23 towns.
</P>
<P>
	   "(The parcels) represent more than money in the bank," Lt. Gov. M. Jodi Rell
said. "They represent land in the bank. And that's a great investment."
</P>
<P>
	   The preserved areas include shorelines, wetlands, a dairy farm, woodlands,
greenways and municipal parks.
</P>
<P>
	   The smallest parcel of land being saved is a 2-acre patch in Vernon. The
largest area is 238 acres in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   In Woodbridge, a 200-acre parcel will connect other open space holdings that
are part of the Woodbridge Greenway.
</P>
<P>
	   In Essex, 8 acres will preserve the largest remaining piece of natural land
along the lower Falls River.
</P>
<P>
	   "These purchases will ensure that residents across the state will have
access to natural resources while preserving the environment for future
generations," said Arthur Rocque, commissioner of the Department of
Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
	   The money awarded Tuesday is the third round of grants handed out since the
Legislature in 1998 approved Gov. John G. Rowland's open space spending program.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the first two rounds of grants totaled about $10 million and
preserved 4,200 acres of land.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal of the open space program is to preserve 673,210 acres - or 21
percent - of Connecticut's land by 2023. The state would own 10 percent of the
land; the remaining 11 percent would be owned by towns, private and nonprofit
land preservation organizations and water companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "This grant program is an opportunity for organizations at the local level
to call the state's attention to locally important pieces of land which are rich
in natural significance and should remain preserved," Rocque said.

<HEADLINE> New York to formally knock standing eight count out of ring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Athletic Commission plans to follow the
lead of other boxing states by proposing the elimination of the standing eight
count in all New York professional bouts.
<P>
	   The commission is also gathering public comment on rules to implement fight
judge selection and pay reforms prompted by the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis
draw controversy last year at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
	   The standing eight count was originally designed to protect the safety of
boxers by allowing the referee to step in and give a fighter who is being
pummeled an eight-second respite.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reason for initially putting it in is if a fighter was sustaining blows
to the head, and you weren't sure how serious it was, the eight count gave you a
chance to stop the fight," said Dr. Barry Jordan, a White Plains neurologist who
has served as ringside physician during many New York bouts.
</P>
<P>
	   But the consensus has grown among doctors that "it is probably best not to
have the standing eight count," Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a boxer is sustaining enough punishment to have to count to eight to
assess his condition, then he's probably suffered enough punishment to stop the
fight," the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Athletic Commission counsel Lawrence Mandelker said boxing officials believe
some referees were using the count to give beleaguered boxers a rest, which is
unfair to their opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a fighter is ahead and he is on the verge of getting a knockout, they
are depriving him of a chance to finish the bout and score the knockout," said
Steve Acunto, a deputy state athletic commissioner in New York and head of the
American Association for the Improvement of Boxing.
</P>
<P>
	   Championship bouts in New York already are staged under the rules of the
national Association of Boxing Commissions, which in 1998 did away with the
standing eight count. The association represents boxing officials in the 48
states in which professional bouts are allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   The standing eight count in New York could be eliminated as early as April,
depending on the comments the commission receives, according to Mandelker.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would be surprised if we get negative comments," Mandelker said.
</P>
<P>
	   The regulations also contain the previously announced revision of rules
about the selection of judges to work title fights in New York. Those changes
were prompted by the uproar caused when the Holyfield-Lewis heavyweight title
match was declared a draw, though most ringside observers thought Lewis was a
clear winner.
</P>
<P>
	   The new rules will provide for judges at future championship matches in New
York to be selected by the state Athletic Commission and not boxing's
sanctioning organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   They also create a sliding scale for what referees and judges at such bouts
will be paid, based on the fight's purse.
</P>
<P>
	   For a fight with a combined purse of between $1 million and $2.5 million,
for instance, judges and the referee will get $3,333 each. For the biggest-money
bouts, with a combined purse of $10 million or more, judges and the referee will
earn $6,000 each.
</P>
<P>
	   The new regulations also provide for reimbursement for judges' and referees'
travel, lodging and meal expenses for title fights.
</P>
<P>
	   The state will also require the filing of affidavits declaring that no one
at a bout's sanctioning body received any payments from that fight's promoters.
</P>
<P>
	   The work of the judge selected by the International Boxing Federation at the
Lewis-Holyfield fight, Eugenia Williams, underwent particular scrutiny after she
scored the bout for Holyfield. She denied she was unduly influenced by IBF
officials, who recognized Holyfield as its champion.
</P>
<P>
	   IBF president Robert Lee Sr. has since been indicted in New Jersey for
selling his federation's rankings of some fighters and for demanding kickbacks
from promoters to sanction bouts.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis won a rematch between the two fighters last November in Las Vegas -
this time with many ringside observers thinking Lewis got the benefit of some
sympathetic scoring from judges.

<HEADLINE> Bradley questions Gore's consistency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) - Pulling his criticisms of Al Gore together into
a single theme, Bill Bradley said Tuesday his own views on abortion, guns and
other issues were "clear, consistent, reliable." He asked: "What do we really
know about Al Gore?"
<P>
	   In a speech at Adelphi University, Bradley expanded on the refrain he
previewed in Monday night's Democratic presidential debate, drawing a rebuke
from the front-runner. "You're sounding a little desperate because you're trying
to build yourself up by tearing everybody else down," Gore said during the
debate at Harlem's Apollo Theatre.
</P>
<P>
	   On tighter gun control, guaranteed abortion rights and stricter campaign
finance laws, Bradley repeated over and again: "It's what I believe, it's what
I've always fought for, and it's what I'll do as president."
</P>
<P>
	   "My record on these fundamental Democratic issues is clear, consistent,
reliable," the former New Jersey senator said. He drew a contrast with the vice
president, saying as a Tennessee congressman Gore voted against abortion rights
and was "a reliable vote for the National Rifle Association ... a dependable
vote for the tobacco companies."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said Gore's "old politics of distortion and attacks and polls and
consultants" has contributed to a new high in public skepticism. "I have a right
to try to change that skepticism. ... I believe the American people deserve a
president who will tell them the truth," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The speech was meant to package his criticism of Gore in one neat argument
that Bradley hopes will sink in with voters during the furious two-week sprint
to the March 7 primaries. Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, said the campaign
hasn't ruled out television ads showcasing the new theme.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley began Tuesday with a stop at the Titan Food Greek grocery in
Astoria, N.Y., sampling the feta cheese and baklava. He assured Greek-Americans
that he's "on your side" in the dispute with Turkey over Cyprus. "This is a
problem we can solve. We know what the answer is, and it's the Turkish Army has
to get off Cyprus," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who lost to Gore in Iowa and New Hampshire, has two weeks to stage
a comeback in the balloting in more than a dozen states. Beginning Wednesday,
Bradley will spend a whopping six days in Washington state working toward what
spokesman Eric Hauser called a "momentum-boosting" win in the state's nonbinding
primary Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who is backed by the Democratic Party establishment, accused Bradley
of attack tactics that "divide us as Democrats." He was taking Tuesday off at
home in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he was an advocate of affirmative steps to open opportunities for
blacks, and to improve education as well, calling them "the best reparation" for
slavery.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley argued Gore was concealing a more right-leaning record. "Calling
attention to the fact that he was a conservative Democrat before he was Bill
Clinton's vice president is simply truth-telling," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a conservative Democrat, did not support national health insurance,
(had) an 84 percent right-to-life voting record and was the poster boy for the
NRA."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, for all the clatter about Gore's veracity, Bradley volunteered this
answer when an analyst for CNN, which broadcast the 90-minute debate, asked
whether Gore had "the trustworthiness, the intellectual honesty" to make a good
president: "The people will make this decision. My view also is that if Al were
the nominee, I would support him."
</P>
<P>
	   Neither rival was spared from jeers and boos by the raucous and largely
black audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those in the crowd were Whoopi Goldberg (Gore supporter), film
director Spike Lee (for Bradley) and O.J. Simpson defense attorney Johnnie
Cochran (alliance unclear).
</P>
<P>
	   "It was heartwarming to see two candidates fight over us rather than take us
for granted," said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who added that he will probably make an
endorsement next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates used the forum, centered on urban and minority issues, to
appeal to non-white voters - who are expected to account for anywhere between 20
percent and 35 percent of New York's Democratic primary turnout.

<HEADLINE> High court clears way for lawsuit over HIV infection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A woman infected with the AIDS virus during a
blood transfusion can sue Danbury Hospital, the state Supreme Court ruled
Tuesday, reviving a lawsuit thrown out by a lower court.
<P>
	   Roberta Ann Sherwood had sued the hospital for negligence in 1996, 11 years
after she contracted HIV from contaminated blood she received while undergoing
back surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   A Superior Court judge had rejected the lawsuit, ruling that the claim
exceeded the three-year statute of limitations on filing suit in a medical
malpractice case.
</P>
<P>
	   The lower court also ruled against Sherwood's claim that the hospital
violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act by making a business
decision to use unscreened blood.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing of Sherwood's discovery she was infected with HIV, and when she
learned the source of the infection, are the key issues in the high court's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   On April 19, 1985, Sherwood was admitted to the hospital for back surgery
and was given four units of blood which had not been screened for the presence
of HIV antibodies.
</P>
<P>
	   A few days after the surgery the hospital received a notice from the
American Red Cross recalling all such untested blood.
</P>
<P>
	   On September 1, 1994, after a routine blood test ordered by her doctors,
Sherwood learned for the first time she had contracted HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   An investigation followed. According to the court's decision, Sherwood
learned for the first time on March 14, 1995, that the source of the infection
was the 1985 blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
	   The high court agreed that the hospital had not violated the state's unfair
trade practices statutes.
</P>
<P>
	   But Justice William J. Sullivan, writing for the majority, said a reasonable
jury could have found that basic standard of care required that Danbury Hospital
"to have taken steps to notify the plaintiff, after the transfusion, that the
blood she had received ... was not tested for HIV."
</P>
<P>
	   The decision sends the case back to Danbury Superior Court for trial on the
negligence issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Hospital officials could not be reached. A message was left at the
hospital's public relations office.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were down today but recovering from an early sharp
drop as interest rate fears, the spark for last week's big decline, lingered
over trading desks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped for its fourth day in a row, and
was down 14.27 in afternoon trading at 10,205.25. In earlier trading, the Dow
was off nearly 115 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index was off 72.60 at 4,339.14,
having also regained some ground. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 6.92
at 1,339.17.
</P>
<P>
	   William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve, reinforced
expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very clear that we will have to use the interest rate tool as long as
the demand side of the economy stays this robust," he said in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   His comments echoed testimony last week from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan,
who suggested more rate increases may be needed to cool the economy and keep
inflation under control. On Friday, the Dow fell 295 points and the Nasdaq lost
137 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Markets were closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday, and today
investors traded cautiously.
</P>
<P>
	   "The average investor is looking for the opportunity to step in here, but
with the pressure that's been created by the Federal Reserve, this could drag on
for a while," Bob Dickey, managing director of technical analysis at Dain
Rauscher Wessels.
</P>
<P>
	   But some individual stocks moved solidly higher today after releasing upbeat
news.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC Communications, a regional telephone company, announced it would spend
$3.9 billion in cash to acquire Sterling Commerce Inc., a provider of Internet
integration software. SBC's shares dipped 1/2 to 35 15/16, while Sterling's
shares soared 11 15/16 to 43 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   In another telecom deal, Global Crossing Ltd., a long-distance phone
company, said it would pay $3.8 billion for IXNet, an Internet networking
company. Global Crossing's stock fell 4 5/16 to 48 1/16, while IXNet's shares
rose 2 5/16 to 54 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Nextel Communications, a wireless phone company, reported a
lower-than-expected loss in its most recent quarter, and said it would split its
stock 2-for-1. Nextel's shares jumped 7 3/4 to 126 7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors, however, said they are starting to worry about profits in the
coming months. Intel, the chip maker, saw its shares slip 2 1/4 to 103 1/8, and
Cisco's shares fell 1 7/8 to 123 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks was down 7.57 at 538.11.
</P>
<P>
	   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 644.47 million shares down from
the 750.46 million the same time Friday. The markets were closed Monday in
observance of Presidents Day.

	   The black object in the unarmed Bronx man's hand turned out to be a wallet.
But when he pulled it out, "that was it," Patten told jurors. "You can't expect
(the officers) to stand there and get blasted away."
</P>
<P>
	   Patten, his voice sometimes booming, argued that with bullets ricocheting
around the tiny vestibule where Diallo died, the defendants thought they were in
a firefight. The result was a mistake, not a crime, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers "were wrong," he said. "They made a mistake. But they honestly
believed this guy was shooting at them."
</P>
<P>
	   Patten's arguments came after nine days of testimony in the trial of Sean
Carroll, 37, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy, 27. The
defendants - all white - have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder in the
killing of Diallo, a black West African immigrant, on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the plainclothes officers cornered the victim in the
vestibule of his apartment building, then, without warning, unleashed 41 bullets
- a "wall of lead." The victim was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was moved to Albany after a judge ruled the defendants could not
get a fair trial in New York City because of the publicity surrounding the case.
The case could go to the jury as early as Wednesday after prosecution final
arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted of murder, the officers face a maximum sentence of 25 years to
life in prison. However, State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi opened the
door for a compromise verdict last week by ruling that jurors would be able to
convict on less serious charges such as second-degree manslaughter, which would
mean the defendants could get only probation.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense argued Tuesday there was not enough proof to convict the
officers on any charge. They said a medical examiner's theory that most of the
bullets hit Diallo as he was going down or already on the ground was flawed and
biased.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys also attacked prosecutors for not calling the only eyewitness
other than the officers. Called by the defense, the witness, Schrrie Elliott,
testified that she heard one officer yell "Gun!" before the gunfire erupted, and
that the victim appeared to stay upright.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy's attorney, James Culleton, argued that his client opened fire only
after Carroll and McMellon shot first. Murphy also saw McMellon fall off the
stoop, and assumed he had been shot, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They tell you he's guilty of murder. That he wasn't justified? Shame on
them," Culleton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another defense attorney, Steven Brounstein, warned against the
prosecution's "mantra of 41 bullets."
</P>
<P>
	   "Ken Boss did not fire 41 shots," Brounstein said. "He fired his gun five
times. He perceived a threat based on what he heard, what he observed. ... This
is not a case of 41 shots."
</P>
<P>
	   Culleton also said the officers followed police procedure when they stopped
to question Diallo because he was lurking around a doorway in the middle of the
night.
</P>
<P>
	   "On Feb. 4, 1999, these four police officers, they didn't know who Mr.
Diallo was. They didn't know he lived in that building," said Culleton. "And
they had an obligation, following proper police procedure, to stop, to walk up
to Mr. Diallo and ask, 'Who are you?' and 'Why are you in this area?"'
</P>
<P>
	   "Why Mr. Diallo acted the way he did to this simple request to talk, we'll
never know," he said.

<HEADLINE> Officer's murder trial to begin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) - Prosecutors in the trial of a police officer
charged with murder after the shooting of a suspect may try to show that the
officer's foot was on the suspect's back, a lawyer said.
<P>
	   Scott Smith, 28, is the first police officer in the state to be charged with
murder for an act in the line of duty. His trial is scheduled to begin Wednesday
morning in Litchfield Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith was charged after shooting 27-year-old Franklyn Reid once in the back
on Dec. 28, 1998. Reid was wanted on several warrants and fled on foot when
police tried to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Pattis, a New Haven attorney who is not involved in the Smith trial
but has handled other cases involving alleged police misconduct, said he
believes prosecutors may try to show that Smith's footprint was discovered on
Reid's back.
</P>
<P>
	   "That would raise serious questions on whether he was resisting or making a
furtive movement that would justify the officer's use of deadly force," Pattis
told The News-Times of Danbury.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor John Connelly and Smith's attorney, John Kelly, refused to
discuss the report, citing a gag order imposed by the judge.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith has said he believed Reid was reaching for a weapon. But during a
probable cause hearing last year, Connelly presented a witness who reported
seeing a police officer standing over the suspect, using his left hand to hold
the man's wrists behind his back.
</P>
<P>
	   The officer's left foot was on the black man's back and the officer held
what appeared to be a walkie-talkie over the man's head with his right hand, the
witness said
</P>
<P>
	   "That makes absolutely no sense," Kelly said at the time. "My client would
have shot himself in the left foot."
</P>
<P>
	   Reid was found carrying a knife with a 2-inch blade, but prosecutors say the
knife was out of reach in a jacket that had been discarded.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Judge Charles Gill rejected a request by prosecutors to move
the trial out of Litchfield, but criticized police and Smith's supporters for
"rash, and ill-advised and ill-considered" actions, such as rallies at the
courthouse and the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial comes less than a week a Hartford police officer was cleared in a
shooting that claimed the life of a 14-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
	   A special prosecutor declined to bring charges and ruled that Officer Robert
Allan had reason to believe his life was in danger when he shot Aquan Salmon in
the back. Allan had said he believed Salmon was reaching for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Gill has said he expects Smith's trial to continue until the middle of
March.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith is free on bond and has been placed on desk duty by the New Milford
police department.

<HEADLINE> Economists: Fed To Play Bigger Role  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The record-breaking U.S. economy will turn in solid
growth both this year and next but the Federal Reserve will be forced to raise
interest rates more than had been expected to keep inflation at bay, a group of
business economists forecast today.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association for Business Economics predicted in its latest
economic outlook that the gross domestic product, the nation's total economic
output, would slow slightly to 3.8 percent this year, after three straight years
of growth at 4 percent or higher.
</P>
<P>
	   For 2001, the group saw an even more pronounced slowdown with the GDP
expanding by just 3 percent, which would be the slowest annual growth rate since
a 2.7 percent increase in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   The economists said the slowdown will be the work of the Federal Reserve,
which has already raised interest rates four times since June in an effort to
keep inflation from getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
	   While in their last survey in November the business economists had expected
the Fed to raise interest rates only once this year, the group is now
forecasting three. The first came Feb. 2, a quarter-point move that left the
federal funds rate at 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Diane Swonk, president of the business economics group and chief economist
at Bank One in Chicago, said the unrelenting strength of the economy had made
the forecasting panel rethink its view of Fed actions this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the past the panel believed that the economy would eventually slow on
its own, with little intervention from the Fed," she said. "Today, the panel
believes that the Fed will need to tighten to get the economy to slow
measurably."
</P>
<P>
	   The business group's forecast of 3.8 percent GDP growth this year reflected
an upward revision from a November survey which had projected a 3.2 percent
increase. Economists have for the past three years been expecting the economy to
slow only to be surprised by the strength of consumer spending, which accounts
for two-thirds of total economic activity.
</P>
<P>
	   The strength this year will keep the unemployment rate hovering around the
current 40-year low of 4 percent. The group forecast an average jobless rate
this year of 4.1 percent, even better than last year's average of 4.2 percent.
But the slower growth will see the jobless rate start to creep up in 2001,
rising to 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the recent surge in oil prices, inflation was forecast to remain
contained with consumer prices rising by just 2.5 percent this year, compared to
a 2.6 percent increase last year, when measured from the fourth quarter. The CPI
was forecast to be up just 2.6 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The business economists have no recession in their forecast. The current
expansion set a longevity record in February of 107 months, beating the previous
record holder, the 1960s expansion which lasted for 106 months without a
recession.
</P>
<P>
	   Swonk said she believed the current expansion could last at least until 2004
given that price pressures have remained in check.
</P>
<P>
	   The business group pinpointed a sudden plunge in the high-flying stock
market as the greatest threat to the expansion with 20 percent of those surveyed
ranking a "stock market bubble" as the economy's most serious problem, double
the percentage citing this threat last year.

<HEADLINE> Challenge to Electric Chair Rejected  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, voting 5-4 Tuesday, rejected a
challenge to Alabama's use of the electric chair as the only means of execution.
But doubt remained whether three states -- Alabama, Georgia and Nebraska -- can
continue offering no alternative for putting inmates to death.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices turned away an appeal that called death in Alabama's electric
chair a type of ``cruel and unusual punishment'' the Constitution forbids.
</P>
<P>
	   Death row inmate Robert Lee Tarver contended that Alabama's ``antiquated''
electric chair exposes him to a risk of ``excessive burning, disfigurement and
... pain and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the court's brief order denying review to Tarver's appeal does not set
a legal precedent, it does free Alabama officials to set a new execution date
for him.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was unclear whether the court will use some other case to review the
legitimacy of electrocutions -- and whether such review will be granted before
Tarver dies in the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Alabama inmate is scheduled to be electrocuted March 4.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the court is still very concerned about this issue,'' said Bryan
Stevenson, Tarver's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor said he still will urge the state
Legislature to pass a law allowing lethal injection to be used if the Supreme
Court ever does rule that electrocution is unconstitutional. Such a bill is
pending in the Alabama House.
</P>
<P>
	   A bill to make injection the primary means of execution is pending in the
Alabama Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen
G. Breyer voted to hear arguments in Tarver's case, but five votes are needed to
grant such review.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas voted against Tarver.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama officials had urged the nation's highest court to reject his appeal,
saying death in the electric chair is almost painless and instantaneous.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarver was to have been electrocuted earlier this month but the justices
ordered his execution delayed just hours before it was to take place.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama is just one of three states that use the electric chair as their
sole means of execution.
</P>
<P>
	   The Georgia House voted overwhelmingly Monday to phase out electrocution and
execute inmates by injection. Legislators said they feared the Supreme Court
would ban the electric chair. That legislation now goes to the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The court last month canceled its review of Florida's use of the electric
chair after the state Legislature passed new legislation providing for death by
injection as the primary means of execution. Gov. Jeb Bush signed it into law.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court never has found any specific form of execution to be
unconstitutional but Tarver's appeal argued that ``a national consensus has
emerged rejecting'' electrocution. Florida joined Kentucky and Tennessee in
moving away from electrocutions in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-eight states have death penalty laws. Of the 98 death row inmates
executed across the nation in 1999, 94 were killed by injection. Three were
electrocuted and one was killed by cyanide gas.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarver, 52, was convicted of the 1984 robbery and murder of Hugh Kite
outside the bait shop and grocery Kite owned in Cottonton, near the Georgia
line. Prosecutors said Tarver shot Kite several times and stole his wallet.

<HEADLINE> Sex Trade May Be Replacing Narcotics  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With as many as 2 million women worldwide forced into
sexual slavery, the sex trade seems to have replaced narcotics as the favored
illegal trade activity, White House officials told at a Senate hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Harold Koh, assistant Secretary of State for democracy, human rights and
labor, said international criminals are moving away from ``guns and drugs'' to
marketing women.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are weaker restraints and growing demand,'' Koh told the Senate
Foreign Relations subcommittee on Near Eastern and Southern Asian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., who chaired the hearing, spoke of meeting some
women victims during recent travels to Asia and called the trade ``the greatest
manifestation of slavery in the world today.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are told they will be taking a job as a nanny and are given money of
their family. Then they are taken across a border and held against their will,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are only beginning to learn the methods of this industry,'' Brownback
said. ``Two-thirds come back with AIDS or tuberculosis. They basically come back
to die.''
</P>
<P>
	   A woman called Inez and disguised to protect her identity testified that she
was forced into a life of sexual slavery in the United States by traffickers in
her native Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she was duped by men who promised her work at a restaurant but said
she owed them a ``smuggling fee'' of $2,500 that she had to pay off by selling
herself to men.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We worked six days a week and 12-hour days,'' she said. ``We mostly had to
serve 32 to 35 clients a day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement officials raided the brothel and while some of the
traffickers have been prosecuted, some escaped capture and returned to Mexico,
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Solid numbers on the scope of the problem are hard to come by, but best
estimates show at least 50,000 women brought into the United States annually for
forced labor, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakdown of international borders and expansion of trade are among the
factors fueling trafficking, said Teresa Loar, director of the President's
Interagency Council on Women.
</P>
<P>
	   Feeder countries for the slave trade include Ukraine, Albania, the
Philippines, Thailand, Mexico and Nigeria, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank E. Loy, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs, said the Clinton
Administration approach has focused on preventing the trade from getting
established, protection and assistance for victims and prosecution of
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   Loy said the administration has stopped short of pushing for economic
sanctions against offending nations, however, because that would curtail efforts
to build an international effort to combat the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Bills aimed at curbing trafficking have been introduced in the House and
Senate.

<HEADLINE> Court: minimum wage OK for welfare recipients on workfare  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Welfare recipients in New York City are entitled to
only minimum-wage credit for their workfare job assignments instead of the
usually-higher prevailing wages regular workers get, the state's highest court
ruled Tuesday.
<P>
	   In a victory for the Giuliani administration, the Court of Appeals
unanimously said the state has traditionally not recognized that the prevailing
wage, civil service rules and other protections for workers extend to welfare
recipients working for public assistance benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of New York City welfare beneficiaries has been contending for more
than two years that the Giuliani administration was unconstitutionally
shortchanging them by setting their pay scale according to the then-federal
minimum wage level of $4.75 an hour. The minimum wage has since gone up to $5.15
an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the city's Work Experience Program (WEP) - usually referred to
informally as "workfare" - the welfare recipients were put to work by the city's
parks, sanitation and other departments. Some welfare recipients were doing
"skilled" tasks like painting, plastering and electrical work while others did
more mundane tasks like clerical work, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   The welfare recipients contended that their fellow workers at those agencies
were often receiving twice as much or more for the same work. They said that
violated the state constitution's guarantees that employees under public works
contracts be given the "prevailing wage," which is same amount that other
workers in the region get for the same tasks.
</P>
<P>
	   The welfare workers didn't actually get paychecks for their work, but were
rather allowed to continue getting benefits if they put in the required number
of hours on the job each month.
</P>
<P>
	   But the seven Court of Appeals judges Tuesday said it would be illogical to
apply the prevailing wage to workfare situations.
</P>
<P>
	   Workfare participants "simply are not 'in the employ of' anyone" within the
meaning of the state constitution, Judge Joseph Bellacosa wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
	   "That is the very reason they are receiving welfare benefits and are
required to participate in the (workfare) program, until they can find or be
placed in jobs with the customary array of traditional indicia of employment,"
Bellacosa wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also took a dim view of the workers seeking to reduce the hours in
which they would have to participate in workfare jobs if the court ruled in
their favor.
</P>
<P>
	   "The relief sought by this lawsuit - fewer working hours - is not what the
important prevailing wage protection is designed to address," he wrote. "That
provision is New York's proud enforcement of the value of work and the dignity
of earned wages."
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Tuesday that workfare assignments are for 16
hours or 20 hours a week and not "anything near full-time work."
</P>
<P>
	   "WEP workers are not employees," Giuliani said. "They are people who are on
welfare that we're hoping to get off welfare that are working doing transitional
assignments as they try to find permanent assignments."
</P>
<P>
	   There are about 38,000 people on workfare assignments in New York City,
according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Blum, Legal Aid Society lawyer for the workfare clients, was not
immediately available to comment on the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The state AFL-CIO, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the
workfare workers' arguments, criticized Tuesday's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just don't understand, someone goes to work every day, performs their
labor and serves their boss, how can they not be an employee?" union spokesman
Mario Cilento said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's ruling affirmed a decision by the mid-level Appellate Division of
state Supreme Court. A trial court judge had sided with the workers against city
and state welfare officials.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials had argued before the court that by affirming the welfare
recipients' arguments, the judges could be jeopardizing the state's receipt of
some $2.4 billion in federal welfare funds.

<HEADLINE> Service Merchandise Cuts More Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Service Merchandise Company Inc. plans to cut 4,800
additional jobs, reduce store sizes and discontinue some product lines as part
of its ongoing bankruptcy reorganization plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nashville-based company was forced into Chapter 11 last March by a group
of creditors, claiming total debts of $1.29 billion. The company has so far
closed 122 stores and cut 5,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company continues to make good progress in its restructuring efforts,
with 1999 as a year of stabilization for Service Merchandise," chief executive
Sam Cusano said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company began notifying workers Tuesday about the latest job cuts. The
company currently about 16,000 full-time employees at its Nashville offices,
three distribution centers and 221 stores in 32 states.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is reducing the number of products it sells and expanding its
core jewelry business, especially diamonds, and its Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Service Merchandise will spend $150 million of over the next two years to
reduce store sizes and remodel showrooms to include more jewelry display cases
and Internet kiosks for merchandise orders. The company will rent or sell the
surplus store space.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will no longer sell toys, sporting goods, most consumer
electronics and indoor furniture. It will continue to sell housewares, silver,
crystal, small appliances, patio furniture, luggage and clocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're no longer going to try to fix those other businesses," Cusano said.
"What we're saying is, we can't be all things to all people."
</P>
<P>
	   The inventory reduction means the closure of the company's distribution
centers in Orlando, Fla., and Montgomery, N.Y., and a consolidation of inventory
at the Nashville center.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcements were made as Service Merchandise reported its year-end
earnings and a new bank-financing package that will help the company past its
emergence from bankruptcy, likely next year.
</P>
<P>
	   The company expects to get approval of a new four-year, $600 million bank
financing agreement from Fleet Retail Finance Inc., replacing a previous
financing agreement. It intends to use the funds to pay for its store
renovations and other improvements, operating expenses and general working
capital once the company emerges from Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Service Merchandise reported a net loss of $243.7 million, or a loss of
$2.45 a share, for the year ending Jan. 2. Net sales for the period were $2.23
billion. For the prior year, the company reported a net loss of $110.3 million,
or a loss of $1.11 a share, on net sales of $3.17 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter earnings were $68.3 million compared to $49.1 million for the
same period last year. Operating earnings were $25.2 million for the year ending
Jan. 2.

	   HIDDEN TRAVEL COSTS: Buying travel tickets online, which has been touted as
a great way to get cheap fares, can cost more than you think. A study by
Consumer Reports magazine found 12 big online travel providers charge fees that
can add as much as 85 percent to the advertised price of your ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half the sites polled charged from $4 to $30 to book and mail
paper tickets rather than issuing electronic tickets, which often involve no
more than a reference number being issued to a traveler. Most discounters won't
mail paper tickets without charging a fee.
</P>
<P>
	   Once you have a ticket, changing your itinerary could cost you more than the
ticket itself. While airlines tend to charge a $75 penalty for altering travel
arrangements, some online sites charge double or even five times that amount, up
to $375.

	   Record high sales prices drove the average apartment price up 19 percent in
1999, the largest percentage gain in 11 years, according to the Corcoran Group,
a real estate firm. The average two-bedroom apartment sold for $665,000 -- what
people in many parts of the country would pay for a very large house on a big
plot of land. The biggest apartments, those with four or more bedrooms, averaged
$4.5 million.

	   SOUNDING SMART: A formula called the "Four P's" can help you sound smart at
office meetings and further your career, says Alberto Paz, president of Robert
A. Becker Inc., a marketing firm based in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The first P is for purpose -- always know the reason why a meeting is being
held, so you can plan for it. The second is for participants. If you know who
will be at the meeting, you'll be better able to define your role at the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   Third is the P for prepare -- know what is expected of you at the meeting,
and be sure to have with you the information you'll be asked for. And fourth is
the P for participate: "You don't necessarily have to come up with the most
brilliant solution to the problem being discussed," Paz said, but if you don't
take part, your bosses and co-workers will think you have no ideas..
</P>
<P>
	   Paz said executives often underestimate the importance of business meetings.
That can ruin their careers down the road.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Cribs Found To Be Unsafe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eight of every 10 cribs inspected at a national sampling
of motels and hotels were unsafe, the chairwoman of the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Spot checks in 90 hotels in 27 states and the District of Columbia found
loose hardware, unsecured mattress supports, dangerously soft bedding and
too-large adult-sized sheets, all of which can cause death by strangulation or
suffocation, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ann Brown, the safety commission head, said she had urged the nation's
hotels to join in what she called a ``pre-emptive strike'' to assure the safety
of their youngest guests.
</P>
<P>
	   And she expressed extreme disappointment that only one hotel group has
chosen to take part, Bass Hotels and Resorts. It operates Holiday Inn,
Inter-Continental and Crowne Plaza Hotels.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for the industry trade association, the American Hotel &AMP; Motel
Association, did not immediately return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown said that while 40 infants die in crib-related accidents each year,
none of the incidents has been specifically linked to hotels or motels.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said the spot inspections performed by the National SAFE Kids
Campaign, which identified safety hazards in 82 percent of all inspected hotel
cribs, shows the potential for tragedy exists.
</P>
<P>
	   Heather Paul, executive director of the SAFE Kids Campaign, said the new
warning ``simply raises a red flag for the hotel industry that they might be
putting babies at risk.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want hotels to know there are simple steps they can take to help ensure
a safe sleeping environment for their youngest guests,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We should not have to wait for a front-page story of a baby dying in a
(hotel) crib for action to take place,'' she said. ``We shouldn't have to wait
for a body count.''
</P>
<P>
	   Brown said the inspection also discovered that more than half of all
portable play yards and playpens provided by hotel management also had at least
one safety hazard, including holes or tears in the meshing large enough to trap
and strangle babies.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission said it recommends that babies be placed on their backs for
sleep with no soft bedding, which it said can lead to suffocation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether the hotel is on Fifth Avenue or Main Street, there's no guarantee
the cribs you request will be safe and in good repair,'' Brown said. ``Parents
who are traveling should not have to worry about the place they put their child
down to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
	   The safety commission cited estimates it said show that children under 2
years old spend 7 million nights a year at the estimated 65,000 hotels and
motels in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The Consumer Product Safety Commission hotline, which has crib-safety and
recall information, is 1-800-638-2772.

	   German Computer Fair Goes Mobile
</P>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Mobile communications will take center
stage when the world's biggest computer and technology convention
starts Thursday in Hanover. Nearly 8,000 companies will show off
the latest gadgets, coolest computers and hot-selling software.
``This year, going mobile is hot -- making things cheaper and
smaller -- especially being able to communicate with the Internet
from handheld devices,'' said Monika Brandt, spokeswoman for the
CeBit 2000 fair. Hundreds of companies will be showcasing mobile
technologies ranging from handheld computers to satellites. Part of
the new push is toward machines that communicate with each other,
such as parking meters or vending machines that radio in when they

	   SEC Sues Two Day-Trading Firms
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators today sued two day-trading
firms and nine people for allegedly making loans to trader
customers that exceeded legal limits. One firm, Investment Street
Co., and two of its executives agreed in a settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to pay fines; the other,
All-Tech Direct Inc., is disputing the charges. The SEC alleged, in
separate lawsuits filed in federal court, that Investment Street
and All-Tech violated federal margin lending rules. Investors buy
stocks on margin by borrowing part of the purchase price from their
brokerage firm or day-trading firm and putting up the securities as
collateral for the loan.

competitors and potential rivals. Government lawyers repeatedly
cited findings late last year by U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson that Microsoft had abused its monopoly power and
hurt consumers, and they repeated a list of complaints they lodged
against the software giant during a lengthy trial. Today's final

<HEADLINE> Court Questions Hubbell Prosecution  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Supreme Court justices today questioned the
prosecution of presidential friend Webster Hubbell using documents he was forced
to provide under a limited grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Did the government know about the contents of the documents beforehand?''
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked Whitewater prosecutors' lawyer, Ronald J.
Mann. ``It was only by virtue of the production of the documents that you
learned the facts that enabled you to carry out the prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested that ``the immunity that you gave him
immunized nothing. If that was the case, wasn't there a certain deception
involved?''
</P>
<P>
	   Hubbell pleaded guilty last year to a misdemeanor tax charge based partly on
financial papers he was required to give Whitewater prosecutors under limited
immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   Mann argued for new Independent Counsel Robert W. Ray, who took over the job
from Kenneth Starr last October.
</P>
<P>
	   Mann asked the justices to preserve Hubbell's guilty plea. Although
Hubbell's act of producing the documents was protected by immunity, Mann argued,
prosecutors still could use the contents of the documents against him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is a terrible kind of immunity,'' countered Hubbell's lawyer, John W.
Nields Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   The Constitution's Fifth Amendment protects people from having to testify
against themselves. Nields contends that turning over the documents amounted to
a statement that Hubbell possessed the papers, and the immunity he was granted
should guard against that statement being used against him.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said, ``Virtually everyone has
tax records and accounting records. It is no confession to say those records
exist.''
</P>
<P>
	   A lower court ruled largely against prosecutors and set a standard that
likely would have barred use of the documents. Hubbell pleaded guilty to the tax
charge last June, but only on condition that his plea would be dismissed if the
Supreme Court upheld the lower court ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Therefore, Hubbell's plea will remain in place only if the justices rule for
the prosecutors. A decision is expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   Several justices questioned how turning over documents differs from being
forced to provide blood or handwriting samples or stand in a police lineup --
all of which can be required.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Stephen G. Breyer said the legal standard sought by Nields could
``work a revolution'' on self-incrimination and immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubbell was the No. 3 official at the Justice Department early in President
Clinton's first term and has been a friend of the president and Hillary Rodham
Clinton since their Arkansas days.
</P>
<P>
	   The misdemeanor tax charge alleged that Hubbell evaded paying taxes on some
of the hundreds of thousands of dollars he received from friends of the Clintons
in 1994 when he was being investigated by Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said
prosecutors could use the documents against Hubbell only by showing they
previously had ``reasonably particular knowledge'' of their existence.
</P>
<P>
	   Not affected by Tuesday's case is Hubbell's guilty plea last June to a
felony charge involving legal work for a savings and loan at the center of the
investigation known as Whitewater, which involved the real estate dealings of
Clinton and his wife during the 1980s. Hubbell was sentenced to a year of
probation.

<HEADLINE> Challenge to Electric Chair Rejected  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, voting 5-4 Tuesday, rejected a
challenge to Alabama's use of the electric chair as the only means of execution.
But doubt remained whether three states -- Alabama, Georgia and Nebraska -- can
continue offering no alternative for putting inmates to death.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices turned away an appeal that called death in Alabama's electric
chair a type of ``cruel and unusual punishment'' the Constitution forbids.
</P>
<P>
	   Death row inmate Robert Lee Tarver contended that Alabama's ``antiquated''
electric chair exposes him to a risk of ``excessive burning, disfigurement and
... pain and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the court's brief order denying review to Tarver's appeal does not set
a legal precedent, it does free Alabama officials to set a new execution date
for him.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was unclear whether the court will use some other case to review the
legitimacy of electrocutions -- and whether such review will be granted before
Tarver dies in the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Alabama inmate is scheduled to be electrocuted March 3.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the court is still very concerned about this issue,'' said Bryan
Stevenson, Tarver's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor said he still will urge the state
Legislature to pass a law allowing lethal injection to be used if the Supreme
Court ever does rule that electrocution is unconstitutional. Such a bill is
pending in the Alabama House.
</P>
<P>
	   A bill to make injection the primary means of execution is pending in the
Alabama Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen
G. Breyer voted to hear arguments in Tarver's case, but five votes are needed to
grant such review.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas voted against Tarver.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama officials had urged the nation's highest court to reject his appeal,
saying death in the electric chair is almost painless and instantaneous.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarver was to have been electrocuted earlier this month but the justices
ordered his execution delayed just hours before it was to take place.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama is just one of three states that use the electric chair as their
sole means of execution.
</P>
<P>
	   The Georgia House voted overwhelmingly Monday to phase out electrocution and
execute inmates by injection. Legislators said they feared the Supreme Court
would ban the electric chair. That legislation now goes to the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The court last month canceled its review of Florida's use of the electric
chair after the state Legislature passed new legislation providing for death by
injection as the primary means of execution. Gov. Jeb Bush signed it into law.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court never has found any specific form of execution to be
unconstitutional but Tarver's appeal argued that ``a national consensus has
emerged rejecting'' electrocution. Florida joined Kentucky and Tennessee in
moving away from electrocutions in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-eight states have death penalty laws. Of the 98 death row inmates
executed across the nation in 1999, 94 were killed by injection. Three were
electrocuted and one was killed by cyanide gas.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarver, 52, was convicted of the 1984 robbery and murder of Hugh Kite
outside the bait shop and grocery Kite owned in Cottonton, near the Georgia
line. Prosecutors said Tarver shot Kite several times and stole his wallet.

	   The Supreme Court took these actions Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
	   --Agreed to decide next year whether police can set up random traffic
checkpoints and stop motorists to search for illegal drugs. At issue in the case
from Indianapolis is the scope of the privacy Americans enjoy when in their

</P>
<P>

crime family in New York City. He was convicted in 1992 for 14 murders and other
crimes.

only to see their victory thrown out on appeal because of improper expert
testimony are not always entitled to a new trial to prove their case.

<HEADLINE> Advocates defend dredge-and-dump plan before congressional panel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) - Supporters of a plan to dump contaminated New
York Harbor sediment off the New Jersey coast traveled to unfriendly territory
Tuesday, defending the plan before a congressional subcommittee.
<P>
	   In the third of a series of hearings on the plan, representatives of the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and a
coalition of pro-dumping businesses testified before the House Subcommittee on
Fisheries Conservation, Wildlife and Oceans.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not chemical or medical waste. This is dirt, " said Sam Crane,
coordinator of Nation's Port, a coalition of business and labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The Corps of Engineers has granted permits that will allow mud to be dredged
from Brooklyn Marine Terminal and Castle Astoria Terminals and deposited in the
underwater dump. Some of the Brooklyn Marine dumping has occurred already;
Castle Astoria's has not begun yet.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan faces a chorus of opposition in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmental advocates, political leaders, recreational fishermen and
others say it violates the letter and spirit of a 1996 agreement to close the
so-called Mud Dump, an underwater depository located about six miles off the
coast of Sandy Hook.
</P>
<P>
	   They say the dumping would turn back the clock on efforts to clean the
ocean, jeopardizing the state's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Only clean material, as defined by the government, can be dumped at the site
as a means to cover toxic materials already in the dump, now known officially as
the Historic Area Remediation Site.
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers say the dredged sediment - which contains mercury, arsenic, zinc and
other heavy metals - is clean enough to serve as a cap on the material already
in the underwater dump, which closed Sept. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan was the subject of a raucous Jan. 24 hearing at Fort Monmouth in
which members of the International Association of Longshoremen shouted down
opponents as they tried to speak and a Feb. 12 hearing in Long Branch that was
attended almost entirely by the opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   Venturing into the lion's den Tuesday, Crane and the two government
officials faced U.S. Reps. Frank LoBiondo, Chris Smith, James Saxton and Frank
Pallone - all of whom oppose the dumping - while a standing-room-only crowd of
about 300 looked on in the Dover Township Municipal Building hearing room.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd broke into applause twice as Saxton grilled Deputy Regional
Administrator William Muszynski of the EPA and Corps of Engineers environmental
scientist Robert Engler about the government's criteria for determining the
sediment to be "clean."
</P>
<P>
	   "You would permit, under your regulations, significantly increased levels of
contaminants? That obviously flies in the face of what we're all here trying to
protect," said Saxton, R-Mount Holly.
</P>
<P>
	   Muszynski acknowledged that the EPA had failed to establish a new set of
remediation standards to evaluate the material proposed for dumping, as the
government was supposed to do under the 1996 agreement. He said the EPA is
re-evaluating the scientific basis at the heart of its existing standards, which
were developed sometime in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Engler said the Corps of Engineers does not believe that the sediment will
cause "acute toxicity" in the dump area and said there is no evidence the
contamination would move up the food chain to humans.
</P>
<P>
	   Crane called the dredge-and-dump plan the least expensive, most practical
method of deepening New York harbor and completing the remediation needed at the
underwater dump.
</P>
<P>
	   Failure to dredge the harbor will result in cargo ships being diverted to
other ports, costing the New York area jobs, Crane said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Saxton said New Jersey has plenty to lose, too. The pollution is one
thing, he said. The perception can be even worse, as New Jersey shore towns
learned in the 1980s, when medical waste and hypodermic needles washed up on
beaches, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to see (summer rental) leases canceled. We're going to see our
economy go down the tubes," Saxton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Tuesday, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey called on the
Corps and the EPA to hold meetings to "clarify the facts" underlying the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the agencies, Port Authority Commerce Director Lillian
Borrone said the meetings should include elected officials and representatives
of federal and state agencies, business, labor and environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a lack of agreement on some basic facts: What are the current
federal standards for determining whether sediments are clean? Have they been
changed in the past three years? What is the status of an EPA review of those
standards? We need to foster a common understanding of these basic facts in
order to resolve the dispute," Borrone said.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed on Wall Street today as investors, while
searching for bargain stocks, were dogged by worries about interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, reversing a three-day losing streak, was
up 39.09 at 10,258.61 in afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index, however, was unable to shake
off concerns about interest rates and was down 50.77 at 4,360.97. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 2.63 at 1,348.72.
</P>
<P>
	   "The average investor is looking for the opportunity to step in here, but
with the pressure that's been created by the Federal Reserve, this could drag on
for a while," Bob Dickey, managing director of technical analysis at Dain
Rauscher Wessels.
</P>
<P>
	   In the morning, William McDonough, president of the New York Federal
Reserve, reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely raise
interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very clear that we will have to use the interest rate tool as long as
the demand side of the economy stays this robust," he said in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   His comments echoed testimony last week from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan,
who suggested more rate increases may be needed to cool the economy and keep
inflation under control. On Friday, the Dow fell 295 points and the Nasdaq lost
137 points as investors were unnerved by the prospect of higher rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Markets were closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday, and today
investors traded cautiously. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 756.77
million shares down from the 827.93 million the same time Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues by a 5-to-8 margin on the
NYSE.
</P>
<P>
	   The computer industry was one of the weaker sectors today as investor
started to fret about proftis in the coming months. Intel, the chip maker, saw
its shares slip 1 5/16 to 104 1/16, and Cisco's shares fell 2 to 123 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The exception, however, was Texas Instruments, which unveiled two new
processors. The company's stock shot up 8 13/16 to 143 11/16.
</P>
<P>
	   In other news, SBC Communications, a regional telephone company, announced
it would spend $3.9 billion in cash to acquire Sterling Commerce Inc., a
provider of Internet integration software. SBC's shares dipped 5/8 to 35 13/16,
while Sterling's shares soared 11 15/16 to 43 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   A second telecom deal: Global Crossing Ltd., a long-distance phone company,
said it would pay $3.8 billion for IXNet, an Internet networking company. Global
Crossing's stock fell 4 13/16 to 47 13/16, while IXNet's shares rose 2 1/8 to 54
5/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Nextel Communications, a wireless phone company, reported a
lower-than-expected loss in its most recent quarter, and said it would split its
stock 2-for-1. Nextel's shares jumped 9 7/16 to 128 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks was down

<HEADLINE> Lufthansa Grounds 26 Boeing Jets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Germany's Lufthansa airline briefly grounded 26
Boeing 747-400 long-haul aircraft for safety inspections and repairs Tuesday
after discovering cracks in lines that carry firefighting agents to the turbine
engines.
</P>
<P>
	   Lines had to be replaced on eight of the 747-400 models, and all the jets
later were returned to service, Deutsche Lufthansa AG spokeswoman Sigrid Baeumer
said Tuesday evening. A precautionary inspection of six Boeing 747-200s owned by
Lufthansa uncovered no problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cracked lines were discovered early in the day during routine
maintenance of one of the 747-400s, and Lufthansa decided to ground all the
aircraft until they were inspected and their copper lines replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Baeumer said it was the first time the airline had such a problem with the
copper tubing, which is commonly used in aeronautics.
</P>
<P>
	   The grounding forced cancellation of a flight to Tokyo, and passengers were
sent on a later flight from Frankfurt. All but five of the airline's 747-400s
were in Germany; the others were based in Bangkok, Thailand; Buenos Aires,
Argentina; Capetown, South Africa; Manila, Philippines; and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
	   Lufthansa said it immediately informed Boeing Co. of the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Franzjosef Darius, a spokesman for Boeing in Hamburg, said his company was
grateful for Lufthansa's quick reaction.
</P>
<P>
	   Darius said he was unaware of other airlines reporting similar problems,
adding that fires in the turbine engines were rare but that the lines in
question were critical to dousing any blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   In Seattle, Boeing spokeswoman Debbie Nomaguchi said the company issued a
service bulletin for the same fire-extinguisher tubing in 1995, advising
airlines flying 747-400s to replace it because of problems similar to those
reported by Lufthansa.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are still working to determine if this is an isolated case or if it's
fleet-wide," affecting all 747-400s, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lufthansa spokeswoman Karin Weber said the airline replaced the tubing in
1995 with new Boeing parts, but that the problem was with the new tubing.
</P>
<P>
	   "Boeing is in process of sending out an all-operator message" to advise its
747 customers that Lufthansa found cracked tubes in several planes, said company
spokesman Gary Lesser in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing customers are being asked to advise the company if they have found
any similar problems while inspecting their aircraft, he said, though customers
are not being asked to conduct such inspections.
</P>
<P>
	   But Boeing 747 customers with GE engines -- the kind used in the Lufthansa
planes -- whose aircraft are undergoing heavy maintenance are being asked to
check the lines, Lesser said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 747-400 is a bigger, longer-range version of Boeing's 747, with a
capacity of 416 to 524 passengers and a range of about 8,400 miles. First flown
in 1989, the 747-400 family includes four models.
</P>
<P>
	   The 747-200, depending on variable seating arrangement, carries between 300
and 368 passengers.

<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Continued strong buying by home fixer-uppers spurred a 38
percent rise in fourth-quarter earnings at The Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the three months ending Dec. 31 were $578 million, or 25
cents per share, compared with $418 million or 18 cents per share for the same
period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The results announced Tuesday surpassed by a penny the expectations of
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thompson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   In late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Home Depot shares
were down 12 1/2 cents at $53.62 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Home Depot said warm weather in November helped extend the building season
in many areas. Also, sales of flooring and kitchen and bath materials were
higher than average, company spokesman Jerry Shields said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $9.2 billion, up 26 percent from the $7.2 billion
Home Depot posted in the year-ago period.

percent from $1.6 billion or 71 cents per share in 1998. Sales for 1999 were
$38.4 billion, 27 percent higher than for 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Stand on Taiwan Worries U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration expressed deep concern Tuesday
over a warning by China that it could use force if Taiwan delays indefinitely
reunification talks with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. diplomats relayed the administration's concerns to Chinese authorities
in Beijing and Washington just a day after China issued the threat in an
11,000-page position paper.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart rejected the Chinese
threat and recalled that the United States sent two aircraft carriers and other
warships to the region to calm a crisis four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We reject any use of force or any threat of force in this situation,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that peaceful dialogue and bilateral engagement between the
sides is the way to move forward,'' he said. ``We have repeated, I think, in
both actions and words that we view any threat to Taiwan with grave concern.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the State Department, spokesman James P. Rubin described as a new
formulation China's threat to use force if there is an indefinite delay in
reunification talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We find the formulation troubling; we don't find it particularly
helpful,'' he said. At the same time, he said it would be a mistake to
exaggerate the significance of the Chinese statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had much worse periods on this question in the past,'' he said. He
added that the administration is not considering any change in its opposition to
legislation before Congress to strengthen U.S.-Taiwanese military relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said military ties with Taiwan, authorized under the Taiwan Relations
Act, has enabled the United States to be ``second-to-none'' in its support of
the anti-communist bastion. He said that arrangement has served U.S. interests
extremely well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that support has made a difference as recently as 1996. And so
nobody should doubt our willingness to act in our own national interest,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, China fired nuclear-capable missiles near Taiwan's two largest
ports, prompting the United States to send two aircraft carriers and other
warships to the region.
</P>
<P>
	   China's muscle-flexing at the time was related to the impending presidential
elections at the time. And the new threat from Beijing appeared aimed at
influencing presidential elections on Taiwan set for next month. Analysts said
China seems intent on discouraging support for the candidate most identified
with the pro-independence sector on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart recalled that in 1996, ``we responded appropriately to what was
viewed as a threat. And that should give you some indication of how we view this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lin Chong-pin, Taiwan's vice chairman of a council that handles Taiwan's
China policy, would not directly address the new threat but said tensions would
not ease as long as Beijing refuses to acknowledge that China is split and each
side is controlled by a separate government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until we unify, both sides of course will have different views about what
'one China' means,'' Lin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest flare-up comes amid President Clinton's drive to win
congressional approval of permanent trading benefits for China, part of a
trade-opening deal to admit Beijing into the World Trade Organization, which
sets the rules for global trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the deal are likely to seize on the new Chinese stand in hopes
of blocking the trade package. But Lockhart insisted that it should not affect
the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The agreement is very much in our country's interest and our national
interest,'' he said. ``This is a one-sided agreement benefiting American
business, American workers, American families. We should move forward on that
basis.''

<HEADLINE> Service Merchandise Cuts More Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Service Merchandise Company Inc. plans to cut 4,800
additional jobs, reduce store sizes and discontinue some product lines as part
of its ongoing bankruptcy reorganization plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nashville-based company was forced into Chapter 11 last March by a group
of creditors, claiming total debts of $1.29 billion. The company has so far
closed 122 stores and cut 5,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company continues to make good progress in its restructuring efforts,
with 1999 as a year of stabilization for Service Merchandise," chief executive
Sam Cusano said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company began notifying workers Tuesday about the latest job cuts. The
company currently about 16,000 full-time employees at its Nashville offices,
three distribution centers and 221 stores in 32 states.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is reducing the number of products it sells and expanding its
core jewelry business, especially diamonds, and its Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Service Merchandise will spend $150 million of over the next two years to
reduce store sizes and remodel showrooms to include more jewelry display cases
and Internet kiosks for merchandise orders. The company will rent or sell the
surplus store space.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will no longer sell toys, sporting goods, most consumer
electronics and indoor furniture. It will continue to sell housewares, silver,
crystal, small appliances, patio furniture, luggage and clocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're no longer going to try to fix those other businesses," Cusano said.
"What we're saying is, we can't be all things to all people."
</P>
<P>
	   The inventory reduction means the closure of the company's distribution
centers in Orlando, Fla., and Montgomery, N.Y., and a consolidation of inventory
at the Nashville center.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcements were made as Service Merchandise reported its year-end
earnings and a new bank-financing package that will help the company past its
emergence from bankruptcy, likely next year.
</P>
<P>
	   The company expects to get approval of a new four-year, $600 million bank
financing agreement from Fleet Retail Finance Inc., replacing a previous
financing agreement. It intends to use the funds to pay for its store
renovations and other improvements, operating expenses and general working
capital once the company emerges from Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Service Merchandise reported a net loss of $243.7 million, or a loss of
$2.45 a share, for the year ending Jan. 2. Net sales for the period were $2.23
billion. For the prior year, the company reported a net loss of $110.3 million,
or a loss of $1.11 a share, on net sales of $3.17 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter earnings were $68.3 million compared to $49.1 million for the
same period last year. Operating earnings were $25.2 million for the year ending
Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Service Merchandise also confirmed it plans to cancel all existing common
stock and will not issue new shares to current shareholders in the reorganized
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares recently trading over the counter were valued at about 14 cents.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Burundi Peace  </HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG NELSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- In his first-ever foray into video diplomacy,
President Clinton urged Burundi's leaders Tuesday to ``accept the risks of
peacemaking'' and reach a peace settlement before violence ruins their chances
for future prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech beamed via satellite to negotiators in Tanzania, Clinton said
the United States supported efforts to resolve the civil war in the neighboring
African country of Burundi, where fighting between Hutu rebels and the
Tutsi-dominated army has killed more than 200,000 people and uprooted more than
1.2 million since 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   ``America cares about the peace process there and America wants all the
parties to succeed,'' Clinton said, his image glowing from four 33-inch
television screens arrayed across the floor of a conference hall in the northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha. Clinton's aides said it was the first time the White
House had engaged in video diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Flanked by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and national security
adviser Sandy Berger, Clinton spoke at the invitation of former South African
President Nelson Mandela, who took over last month as mediator of the
20-month-old talks. The talks stalled in August after the previous mediator,
former President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, became too ill to continue. He died
of leukemia in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's appearance was part of Mandela's campaign to turn the glare of
international attention on the seemingly intractable problems of Burundi, a
country of 6.2 million people the size of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, six African heads of state converged on Arusha to hear Mandela's
assessment of the progress of the talks, which are aimed at reconciling the
often deadly differences that have divided the Hutu majority and the minority
Tutsi, who dominate the country's government, military and economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous glimmers of progress have often ended tragically. The first
democratically elected president, a Hutu, was assassinated by Tutsi paratroopers
seven years ago, ushering in the current era of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton promised that the United States would do ``all it can'' to help the
negotiations succeed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the great peacemakers find a way to let their hurts and grievances
go,'' Clinton told the representatives of 18 Burundian political, government and
civic groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Those grievances spilled across the conference hall earlier Tuesday, as one
by one, the negotiators recited the familiar litany of offenses they have
suffered at the hands of their enemies sitting nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela grew impatient and finally erupted in a bitter denunciation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is what leads the people, even the donors, to say we're wasting our
money. We are dealing with a leadership that does not really care for the people
of Burundi who are being slaughtered ... There is no appreciation of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union and the United States have donated more than $8.2 million
to stage the talks. A confidential report prepared for the French government
last year said negotiators, who are paid a $100 a day, had no incentive to
quickly reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   By day's end, the champion of the anti-apartheid struggle, who spent 27
years in a South African jail cell, had cooled. He congratulated Gaetan
Nikobamye, leader of the miniscule Liberal Party, for announcing his eagerness
to consider draft peace proposals. He also reiterated his intention to meet with
representatives of the two main Hutu rebel groups, who so far have not
participated in the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Mandela's aides, agreement remains to be reached on the thorny
issues of integrating Hutu rebels into the armed forces, election ground rules
and amnesty for human rights violators.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the leaders at the peace conference were presidents Pierre Buyoya of
Burundi, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Joaquim Chissano
of Mozambique, Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
	   For all the talk on Tuesday of knotty international problems, there was
still time for references to U.S. domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after the presidential seal of the United States appeared on the
television screen, followed by Clinton himself, Mandela asked Clinton to convey
his greetings to his family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tell Hillary we wish her all the luck,'' Mandela said, referring to the
first lady's campaign for a U.S. Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You'd be proud of her,'' Clinton remarked, even though she ``is not as
good as you are'' at getting out votes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But almost,'' the president quickly added.

<HEADLINE> Court: minimum wage OK for welfare recipients on workfare  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Welfare recipients in New York City are entitled to
only minimum-wage credit for their workfare job assignments instead of the
usually-higher prevailing wages regular workers get, the state's highest court
ruled Tuesday.
<P>
	   In a victory for the Giuliani administration, the Court of Appeals
unanimously said the state has traditionally not recognized that the prevailing
wage, civil service rules and other protections for workers extend to welfare
recipients working for public assistance benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of New York City welfare beneficiaries has been contending for more
than two years that the Giuliani administration was unconstitutionally
shortchanging them by setting their pay scale according to the then-federal
minimum wage level of $4.75 an hour. The minimum wage has since gone up to $5.15
an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the city's Work Experience Program (WEP) - usually referred to
informally as "workfare" - the welfare recipients were put to work by the city's
parks, sanitation and other departments. Some welfare recipients were doing
"skilled" tasks like painting, plastering and electrical work while others did
more mundane tasks like clerical work, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   The welfare recipients contended that their fellow workers at those agencies
were often receiving twice as much or more for the same work. They said that
violated the state constitution's guarantees that employees under public works
contracts be given the "prevailing wage," which is same amount that other
workers in the region get for the same tasks.
</P>
<P>
	   The welfare workers didn't actually get paychecks for their work, but were
rather allowed to continue getting benefits if they put in the required number
of hours on the job each month.
</P>
<P>
	   But the seven Court of Appeals judges Tuesday said it would be illogical to
apply the prevailing wage to workfare situations.
</P>
<P>
	   Workfare participants "simply are not 'in the employ of' anyone" within the
meaning of the state constitution, Judge Joseph Bellacosa wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
	   "That is the very reason they are receiving welfare benefits and are
required to participate in the (workfare) program, until they can find or be
placed in jobs with the customary array of traditional indicia of employment,"
Bellacosa wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also took a dim view of the workers seeking to reduce the hours in
which they would have to participate in workfare jobs if the court ruled in
their favor.
</P>
<P>
	   "The relief sought by this lawsuit - fewer working hours - is not what the
important prevailing wage protection is designed to address," he wrote. "That
provision is New York's proud enforcement of the value of work and the dignity
of earned wages."
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Tuesday that workfare assignments are for 16
hours or 20 hours a week and not "anything near full-time work."
</P>
<P>
	   "WEP workers are not employees," Giuliani said. "They are people who are on
welfare that we're hoping to get off welfare that are working doing transitional
assignments as they try to find permanent assignments."
</P>
<P>
	   There are about 38,000 people on workfare assignments in New York City,
according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Blum, Legal Aid Society lawyer for the workfare clients, said he was
disappointed by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's most unfortunate about it is it means the city will continue to
operate a two-tier labor force in which an entire class of workers who are
providing very valuable services to the public will not have their labor
adequately valued or respected," Blum said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Blum noted that Bellacosa took pains to note that the judges Tuesday
were only considering the challenge to the constitutionality of not paying the
welfare workers prevailing wage. There could be other grounds under state law to
mount further court fights, Blum said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state AFL-CIO, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the
workfare workers' arguments, criticized Tuesday's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just don't understand, someone goes to work every day, performs their
labor and serves their boss, how can they not be an employee?" union spokesman
Mario Cilento said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's ruling affirmed a decision by the mid-level Appellate Division of
state Supreme Court. A trial court judge had sided with the workers against city
and state welfare officials.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials had argued before the court that by affirming the welfare
recipients' arguments, the judges could be jeopardizing the state's receipt of
some $2.4 billion in federal welfare funds.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down on Weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Wet weather forecasts for Midwestern growing regions sent
corn prices to a two-week low Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Other
grains and soybeans also retreated.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn sank on the outlook for precipitation every day this week in the
Midwest. But trading was quiet and the downside was limited in what remains a
bull market for corn.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat, too, was pressured by soggy weather forecasts, dipping on
expectations that much of the U.S. winter wheat belt will get needed moisture
this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans fell late in the session after initially surging higher in
carryover momentum from Friday's rally. A report that the Brazilian government
will exceed market estimates when it releases its crop estimate on Thursday was
bearish on the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.62 1/4 a bushel; March corn
fell 1 1/4 cent to $2.19 1/4 a bushel; May oats were unchanged at $1.15 1/4 a
bushel; March soybeans fell 1 1/2 cent to $5.13 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork
futures advanced.
</P>
<P>
	   April live cattle fell 1.03 cent to 69.87 cents a pound; March feeder cattle
fell .80 cent to 82.30 cents a pound; April lean hogs rose .43 cent to 57.65
cents a pound; March frozen pork bellies rose 1.95 cent to 90.40 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Mine Agency Suspended  </HEADLINE>
   By KER MUNTHIT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Cambodia's scandal-plagued mine-clearance
agency said Tuesday that it would suspend operations due to a lack of funds,
potentially crippling the country's efforts to rid itself of millions of land
mines.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cambodian Mine Action Center will stop work Friday and remain closed for
a month or two while it waits for foreign donors to contribute more money,
Director-General Khem Sophoan told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have ordered staff to return equipment to their camps and warehouses,''
he said. ``About 2,000 staff will be laid off. When we close the doors, it will
be a big loss.''
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 10 million mines were left buried in Cambodia after almost
three decades of civil war. Intensive surveying and clearance by several
organizations since 1991 have seen that estimate reduced to 4 million to 6
million mines.
</P>
<P>
	   The government-run agency has been responsible for nearly two-thirds of
professional mine clearance since U.N. peacekeepers left Cambodia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   The center was hailed internationally as a model for other war-scarred
nations attempting to clear land for poor citizens displaced by conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   But it became mired in scandal last year when it was revealed that more than
$1 million in donor money was spent on land in southwestern Cambodia that was
then turned over to government officials, wealthy businessmen and army generals.
</P>
<P>
	   Donor nations that provide about $12 million annually to the center were
angered by the scandal and suspended funding for several months.
</P>
<P>
	   A host of financial reforms and the firing of several top staffers appeared
to have operations back on track in December, but Khem Sophoan said the center
was quickly running out of money.
</P>
<P>
	   The center has only $200,000 left, and needs $800,000 more to cover normal
operational costs through the end of March, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   One clearance unit in the tourist destination of Siem Reap will remain
working through the shutdown because it receives separate funding through the
German government, the director-general said.
</P>
<P>
	   A few private mine-clearance agencies -- including the Mine Advisory Group
and HALO Trust -- also will not be affected.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Accused of Massacre  </HEADLINE>
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian troops rampaged through a suburb of the Chechen
capital, killing at least 62 civilians in what could be the worst such massacre
in the Chechen war, an international human rights group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews with survivors revealed that about 100 soldiers systematically
robbed and killed civilians in the Grozny suburb of Aldi on Feb. 5-6, according
to Human Rights Watch, a New York-based organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials have vehemently denied that federal troops took part in
any atrocities against civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   But the group cited survivors as saying the Russian troops also committed
several rapes and hurled grenades into basements where residents were trying to
hide. The reported rampage came a few days after most rebels fled the city, and
Russian troops were moving to flush out the holdouts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are absolutely shocked by this evidence,'' said Malcolm Hawkes, a Human
Rights Watch spokesman. ``It's the worst case documented so far.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkes said Human Rights Watch had ``convincing evidence'' of 82 deliberate
murders in Aldi, of which 62 have been documented. He said the group would
release the list of victims and full details later this week after it checks the
remaining 20 cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Vladimir Kalamanov, appointed last week by acting President Vladimir Putin
as human rights commissioner for Chechnya, promised Tuesday to check all
allegations that civilians were being murdered, but he refrained from discussing
specific cases before making a trip to the region.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the authorities abused their position, they must be punished,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, he said he would also see that the soldiers' rights
weren't violated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important to protect civilians, but we must also protect the rights
of soldiers and officials,'' Kalamanov said. ``I can't refuse my protection to
the representatives of the federal authorities.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reported massacre in Aldi was the third mass killing of civilians that
Human Rights Watch claims to have documented. The previous killings were an
alleged massacre of some 40 civilians in the village of Alkhan-Yurt in early
December and an ensuing rampage in Grozny's Staropromyslovsky region in which 41
people died.
</P>
<P>
	   The report of the latter violence came in early February, and the government
hotly denied it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While they were busy denying reports about killings in Staropromyslovsky,
an even worse massacre was occurring,'' Hawkes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the rampage in Aldi, the Russian soldiers threatened revenge
against survivors who talked about it, Hawkes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reports of atrocities by Russian troops, coming on top of the indiscriminate
shelling of cities and villages, have drawn strong international protests.
</P>
<P>
	   The military has continued to claim that heavy bombings and shellings have
spared civilians, despite abundant evidence to the contrary.

<HEADLINE> SBC To Acquire Sterling Commerce  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- SBC Communications Inc. is acquiring Sterling Commerce
Inc. for $3.9 billion in a bid to grab part of the fast-growing
business-to-business Internet commerce market.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC's $44.25 a share offer for Sterling, which makes software that lets
businesses buy and sell goods and services on the Internet, is a 40 percent
premium over Sterling's Friday closing stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Sterling jumped nearly 38 percent Tuesday afternoon on the New
York Stock Exchange, up $11.93 3/4 to $43.50. SBC shares were down $2 to $36.25
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen McGaw, SB1C's managing director for corporate development, defended
the purchase price, saying Sterling had been undervalued by the market, but also
acknowledged a short-term effect on SBC stock.
</P>
<P>
	   "All on its own, this business is slightly dilutive to SBC," McGaw said, but
added the company is not changing its earnings outlook for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition follows other moves by San Antonio-based SBC to transform
itself from just a provider of local phone service to a player in Internet
access and other services.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, SBC said it will invest $6 billion to become a leading provider
of high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
	   Sterling Commerce, based in Dublin, Ohio, operates online "communities"
where businesses can buy and sell goods and services and sells software that
lets customers exchange information. It reported 1999 revenues of $561 million.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC will merge Sterling with an SBC subsidiary. The deal is expected to
close in the next few months. Sterling, which has 2,300 employees, will keep
operations in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
	   Sterling began as a unit of Sterling Software, a provider of management
software. It has more than 42,000 customers -- including SBC -- in banking,
health care, telecommunications and other industries.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC, which leapfrogged over Bell Atlantic to become the nation's No. 1 phone
company when it bought Ameritech, operates nearly 60 million U.S. phone lines.
It has also made investments in fiber optics -- it is seeking federal approval
to begin long-distance service -- and recently struck a partnership with Prodigy
Communications, an Internet service provider.

<HEADLINE> Fired employee return to store, kills boss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - An unreliable employee fired from an electrical
supply store for once again showing up late for work returned early the next
morning and stabbed his boss to death, authorities said Tuesday.
<P>
	   Kelvin Owes, 33, pleaded innocent at his arraignment Tuesday to charges of
second-degree murder. Prosecutors left open the option of charging him with
first-degree murder, which carries a possible death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   A co-worker found the body of office manager Janet Welch, 53, at daybreak
Monday inside Maynard's Electrical Supply Inc. in a commercial strip near the
suburb of Irondequoit. The suspect was found hiding in the rafters.
</P>
<P>
	   Owes had been fired several times over the last year, most recently by Welch
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "He had been fired and hired back and then unfortunately would have further
problems and then would get fired again," said Monroe County District Attorney
Howard Relin.
</P>
<P>
	   "He had problems with coming in when he was supposed to come in - just
normal work-related problems that people have in terms of lateness and failing
to show up," Relin said, adding that "no other unusual things had happened like
problems with other employees."
</P>
<P>
	   Owes was jailed without bail. Prosecutors said they might escalate charges
against him at a preliminary hearing Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   An assailant battered Welch repeatedly around the head and body with a blunt
instrument and then stabbed her multiple times in the torso and the throat with
an unidentified "edged weapon," police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Owes previously served time for unlawful imprisonment and criminal trespass
and was placed on five years' probation, police said, declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Welch, who was married, had worked at Maynard's for about 20 years and was
"a wonderful employee and a wonderful human being," said store owner Glenn
Hellman.

<HEADLINE> Service Merchandise Cuts More Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Service Merchandise Company Inc. plans to cut 4,800
additional jobs, reduce store sizes and discontinue some product lines as part
of its ongoing bankruptcy reorganization plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nashville-based company was forced into Chapter 11 last March by a group
of creditors, claiming total debts of $1.29 billion. The company has so far
closed 122 stores and cut 5,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company continues to make good progress in its restructuring efforts,
with 1999 as a year of stabilization for Service Merchandise," chief executive
Sam Cusano said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company began notifying workers Tuesday about the latest job cuts. It
currently has about 16,000 full-time employees at its Nashville offices, three
distribution centers and 221 stores in 32 states.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is reducing the number of products it sells and expanding its
core jewelry business, especially diamonds, and its Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Service Merchandise will spend $150 million of over the next two years to
reduce store sizes and remodel showrooms to include more jewelry display cases
and Internet kiosks for merchandise orders. The company will rent or sell the
surplus store space.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will no longer sell toys, sporting goods, most consumer
electronics and indoor furniture. It will continue to sell housewares, silver,
crystal, small appliances, patio furniture, luggage and clocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're no longer going to try to fix those other businesses," Cusano said.
"What we're saying is, we can't be all things to all people."
</P>
<P>
	   The inventory reduction means the closure of the company's distribution
centers in Orlando, Fla., and Montgomery, N.Y., and a consolidation of inventory
at the Nashville center.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcements were made as Service Merchandise reported its year-end
earnings and a new bank-financing package that will help the company past its
emergence from bankruptcy, likely next year.
</P>
<P>
	   The company expects to get approval of a new four-year, $600 million bank
financing agreement from Fleet Retail Finance Inc., replacing a previous
financing agreement. It intends to use the funds to pay for its store
renovations and other improvements, operating expenses and general working
capital once the company emerges from Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Service Merchandise reported a net loss of $243.7 million, or a loss of
$2.45 a share, for the year ending Jan. 2. Net sales for the period were $2.23
billion. For the prior year, the company reported a net loss of $110.3 million,
or a loss of $1.11 a share, on net sales of $3.17 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter earnings were $68.3 million compared to $49.1 million for the
same period last year. Operating earnings were $25.2 million for the year ending
Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Service Merchandise also confirmed it plans to cancel all existing common
stock and will not issue new shares to current shareholders in the reorganized
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares recently trading over the counter were valued at about 14 cents.

<HEADLINE> Russia: 'No Way Out' for Chechens  </HEADLINE>
   By NICK WADHAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Thousands of rebels in Chechnya's mountains have ``no
way out'' as Russian forces backed by artillery and air attacks close in on
them, Russia's defense minister said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   About 20,000 Russian troops nearly completed a blockade of the Argun Gorge,
a key passage into the rugged slopes of Chechnya's mountains, the military said
Tuesday. Russian warplanes and helicopter gunships flew more than 150 combat
missions over the area in 24 hours, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interfax news agency, citing sources at a Russian base in Khankala, said
a Russian helicopter was lost Tuesday in the Argun Gorge. The Defense Ministry
made no immediate comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian strategists remained concerned about a rebel resurgence, and have
warned repeatedly over the past weeks that rebels are planning substantial
attacks for Wednesday. The day is both a Russian holiday honoring the military
and a traditional Chechen commemoration of the beginning of their mass
deportation to Central Asia in 1944 under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
</P>
<P>
	   Apparently in response to those concerns, Russia closed all its border
crossings into Chechnya on Tuesday. Russia previously has shut border crossings
for periods ranging up to several days at a time.
</P>
<P>
	   In southern Chechnya, the rebels maintained their tight grip on the village
of Duba-Yurt at the entrance to the Argun Gorge, according to the news agency
Interfax. But Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the fighters ``have no way out
anymore,'' Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   But the rebels, skilled in guerrilla techniques, have repeatedly shown
during the 5-month-old war that they are able to slip through Russian lines.
They have mounted surprise attacks on Russian-held towns, and many fighters
broke out of the capital, Grozny, this month, even though the city was
encircled.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ruins of Grozny, troops appeared tense on Tuesday, generally sticking
close to their checkpoints and bunkers. Soldiers were overheard discussing
rumors that the Chechen warlord Khattab was leading a band of 700 fighters to
attack Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
	   Human Rights Watch said Tuesday it had documented accounts of a massacre of
Chechen civilians that could be the worst atrocity of the war.
</P>
<P>
	   The group said at least 62 people died in Aldi, on the outskirts of Grozny,
in a two-day rampage that began Feb. 5. It said about 100 soldiers
systematically robbed and shot civilians. The troops also committed several
rapes and hurled grenades into basements where residents were hiding, the group
said, citing survivors' accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has repeatedly denied reports that its troops have taken part in
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
	   While Russian aircraft slammed the mountains with bombs and rockets, troops
moving toward the rebels' mountain stronghold of Shatoi seized heights near the
villages of Makhkety and Selmentazhen, the military said. Up to 5,000 fighters
are concentrated around Shatoi, Interfax reported, citing military sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Soldiers have been fighting the rebels at the entrance to the Argun Gorge
for weeks, and the flank offensive on villages east of the gorge seemed aimed at
encircling the separatists.
</P>
<P>
	   In a tacit acknowledgment of the rebels' ability to maneuver around Russian
troops, Sergeyev said his forces were determined to wipe out the rebels before
spring melted the mountain snow, which could open new escape routes.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of rebels tried to break out of the Argun Gorge and into neighboring
Georgia, but were fought back by Russian border guards, the news agency
ITAR-Tass reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid concerns about attacks on Wednesday, security precautions have been
taken at airports and train stations across Russia. Police in far-flung cities
have been carrying out security sweeps, focusing on people originating from the
Caucasus Mountains area.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, police officers were placed on 12-hour shifts, with no leave
allowed until Feb. 29, Echo of Moscow radio reported. In other cities, Police
also were placed on alert, Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials have warned of alleged Chechen plans to stage terrorist
attacks and airplane hijackings in Russia. Moscow already has blamed Chechen
rebels for four bombings of apartment houses last fall that killed some 300
people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kremlin has cited those attacks, along with the preceding invasion of
the southern region of Dagestan by Chechnya-based Islamic militants, as part of
the reason it sent troops to Chechnya in September.

	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Unilever, the consumer products company
behind such household names as Lipton, Vaseline and Pepsodent, plans to slash
25,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, over five years as it tries to
reverse a slump in profits and its share price.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, which has headquarters in England and the Netherlands,
announced the cuts Tuesday as part of a reorganization that will also see the
closing of 100 major production sites in Europe and the Americas, leaving 150
factories.
</P>
<P>
	   Unilever, which is eliminating hundreds of lagging brands, also reported
that profits fell 5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Co-chairman Antony Burgmans, the head of Unilever's Dutch arm, told a news
conference the measures "are necessary for the long-term health of the company."
Left unclear was how many of the job cuts would come in the form of layoffs and
which countries would be hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported that its 1999 net profit slipped to 6.14 billion
guilders, or $2.97 billion, down from 6.49 billion guilders in 1998. Sales rose
2 percent to 90.9 billion guilders, or $43.7 billion, compared to 92.4 billion
guilders in 1998. Per share earnings in 1999 were 1 percent stronger at 5.83
guilders, or $2.81, compared to 5.66 guilders the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Unilever, one of the world's largest manufacturers of beauty, home-care and
cooking products, said in a statement that businesses which fail to meet targets
will be sold or reorganized in coming years. Fragrance and cosmetics unit
Elizabeth Arden and the European bakery operations are under review.
</P>
<P>
	   Also included in Unilever's wide array of brands are Calvin Klein
fragrances, Dove soap, Close-Up toothpaste and Breyer's ice cream.
</P>
<P>
	   As investors have poured billions of dollars into technology stocks in
recent years, many retail shares such as Unilever have been left by the wayside.
The stock slid 30 percent in Amsterdam over the past 12 months and a drastic
restructuring was long awaited.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said Tuesday the restructuring wouldn't bring shareholders much
gain in the short term, with earnings remaining weak until 2004. But they were
positive about long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have now presented a more clear strategy," said Robert-Jan Vos with
SNS Securities. "It could enhance organic growth which has been lower than
Unilever's peers."
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew Saunders, an analyst with HSBC in London, will raise his earnings
forecasts after Unilever "did what was necessary" to keep up with its main
competitor, Procter and Gamble.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact of the matter is that these measures will drive higher returns for
investors and higher profit," he said. "About 75 percent of the portfolio is now
low-growth and low-return."
</P>
<P>
	   Unilever shares jumped nearly 9 percent to 50 euros, or $50, in Amsterdam
after the announcement, but fell back to a 4 percent gain at 47.66 euros.
</P>
<P>
	   Late last year, Unilever disclosed plans to focus on just 400 of its current
1,800 brands. On Tuesday, it said it will invest $1.5 billion to market that
smaller product lineup over the next five years. Procter and Gamble has just 300
brands.
</P>
<P>
	   "The move towards a streamlined, more focused organization will dramatically
improve our ability to market our leading brands," Burgmans said.
</P>
<P>
	   The restructuring will cost an estimated $5 billion and eventually slice
$1.6 billion off annual costs, Unilever said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unilever also plans to increase sales over the Internet, investing $200
million this year for on-line activities, while it continues to look for
acquisition and alliance partners.
</P>
<P>
	   Burgmans forecast per share net earnings growth of between 8 percent and 10
percent this year, driven by stronger sales in emerging markets, Western Europe
and North America.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Earnings Rise With Oil Price  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON BARKHO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A handful of protein biscuits seems like too little,
too late for Zakiya Abdulrahman's family.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the biscuits are a windfall for the pregnant woman with five
children whose family's income is less than $1 per day -- and they are possible
only because of a rise in world oil prices. The costly oil means Iraq is earning
more money under the U.N. oil-for-food program designed to let it skirt trade
sanctions for the good of its people.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently, that has meant a small improvement for Abdulrahman and nearly
5,000 other malnourished mothers and children in the low-income Baghdad
neighborhood of Mashahda: six high protein biscuits a month per person. That is
in addition to free rations of rice, flour, legumes, sugar and tea distributed
under an earlier phase of the oil-for-food project.
</P>
<P>
	   But Abdulrahman and her five children are still in dire need. Abdulrahman's
husband earns his tiny income selling groceries from a cart. Her 11-month-old
boy weighed 13 pounds -- the norm for that age is almost 20 pounds -- when a
community care volunteer put him on an electronic scale.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past three months, regular power cuts in Abdulrahman's neighborhood
have lasted as long as 16 hours a day. Broken pipes inundate some streets with
sewage. Children scour garbage heaps in search of used tin cans and bottles they
can sell to recyclers.
</P>
<P>
	   Such misery exists despite Iraq's oil reserves, and despite the fact that in
the past year, the price of the crude basket of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries has risen from a 25-year record low of around $6 a barrel to
more than $27.
</P>
<P>
	   While the increase has boosted Iraq's revenues, it isn't doing much to help
the country's poor because much of the money is either taken away or blocked by
the United Nations, Iraqi officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is not allowed to freely sell its oil on world markets under sanctions
imposed to punish it for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions cannot be
lifted until U.N. inspectors certify Iraq is not producing weapons of mass
destruction. Iraq has barred inspectors for the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   The sanctions have crippled Iraq's economy. But in December 1996, the
oil-for-food exception was instituted.
</P>
<P>
	   At first, it allowed Iraq's government to sell $2 billion worth of oil every
six months on the condition that the proceeds are used to buy food and other
essentials for ordinary Iraqis. The financial ceiling was raised to $5.2 billion
in 1998, and a December 1999 U.N. resolution removed it altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   All told, Iraq has sold about $22 billion worth of oil under the program,
officials estimate. So far, though, the government has earmarked only $30
million of the proceeds to combat widespread malnutrition among children and
pregnant and nursing mothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz charges that his country is the last to
benefit from the oil sales. He has said about $7.7 billion of total earnings
have been funneled to a U.N. fund to compensate the victims of Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait. The money also covers U.N. expenses incurred in administering the
program and dismantling Iraq's war machine.
</P>
<P>
	   Tariq also says the U.N. sanctions committee is blocking Iraq from buying
commodities for its people and its oil industry. He charges that commodities
contracts worth more than $8 billion are either blocked or have not reached Iraq
yet.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, about 15 percent of the revenues are earmarked for Iraq's
Kurdish north, an area outside Baghdad's control. All of those subtractions
together, Iraq says, leave few funds to do what the oil-for-food program was
intended to do -- help Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. and British diplomats say the Baghdad government hoards medicines
instead of distributing them to hospitals and is refusing to rid itself of
weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles. They maintain that in the
absence of weapons monitors, Iraq will acquire equipment and spare parts to
reinstate its weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, smuggled oil is pouring out of Iraq and onto the markets, the
U.S. Navy says.
</P>
<P>
	   Although smugglers sell for less than the legitimate market rate, their
prices go up with world market prices. Smuggled oil revenues go straight to the
Iraqi regime's coffers and can be used in any way Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
sees fit, observers say.
</P>
<P>
	   The wrangling between Iraq and the United Nations has taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
	   Two senior U.N. relief officials in Baghdad resigned this week, frustrated
at the disputes. The two, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Hans von Sponeck and
U.N. World Food Program chief Jutta Burghardt, said they feared the spats
between the sides will continue -- and the suffering of innocent civilians will
worsen.
</P>
<P>
	   They also said they don't believe Iraq is trying to misuse the oil-for-food
funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't have the impression that there is a willful act'' on the part of
the government to divert equipment to military use or hoard supplies, von
Sponeck said.
</P>
<P>
	   For Abdulrahman, like millions of other Iraqis, it is a political game for
which she and her children are paying a heavy price.

<HEADLINE> Singer Looks To Stop Bovine Cruelty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Rock singer Chrissie Hynde is on a
crusade -- to stop cruelty to cows in Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   She was the headliner at a small rally organized by the People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals to protest the use of cow hides imported from India
to feed the demand for leather.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's demonstration was held outside a Gap store, chosen because of the
company's "everybody in leather" ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously it's not just the Gap," said Hynde, 48, who performed in
Vancouver on Saturday with her band, the Pretenders. "But until they stop using
leather from India and China, we should stop buying it."
</P>
<P>
	   Gap spokeswoman Kellie Leonard said Monday in San Francisco that the chain
doesn't manufacture leather goods but only purchases them from overseas
factories. "We expect apparel factories to follow applicable laws and
industry-best practices," she said.

<HEADLINE> SEC Sues Two Day-Trading Firms  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators, taking their first major action
against companies in the day-trading industry, on Tuesday sued two firms and
nine people for allegedly making loans to trader customers that exceeded legal
limits.
</P>
<P>
	   One firm, Investment Street Co., and two of its executives agreed in a
settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay fines; the other,
All-Tech Direct Inc., is fighting the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   The electronic day-trading industry has attracted several thousand
individual investors nationwide, who are distinct from the 10 million or so
Americans who occasionally trade stocks over the Internet. Day traders engage in
the risky practice of riding the stock market's ups and downs, trying to squeeze
out profits by rapidly buying and selling shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Host firms such as Investment Street and All-Tech provide trading
facilities, computers and specialized software for their customers, who usually
pay the firms a commission on each trade.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC alleged, in separate lawsuits filed in federal court, that
Investment Street and All-Tech violated federal margin lending rules. Investors
buy stocks on margin by borrowing part of the purchase price from their
brokerage firm or day-trading firm and putting up the securities as collateral
for the loan.
</P>
<P>
	   Margin requirements, set by the Federal Reserve, generally limit borrowing
to 50 percent of a stock's purchase price. Brokerage and day-trading firms are
allowed to set limits stricter than 50 percent for their customers but they
cannot allow them to borrow more than half of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
	   Investment Street, based in Miami, neither admitted to nor denied the
allegations in agreeing to the settlement. Investment Street and Dynamic Trading
of Miami Inc., which provided administrative services for Investment Street,
together agreed to pay a $25,000 fine and to refrain from future violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Javier Saenz, president of Investment Street, and Emilio Sardi, one of its
directors, each agreed to pay a $5,500 fine and to be temporarily suspended from
the brokerage industry. The lengths of their suspensions were not immediately
known.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC said that Montvale, N.J.-based All-Tech, one of the biggest
day-trading firms, made margin loans by using the money of three people
associated with the firm.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency alleged that All-Tech and seven associated people were
responsible for making 103 unsecured loans to customers in 1998 to meet margin
calls totaling more than $3.6 million. In a margin call, an investor is asked to
come up with more money in order to meet the minimum requirement in his or her
trading account.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC also alleged that four All-Tech executives -- President Mark Shefts;
Harry Lefkowitz, vice president of operations; Lisa Esposito, head of the firm's
margin department; and Barry Parrish, manager of its San Diego office -- aided
the violations by authorizing the margin loans to customers or otherwise helping
them get made.
</P>
<P>
	   "The SEC charges are groundless and baseless," All-Tech's associate general
counsel, Franklin Ogele, said by telephone. "We intend to defend ourselves
vigorously ... and we believe we will be exonerated."
</P>
<P>
	   Harvey Houtkin, All-Tech's founder and chief executive, has been an
outspoken defender of the day-trading industry.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC and state securities regulators have been concerned about what they
say is an excessive reliance on margin loans by day traders who do not have the
money to meet margin requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   The practice of day-trading on margin came under a public spotlight last
July, when trader Mark Barton shot and killed nine people at two day-trading
firms in Atlanta, including a local office of All-Tech, before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Barton, who had received large margin loans, is believed to have lost nearly
half a million dollars in his day trading -- including $153,000 in one three-day
"binge."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-policing
brokers' group, have scrutinized firms in the day-trading business to see if
they make unrealistic promises of quick riches to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt told Congress in September that several
day-trading firms have used deceptive advertising to lure investors. He said the
agency's inquiry also found that many firms have lax compliance with securities
laws, including sloppy record keeping and inadequate supervision of employees.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Claims Success in E. Timor  </HEADLINE>
   By HEATHER PATERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- After five months of restoring calm to an East
Timor devastated by rampaging militias, an Australian-led force will leave the
recovering territory Wednesday to the U.N. administrators who will guide it
toward full independence.
</P>
<P>
	   When the 19-nation force was deployed in September, East Timor was in chaos,
with buildings on fire and gunshots from anti-independence militias and maverick
Indonesian troops echoing across the capital, Dili.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, hundreds of thousands of East Timorese who were forced to flee the
bloody mayhem are trying to rebuild their shattered lives and hope their
homeland will be independent within a few years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is one of the most complex, challenging and most successful military
operations we have ever run,'' Australian army Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, the
commander of the multinational force, said Tuesday in a farewell speech to his
troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The Australian-led force will leave Wednesday, replaced by a U.N. force in
blue berets. Cosgrove is scheduled to depart on an Australian navy ship, leaving
the U.N. force under the command of Lt. Gen. Jaime de los Santos of the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
	   The multinational troops, known as Interfet, supervised the largely peaceful
withdrawal of Indonesian soldiers from East Timor and had the territory under
its control within seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the massive destruction before they arrived, skirmishes with
militias and Indonesian troops were few. The peacekeepers killed one Indonesian
police officer and six militia men.
</P>
<P>
	   Two soldiers died, one in a car accident and another from illness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very relieved about the low cost in human terms with violence
virtually stopping after our arrival, low cost in lives to Interfet and our
adversaries,'' Cosgrove said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesia's military is accused of helping the anti-independence militias
launch the violence after East Timor's people overwhelmingly voted for
independence from Indonesia in a U.N.-supervised ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   A state-appointed human rights report and a separate U.N. investigation have
accused former military chief Gen. Wiranto of being ultimately responsible for
the terror and destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   President Abdurrahman Wahid dropped Wiranto as security minister last week
over the allegations, and state prosecutors are considering whether to file
charges against him and other senior Indonesian commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-star general had repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Yasril Ananta Baharuddin, head of a parliamentary commission that
scrutinizes the military, said Wiranto will be summoned before parliament in
early March to answer questions about the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want firsthand information from Wiranto himself,'' the legislator said.
</P>
<P>
	   The anti-independence militias are still active in Indonesian-controlled
West Timor, where members stoned a U.N. team on Tuesday and disrupted the return
of 1,000 refugees back to East Timor. No one was injured but only 179 people
made it across the border, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. peacekeepers are well-armed, with automatic weapons, and have
authority to use them to defend themselves and carry out their jobs. It is
anticipated that the troops deployed along the West Timor border would be more
heavily armed to deal with militias than peacekeepers elsewhere in the
territory, U.N. officials said.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-EU Data Privacy Talks Advance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The United States and the European Union said
Tuesday they have reached a breakthrough on one of the most difficult elements
of a data privacy agreement, but that there is still work to do prior to the
end-of-March deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had a breakthrough on enforcement,'' said David Aaron, U.S.
undersecretary of commerce for international trade. ``There's been a great
measure of agreement on remedies and due process.''
</P>
<P>
	   American companies want an agreement that will ensure that as much personal
data as possible about European consumers can be transferred across the
Atlantic. European human rights campaigners want to curb this.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks, which began two years ago, have been stalled because of EU
concerns about enforcement in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   John Mogg, chief negotiator for the EU, said a group of EU negotiators who
visited the United States in January left with clear ideas on how American laws
are enforced when companies violate the U.S. self-regulatory system.
</P>
<P>
	   Any kind of agreement still would have to be approved by the EU's 15 member
states and backed by the European Parliament. Such an agreement would regulate
how information about private individuals can be used in the trans-Atlantic
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
	   Many industries, including airlines, insurance and financial companies, want
to be assured that companies can transfer personal data about European consumers
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Europe has been very cautious in regulating data gathering and processing.
In 1998, EU nations starting applying a directive which covers as wide an area
as possible and creates an elaborate system of government regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. system allows the private sector much more room for
self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   Mogg said that the package is in the final stages of negotiation, and that
the enforcement issue is a key EU priority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the U.S., if you say that you follow privacy rules and you don't --
that's a crime,'' Aaron said, adding that the Federal Trade Commission and
Justice Department would pursue all complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think that's going a long way to show Europe that EU data will be
protected,'' Aaron said.

<HEADLINE> Study: More Kids on Prescribed Drugs  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- When he was a toddler, Heath Barker was nicknamed "the red
tornado" for his auburn hair and his penchant for tearing things up and jumping
off the furniture. When he was just 4, he was diagnosed with attention deficit
disorder and prescribed Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
	   A study of more than 200,000 preschool-age children shows this was no
isolated case.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of 2- to 4-year-olds on psychiatric drugs including Ritalin and
anti-depressants like Prozac soared 50 percent between 1991 and 1995,
researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts said they are troubled by the findings, because the effects of such
drugs in children so young are largely unknown. Some doctors worry that such
powerful drugs could be dangerous for children's development.
</P>
<P>
	   Heath's mother has anecdotal evidence suggesting -- as the researchers do --
that the number of youngsters on psychiatric drugs is still rising. Through her
involvement in Internet support groups for parents of children with behavior
problems, Michele Barker said she is hearing of more and more 3- and 4-year-olds
being put on drugs like Prozac.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's become a quick fix," said Barker, 39, of Hot Springs, Ark.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the study did not examine reasons for the increases, Julie Magno
Zito, the lead author and an assistant professor of pharmacy and medicine at the
University of Maryland, suggested a few possibilities.
</P>
<P>
	   With an increasing number of children attending day care, parents may feel
pressured "to have their children conform in their behavior," Zito said. She
also said there is a much greater acceptance in the 1990s of psychoactive drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Joseph T. Coyle of Harvard Medical School's psychiatry department said
the study reveals a troubling trend, "given that there is no empirical evidence
to support psychotropic drug treatment in very young children and that there are
valid concerns that such treatment could have deleterious effects on the
developing brain."
</P>
<P>
	   "These disturbing prescription practices suggest a growing crisis in mental
health services to children and demand more thorough investigation," Coyle wrote
in an editorial accompanying the study.
</P>
<P>
	   The authors reviewed Medicaid prescription records from 1991, 1993 and 1995
for preschoolers from a Midwestern state and a mid-Atlantic state; and for those
in an HMO in the Northwest. The states were not identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Use of stimulants, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics and clonidine -- a drug
used in adults to treat high blood pressure and increasingly for insomnia in
hyperactive children -- were examined. Substantial increases were seen in every
category except anti-psychotics, though in some cases the actual number of
prescriptions was quite small.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of children getting any of the drugs totaled about 100,000 in
1991, and jumped 50 percent to 150,000 in 1995. That year, 60 percent of the
youngsters on drugs were age 4, 30 percent were 3 and 10 percent were
2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
	   The use of clonidine skyrocketed in all three groups. Although the numbers
were small, the researchers said the clonidine increases were particularly
remarkable because its use for attention disorders is "new and largely
uncharted." They noted that slowed heart beat and fainting have been reported in
children who use clonidine with other medications for attention disorders.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. David Fassler, chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls for Talks With India  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Complaining of ``increasingly strident''
statements from India, Pakistan's new foreign secretary urged Indian leaders
Tuesday to accept his country's offer of talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In recent months, Indian policy-makers and leaders have become
increasingly strident in their pronouncements against Pakistan,'' said Inam-ul
Haq, who took over the No. 2 job at Pakistan's foreign ministry last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have responded with a policy of restraint and maturity and have
expressed our willingness to resume dialogue with India,'' he said. ``We live in
a difficult environment. The quest for security and peace has always been at the
core of our foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
	   All topics are open for discussion, said Haq, but the big issue is the
disputed Kashmir region. Both India and Pakistan lay claim to Kashmir, a former
princely state divided between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Five civilians were killed in the region Monday night, when Pakistani troops
fired more than 500 rounds of mortar shells across the border in Kashmir, the
Indian army said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan accused India of firing the first shots and killing three Pakistani
civilians in the encounter. ``Our troops retaliated, hitting selected military
targets,'' Pakistan army spokesman Col. Salaut Raza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cross-border shelling is common in the volatile region.
</P>
<P>
	   Kashmir -- the flashpoint of two previous wars between Pakistan and India --
rose to international prominence in 1998 when the two South Asian nations
exploded nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
	   Both countries claim to have nuclear arms, although neither has spelled out
the type or number of weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kashmir dispute will have to be settled if peace in the region is to be
guaranteed, Haq said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Indian foreign ministry could not immediately be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan wants a vote held on both sides of the disputed border to let
Kashmiris decide whether a reunified Kashmir would become part of India or
Pakistan. Such a vote is guaranteed in a 1948 U.N. resolution. India rejects a
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan also has sought international mediation, and President Clinton, who
is to visit India next month, has offered to try to bridge the divide. However,
India has flatly rejected any outside mediation. Clinton said both countries
have to agree to his intervention before he will do it.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision has not yet been made on whether Clinton will stop in Pakistan on
his trip to the region. The visit was put in question last October after the
army threw out the elected government of Nawaz Sharif and took control.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Gen. Pervez Musharraf has refused to set a timetable for a return to
democracy, saying he wants to clean up a deeply corrupt system and revive a weak
and ailing economy before holding elections.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Europe, Asian Markets Falter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A late round of bargain-hunting today halted a slide in the
Dow industrials in the first U.S. trading following last week's big drop.
</P>
<P>
	   But the bounce back from today's lows came too late to lift European
markets. As Wall Street retreated on interest rate jitters this morning,
European exchanges gave up early gains and a bid to recover from Monday's losses
faltered. Stocks closed lower in Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, at one point down almost 115 points,
finished the day up 85.32 at 10,304.84 in active trading. The Nasdaq composite
index, off as much as 120 points during trading, regained some lost ground and
was down 29.77 at 4,381.97, according to preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week's selloff encouraged some investors to shop for bargains today,
but interest rate worries continued to hang over the market.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. stocks plunged on Friday, carrying the Dow down 295 points and the
Nasdaq down 137 after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested more
rate increases may be needed to cool off the economy and keep inflation under
control. U.S. financial markets were closed Monday in observance of Presidents
Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the National Association for Business Economics predicted the economy
would grow at a slower rate this year and next and said it now expects at least
two more interest rate increases by the Fed this year. And William McDonough,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the central bank would
continue to use higher interest rates as an inflation-fighting tool so long as
the demand side of the economy remains robust.
</P>
<P>
	   European markets, which had been recovering today after a big drop Monday,
gave up gains after Wall Street turned lower.
</P>
<P>
	   The DAX index in Frankfurt, Germany, closed with a 0.2 percent gain after
being up more than 1 percent earlier in the day, and London's FTSE-100 Share
Index fell 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   A second straight day of selling in Asia earlier today hit high-tech shares
particularly hard.
</P>
<P>
	   In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed down 0.78
percent. On Monday, the average tumbled 245.28 points, or 1.23 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Markets in Hong Kong and Singapore also suffered today. The Hang Seng index
fell 0.4 percent and Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index closed down 0.44
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The losses pointed to one cause: last week's big drop on Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Stand on Taiwan Worries U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration expressed deep concern Tuesday
over a warning by China that it could use force if Taiwan delays indefinitely
reunification talks with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. diplomats relayed the administration's concerns to Chinese authorities
in Beijing and Washington just a day after China issued the threat in an
11,000-page position paper.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart rejected the Chinese
threat and recalled that the United States sent two aircraft carriers and other
warships to the region to calm a crisis four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We reject any use of force or any threat of force in this situation,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that peaceful dialogue and bilateral engagement between the
sides is the way to move forward,'' he said. ``We have repeated, I think, in
both actions and words that we view any threat to Taiwan with grave concern.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Stanley O. Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Chinese
position paper was ``obviously a source of concern for us'' and appeared to be
contrary to ``the policy that is the bedrock of our relations'' with both China
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of Congress, where support for Taiwan runs strong, suggested the
administration was not repudiating the Chinese statement with enough force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to articulate more clearly where we are,'' said Sen. Craig Thomas,
R-Wyo., chairman of the East Asian and Pacific subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John Kerry, R-Mass., said that China's statement ``is unacceptable''
and that the administration had the responsibility to make sure that China ``not
misinterpret where we are -- in one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the State Department, spokesman James P. Rubin described as a new
formulation China's threat to use force if there is an indefinite delay in
reunification talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We find the formulation troubling; we don't find it particularly
helpful,'' he said. At the same time, he said it would be a mistake to
exaggerate the significance of the Chinese statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had much worse periods on this question in the past,'' he said. He
added that the administration is not considering any change in its opposition to
legislation before Congress to strengthen U.S.-Taiwanese military relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said military ties with Taiwan, authorized under the Taiwan Relations
Act, has enabled the United States to be ``second-to-none'' in its support of
the anti-communist bastion. He said that arrangement has served U.S. interests
extremely well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that support has made a difference as recently as 1996. And so
nobody should doubt our willingness to act in our own national interest,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, China fired nuclear-capable missiles near Taiwan's two largest
ports, prompting the United States to send two aircraft carriers and other
warships to the region.
</P>
<P>
	   China's muscle-flexing at the time was related to the impending presidential
elections at the time. And the new threat from Beijing appeared aimed at
influencing presidential elections on Taiwan set for next month. Analysts said
China seems intent on discouraging support for the candidate most identified
with the pro-independence sector on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart recalled that in 1996, ``we responded appropriately to what was
viewed as a threat. And that should give you some indication of how we view this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lin Chong-pin, Taiwan's vice chairman of a council that handles Taiwan's
China policy, would not directly address the new threat but said tensions would
not ease as long as Beijing refuses to acknowledge that China is split and each
side is controlled by a separate government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until we unify, both sides of course will have different views about what
'one China' means,'' Lin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest flare-up comes amid President Clinton's drive to win
congressional approval of permanent trading benefits for China, part of a
trade-opening deal to admit Beijing into the World Trade Organization, which
sets the rules for global trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the deal are likely to seize on the new Chinese stand in hopes
of blocking the trade package. But Lockhart insisted that it should not affect
the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The agreement is very much in our country's interest and our national
interest,'' he said. ``This is a one-sided agreement benefiting American
business, American workers, American families. We should move forward on that
basis.''

<HEADLINE> Workers Questioned in Cyanide Spill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Romanian prosecutors began questioning workers at
a gold mine Tuesday about the circumstances of a devastating cyanide spill last
month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No criminal investigation is going on yet,'' said Dan Bocurtean, chief
prosecutor of the Maramures region, the Mediafax news agency reported. It was
still unclear if he would take legal action against the joint
Australian-Romanian company running the gold mine.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 30, tons of cyanide-laced water spilled from a containment reservoir
operated by the Aurul gold mine near Baia Mare, entering a nearby creek and
spreading into the Tisza and Danube rivers. The cyanide killed huge quantities
of fish and other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, cyanide levels in seven wells near the mine were from 4.5 to 700
times higher than the Romanian standards of 0.01 milligram per liter, said
Andrei Muresan, head of the health authority in Baia Mare, 265 miles northwest
of Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a recent thaw in the Baia Mare area, more cyanide has apparently
seeped into the wells of the nearby village of Bozanta Mare, Romanian officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, local authorities in counties along the Danube River shut down
water pumps supplying water from the Danube as the cyanide wave approached them.
</P>
<P>
	   Bocurtean was quoted by Mediafax as saying the workers supervising the
reservoir's dam had apparently made no mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We still have to find out whether there is someone to be found guilty,''
Bocurtean said.

<HEADLINE> Report Critical of Ex-CIA Director  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former CIA Director John Deutch knew that computers
connected to the Internet were vulnerable to attack, but took no steps to
protect some of the nation's most sensitive secrets, said an internal CIA report
released by a congressional panel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also accuses the current CIA director, George Tenet, and other
top ranking agency officials of waiting too long to act in referring the matter
to the Justice Department and to congressional oversight committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet ``should have involved himself more forcefully to ensure a proper
resolution of the matter,'' concluded the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The release of the highly critical inspector general's report by the Senate
Intelligence Committee came as Deutch delivered a personal apology to the panel
in a closed door session.
</P>
<P>
	   Participants said that Deutch appeared contrite.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel voted to release an unclassified 77-page CIA-edited version of the
report which is at the center of the controversy surrounding Deutch, who was
stripped of his CIA security clearances last year as a result of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, a former deputy defense secretary, also voluntarily gave up Pentagon
security clearances earlier this month in the face of growing investigations.
Deutch served from May 10 1995 to Dec. 14, 1996 as CIA director.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general's report said that Deutch violated agency rules in
using as many as eight separate unsecured computers to process ``a large volume
of highly classified information,'' including information relating to covert
intelligence operations, top secret communications, classified details about
intelligence budgets and drafts of top-secret memos to President Clinton and
Vice President Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   These included desktop computers that Deutch had at his homes at Bethesda,
Md., and Belmont, Mass, his offices in the CIA headquarters and in the Old
Executive Office Building next to the White House, plus a laptop.
</P>
<P>
	   All five these computers had modems enabling them to connect to the
Internet, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The internal investigation ``has established that Deutch was aware of
prohibitions relating to the use of unclassified computers for processing
classified information,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Despite this knowledge, Deutch processed a large volume of highly
classified information on these unclassified computers, taking no steps to
restrict access to the information and thereby placing national security
information at risk.''
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the material in the inspector general's report had been reported
before, based on accounts by administration officials and lawmakers familiar
with the document. However, it was the first time that the report had been
released publicly.
</P>
<P>
	   The report disclosed that Deutch had been reprimanded for mishandling
classified information earlier, even before he became CIA director in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   It also suggests that the CIA investigation into the matter was lax, with
Tenet suggesting ``no one ever raised the issue of reporting the incident to the
Department of Justice or whether Deutch's clearance should be affected.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet finally stripped Deutch of that clearance last August, 2 1/2 years
after the investigation began.
</P>
<P>
	   In a written statement Tuesday, CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said that Tenet
``has made it clear that he believes that Dr. Deutch's lax handling of
classified information was inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet also agreed that the CIA's own investigation into the matter, at least
initially, ``was not well conducted and that Congress, which was first notified
of the ongoing investigation in June 1998, should have been advised of the
situation earlier.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said that the report ``paints a picture of individuals
struggling with the challenge of conducting a sensitive security investigation
of the agency's former director. CIA officials faced difficult decisions on how
to carry out a thorough investigation while preserving the personal privacy of
Mr. Detuch.''
</P>
<P>
	   Committee members said that Deutch, in his appearance before the panel,
apologized repeatedly for the mishandling of classified material. ``He was
fairly contrite. There's no doubt about that,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Med Mistakes Reported  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants to require fuller accounting of
deadly mistakes occurring daily in America's hospitals, but skeptical senators
said Tuesday his plan lacks details and the money to make it work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a worthy endeavor,'' Clinton said as he predicted bipartisan
support for a national plan to cut medical mistakes. At the same time, he tried
to convince doctors and hospitals that reporting serious problems need not lead
to more malpractice lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton wants a nationwide system to report and analyze medical mistakes,
similar to the airlines' reporting program for aviation accidents and safety
risks. He is pressing states to begin reporting within three years, but he
cannot force them to without separate legislation from Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House plan follows an independent report last year that missteps
by medical staff kill between 44,000 and 98,000 hospitalized Americans each year
-- equivalent to a jetliner crash every day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reporting is vital to holding health care systems accountable for
delivering quality care, and educating the public about the safety of their
health care system,'' Clinton said Tuesday. ``It is critical to uncovering
weaknesses, targeting widespread problems, analyzing what works and what doesn't
and sharing it with others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton endorsed many of the recommendations in that report from the
Institute of Medicine, including establishing a goal of reducing medical
mistakes by half within five years.
</P>
<P>
	   He also asked Congress for $20 million to set up a national clearinghouse
for patient safety, as the institute recommended. The institute is part of the
National Academy of Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress to
advise the government on scientific matters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a balanced, commonsense approach based on prevention, not
punishment, based on problem-solving, not blame-placing,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Medical Association and other large lobbies staunchly oppose
mandatory reporting, fearing that it opens hospitals and doctors to lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We live in an extraordinarily litigious environment,'' said Dr. Nancy
Dickey, past president of the AMA and a spokeswoman for the doctors' group.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House replies that while its plan offers consumers more
information about the safety records of individual hospitals, it would keep key
details about who did what to whom out of the hands of claims attorneys.
</P>
<P>
	   At a joint Senate subcommittee hearing Tuesday, several lawmakers offered
general endorsements for Clinton's approach but said they are confused as to how
the reporting system will work and who will pay for it.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, they noted that Clinton's proposed $20 million budget is for
research, not reporting. That leaves states on their own unless Congress steps
in with cash. In contrast, a bill already introduced by Sens. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, would provide grants to states to help start
reporting systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Specter said he supports mandatory reporting, even though powerful medical
lobbies oppose it. Specter complained, however, that the Clinton plan urges all
50 states to have mandatory reporting systems within three years but specifies
no sanctions if they don't.
</P>
<P>
	   Specter added that Pennsylvania already has a mandatory reporting system but
few hospitals actually comply.
</P>
<P>
	   Already 18 states have varying requirements for reporting medical errors,
but they're scattershot in what they require and how reports are analyzed or
used. Consequently, the Institute of Medicine said few state programs are
effective.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, worried that small rural hospitals, some with
as few as 10-15 beds, already are struggling economically and cannot afford to
establish a reporting system.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also announced several new requirements that do not need
congressional approval, including an immediate mandatory reporting requirement
for the 500 Defense Department-administered hospitals that serve an estimated 8
million people. The Health Care Financing Administration will require error
reduction plans this year in all 6,000 hospitals that participate in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration has a year to develop new standards to help
prevent medical mistakes caused by sound-alike drug names or look-alike
products. The agency also will devise new standards for labels that highlight
common problems such as errors in dosage size.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Taken together, these actions represent the most significant effort our
nation has ever made to reduce medical errors,'' Clinton said.

elections at the time. And the new threat from Beijing appeared aimed at
influencing presidential elections on Taiwan set for next month. Analysts said
China seems intent on discouraging support for the candidate most identified
with the pro-independence sector on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart recalled that in 1996, ``we responded appropriately to what was
viewed as a threat. And that should give you some indication of how we view this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lin Chong-pin, Taiwan's vice chairman of a council that handles Taiwan's
China policy, would not directly address the new threat but said tensions would
not ease as long as Beijing refuses to acknowledge that China is split and each
side is controlled by a separate government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until we unify, both sides of course will have different views about what
'one China' means,'' Lin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest flare-up comes amid President Clinton's drive to win
congressional approval of permanent trading benefits for China, part of a
trade-opening deal to admit Beijing into the World Trade Organization, which
sets the rules for global trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the deal are likely to seize on the new Chinese stand in hopes
of blocking the trade package. But Lockhart insisted that it should not affect
the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The agreement is very much in our country's interest and our national
interest,'' he said. ``This is a one-sided agreement benefiting American
business, American workers, American families. We should move forward on that
basis.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 85.32; Nasdaq Off 31.07  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed in a volatile day on Wall Street today as
investors, while searching for bargain stocks, were dogged by worries about
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down as much as 115 points
early in the day, rallied in the afternoon to close up 85.32 at 10,304.84.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index, however, was unable to shake
off concerns about interest rates and fell 31.07 to 4,380.67.
</P>
<P>
	   "The average investor is looking for the opportunity to step in here, but
with the pressure that's been created by the Federal Reserve, this could drag on
for a while," said Bob Dickey, managing director of technical analysis at Dain
Rauscher Wessels.
</P>
<P>
	   In the morning, William McDonough, president of the New York Federal
Reserve, reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely raise
interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very clear that we will have to use the interest rate tool as long as
the demand side of the economy stays this robust," he said in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   His comments echoed testimony last week from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan,
who suggested more rate increases may be needed to cool the economy and keep
inflation under control. On Friday, the Dow fell 295 points and the Nasdaq lost
137 points as investors were unnerved by the prospect of higher rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Markets were closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday, and today
investors traded cautiously. And declining issues outnumbered advancing issues
by about a 4-to-3 margin on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
	   "What you are really seeing today is what has been oversold, the Dow, is
coming back. And what was overbought, the Nasdaq, is having a correction," said
Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at First Union Securities in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   One sector that is giving back some of its recent gains is the computer
industry. Investors are beginning to worry that as the Fed put the brakes on the
economy, profits will slow. That sentiment hurt shares of Intel and Cisco.
</P>
<P>
	   The exception today, however, was Texas Instruments, which unveiled two new
processors. The company's stock shot up almost 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In other news, SBC Communications, a regional telephone company, announced
it would spend $3.9 billion in cash to acquire Sterling Commerce Inc., a
provider of Internet integration software. SBC's shares dipped slightly, while
shares of Sterling soared.
</P>
<P>
	   A second telecom deal: Global Crossing Ltd., a long-distance phone company,
said it would pay $3.8 billion for IXNet, an Internet networking company. Global
Crossing's stock fell, while IXNet's shares rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Nextel Communications, a wireless phone company, reported a
lower-than-expected loss in its most recent quarter, and said it would split its
stock 2-for-1. Nextel's shares jumped more than 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Cribs Found To Be Unsafe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eight of every 10 cribs inspected at a national sampling
of motels and hotels were unsafe, the chairwoman of the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Spot checks in 90 hotels in 27 states and the District of Columbia found
loose hardware, unsecured mattress supports, dangerously soft bedding and
too-large adult-sized sheets, all of which can cause death by strangulation or
suffocation, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ann Brown, the safety commission head, said she had urged the nation's
hotels to join in what she called a ``pre-emptive strike'' to assure the safety
of their youngest guests.
</P>
<P>
	   And she expressed extreme disappointment that only one hotel group has
chosen to take part, Bass Hotels and Resorts. It operates Holiday Inn,
Inter-Continental and Crowne Plaza Hotels.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry trade group, the American Hotel &AMP; Motel Association, said in a
statement that it had had no opportunity to review the crib-safety campaign but
expressed no objections to it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The safety of all guests, including children, is a top priority for
hoteliers,'' the association statement said. ``We applaud (the commission's)
efforts to spotlight the importance of crib safety, and we encourage the lodging
industry to review the recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Brown said that while 40 infants die in crib-related accidents each year,
none of the incidents has been specifically linked to hotels or motels.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said the spot inspections performed by the National SAFE Kids
Campaign, which identified safety hazards in 82 percent of all inspected hotel
cribs, shows the potential for tragedy exists.
</P>
<P>
	   Heather Paul, executive director of the SAFE Kids Campaign, said the new
warning ``simply raises a red flag for the hotel industry that they might be
putting babies at risk.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want hotels to know there are simple steps they can take to help ensure
a safe sleeping environment for their youngest guests,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We should not have to wait for a front-page story of a baby dying in a
(hotel) crib for action to take place,'' she said. ``We shouldn't have to wait
for a body count.''
</P>
<P>
	   Brown said the inspection also discovered that more than half of all
portable play yards and playpens provided by hotel management also had at least
one safety hazard, including holes or tears in the meshing large enough to trap
and strangle babies.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission said it recommends that babies be placed on their backs for
sleep with no soft bedding, which it said can lead to suffocation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether the hotel is on Fifth Avenue or Main Street, there's no guarantee
the cribs you request will be safe and in good repair,'' Brown said. ``Parents
who are traveling should not have to worry about the place they put their child
down to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
	   The safety commission cited estimates it said show that children under 2
years old spend 7 million nights a year at the estimated 65,000 hotels and
motels in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>

	   The Consumer Product Safety Commission hotline, which has crib-safety and
recall information, is 1-800-638-2772.

<HEADLINE> Putin Defends Russian Army  </HEADLINE>
   By IVAN SEKRETAREV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VOLGOGRAD, Russia (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin defended the
Russian armed forces on Tuesday, calling talk of the army's collapse ``an open
lie.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is unfair and disrespectful to our soldiers and officers, especially
those now fighting in Chechnya,'' Putin declared during a whirlwind visit to the
southern Russian city of Volgograd.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's visit came on the eve of Defender of the Fatherland Day, a major
military holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian military has been in steady decline since the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and its reputation suffered huge damage during the last war in
Chechnya, in 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
	   Soldiers are underfed, underpaid and barely trained, and Russia's economic
woes mean the army hasn't received new weapons in years. Hazing is fierce and
endemic. Desertion, suicide, and alcoholism are rampant in the ranks, and
corruption is widespread among officers.
</P>
<P>
	   But Putin, who has championed the current war in Chechnya, said that talk of
the military's demise was wrong. ``The army is fulfilling its duties as it
should.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since coming to power on Dec. 31 following Boris Yeltsin's resignation, the
Soviet KGB veteran has repeatedly stressed his intention to enhance Russia's
military might. He has moved to increase Russia's defense budget and weapons
purchases from the ailing military-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
	   In Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad, Putin walked through the imposing Mamayev
Hill memorial, which marks some of the Soviet Union's heaviest battles of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
	   He spoke with veterans who had defended the city against Nazi forces, and
laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin also conferred with regional officials and toured a military hospital,
chatting with wounded soldiers. Upon hearing doctors' requests for additional
funds, Putin immediately ordered $347,200 to be given to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   His trip, heavily covered by Russian state media, was also a campaign swing.
It came a day after the Central Elections Commission completed the registration
of candidates for the March 26 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin leads the pack of 11 contenders and is expected to win easily.

<HEADLINE> Office Admits Genetic Patent Error  </HEADLINE>
    By COLLEEN BARRY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- The European Patent Office on Tuesday admitted it made a
mistake in granting a patent that critics claim would allow genetic manipulation
of human organs and cells.
</P>
<P>
	   Facing protests from European governments and environmentalists, the
Munich-based Patent Office said in a statement that the patent for research at
Scotland's University of Edinburgh was flawed.
</P>
<P>
	   The patent mistakenly omitted one term, "non-human," which would make clear
the approval does not apply to humans.
</P>
<P>
	   "We made a mistake," said Rainer Osterwalder, a spokesman for office
established in 1977 to centralize the patent grant system, which currently
includes 19 member countries. "This should not have been granted in the present
form."
</P>
<P>
	   The environmental group Greenpeace, which discovered the mistake and led
protests outside the Patent Office Tuesday, said the omission could be
misinterpreted and used to support genetic cloning.
</P>
<P>
	   The Patent Office denied, however, that the patent could be extended to
human cloning.
</P>
<P>
	   The patent refers to "a method of preparing a transgenic animal," but the
Patent Office said the term "non-human" should have been included because
"animal" can also refer to humans.
</P>
<P>
	   The patent technically violates EU guidelines that take effect July 31
banning "processes that would change the genetic identity of human organisms."
</P>
<P>
	   Osterwalder said the office was investigating how the mistake got through,
but he said inattention and a high volume of applications were likely to blame.
</P>
<P>
	   The patent, granted in December on a 1994 application, was sought for human
cell research leading to possible replacement of diseased human tissue, such as
that found in people suffering from Parkinson's disease, a spokeswoman at
Edinburgh University said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The patent does not relate in any sense to the cloning of human beings,"
the spokeswoman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   German and Italian politicians led protests Tuesday, pledging to file a
challenge, the only remedy available. The Patent Office said it could not
unilaterally undo the error.
</P>
<P>
	   German Health Minister Andrea Fischer said she would recommend Wednesday
that the German Cabinet issue a challenge to correct the "serious" error.
Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin said the decision "cannot be reconciled
with law and ethics."
</P>
<P>
	   Italy's EU policy minister, Patrizia Toia, said the Italian government may
likewise take legal action to intervene against what she called a "disastrous
decision."

<HEADLINE> SBC To Acquire Sterling Commerce  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- SBC Communications Inc. is acquiring Sterling Commerce
Inc. for $3.9 billion in a bid to grab part of the fast-growing
business-to-business Internet commerce market.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC's $44.25 a share offer for Sterling, which makes software that lets
businesses buy and sell goods and services on the Internet, is a 40 percent
premium over Sterling's Friday closing stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Sterling jumped nearly 38 percent Tuesday afternoon on the New
York Stock Exchange, up $11.93 3/4 to $43.50. SBC shares were down $2 to $36.25
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen McGaw, SBC's managing director for corporate development, defended
the purchase price, saying Sterling had been undervalued by the market, but also
acknowledged a short-term effect on SBC stock.
</P>
<P>
	   "All on its own, this business is slightly dilutive to SBC," McGaw said, but
added the company is not changing its earnings outlook for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition follows other moves by San Antonio-based SBC to transform
itself from just a provider of local phone service to a player in Internet
access and other services.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, SBC said it will invest $6 billion to become a leading provider
of high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
	   Sterling Commerce, based in Dublin, Ohio, operates online "communities"
where businesses can buy and sell goods and services and sells software that
lets customers exchange information. It reported 1999 revenues of $561 million.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC will merge Sterling with an SBC subsidiary. The deal is expected to
close in the next few months. Sterling, which has 2,300 employees, will keep
operations in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
	   Sterling began as a unit of Sterling Software, a provider of management
software. It has more than 42,000 customers -- including SBC -- in banking,
health care, telecommunications and other industries.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC, which leapfrogged over Bell Atlantic to become the nation's No. 1 phone
company when it bought Ameritech, operates nearly 60 million U.S. phone lines.
It has also made investments in fiber optics -- it is seeking federal approval
to begin long-distance service -- and recently struck a partnership with Prodigy
Communications, an Internet service provider.

<HEADLINE> High court clears way for lawsuit over HIV infection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A woman infected with the AIDS virus during a
blood transfusion can sue Danbury Hospital, the state Supreme Court ruled
Tuesday, reviving a lawsuit thrown out by a lower court.
<P>
	   Roberta Ann Sherwood had sued the hospital for negligence in 1996, 11 years
after she contracted HIV from contaminated blood she received while undergoing
back surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   A Superior Court judge had rejected the lawsuit, ruling that the claim
exceeded the three-year statute of limitations on filing suit in a medical
malpractice case.
</P>
<P>
	   The lower court also ruled against Sherwood's claim that the hospital
violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act by making a business
decision to use unscreened blood.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing of Sherwood's discovery she was infected with HIV, and when she
learned the source of the infection, are the key issues in the high court's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   On April 19, 1985, Sherwood was admitted to the hospital for back surgery
and was given four units of blood which had not been screened for the presence
of HIV antibodies.
</P>
<P>
	   A few days after the surgery the hospital received a notice from the
American Red Cross recalling all such untested blood.
</P>
<P>
	   On September 1, 1994, after a routine blood test ordered by her doctors,
Sherwood learned for the first time she had contracted HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   An investigation followed. According to the court's decision, Sherwood
learned for the first time on March 14, 1995, that the source of the infection
was the 1985 blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
	   The high court agreed that the hospital had not violated the state's unfair
trade practices statutes.
</P>
<P>
	   But Justice William J. Sullivan, writing for the majority, said a reasonable
jury could have found that basic standard of care required that Danbury Hospital
"to have taken steps to notify the plaintiff, after the transfusion, that the
blood she had received ... was not tested for HIV."
</P>
<P>
	   The decision sends the case back to Danbury Superior Court for trial on the
negligence issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Roland F. Young III, an attorney representing the hospital, said
administrators were disappointed, but said the ruling is not a finding that the
hospital acted inappropriately.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital could offer no other comment because the matter is still in
court, Young said.

    	   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) - Prosecutors in the trial of a police officer
charged with murder after the shooting of a suspect may try to show that the
officer's foot was on the suspect's back, a lawyer said.
<P>
	   Scott Smith, 28, is the first police officer in the state to be charged with
murder for an act in the line of duty. His trial is scheduled to begin Wednesday
morning in Litchfield Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith was charged after shooting 27-year-old Franklyn Reid once in the back
on Dec. 28, 1998. Reid was wanted on several warrants and fled on foot when
police tried to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Pattis, a New Haven attorney who is not involved in the Smith trial
but has handled other cases involving alleged police misconduct, said he
believes prosecutors may try to show that Smith's footprint was discovered on
Reid's back.
</P>
<P>
	   "That would raise serious questions on whether he was resisting or making a
furtive movement that would justify the officer's use of deadly force," Pattis
told The News-Times of Danbury.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor John Connelly and Smith's attorney, John Kelly, refused to
discuss the report, citing a gag order imposed by the judge.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith has said he believed Reid was reaching for a weapon. But during a
probable cause hearing last year, Connelly presented a witness who reported
seeing a police officer standing over the suspect, using his left hand to hold
the man's wrists behind his back.
</P>
<P>
	   The officer's left foot was on the black man's back and the officer held
what appeared to be a walkie-talkie over the man's head with his right hand, the
witness said
</P>
<P>
	   "That makes absolutely no sense," Kelly said at the time. "My client would
have shot himself in the left foot."
</P>
<P>
	   Reid was found carrying a knife with a 2-inch blade, but prosecutors say the
knife was out of reach in a jacket that had been discarded.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Judge Charles Gill rejected a request by prosecutors to move
the trial out of Litchfield, but criticized police and Smith's supporters for
"rash, and ill-advised and ill-considered" actions, such as rallies at the
courthouse and the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial comes less than a week a Hartford police officer was cleared in a
shooting that claimed the life of a 14-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
	   A special prosecutor declined to bring charges and ruled that Officer Robert
Allan had reason to believe his life was in danger when he shot Aquan Salmon in
the back. Allan had said he believed Salmon was reaching for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Gill has said he expects Smith's trial to continue until the middle of
March.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith is free on bond and has been placed on desk duty by the New Milford
police department.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A late round of bargain-hunting today halted a slide in the
Dow industrials in the first U.S. trading following last week's big drop.
</P>
<P>
	   But the bounce back from today's lows came too late to lift European
markets. As Wall Street retreated on interest rate jitters this morning,
European exchanges gave up early gains and a bid to recover from Monday's losses
faltered. Stocks closed lower in Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, at one point down almost 115 points,
finished the day up 85.32 at 10,304.84 in active trading. The Nasdaq composite
index, off as much as 120 points during trading, regained some lost ground and
closed down 29.62 at 4,382.12.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week's selloff encouraged some investors to shop for bargains today,
but interest rate worries continued to hang over the market.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. stocks plunged on Friday, carrying the Dow down 295 points and the
Nasdaq down 137 after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested more
rate increases may be needed to cool off the economy and keep inflation under
control. U.S. financial markets were closed Monday in observance of Presidents
Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the National Association for Business Economics predicted the economy
would grow at a slower rate this year and next and said it now expects at least
two more interest rate increases by the Fed this year. And William McDonough,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the central bank would
continue to use higher interest rates as an inflation-fighting tool so long as
the demand side of the economy remains robust.
</P>
<P>
	   European markets, which had been recovering today after a big drop Monday,
gave up gains after Wall Street turned lower.
</P>
<P>
	   The DAX index in Frankfurt, Germany, closed with a 0.2 percent gain after
being up more than 1 percent earlier in the day, and London's FTSE-100 Share
Index fell 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   A second straight day of selling in Asia earlier today hit high-tech shares
particularly hard.

<HEADLINE> Judge orders hearing on city's homeless shelter plans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan judge ruled Tuesday that the city may not
force homeless adults to accept workfare jobs in exchange for city shelter.
<P>
	   State Supreme Court Justice Stanley Sklar said the law city officials cite
in support of the requirement may be constitutional, but it violates a consent
decree that requires the city to give shelter for every needy adult who seeks
it.
</P>
<P>
	   The law requiring the homeless to work stems from a 1995 regulation issued
by the state Department of Social Services at the city's request. It requires
anyone seeking shelter in New York City - even for one night - to comply with
welfare eligibility rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The city has been trying to put the rules into effect since the law was
enacted. The rules also require people seeking shelter to be evaluated for
substance abuse rehabilitation, educational programs, and workfare.
</P>
<P>
	   But back in 1981, the city signed a consent decree in which it agreed to
provide shelter to every needy, single adult man who asked for it, and in 1983
it signed a similar agreement for single adult women.
</P>
<P>
	   Sklar ruled that the consent decree holds. The DSS regulation, while legal,
"is declared null and void as it pertains to the population of single adult
homeless persons who are the subject of the consent decree."
</P>
<P>
	   Sklar's ruling applies only to single adults, but lawyers for the homeless
could invoke the equal protection doctrine and ask the courts to extend the
ruling to homeless families with children.
</P>
<P>
	   The city has said it wants to take legal action toward removing children
from adults who refuse workfare jobs because those adults would be denied
shelter, and therefore they would not be providing properly for the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has pushed to put the workfare rules into
effect, denounced Tuesday's decision, saying, "I expect the Court of Appeals to
reverse it pretty quickly."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani also took a swipe at Sklar, saying the ruling came as no surprise,
"given the predispositions of the judge."
</P>
<P>
	   "Justice Sklar is clinging to his desire for a city of dependents," the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   "What he's missing is that since that consent decree there's been the
welfare reform law, a change of law and regulations in the state of New York,"
the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, called
the ruling a "legal slam-dunk" and said Sklar "recognized that the consent
decree's fundamental purpose was to save human life."
</P>
<P>
	   Brosnahan said Sklar found neither the law nor the facts of the case had
changed in ways that would force a modification of 1981 consent agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   "This ruling is a tremendous political blow to Mr. Giuliani," said
Brosnahan. "His position (on homeless issues) has been clearly calculated for
the conservative Upstate vote."
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Banks, a lawyer who works on behalf of the homeless, said Sklar's
ruling "is an important decision that prevents the city from going ahead with a
flawed plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's in nobody's interest to have socially and physically dysfunctional
individuals sleeping on the streets," Banks said.

<HEADLINE> Marriott Sued Over Real Estate  </HEADLINE>
    By KELLEY SHANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Don Burklew of King George, Va., considers himself a
conservative investor.
</P>
<P>
	   So when Burklew saw the opportunity to buy into a limited partnership
offered by Marriott, the well-known and long-established hotel and hospitality
giant, he jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
	   With an initial outlay of $100,000 in 1987 and a projected payoff of almost
$300,000 at the end of 2001, when he would be 62, Burklew viewed the investment
as a significant portion of his retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
	   But those gains haven't materialized, and now Burklew and hundreds of other
investors in the Courtyard by Marriott II Limited Partnership are suing over
what they claim was a bad business deal loaded with false promises.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other claims, they say the hotel property was overpriced and that
Marriott charged excessive management fees and knowingly presented inflated
profit projections to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   While investors have received some return on their money, they say it is far
below expectations and is unlikely to be anywhere close to the original
projections when the partnership ends next year. They are seeking a damage award
that could reach $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   "To say that I'm disappointed is an understatement," said Burklew. "A
good-sized percentage of my planned retirement has been stolen from me."
</P>
<P>
	   A pretrial hearing in the class-action fraud lawsuit against Host Marriott
Corp., Marriott International Inc. and other defendants associated with the
limited partnership is scheduled Thursday in San Antonio, with jury selection
expected the following week. Both side are still trying to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Marriott defendants deny any wrongdoing and say the Courtyard by
Marriott II Limited Partnership was intended for wealthy, sophisticated
investors aware of the potential hazards of big real estate ventures.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very high-risk investment," said Tom Cunningham, a lawyer for Host
Marriott. He referred further questions to Marriott officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Profits for the limited partners were not as large as anticipated because of
a decline in the real estate market in the late 1980s, Marriott officials
contend. The Persian Gulf War and an economic recession on the travel industry
in the early 1990s also hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   "But far from turning its back on investors during this time, which was
quite troubled, Marriott took steps to ensure that investors would receive
adequate returns and not lose their properties," said Tom Marder, a spokesman
for Marriott International.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the investors claim the Marriott Corp. -- which since has
split into two companies -- used limited partnerships and its Courtyard hotels
as a "growth vehicle" while shifting its emphasis from hotel ownership to
management.
</P>
<P>
	   Limited partnerships were prevalent in the real estate world during the
liquidity of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Courtyard by Marriott II Limited Partnership was sold to investors in 1987.
The limited partnership purchased 70 Courtyard By Marriott hotels for $643
million.
</P>
<P>
	   In most cases it bought only the hotels and not the land beneath them, which
Marriott or its subsidiaries retained and leased to the limited partnership.
</P>
<P>
	   The investor plaintiffs contend the hotel purchase amount was "grossly
overpriced" in what Marriott knew was an overbuilt hotel market and that what
was supposed to be an independent appraisal of the properties' value was
conducted by a company with ties to Marriott.
</P>
<P>
	   Disgruntled investors also claim Marriott, through a subsidiary, charged an
unreasonable management fee for the hotels of 6 percent of gross revenues,
compared with an industry norm of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Marriott knew that this deal was a dog from Day One," said Jim Moriarty of
Houston, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers. "In fact, their own numbers showed that
this deal was going to be a disaster for the investors."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite lower-than-expected profits, investors still have received returns
averaging 7 percent annually, and even slightly higher in recent years,
according to Marriott.
</P>
<P>
	   The investors say they expected at least a 16 percent return, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Burklew believes if the lawsuit goes to trial his side will prevail. But he
fears there would be years of appeals, and that may mean that some of the
investors -- two-thirds of whom are over 65, according to Moriarty -- will never
reap their profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "I will be lucky to see the day that the appeals are over and the money is
paid," he said. "My grandkids might see it, or my kids."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Stand on Taiwan Worries U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration expressed concern Tuesday over
a warning by China that it could use force if Taiwan delays indefinitely
reunification talks with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. diplomats relayed the administration's concerns to Chinese authorities
in Beijing and Washington just a day after China issued the threat in an
11,000-page position paper.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart recalled that the
United States sent two aircraft carriers and other warships to the region to
calm a crisis four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We reject any use of force or any threat of force in this situation,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that peaceful dialogue and bilateral engagement between the
sides is the way to move forward,'' he said. ``We have repeated, I think, in
both actions and words that we view any threat to Taiwan with grave concern.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Stanley O. Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Chinese
position paper appeared to be contrary to ``the policy that is the bedrock of
our relations'' with China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of Congress, where support for Taiwan runs strong, suggested the
administration was not repudiating the Chinese with enough force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to articulate more clearly where we are,'' said Sen. Craig Thomas,
R-Wyo., chairman of the East Asian and Pacific subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said China's statement ``is unacceptable'' and
that the administration had the responsibility to make sure that China ``not
misinterpret where we are -- in one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the State Department, spokesman James P. Rubin said it would be a mistake
to exaggerate the significance of the Chinese statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had much worse periods on this question in the past,'' he said. He
added that the administration is not considering any change in its opposition to
legislation before Congress to strengthen U.S.-Taiwanese military relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said military ties with Taiwan, authorized under the Taiwan Relations
Act, has enabled the United States to be ``second-to-none'' in its support of
the anti-communist bastion. He said that arrangement has served U.S. interests
extremely well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody should doubt our willingness to act in our own national interest,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, China fired nuclear-capable missiles near Taiwan's two largest
ports, prompting the United States to send two aircraft carriers and other
warships to the region.
</P>
<P>
	   China's muscle-flexing at the time was related to impending presidential
elections. The new threat from Beijing appeared aimed at influencing
presidential elections on Taiwan set for next month. Analysts said China seems
intent on discouraging support for the candidate most identified with the
pro-independence sector on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart recalled that in 1996, ``we responded appropriately to what was
viewed as a threat. And that should give you some indication of how we view this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said there has been no change in
U.S. military operations in the Pacific in response to the threat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is only rhetoric at this point,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bacon said ``it would be extremely difficult for China to carry out an
invasion'' of Taiwan, given the Chinese military's limited capacity to execute a
large amphibious operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Lin Chong-pin, Taiwan's vice chairman of a council that handles Taiwan's
China policy, would not directly address the new threat but said tensions would
not ease as long as Beijing refuses to acknowledge that China is split and each
side is controlled by a separate government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until we unify, both sides of course will have different views about what
'one China' means,'' Lin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest flare-up comes amid President Clinton's drive to win
congressional approval of permanent trading benefits for China, part of a deal
to admit Beijing into the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules for
global trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents are likely to seize on the new Chinese stand in hopes of blocking
the trade package. Lockhart insisted that it should not affect the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The agreement is very much in our country's interest and our national
interest,'' he said. ``This is a one-sided agreement benefiting American
business, American workers, American families. We should move forward on that
basis.''

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Earnings Rise With Oil Price  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON BARKHO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A handful of protein biscuits seems like too little,
too late for Zakiya Abdulrahman's family.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the biscuits are a windfall for the pregnant woman with five
children whose family's income is less than $1 per day -- and they are possible
only because of a rise in world oil prices. The costly oil means Iraq is earning
more money under the U.N. oil-for-food program designed to let it skirt trade
sanctions for the good of its people.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently, that has meant a small improvement for Abdulrahman and nearly
5,000 other malnourished mothers and children in the low-income Baghdad
neighborhood of Mashahda: six high protein biscuits a month per person. That is
in addition to free rations of rice, flour, legumes, sugar and tea distributed
under an earlier phase of the oil-for-food project.
</P>
<P>
	   But Abdulrahman and her five children are still in dire need. Abdulrahman's
husband earns his tiny income selling groceries from a cart. Her 11-month-old
boy weighed 13 pounds -- the norm for that age is almost 20 pounds -- when a
community care volunteer put him on an electronic scale.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past three months, regular power cuts in Abdulrahman's neighborhood
have lasted as long as 16 hours a day. Broken pipes inundate some streets with
sewage. Children scour garbage heaps in search of used tin cans and bottles they
can sell to recyclers.
</P>
<P>
	   Such misery exists despite Iraq's oil reserves, and despite the fact that
the price of the crude basket of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries has risen from a low of below $11 a barrel in 1998 to more than $27.
</P>
<P>
	   While the increase has boosted Iraq's revenues, it isn't doing much to help
the country's poor because much of the money is either taken away or blocked by
the United Nations, Iraqi officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is not allowed to freely sell its oil on world markets under sanctions
imposed to punish it for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions cannot be
lifted until U.N. inspectors certify Iraq is not producing weapons of mass
destruction. Iraq has barred inspectors for the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   The sanctions have crippled Iraq's economy. But in December 1996, the
oil-for-food exception was instituted.
</P>
<P>
	   At first, it allowed Iraq's government to sell $2 billion worth of oil every
six months on the condition that the proceeds are used to buy food and other
essentials for ordinary Iraqis. The financial ceiling was raised to $5.2 billion
in 1998, and a December 1999 U.N. resolution removed it altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   All told, Iraq has sold about $22 billion worth of oil under the program,
officials estimate. So far, though, the government has earmarked only $30
million of the proceeds to combat widespread malnutrition among children and
pregnant and nursing mothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz charges that his country is the last to
benefit from the oil sales. He has said about $7.7 billion of total earnings
have been funneled to a U.N. fund to compensate the victims of Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait. The money also covers U.N. expenses incurred in administering the
program and dismantling Iraq's war machine.
</P>
<P>
	   Tariq also says the U.N. sanctions committee is blocking Iraq from buying
commodities for its people and its oil industry. He charges that commodities
contracts worth more than $8 billion are either blocked or have not reached Iraq
yet.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, about 15 percent of the revenues are earmarked for Iraq's
Kurdish north, an area outside Baghdad's control. All of those subtractions
together, Iraq says, leave few funds to do what the oil-for-food program was
intended to do -- help Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. and British diplomats say the Baghdad government hoards medicines
instead of distributing them to hospitals and is refusing to rid itself of
weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles. They maintain that in the
absence of weapons monitors, Iraq will acquire equipment and spare parts to
reinstate its weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, smuggled oil is pouring out of Iraq and onto the markets, the
U.S. Navy says.
</P>
<P>
	   Although smugglers sell for less than the legitimate market rate, their
prices go up with world market prices. Smuggled oil revenues go straight to the
Iraqi regime's coffers and can be used in any way Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
sees fit, observers say.
</P>
<P>
	   The wrangling between Iraq and the United Nations has taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
	   Two senior U.N. relief officials in Baghdad resigned this week, frustrated
at the disputes. The two, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Hans von Sponeck and
U.N. World Food Program chief Jutta Burghardt, said they feared the spats
between the sides will continue -- and the suffering of innocent civilians will
worsen.
</P>
<P>
	   They also said they don't believe Iraq is trying to misuse the oil-for-food
funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't have the impression that there is a willful act'' on the part of
the government to divert equipment to military use or hoard supplies, von
Sponeck said.
</P>
<P>
	   For Abdulrahman, like millions of other Iraqis, it is a political game for
which she and her children are paying a heavy price.

<HEADLINE> Schwarz: I wasn't in precinct for Louima attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The police officer convicted of restraining Abner Louima
while a second cop sodomized the bleeding suspect with a broom handle testified
Tuesday that he wasn't even inside the precinct house when the brutal attack
occurred.
<P>
	   Charles Schwarz, testifying for the first time about that infamous August
1997 night, said he was conducting a routine "field search" of his patrol car
when Officer Justin Volpe was apparently attacking the Haitian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly nervous, but speaking in a calm, clear voice, the 34-year-old
Schwarz said he had only accompanied Louima from the patrol car to the front
desk of the 70th Precinct. The attack by rogue cop Volpe occurred in a bathroom
inside the precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz's lawyer, Ronald Fischetti, asked his client who had escorted Louima
from the desk to the rear of the precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it was Tommy Wiese," Schwarz replied. "I'm not 100 percent sure,
but I think it was him."
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, Wiese, and Officer Thomas Bruder are on trial in Brooklyn federal
court for conspiring to obstruct justice by concealing Schwarz's role as the
second officer who held Louima down during the broomstick attack.
</P>
<P>
	   But Schwarz insisted that he was outside the precinct, inspecting his patrol
car for weapons or contraband that Louima might have dumped after his arrest.
Such inspections were standard after an arrest, Schwarz testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz was convicted at an earlier trial of violating Louima's civil rights
by assisting in the attack, but he didn't testify in that case. He could face a
life sentence on the conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   Last May, Volpe pleaded guilty to violating Louima's civil rights and was
sentenced to 30 years. Last week, telling the full story for the first time
under oath, Volpe said that Wiese - not Schwarz - was present, but did not
intervene.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz testified that he was unaware of what happened following Louima's
arrest outside a Brooklyn nightclub until two days later, when detectives from
Internal Affairs began grabbing broomsticks and mop handles from the precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   "I assumed they thought he had been beaten with broomsticks or a mop
handle," said Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   Louima suffered severe internal injuries, including a ruptured bladder and
colon, and spent two months in the hospital after the Aug. 9, 1997 attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, a police investigator testified that Louima picked his torturer out
of a police photo array, but was unable to identify the second officer in the
bathroom when he was sodomized.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Reinaldo Daniels, who tape-recorded a hospital interview with Louima
while heading the department's internal investigation of the attack, also
admitted under defense questioning that he improperly corrected errors in his
written report.
</P>
<P>
	   The veteran detective conceded that he never showed Louima a picture of
Wiese, 34, who claims that he entered the bathroom as Volpe stood over the
Haitian immigrant, bloody stick in hand.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did he (Louima) tell you the second officer was just standing there, doing
nothing?" Fischetti asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," replied Daniels.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischetti showed jurors four sets of photos, each containing six mug shots
of cops. They were the same pictures shown to Louima at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The victim failed to pick out Schwarz, Daniels testified, but when he saw
Volpe's mug shot, "his eyes opened up like half dollars."

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Cuban Diplomat May Face Arrest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said Tuesday that a Cuban diplomat
who has been ordered out of the country will lose his diplomatic privileges if
Cuba continues to insist that he remain here.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be highly unusual for a state to refuse to remove a diplomat
under these circumstances, '' spokesman James P. Rubin said. ``Under the Vienna
Convention on diplomatic relations, Cuba must either recall the diplomat in
question or terminate his functions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin added that if the diplomat does not leave, he will lose his immunity
from prosecution and would become subject to U.S. law.
</P>

	   On Saturday, the State Department ordered the diplomat, Jose Imperatori, to
leave the country within seven days because of alleged links with a U.S.
immigration official arrested last week in Miami on charges of spying for Cuba.

that Imperatori was being declared a persona non grata and had until Saturday to

	   Dow Ends Up 85.32; Nasdaq Off 31.07
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed in a volatile day on Wall
Street today as investors, while searching for bargain stocks, were
dogged by worries about interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial
average, which had been down as much as 115 points early in the
day, rallied to close up 85.32 at 10,304.84. The technology-focused
Nasdaq composite index, however, was unable to shake off concerns
about interest rates and fell 31.07 to 4,380.67. ``The average
investor is looking for the opportunity to step in here, but with
the pressure that's been created by the Federal Reserve, this could
drag on for a while,'' Bob Dickey, managing director of technical
analysis at Dain Rauscher Wessels, said.

<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Mobile communications will take center
stage when the world's biggest computer and technology convention
starts Thursday in Hanover. Nearly 8,000 companies will show off
the latest gadgets, coolest computers and hot-selling software.
``This year, going mobile is hot -- making things cheaper and
smaller -- especially being able to communicate with the Internet
from handheld devices,'' said Monika Brandt, spokeswoman for the
CeBit 2000 fair. Hundreds of companies will be showcasing mobile
technologies ranging from handheld computers to satellites. Part of
the new push is toward machines that communicate with each other,
such as parking meters or vending machines that radio in when they

	   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The latest effort by airlines to boost
fares by up to $30 per round trip has stalled, with several
airlines declining to go along with the move. Continental started
the latest round of increases on Friday, citing escalating fuel
prices. Five other large airlines, including American, matched the
increase. But Southwest Airlines, Northwest Airlines and America
West were among the holdouts that chose not to raise prices. Faced
with rivals offering lower prices on the same routes, American
rolled back its increase two days after putting it in effect, as

<HEADLINE> FedEx Pulls 'Wizard of Oz' Ad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- FedEx Corp. has pulled its "Wizard of Oz" commercial that
debuted on the Super Bowl after hearing complaints that it may give youngsters
the impression that it was okay to "huff" inhalants.
</P>
<P>
	   The commercial mixed clips from the movie classic with images of a FedEx
truck delivering helium-filled balloons to three Munchkins whose voices
inexplicably sank as they serenaded the newly arrived Dorothy. Their high pitch
is restored after they inhale helium from the balloons.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokeswoman Carla Boyd said the Memphis-based delivery company pulled the ad
from the planned commercial rotation on Feb. 14 after it had been running for
about two weeks. She said its ad agency is looking "at possibilities for
revising the spot."
</P>
<P>
	   "We had some individuals contact us and we want to be responsive to our
customers," she said, declining to be specific about the number of complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those who asked that the ad be withdrawn was Harvey Weiss, director of
the National Inhalant Prevention Council, a Texas-based organization that works
to discourage the practice of "huffing" inhalants to get high.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiss said his group began getting calls and messages about the ad soon
after it was shown on the Super Bowl telecast on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   "They felt it sent the wrong message to young people that it was okay to
huff and was fun to huff and to put some sort of gas into your body," he aid.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he called FedEx the next day and asked that the ad be pulled. He
said he considered it a "courageous decision on their part to pull it" given how
much the company had probably invested in creating and running the ad.
</P>
<P>
	   It cost an average $2.2 million just to run a 30-second ad on the Super
Bowl. FedEx wouldn't disclose what it cost to produce the commercial.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyd said FedEx had consulted with national health and toxicology officials
before making the commercial and was assured that helium was not a drug and was
nontoxic and that it posed no health threat.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are just waiting for our ad agency to come back to us," she said, adding
there was no timetable for making a decision on what to do with the ad.

<HEADLINE> World Premieres, Tribute To Copland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A world premiere of a work by a Puerto Rican composer and
a centenary tribute to Aaron Copland will mark the 70th season of the National
Symphony Orchestra, beginning Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberto Sierra's "Fandangos," tracing the history of that dance music, will
be played next year on Feb. 28, March 2 and March 3, under the baton of music
director Leonard Slatkin. The Philadelphia Orchestra also commissioned a work by
Sierra in 1998, to mark its 100th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
	   Copland, who died in 1990, would have been 100 this year. In 1979 he led the
first of the orchestra's concerts on the lawn of the Capitol, now a regular,
nationally-televised program. The following year a televised performance honored
his 80th birthday. Slatkin will direct six Copland works Sept. 21, 22 and 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Another world premiere in the coming season will be the "Percussion
Concerto" of Steve Martland, a rock composer, part of a British Festival by the
orchestra between May 3 and 19, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual Beethoven Festival, 10 performances in September, will
concentrate on his work as retouched by Gustav Mahler, himself a distinguished
composer in the Viennese tradition. Mahler died in 1911.
</P>
<P>
	   "For those who know this music well, you'll have fun spotting the
differences," Slatkin said in announcing the season. "And for those who are just
coming to hear Beethoven, it's still Beethoven."

<HEADLINE> Truckers protest soaring fuel prices at Capitol  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Independent truckers drove their big rigs Tuesday
through city streets to Capitol Hill to protest diesel fuel prices and demand
tax breaks to offset greatly increased operating costs.
<P>
	   "We're dying," said Douglas Sorantino, a rally organizer and New Jersey
truck driver. "We need help now. If they don't do it tomorrow, we won't be
around 60 or 90 days from now."
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 truckers joined a convoy that began in New Jersey and traveled
through Delaware and Maryland before snaking its way through the nation's
capital to a rally on the Capitol steps.
</P>
<P>
	   Police escorted the truckers, horns blaring, along the protest route and
finally through city streets near the Capitol cordoned off to allow parking for
the huge rigs. The truckers walked to the Capitol, some carrying signs that read
"Enough is Enough" and "Will Work for Fuel."
</P>
<P>
	   Truckers are angry that gasoline prices have been rising steadily since last
March, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut crude oil
production by 7.5 percent, or more than 2 million barrels a day, to boost prices
that had fallen to 12-year lows.
</P>
<P>
	   Increases in diesel fuel prices are costing truckers as much as $100 a day,
some haulers contended. They said the cost eventually will throw them out of
business and wreak havoc on an economy that depends on trucks to transport 90
percent of goods, including food, clothing, cars and appliances.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Hentz, a spokesman for the New Jersey group, said truckers can't
charge enough to meet their overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a funeral procession," he said. "If you don't do something about
the cost of fuel and tolls in the next 60 days, we're buried."
</P>
<P>
	   The trucks were adorned with hand-lettered signs. Among them was one on the
back of a dump truck that read: "Thank a trucker. If you live in it, if you wear
it, if you eat it, we brought it to you."
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Cornell, 35, of Browns Mills, N.J., said he sacrificed $400 by not
working Tuesday and for the cost of the fuel and tolls for the trip. But he said
he thinks it's worth it to make the point.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., who attended the rally, told
truckers, "When your industry comes to a standstill, this nation does, too."
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., sent President Clinton a letter Tuesday saying
rising prices of fuel and home heating oil should be considered "a national
emergency."
</P>
<P>
	   The spiraling costs are perhaps most apparent in the Northeast - Vermont,
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts and Connecticut - where diesel
costs average $1.86 a gallon, the American Automobile Association said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York and the District of Columbia prices have climbed as high as
$2.04 and $1.92 a gallon respectively, AAA said. Meanwhile, motorists are paying
about $1.37 a gallon for unleaded fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the nationwide average for diesel was $1.07 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   With some large trucks averaging just 5.5 miles per gallon and fuel tanks
that hold as much as 150 gallons, truckers say their costs are astronomical.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're gouging us with the prices," said Harry Greco, a driver from
Skippack, Pa. "It's out of control. Something has to be done."
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters want Congress and President Clinton to repeal or suspend a 24
cent federal excise tax paid at the pump on diesel and investigate OPEC.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday that repealing the tax is
not a "viable option" since most of the money goes toward building highways that
truckers use.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been doing things to make sure that more product gets (to the
Northeast)," Lockhart said. "We have some evidence now that prices are coming
down, and we'll continue to watch the situation."
</P>
<P>
	   Truckers also are asking the White House to release oil from a government
reserve of almost 600 million barrels. Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan cautioned against tapping the reserve, which he said should be used
only to counter a crisis such as a total shutdown of Middle East oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to diesel fuel and gasoline, the crunch also is being felt by
home heating oil consumers, whose costs have doubled in some parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts believe OPEC will come under increasing pressure - especially from
industrialized nations such as the United States - to raise production at its
meeting in late March. Some caution, however, that such a move won't bring a
precipitous drop in prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will cool them off, and it will shave the peak in summer," said Roger
Diwan, managing director for global oil markets at The Petroleum Finance Co. in
Washington. But he cautioned: "I don't think they are going to cool off
dramatically."

<HEADLINE> Study Examines Estrogen, Alzheimer's  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Research has suggested that women who take estrogen are less
likely to develop Alzheimer's. But a new study found that once the mind-robbing
disease sets in, the female hormone offers no benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   A year of estrogen did nothing to slow the progression of the disease or
improve mental functioning in 120 older women with mild to moderate Alzheimer's,
according to the study in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "Overall, the results of this study do not support the role of estrogen in
the treatment" of Alzheimer's, wrote the researchers, led by neuroscientist Ruth
A. Mulnard of the University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
	   Alzheimer's affects more than 4 million Americans, stealing their memories
and ability to care for themselves. About twice as many women as men have the
incurable disease, in part because they tend to live longer.
</P>
<P>
	   Its causes are unknown, but suggestions that the decline in estrogen levels
in women at menopause might somehow make them more vulnerable to the disease
have prompted interest in the hormone as a possible treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest study, the women, age 60 and older, were given either a low
estrogen dose, a high dose or a placebo every day for a year. No significant
differences were found among the groups in tests of mental function, mood,
memory, attention, language skills or motor function.
</P>
<P>
	   Women taking the low-dose estrogen showed improvement in one measure of
mental function after two months, but the gains disappeared.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, those taking estrogen fared worse than the placebo group in a
rating of dementia.
</P>
<P>
	   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Bennett A. Shaywitz and Sally E. Shaywitz
of Yale University called the findings "clear and unequivocal" but said more
study is warranted.
</P>
<P>
	   "Still unanswered are questions concerning, for example, whether estrogen
given in the early postmenopausal period can prevent or delay the onset of
Alzheimer's disease or diminish its severity," they wrote.

<HEADLINE> Senate May Sanction Iran Suppliers  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brushing aside opposition from the administration, the
Senate is moving to compel the president to be more aggressive in tracking
Russia and other countries that supply weapons materiel to Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, taken up by the Senate Tuesday, also could restrict payments to
Russia in connection with the International Space Station. The bill is expected
to win the Senate's overwhelming approval when it votes Thursday, much as
similar legislation sailed through the House last September, 419-0.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill came up as Iran counted votes in an election expected to put
pro-reform politicians in power. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
said he hoped the legislation would help the reformers against those bent on
harming the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The danger is still there, and those who are in charge of nuclear
proliferation in Iran have a very strong grip on what's being done,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the legislation, the president would be required to submit reports to
Congress every six months to identify countries providing Iran with materiel to
promote its missile and weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The president would have the option of cutting off arms sales or economic
aid to nations helping Iran's weapons programs. He could waive sanctions for
national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill also says the United States could make payments to the Russian
space agency for helping build the International Space Station only after the
president determines that Russia is actively opposing proliferation in Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill ``sends a message to our friends in Russia about the intensity of
our concern about their part in helping Iran develop weapons of mass
destruction,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. He said it also reminds the
administration of ``the broad bipartisan concern here in Congress in support of
tougher action against any nation, including Russia,'' that boosts Iran's
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
	   The president vetoed legislation in 1998 that, unlike the current bill,
would have required sanctions against those helping Iran build missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Heading off a possible veto override, Vice President Al Gore shortly
thereafter announced sanctions on seven Russian entities suspected of
transferring weapons technology to Iran. In 1999 three more Russian groups were
added to the list.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislators now say the administrative action, while needed, did not go far
enough. Lott said Russia, as well as China and North Korea, have not
sufficiently opposed the clandestine transfer of materiel to Iran. The
administration strategy ``has failed to slow the flow of this dangerous
technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott and others pointed to CIA warnings this year that Iran may be closer
than previously believed to amassing a nuclear arsenal and that Russia, already
a top supplier of weapons to Iran, had agreed to sell Iran more nuclear reactors
for power generation.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration, after the House passed the measure last year, threatened
a veto on the ground that it would ``have the effect of undermining multilateral
support that is vital to effectively fight proliferation.'' It said the Russians
had also enacted tough export control legislation and taken steps to end
contacts with Iran's missile program.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic lawmakers said that while the administration still opposes the
bill, the president will not veto it in light of changes made to give him more
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE -- The bill number is H.R. 1883.

<HEADLINE> SBC To Acquire Sterling Commerce  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- SBC Communications Inc. is acquiring Sterling Commerce
Inc. for $3.9 billion in a bid to grab part of the fast-growing
business-to-business Internet commerce market.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC's $44.25 a share offer for Sterling, which makes software that lets
businesses buy and sell goods and services on the Internet, is a 40 percent
premium over Sterling's Friday closing stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Sterling jumped 38 percent Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange, up $12 to $43.56 1/4. SBC shares fell $2 to $36.25.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen McGaw, SBC's managing director for corporate development, defended
the purchase price, saying Sterling had been undervalued by the market, but also
acknowledged a short-term effect on SBC stock.
</P>
<P>
	   "All on its own, this business is slightly dilutive to SBC," McGaw said, but
added the company is not changing its earnings outlook for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition follows other moves by San Antonio-based SBC to transform
itself from just a provider of local phone service to a player in Internet
access and other services.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, SBC said it will invest $6 billion to become a leading provider
of high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
	   Sterling Commerce, based in Dublin, Ohio, operates online "communities"
where businesses can buy and sell goods and services and sells software that
lets customers exchange information. It reported 1999 revenues of $561 million.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC will merge Sterling with an SBC subsidiary. The deal is expected to
close in the next few months. Sterling, which has 2,300 employees, will keep
operations in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
	   Sterling began as a unit of Sterling Software, a provider of management
software. It has more than 42,000 customers -- including SBC -- in banking,
health care, telecommunications and other industries.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC, which leapfrogged over Bell Atlantic to become the nation's No. 1 phone
company when it bought Ameritech, operates nearly 60 million U.S. phone lines.
It has also made investments in fiber optics -- it is seeking federal approval
to begin long-distance service -- and recently struck a partnership with Prodigy
Communications, an Internet service provider.

<HEADLINE> SEC Sues Two Day-Trading Firms  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators, taking their first major action
against companies in the day-trading industry, on Tuesday sued two firms and
nine people for allegedly making loans to trader customers that exceeded legal
limits.
</P>
<P>
	   One firm, Investment Street Co., and two of its executives agreed in a
settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay fines; the other,
All-Tech Direct Inc., is fighting the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   The electronic day-trading industry has attracted several thousand
individual investors nationwide, who are distinct from the 10 million or so
Americans who occasionally trade stocks over the Internet. Day traders engage in
the risky practice of riding the stock market's ups and downs, trying to squeeze
out profits by rapidly buying and selling shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Host firms such as Investment Street and All-Tech provide trading
facilities, computers and specialized software for their customers, who usually
pay the firms a commission on each trade.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC alleged, in separate administrative actions, that Investment Street
and All-Tech, which also are brokerage firms under the agency's jurisdiction,
violated federal margin lending rules. Investors buy stocks on margin by
borrowing part of the purchase price from their brokerage firm or day-trading
firm and putting up the securities as collateral for the loan.
</P>
<P>
	   Margin requirements, set by the Federal Reserve, generally limit borrowing
to 50 percent of a stock's purchase price. Brokerage and day-trading firms are
allowed to set limits stricter than 50 percent for their customers but they
cannot allow them to borrow more than half of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
	   Investment Street, based in Miami, neither admitted to nor denied the
allegations in agreeing to the settlement. Investment Street and Dynamic Trading
of Miami Inc., which provided administrative services for Investment Street,
together agreed to pay a $25,000 fine and to refrain from future violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Javier Saenz, president of Investment Street, and Emilio Sardi, one of its
directors, each agreed to pay a $5,500 fine and be suspended from the brokerage
industry for six months and three months, respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC said that Montvale, N.J.-based All-Tech, one of the biggest
day-trading firms, made margin loans by using the money of three people
associated with the firm.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency alleged that All-Tech and seven associated people were
responsible for making 103 unsecured loans to customers in 1998 to meet margin
calls totaling more than $3.6 million. In a margin call, an investor is asked to
come up with more money in order to meet the minimum requirement in his or her
trading account.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC also alleged that four All-Tech executives -- President Mark Shefts;
Harry Lefkowitz, vice president of operations; Lisa Esposito, head of the firm's
margin department; and Barry Parish, manager of its San Diego office -- aided
the violations by authorizing the margin loans to customers or otherwise helping
them get made.
</P>
<P>
	   "The SEC charges are groundless and baseless," All-Tech's associate general
counsel, Franklin Ogele, said by telephone. "We intend to defend ourselves
vigorously ... and we believe we will be exonerated."
</P>
<P>
	   Harvey Houtkin, All-Tech's founder and chief executive, has been an
outspoken defender of the day-trading industry.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC and state securities regulators have been concerned about what they
say is an excessive reliance on margin loans by day traders who do not have the
money to meet margin requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   The practice of day-trading on margin came under a public spotlight last
July, when trader Mark Barton shot and killed nine people at two day-trading
firms in Atlanta, including a local office of All-Tech, before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Barton, who had received large margin loans, is believed to have lost nearly
half a million dollars in his day trading -- including $153,000 in one three-day
"binge."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-policing
brokers' group, have scrutinized firms in the day-trading business to see if
they make unrealistic promises of quick riches to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt told Congress in September that several
day-trading firms have used deceptive advertising to lure investors. He said the
agency's inquiry also found that many firms have lax compliance with securities
laws, including sloppy record keeping and inadequate supervision of employees.

<HEADLINE> IRA: Won't Link Disarmament UK Moves  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Irish Republican Army said Tuesday it
was unwilling to start disarming as part of a package of conciliatory steps
involving the British military in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   An IRA spokesman, briefing journalists in Belfast, dismissed suggestions
that the British army could take part in a proposed ``day of reconciliation,''
during which the outlawed IRA would be expected to begin scrapping its weapons
in support of Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The governments of Britain and Ireland -- which in March 1999 proposed
creating a reconciliation-themed holiday as a way to encourage disarmament --
have resurrected the idea at a moment when political progress appears to hinge
on persuading the IRA to drop its blanket refusal to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The decommissioning of weaponry must be a voluntary act,'' the IRA
spokesman said on condition of anonymity. ``It will not be influenced or linked
in any way with moves by the British crown forces, who are obliged to
demilitarize in any event.''
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA's unwillingness to move on the issue compelled Britain earlier this
month to withdraw powers from the province's power-sharing Cabinet, a four-party
coalition formed in December under terms of the accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition took shape after the major Protestant party, the Ulster
Unionists, agreed to work alongside the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party in
expectation that IRA disarmament would begin in response.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA spokesman ruled out the possibility of the outlawed group offering a
disarmament ``gesture'' before the Cabinet's reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain is supposed to publish a plan for withdrawing troops and closing
army bases under terms of the peace accord in response to the cease-fires being
observed by the IRA and outlawed pro-British groups. But Britain has yet to do
so, although it has already withdrawn about 3,000 troops and closed several
major bases.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Tuesday that the government was considering ``a day when all
involved in the conflict would be able to mark, in their own way, the end of the
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
	   This might mean the IRA and outlawed pro-British groups would each identify
a hidden cache of weapons to the province's disarmament commission, while the
British army would begin demolition of another base or withdraw another unit.
</P>
<P>
	   The authorities' efforts to impound IRA weaponry continued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   During raids on homes in a Catholic section of Dungannon, 40 miles west of
Belfast, police seized plastic explosive, detonators, two assault rifles, four
handguns, ammunition and telescopic sights. One man was arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams invited several other Northern Ireland parties
to a Belfast meeting to discuss the urgency of re-establishing the Cabinet --
but only two people showed up. Neither was a Cabinet member.
</P>
<P>
	   Adams' party deputy, Martin McGuinness, departed for the United States,
where other key players in the peace process have begun lobbying the White House
and Irish-American leaders for support.
</P>
<P>
	   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, leader of the suspended Cabinet,
visited the White House on Monday. Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson, who stripped the Cabinet of power, is expected there later this week.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton: Debates sound like fun  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TONAWANDA, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton would love to debate in
the Apollo Theater like presidential rivals Bill Bradley and Al Gore did, she
said Tuesday. Even better would be to have debates all over New York.
<P>
	   "It would be kind of fun, travel around the state, engage in debates ...
wouldn't that be fun?" the Senate candidate said during a campaign stop at a
Salvation Army, where a few dozen senior citizens were having lunch. "Stand up
in all sorts of settings all over the state like it used to be done. I'd love
that."
</P>
<P>
	   Although the election is still several months away, Clinton said she was
willing to debate her Republican rival, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
"whenever we could."
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't have any starting time or ending time," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's campaign did not immediately return telephone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "The more information you give to people and the more you answer questions
and the more you can make the campaign about issues, the better it will be for
everybody," said Clinton, who complained of having to defend herself against "a
charge a day" from the Giuliani camp.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, Clinton renewed her call for New York and the other
Northeastern states to have their own home heating oil reserves that could be
tapped in case future shortages make prices skyrocket again.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal was part of a five-point plan that she said would help
homeowners in the short term and the nation in the long term by decreasing its
dependence on heating oil.
</P>
<P>
	   With OPEC countries limiting production, the cost of home heating oil in New
York has risen from a statewide average of 90.6 cents a gallon in February of
last year to $2.01 a gallon this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Northeastern states have been hardest hit by the price increase. Gertrude
Mohr, a Tonawanda homeowner on hand to hear Clinton's plans, said she paid $220
for her last oil delivery, compared to under $100 per delivery last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got to cut back on other things. No dinners out or anything," the
senior citizen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan also includes support for increased funding for the
Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and for a system of swaps which would
allow the federal government to loan oil from the Strategic Petroleum Oil
Reserve to companies that promise to return a larger volume of oil later.
</P>
<P>
	   The country also must develop alternative energy sources to reduce its
reliance on oil, said Clinton, who said she would support investments in cleaner
technologies such as wind, bioenergy, fuel cells and geothermal energy.

<HEADLINE> New Pinochet Assessment Called For  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Responding to a report that found Gen. Augusto Pinochet unfit
to stand trial, Switzerland said Tuesday that ill health should not stop the
former Chilean dictator's extradition. France and Belgium asked for another
medical assessment.
</P>
<P>
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw must consider these and other arguments before
deciding whether to extradite Pinochet to Spain for trial or allow him to go
home. A final decision is not expected before Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Spain, Switzerland, France and Belgium -- which have all requested
Pinochet's extradition -- had until Tuesday evening to respond to an independent
British medical team's conclusion that the 84-year-old Pinochet is too ill to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The responses were the latest round in more than a year of complex legal
proceedings to determine whether Pinochet will stand trial for alleged human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet was arrested in London in October 1998 on a warrant from Spanish
Judge Baltasar Garzon while recuperating from back surgery there. He remains
under police guard in a rented mansion west of London. He has diabetes, and
suffered two small strokes last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   For weeks, Straw did not let the countries requesting Pinochet's extradition
see the medical report that found him unfit. He said that would violate
Pinochet's confidentiality. But last week, Britain's High Court ordered Straw to
make the report available to the four countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The report was supposed to be seen only by those countries' officials. But
Spanish newspapers, which received leaked copies of the report, said it showed
Pinochet had suffered brain damage that would prevent his participation in a
trial.
</P>
<P>
	   French investigating magistrate Roger Le Loire has formally asked British
authorities for another assessment of Pinochet's health, Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Swiss argued that international treaties do not allow Britain to refuse
the extradition for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Michel Malherbe, a spokesman for the Belgian Foreign Ministry, said Brussels
magistrate Damien Vandermeersche had found that ``technically the British report
is very good,'' but questioned the interpretation of the result.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For our judge here the deterioration is actually light, which does make
him fit for trial,'' Malherbe said. He said the judge had requested more tests.
</P>
<P>
	   An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people died or disappeared
during the general's 17-year regime, which began when he ousted elected Marxist
President Salvador Allende in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spanish government does not support the extradition bid by Garzon, the
judge who issued the Pinochet arrest warrant. It said it will not oppose any
decision by Straw to send Pinochet home.
</P>
<P>
	   But a team of Spanish doctors appointed by Garzon disputes the medical
findings and asserts Pinochet is ``competent to be put on trial,'' the Spanish
news agency Efe reported. Garzon sent the doctors' comments and his own to
London on Tuesday and said the general should now undergo a second medical exam.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw's final ruling was not expected until at least Monday, since he vowed
to report it first to lawmakers in the House of Commons, which does not have a
session until then. But Straw announced last month that the doctors' findings
left him inclined to drop extradition.

<HEADLINE> Euro Is Back To Parity With Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Europe's embattled currency clawed back more territory
against the dollar Tuesday, regaining the $1 level for the first time in nearly
a month.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro was quoted at $1.0036 in late trading in New York, up from 98.49
cents late Friday and the first time it has traded above $1 since Jan. 27. U.S.
financial markets were closed Monday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro had been in a slump over the past few weeks on concerns about
Europe's economic outlook, solid economic fundamentals in the United States and
a perception among traders that European financial authorities were reluctant to
influence the euro's level in the open market.
</P>
<P>
	   But several recent signs of strength in Europe's biggest economies have been
lending support to euro, which was launched at the beginning of last year. In
the latest such sign, German labor officials said Tuesday they expected the
jobless rate to drop below 10 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the rebound against the dollar, some traders said the euro may fall
again below the one-for-one level, or parity, against the U.S. dollar, since
many investors continue to have a negative outlook for the young currency.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we haven't seen the last of the euro being under parity," said
Joseph Barnea, a currency trader at Bank Leumi in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, the dollar initially rose against the Japanese yen but
gave up its gains as the trading day wore on. By late afternoon in New York, the
dollar was worth 110.70 yen, down from 110.96 yen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was also quoted at 1.6021 Swiss francs, down from 1.6284, and
1.4626 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4512. The British pound rose to $1.6119 from
$1.6000.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9490 German marks,
down from 1.9858; 6.5367 French francs, down from 6.6601; and 1,929.52 Italian
lire, down from 1,965.96.

<HEADLINE> Cuba: Diplomat Is Not a Spy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba reiterated its denial of U.S. charges that one of its
diplomats in Washington engaged in espionage, saying Tuesday that all of the
official's dealings with a U.S. immigration officer suspected of spying for the
communist country were public and legal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To recruit people to undertake espionage is not conceivable nor has ever
been undertaken by officials in our Interests Section in Washington,'' the Cuban
government said in a lengthy statement carried by state news media.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the government said, it is the U.S. Interests Section that promotes
``counterrevolutionary'' activities in Cuba. U.S. authorities have repeatedly
rejected that charge.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement admitted that Mariano Faget, a Cuban-born supervisor with the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, had contact with officials at the
Cuban Interests Section in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   But they discussed migration accords between the two countries and illegal
entries into the United States by Cubans, not sensitive intelligence matters,
the government said.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget was arrested in Miami last week on charges of passing classified
information to Cuba's communist government.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami Herald on Tuesday identified the diplomat targeted for expulsion
as Jose Imperatori. Neither Washington nor Havana has named the Cuban official
ordered to leave the United States by the end of this week, but the government
statement did name Imperatori as someone Faget had talked to in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   Havana has accused Washington of inventing the spy charges to block the
return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba and has said it will
not willingly withdraw the official.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials have said the two cases are unrelated and that Faget has not
been involved in decisions involving Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been at the center of a U.S.-Cuban custody dispute since he was
found Thanksgiving Day lashed to an inner tube off the Florida coast. His mother
and 10 others died when their boat capsized during an attempt to flee Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   His father and the Cuban government have demanded the boy's return. Elian's
Miami relatives have gone to court to block an INS ruling that ordered him
returned to Cuba.

	   The Miami Herald, citing three U.S. officials it did not name, said
Imperatori met with Elian's grandmothers, Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana,
after they arrived at a Miami airport for an aborted attempt to meet with their
grandson on Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said Imperatori, based in Washington, ordered the
grandmothers' jet fueled after a tense standoff at Kendall-Tamiami Executive
Airport and accompanied them on the return flight to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers met with Elian on Jan. 26. It is unknown whether Imperatori
was with them during their second visit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government statement also viewed as ``extremely strange'' the
sudden illness of U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who was to rule Tuesday
on attempts by Elian's Miami relatives to block his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore was assigned Tuesday to replace
Hoeveler, who was hospitalized over the weekend for an apparent stroke.

<HEADLINE> Fox Avoiding Wedding Business  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- It wasn't much of a honeymoon for Rick Rockwell and Darva
Conger: TV's multimillionaire groom says they didn't consummate their marriage
and it's not likely to last.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fox network, meanwhile, is divorcing itself from the idea of ever
marrying off another multimillionaire after the embarrassment of finding out the
star of last week's prime-time special once had a restraining order against him
for allegedly threatening an ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell, who married Conger after selecting her from 50 potential brides,
told "Dateline NBC" on Tuesday that they slept in separate rooms for all but one
night of their honeymoon and didn't have sex.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, they have returned to their separate California homes and it
seems doubtful the marriage, watched by millions on "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire," will last.
</P>
<P>
	   "She went back with her mom," Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
	   To everyone who thought the show debased the institution of marriage,
Rockwell said he "really had a romantic ideal" in his mind.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said both he and Conger signed an agreement that they could annul the
marriage, no questions asked. He said he thought that would happen.
</P>
<P>
	   No matter what happens to the marriage, a network spokesman said, Conger has
received prizes worth a total of $100,000: the honeymoon, the $35,000 engagement
ring and an Isuzu Trooper.
</P>
<P>
	   The syndicated newsmagazine "Inside Edition" quotes a couple that befriended
Rockwell and Conger on their Caribbean honeymoon cruise as saying there didn't
appear to be much chemistry between them.
</P>
<P>
	   "They did not seem like a couple on their honeymoon," said Carol Miller of
Bloomfield Hills, Mich. "They seemed like two people thrown together."
</P>
<P>
	   In just a few days, Fox went from celebrating the show's high ratings and
scheduling an immediate rerun this week, to canceling the rerun and permanently
shelving the whole concept.
</P>
<P>
	   It began falling apart when an online news service, The Smoking Gun,
revealed Saturday that a California judge issued a restraining order against
Rockwell in 1991 sought by his ex-fiancee, Debbie Goyne. She said Rockwell had
hit her and threatened to kill her.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell told "Dateline NBC" that he never hit Goyne, but he admitted to
letting the air out of the tires on her car. He said he has a temper but "it
doesn't manifest itself too often."
</P>
<P>
	   Goyne said in her petition that she concluded Rockwell's "elevator doesn't
go all the way to the top floor."
</P>
<P>
	   Fox said Tuesday that the show's producers, Next Entertainment, had agreed
to conduct a full background investigation on Rockwell and his potential brides.
Fox said it is looking into how extensive those checks really were.
</P>
<P>
	   Next Entertainment said in a statement that "a good-faith background check
performed prior to the show by a reputable, independent investigator did not
reveal any information that Mr. Rockwell was anything other than a decent,
successful man."
</P>
<P>
	   Next said it specifically asked Rockwell on several occasions if there was
anything in his past that might embarrass him or the show, and he said there
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell said he believed the restraining order would be erased from court
records after seven years. "To me it was ancient history," he said, "and
actually somewhat of a non-event when it occurred."
</P>
<P>
	   It's unclear whether the incident will cost any Fox employees their jobs.
The concept for the show was the brainchild of Mike Darnell, Fox's executive
vice president for alternative programming. The veteran Fox executive has done
more than anyone else in Hollywood to advance the concept of reality
programming.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire" was a ratings success,
Fox won't do anything similar in the future, spokesman Jeff DeRome said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Despite your best intentions, you can never really be sure of a person's
past behavior or background," DeRome said. "We have an ethical responsibility
that dictates we can't be responsible for things like this because we can't be
responsible for people's behavior."
</P>
<P>
	   It's an issue other networks are likely to face soon, because a flood of
similar reality programming is coming in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS is producing two series, one that drops several contestants on a
tropical island in a test of survivor skills and another that films the daily
life of people stuck together in a home for several months. ABC is also working
on a series that follows the manufacturing of a real-life musical "boy band."

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 85.32; Nasdaq Off 29.62  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks broke a three-day losing streak in a
volatile day on Wall Street Tuesday as investors looked for bargains and shunned
usually hot technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down as much as 115 points
early in the day, rallied in the afternoon to close up 85.32 at 10,304.84.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index, however, was unable to shake
off concerns about interest rates and fell 29.62 to 4,382.12. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 6.08 to 1,352.17.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's performance was a marked change from the recent trend on Wall
Street that has pushed the Nasdaq up more than 8 percent this year and sent the
Dow down 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "What you are really seeing today is what has been oversold, the Dow, is
coming back. And what was overbought, the Nasdaq, is having a correction," said
Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at First Union Securities in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Some recent favorites on Wall Street were hit hard Tuesday. Cisco fell 1 7/8
to 123 15/16, and Qualcomm dipped 3 15/16 to 130 9/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors instead favored companies including General Electric, whose shares
rose 4 1/8 to 129 1/4, and Bank of America, up 1 3/16 to 44 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   "The average investor is looking for the opportunity to step in here, but
with the pressure that's been created by the Federal Reserve, this could drag on
for a while," Bob Dickey, managing director of technical analysis at Dain
Rauscher Wessels.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday morning, William McDonough, president of the New York Federal
Reserve, reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely raise
interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very clear that we will have to use the interest rate tool as long as
the demand side of the economy stays this robust," he said in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   His comments echoed testimony last week from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan,
who suggested more rate increases may be needed to cool the economy and keep
inflation under control. On Friday, the Dow fell 295 points and the Nasdaq lost
137 points as investors were unnerved by the prospect of higher rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Markets were closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday, and on Tuesday,
investors traded cautiously. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 1.2
billion shares vs. 1.24 billion on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate acquisitions, earnings and new products also moved individual
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Instruments, which unveiled two new processors, saw its shares shoot
up almost 12 percent, or 14 13/16, to 148 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC Communications, a regional telephone company, announced it would spend
$3.9 billion in cash to acquire Sterling Commerce Inc., a provider of Internet
integration software. SBC's shares fell 2 to 36 1/4, while shares of Sterling
soared 12 to 43 9/16.
</P>
<P>
	   In another telecom deal: Global Crossing Ltd., a long-distance phone
company, said it would pay $3.8 billion for IXNet, an Internet networking
company. Global Crossing's stock fell about 7 percent, or by 3 3/4 to 48 5/8,
while IXNet's shares rose 2 1/2 to 55.
</P>
<P>
	   Nextel Communications, a wireless phone company, reported a
lower-than-expected loss in its most recent quarter, and said it would split its
stock 2-for-1. Nextel's shares jumped more than 10 percent, or by 12 5/16 to
131.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 1,681 down, 1,390 up and 444 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.73 to 540.95.
</P>
<P>
	   In overseas trading, the Nikkei stock index in Tokyo fell 0.78 percent. In
Europe, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index fell 1.1 percent, while the
CAC-40 index in Paris edged down 0.07 percent and Frankfurt's DAX index rose
0.23 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bond Market Rallies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose for a third straight session Tuesday as
investors grew confident that the Federal Reserve is keeping inflation in check.
Bonds also got a boost from the continued volatility in stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 15/16 point, or $9.37 1/2 per
$1,000 in face value. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price,
fell to 6.08 percent from 6.15 percent late Friday. The bond market was closed
Monday in observance of Presidents Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Though rising interest rates have put pressure on bonds in the past few
months, traders are increasingly confident that the Fed's push to keep the
economy from overheating will keep a lid on inflation. Rising inflation is a
leading threat to the value of investments in long-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York reinforced the central bank's willingness to pump up rates if the
consumer-driven economy remains robust, a message that Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan gave Congress last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonds gained in part as the comments caused stocks to fall. Investors move
to bonds as a safe haven at times of stock market volatility because bonds pay a
fixed rate of return.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonds also gained from the McDonough speech because traders became more
comfortable that the Fed is keeping ahead of inflation, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the bond market, prices of short-term Treasury securities
ranged from gains of 5/32 point to  1/4 point and intermediate maturities rose
by up to 15/32 point to 15/16 point, according to Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.80 percent, with the discount
rising 0.06 percentage point from Friday to 5.63 percent. Six-month yields were
6.00 percent as the discount remained unchanged at 5.74 percent. One-year yields
were 6.18 percent, with the discount falling 0.04 percentage point to 5.83
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose
to 5.81 1/4 percent from 5.69 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds rose  1/4 to 92 17/32. The yield to
maturity of the index fell to 6.18 percent from Friday's 6.20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Limited Earnings Up 37 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The Limited Inc. said its fourth-quarter earnings
rose 37 percent, beating analyst expectations, as the retailer reported improved
sales at its clothing stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Limited said adjusted net income for the three months ended Jan. 29 came to
$294.9 million, or $1.31 per share, compared with $215.8 million, or 92 cents
per share, for the same quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call expected earnings of $1.18 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales totaled $3.3 billion, compared with $3.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures reflect the August spinoff of Too Inc. and the May 1998
split-off of Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch Co. as if they had occurred at the beginning of
1998, the company said. They also exclude one-time items.
</P>
<P>
	   Without the adjustment, fourth-quarter earnings increased 39 percent, to
$316.5 million, or $1.41 per share, compared to earnings of $228.2 million, or
97 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Limited, which has been restructuring its clothing chains including Limited,
Express, Lane Bryant and Lerner New York, benefited from closing 301 stores in
1999. Over the past five years, the company has shut more than 1,050 stores, and
another 108 are scheduled to close this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The company began the restructuring after losing customers in the early and
mid-1990s to other merchants who offered more casual, classic clothes and lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Limited also operates Structure stores and owns 84 percent of Intimate
Brands Inc., which includes Victoria's Secret,Bath &AMP; Body Works and White Barn
Candle Co. stores.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Limited's adjusted net income increased 40 percent, to $445.5
million, or $1.93 per share, from $318 million, or $1.35 per share. Sales were
$9.5 billion, compared with $8.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Without the adjustment, earnings for the year were $460.8 million, or $2 per
share, compared with $2 billion, or $8.29 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in The Limited closed at $31.44 Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange, up 81 cents or about 2.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Morale High on Boeing Picket Lines  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- The strike by engineers and technical workers at The Boeing
Co. neared the end of its second week Tuesday, with both sides suggesting they
may return to the bargaining table. But on the picket lines, resolve seems to be
growing.
</P>
<P>
	   Few thought the Society for Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace
had the backbone for a walkout, let alone a prolonged strike. But the engineers
-- the brains behind many of Boeing's aerospace programs -- are proving to be
more committed and resilient than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we've shown we're a force to be reckoned with," said Bill Schivitz,
a flight-control engineer in Boeing's military aviation division who was walking
the line across the street from his offices.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's top federal mediator, C. Richard Barnes, was in Seattle on
Tuesday to meet with both sides. However, Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said no
face-to-face meetings were planned. Conte said the company was "exploring
approaches to returning to the table," but would not say when that might happen.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Bofferding, SPEEA's executive director, said the union's talks were
only "maintenance, not a breakthrough," and that a sit-down meeting had not yet
been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Things have not gone well for the company since the strike began Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing has been forced to handle difficult questions regarding its MD-80 and
DC-9 aircraft, inherited from its merger with McDonnell Douglas, after the crash
of Alaska Airlines Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   It has delivered only four airplanes so far this month. In February 1999,
Boeing delivered 47 aircraft to customers.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Tuesday, the German airline Lufthansa briefly grounded 26 Boeing
747-400 jets due to problems with the planes' fire-extinguishing system. Boeing
engineers, mostly SPEEA members, are often called upon to assist airlines with
technical problems like these.
</P>
<P>
	   While SPEEA membership only totals about two-thirds of the 22,600
engineering and technical employees covered by the contract, SPEEA claimed up to
19,000 workers remained on strike Tuesday. Boeing estimates place the number of
strikers at 17,000. Neither estimate has changed since the beginning of the
strike.
</P>
<P>
	   SPEEA members received their last paychecks Thursday, so things might get
more difficult in the coming weeks. However, the Boeing Employees Credit Union
has offered strikers special loans to help cover costs during the strike and has
waived loan repayments until the strike is over.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Hanling is working at his brother-in-law's machine shop when he's not
on the picket line and is also doing a little carpentry. When not on strike, he
is a stress engineer on Boeing's military F-22 fighter jet project.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm staying out here as long as it takes," he said. "I haven't had to take
out any loans or waive any payments yet, so I can do this for quite a while."
</P>
<P>
	   Many striking workers noted that while Boeing was once the only high-tech
employer in town, the Internet economy now offers some appealing options.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we'd all rather see Boeing do well, but if this drags on, I'll
think about sending my resume to other places," said Rick Reuter, a systems
engineer on the Joint Strike Fighter project, a military contract that Boeing
hopes to win.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is competing with Lockheed Martin, and U.S. Air Force officials
have voiced concerns about how the strike might affect Boeing's performance.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can be sure that Lockheed's schedules aren't slipping," Reuter said.

<HEADLINE> Stora Enso Buying Wis. Paper Co.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- The Finnish-Swedish forest products company Stora
Enso is buying Consolidated Papers Inc. of Wisconsin for about $4 billion in the
latest trans-Atlantic consolidation in the paper business.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal announced Tuesday would create a major paper producer with about
$12.4 billion in revenues and 47,000 employees. It is the second global merger
in the paper and pulp industry within a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Thursday, Europe's largest forest products company, UPM-Kymmene,
announced a $6.6 billion purchase of Champion International Corp. of Stamford,
Conn. That company would have annual revenues of about $14 billion and 50,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the latest deal, Stora Enso is offering $44 for each share of
Consolidated, half in cash and half in stock, a rich premium of 70 percent over
Consolidated's closing value of $26 per share Friday. Stora Enso will also
assume about $900 million in debt from Consolidated.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in Consolidated, which is based in Wisconsin Rapids, Wis., soared
after news of the merger agreement came out, gaining $10 or more than 38 percent
to $36 in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Consolidated Papers is North America's largest producer of coated paper and
uncoated printing papers, and is a leading manufacturer of specialty papers. It
employs some 7,000 people in North America.
</P>
<P>
	   Helsinki-based Stora Enso was formed in 1998 through the merger of Finland's
Enso and Stora of Sweden. It makes magazine paper, newsprint, fine paper and
packaging boards, and employs 40,000 people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition is subject to approval by regulatory commissions and
shareholders. It was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Consolidated has Wisconsin plants in Biron, Kimberly, Niagara, Stevens
Point, Whiting and Wisconsin Rapids. It also has a plant in Duluth, Minn., and
owns nearly 700,000 acres of woodland in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and
Ontario.

<HEADLINE> Some Drugs Are Cheaper for Pets  </HEADLINE>
    By CAREN BENJAMIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cheaper drugs often go to the dogs, congressional
investigators found.
</P>
<P>
	   They compared wholesale prices of 14 popular prescription drugs marketed to
people and pets, often under different brand names, and found the cost for
people can be up to five times higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Delahunt, who requested the study for the House Government Reform
Committee, said Tuesday the prices make some drugs unaffordable for people
without insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm all for healthy pets, but not at the financial and medical expense of
their owners," said Delahunt, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug company representatives called the study ridiculous and said the prices
must be seen in context.
</P>
<P>
	   "The study basically compares apples to oranges, or for that matter, apples
to elephants," said Meredith Art, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
	   Medicines given to animals "piggyback" on the lengthy and expensive approval
process needed for use in humans, Art said. Costs of that process must be
absorbed by the market for which the drug was originally intended, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Patient advocacy groups say the drug companies are hiding behind research.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reality is the prices of prescription drugs have no rhyme or reason
related to the cost of producing those drugs," said Ron Pollack, executive
director of Families USA.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmaceutical companies charge higher prices for drugs for people because
insurance companies often foot the bill, while pet owners usually pay out of
pocket, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   If drug companies "could reasonably charge considerably more for pets they
undoubtedly would do that," Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices for the drugs in the study were gathered from inside Delahunt's
southeastern Massachusetts district but are comparable nationwide, committee
investigators said. Medications surveyed were among the top 200 sellers
nationally in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found Augmentin, a popular antibiotic marketed as Clavamox for
pets, cost more than three times as much when the drug was intended for humans
instead of a dog, cat or horse.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also looked at "directly comparable drugs" -- medications marketed
under the same name and given in the same dosages to people and pets. For these
drugs, manufacturers charged wholesalers an average of 131 percent more when the
drug was intended for human use.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the study found a one-month supply of Medrol cost $3.90 when
purchased as an anti-inflammatory medication for Fido but $20.10 when bought by
Fido's owner for asthma.
</P>
<P>
	   Disparities appear to be "deliberate pricing strategies of the drug
manufacturers" and cannot be attributed to drug production costs or research and
development expenses, the report said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report Critical of Ex-CIA Director  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former CIA Director John Deutch apologized Tuesday for
using unsecured home computers to work on some of the nation's most sensitive
secrets, saying ``I very much regret my errors.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch's apology came as a congressional panel released an internal CIA
report asserting that Deutch knew that his home computers connected to the
Internet were vulnerable -- but took no steps to protect the material.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At no time did I intend to violate security rules,'' Deutch said. ``The
director of Central Intelligence is not above the rules.''
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation resulted in his being stripped last year of his security
clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch spoke before cameras after emerging from a two-hour closed door
session with the Senate Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA report, released by the panel, also suggests the current CIA
director, George Tenet, and other top ranking agency officials of waiting too
long to refer the matter to the Justice Department and to the congressional
oversight committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the committee chairman, said that despite
Deutch's apologies, both before the committee and to reporters, the panel
remained ``deeply troubled'' and intends to investigate further.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know he's a bright man and he served the government a long time, but he
wasn't serving it very well,'' Shelby said. He said he would not rule out
seeking criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department earlier declined to prosecute Deutch.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Tenet, Shelby said he remains troubled that CIA officials reacted
slowly.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other things, the report said that several ``high-risk'' Internet
sites that had been visited by someone in the Deutch household had left
electronic imprints on hard drives. Other officials familiar with the
investigation said that pornographic sites were among the ones visited, although
the visits appeared to have taken place while Deutch was not at home.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the reasons Deutch's computer was especially vulnerable, said the
report, was that his Internet screen name was accompanied in an online
membership directory that listed his true name and that he lived in Bethesda,
Md.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said there is no evidence that any national security secrets were
compromised, even though the CIA continues to make a damage assessment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I very much regret my errors,'' Deutch told reporters. ``I've worked for
this country for over 40 years in a number of positions, and I am proud of my
accomplishments. I hope that my mistakes will be weighed against the service and
the contributions that I have made.''
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to take questions from reporters. Senators who attended the
private session said that Deutch was contrite.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel voted to release an unclassified 77-page, CIA-edited version of
the report which is at the center of the controversy surrounding Deutch.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, a former deputy defense secretary, voluntarily gave up Pentagon
security clearances earlier this month. Deutch served from May 10, 1995, to Dec.
14, 1996, as CIA director.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general's report said Deutch violated agency rules in using as
many as eight separate unsecured computers to process ``a large volume of highly
classified information,'' including information relating to covert intelligence
operations, top secret communications, classified details about intelligence
budgets and drafts of top-secret memos to President Clinton and Vice President
Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   These included desktop computers that Deutch had at his homes in Bethesda,
Md., and Belmont, Mass., his offices in the CIA headquarters and in the Old
Executive Office Building next to the White House, plus a laptop.
</P>
<P>
	   All these computers had modems enabling them to connect to the Internet, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the material in the inspector general's report had been reported
before, based on accounts by administration officials and lawmakers familiar
with the document. However, it was the first time that the report had been
released publicly.
</P>
<P>
	   The report disclosed that Deutch had been reprimanded for mishandling
classified information earlier, even before he became CIA director in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet finally stripped Deutch of that clearance last August, 2 1/2 years
after the investigation began.
</P>
<P>
	   In a written statement Tuesday, CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said that Tenet
``has made it clear that he believes that Dr. Deutch's lax handling of
classified information was inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the agency would ``not hide behind excuses'' in the investigation of
the former director: ``We could have and should have done better.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Requests Singer's Extradition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Mexico has formally requested the extradition of pop
star Gloria Trevi, her manager Sergio Andrade and choreographer Maria Raquenel
Portillo to face charges of corrupting a 17-year-old girl, the Foreign Ministry
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Brazilian Supreme Court will rule on the request, based on documents
provided by the Mexican government, the ministry said. The court has no deadline
for its ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Trevi, Andrade and Portillo, also known as Mary Boquitas, were arrested on
Jan. 13 in Rio de Janeiro and transferred to Brasilia, the capital, on Feb. 10
to await a decision on their extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors from Mexico's Chihuahua state have accused them of corrupting
17-year-old Karina Yapor, whose parents had turned her over to Andrade's care at
age 12 for musical training -- allegedly at Trevi's behest. Yapor abandoned a
baby in Spain in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Her family accused Trevi and others of helping lure Yapor and other girls
into Andrade's care and helping him seduce them. Yapor has denied she was
mistreated, and all three suspects denied wrongdoing when questioned by
Brazilian police.
</P>
<P>
	   Trevi rose to fame in the late 1980s with a sexually flamboyant, politically
rebellious image. She spoke of someday running for president, and released a
series of nude calendars that poked fun at Mexican politics.

<HEADLINE> Two state troopers file lawsuits against motorists alleging false  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Two state troopers have filed lawsuits claiming
that two motorists who lodged complaints against them fabricated details about
traffic stops.
<P>
	   The two men, Allen Wade of Ridgefield Park, and Thomas Golden of Lampeter,
Pa., have been indicted by county grand juries for filing false complaints
against the troopers and then for lying either to State Police investigators or
to municipal court officials about the incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the criminal defendants - who face up to 18 months in prison if
convicted - face civil lawsuits in which individual troopers are seeking to
collect financial damages from them for smearing their professional reputations.
</P>
<P>
	   Trooper Gregory March is suing Wade, who is black, for allegedly fabricating
events in which Wade claimed the trooper said to him, "Stay in the car nigger,"
during a traffic stop for speeding in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a period when negative publicity was at its peak and tensions were
high over allegations of racial profiling and a 1998 incident in which three
minority men were shot and wounded by state troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
	   Sgt. Lawrence Gregan is suing Golden for allegedly fabricating events in
which Golden claimed Gregan threatened him and used his firearm to pin Golden's
arm against a car door during a traffic stop in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Both cases are union causes, with a union lawyer explaining the lawsuits at
a news conference Tuesday. Officials claim that videotape from patrol car
cameras show that the alleged infractions did not occur.
</P>
<P>
	   "The unions will not stand by and let their members be targets for
scurrilous, malicious fabrications. There will be a suit and a judgment will be
executed on whatever assets you may have," said union attorney Richard Loccke.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Troopers Fraternal Association is representing March and the State
Troopers NCO Association, the union for sergeants, is representing Gregan.
Loccke, who is the attorney for both unions, said that the troopers could not
speak with news reporters because of State Police policy prohibiting news media
interviews without advanced approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Detective Sgt. Dennis Hallion, head of the State Troopers NCO Association,
said citizens must be confident that action will be taken when troopers do
wrong. But he said if "a certain faction decides that they want to make up
fabrications, lies, false accounts," then they should fear criminal prosecution
and civil liability.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no listing for Wade, and the phone at the number listed for Golden
was not answered Tuesday. It could not be determined if Golden has an attorney
assigned to his case. Donna Wrenn, a public defender representing Wade, was
unavailable Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Troopers have filed private civil litigation in the past. Chuck Davis of the
attorney general's office said there are no state regulations barring troopers
from such litigation, and he said the state would have no comment on it since
officials regard it as a private matter.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Earnings Rise With Oil Price  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON BARKHO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A handful of protein biscuits seems like too little,
too late for Zakiya Abdulrahman's family.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the biscuits are a windfall for the pregnant woman with five
children whose family's income is less than $1 per day -- and they are possible
only because of a rise in world oil prices. The costly oil means Iraq is earning
more money under the U.N. oil-for-food program designed to let it skirt trade
sanctions for the good of its people.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently, that has meant a small improvement for Abdulrahman and nearly
5,000 other malnourished mothers and children in the low-income Baghdad
neighborhood of Mashahda: six high protein biscuits a month per person. That is
in addition to free rations of rice, flour, legumes, sugar and tea distributed
under an earlier phase of the oil-for-food project.
</P>
<P>
	   But Abdulrahman and her five children are still in dire need. Abdulrahman's
husband earns his tiny income selling groceries from a cart. Her 11-month-old
boy weighed 13 pounds -- the norm for that age is almost 20 pounds -- when a
community care volunteer put him on an electronic scale.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past three months, regular power cuts in Abdulrahman's neighborhood
have lasted as long as 16 hours a day. Broken pipes inundate some streets with
sewage. Children scour garbage heaps in search of used tin cans and bottles they
can sell to recyclers.
</P>
<P>
	   Such misery exists despite Iraq's oil reserves, and despite the fact that
the price of the crude basket of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries has risen from below $10 a barrel in 1998 to around $25 today.
</P>
<P>
	   While the increase has boosted Iraq's revenues, it isn't doing much to help
the country's poor because much of the money is either taken away or blocked by
the United Nations, Iraqi officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is not allowed to freely sell its oil on world markets under sanctions
imposed to punish it for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions cannot be
lifted until U.N. inspectors certify Iraq is not producing weapons of mass
destruction. Iraq has barred inspectors for the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   The sanctions have crippled Iraq's economy. But in December 1996, the
oil-for-food exception was instituted.
</P>
<P>
	   At first, it allowed Iraq's government to sell $2 billion worth of oil every
six months on the condition that the proceeds are used to buy food and other
essentials for ordinary Iraqis. The financial ceiling was raised to $5.2 billion
in 1998, and a December 1999 U.N. resolution removed it altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   All told, Iraq has sold about $22 billion worth of oil under the program,
officials estimate. So far, though, the government has earmarked only $30
million of the proceeds to combat widespread malnutrition among children and
pregnant and nursing mothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz charges that his country is the last to
benefit from the oil sales. He has said about $7.7 billion of total earnings
have been funneled to a U.N. fund to compensate the victims of Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait. The money also covers U.N. expenses incurred in administering the
program and dismantling Iraq's war machine.
</P>
<P>
	   Tariq also says the U.N. sanctions committee is blocking Iraq from buying
commodities for its people and its oil industry. He charges that commodities
contracts worth more than $8 billion are either blocked or have not reached Iraq
yet.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, about 15 percent of the revenues are earmarked for Iraq's
Kurdish north, an area outside Baghdad's control. All of those subtractions
together, Iraq says, leave few funds to do what the oil-for-food program was
intended to do -- help Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. and British diplomats say the Baghdad government hoards medicines
instead of distributing them to hospitals and is refusing to rid itself of
weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles. They maintain that in the
absence of weapons monitors, Iraq will acquire equipment and spare parts to
reinstate its weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, smuggled oil is pouring out of Iraq and onto the markets, the
U.S. Navy says.
</P>
<P>
	   Although smugglers sell for less than the legitimate market rate, their
prices go up with world market prices. Smuggled oil revenues go straight to the
Iraqi regime's coffers and can be used in any way Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
sees fit, observers say.
</P>
<P>
	   The wrangling between Iraq and the United Nations has taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
	   Two senior U.N. relief officials in Baghdad resigned this week, frustrated
at the disputes. The two, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Hans von Sponeck and
U.N. World Food Program chief Jutta Burghardt, said they feared the spats
between the sides will continue -- and the suffering of innocent civilians will
worsen.
</P>
<P>
	   They also said they don't believe Iraq is trying to misuse the oil-for-food
funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't have the impression that there is a willful act'' on the part of
the government to divert equipment to military use or hoard supplies, von
Sponeck said.
</P>
<P>
	   For Abdulrahman, like millions of other Iraqis, it is a political game for
which she and her children are paying a heavy price.

<HEADLINE> Firm says it can get auto emissions improvements done by June  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The private contractor running New Jersey's
troubled auto inspection system pledges that it can fix computer troubles and
increase staffing to have centralized lanes running smoothly by June.
<P>
	   In a 38-page "recovery plan" required by state officials, Parsons
Infrastructure and Technology Group says it can meet the state's deadline to
clear up problems that forced long lines at Division of Motor Vehicle inspection
centers and prompted a political firestorm for Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
	   The report was delivered by the firm to the state on Friday, but state
officials refused to make it public, saying they needed to review it. The
document was released on Tuesday. Treasury spokeswoman Mary Lou Murphy said it
was now a public document because the state had forwarded it to federal
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Parsons' plan for action carries a big price tag. State officials are
withholding a scheduled $10 million capital construction payment from the firm
because the plan was not finished. Murphy on Tuesday said the state is still
reviewing the plan, and that officials would not comment on it.
</P>
<P>
	   The auto inspection system has forced long lines at many stations since it
was implemented Dec. 13 to help New Jersey meet its federal mandate to clean the
air. The Whitman administration says Parsons fell down on the job, but Parsons
officials maintain that state officials also bear some of the blame.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman has suspended the tougher auto emissions test and a complicated
computer system at the 15 centralized inspection stations that had the biggest
problems. Cars at these lanes are given the old tailpipe emissions test in an
action taken to buy time for Parsons.
</P>
<P>
	   Parsons in the report says it will improve computer systems that have forced
delays as cars move through the inspection process. The report includes changes
to make sure equipment won't freeze, and ways to reduce how much staffers must
enter into computers.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Parsons promises to have 950 employees on the job, an 80
percent increase from staffing levels the firm had in December. The plan details
an improved training program and says it will revamp how the lanes are staffed
to keep the lines moving. In addition, the report details the already-planned
construction of about two dozen additional lanes throughout the system.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan, the enhanced emissions test will be phased in beginning in
April in a trial run at the 15 inspection stations where it was suspended. Cars
on these lines will continue to be judged by the old tailpipe test. Parsons
spokesman Carl Golden said the trial run of the new test will allow the firm to
iron out the bugs by the time the system goes fully back on line in June.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had to meet the December 13 deadline, and everyone knew that," Golden
said. "That didn't allow us sufficient time to road test all the computer
equipment, and the other equipment. This is a plan that not only increases
staffing and lanes, it gives us time to make sure it's working properly."
</P>
<P>
	   The report did not satisfy Democratic critics of the system. Assemblyman
Neil Cohen, D-Union, and Anthony Impreveduto, D-Hudson, said Parsons should be
dumped from a seven-year contract that calls for at least $400 million in
payments.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's outrageous that we are getting a four-month action plan to fix
problems that were supposed to have been ironed out two months ago," Impreveduto
said.

<HEADLINE> Parents of Michael Ross victims testify in penalty phase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - The parents of three teen-agers who were killed
by Michael Ross more than 15 years ago choked back their emotions Tuesday and
described for a jury the last time they saw their daughters alive.
<P>
	   Three years after his original death sentence was thrown out on appeal, a
second penalty hearing got underway in New London Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony of the parents, accompanied by large photo portraits of the
smiling girls, set an emotional benchmark for the prosecution's argument that
Ross deserves to be executed.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross, 40, a former Jewett City insurance salesman, has confessed and been
convicted of killing 14-year-olds April Brunias and Leslie Shelley of Griswold,
Robyn Stavinsky, 19, of Norwich and Wendy Baribeault, 17, of Jewett City.
</P>
<P>
	   A jury of nine men and three women must decide if Ross should get the death
penalty or life in prison. Ross' original death sentence was thrown out in 1997
when the state Supreme Court found prosecutors had withheld some psychiatric
evidence from the defense.
</P>
<P>
	   To find that a murder warrants the death penalty, jurors must decide that
the killing was done in an especially cruel, heinous or depraved way, he said.
The killing must be done in a way to inflict extreme pain or torture on the
victim beyond what was necessary to kill.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury also must find there are no mitigating factors that should spare
the Ross' life, such as a mental incapacity or something about the killer's
history or character.
</P>
<P>
	   The case in Superior Court before Judge Thomas Miano is expected to take
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwin Shelley, Leslie's father, testified his daughter was a "beautiful
little girl" who had blond hair, blue eyes and weighed about 85 pounds.
</P>
<P>
	   He last saw her April 22, 1984, as she and April left to go to the movies in
Jewett City.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was Easter Sunday," he said, as he briefly lost his composure on the
witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   He recalled how he made Leslie give him a kiss on the cheek before he would
consent to her trip to the movies.
</P>
<P>
	   April's mother, Ellen Roode, said the last time she heard from April was
when the girl telephoned to say she would be late coming home.
</P>
<P>
	   When the girls did not come home, both families contacted police. Their
bodies were found about 1 1/2 months later.
</P>
<P>
	   Under questioning from defense attorney Karen Goodrow, State Police Capt.
Thomas Snyder admitted Ross led police to the bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Joan Stavinsky testified she became worried about her
stepdaughter Robyn when she failed to come home for Thanksgiving dinner in 1983,
and because she had heard that a girl's body had been found in Norwich.
</P>
<P>
	   Medical examiner Dr. Arkady Katsnelson said his autopsy determined Robyn
died from manual strangulation and was asphyxiated. The strangling cut off blood
supply to the brain by compressing arteries on either side of the neck.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a death could be as quick as 20 seconds, or could take longer,
depending upon how firmly the neck was strangled, he said. Ross was also
convicted of sexually assaulting her.
</P>
<P>
	   Under cross-examination by defense attorney Barry Butler, Katsnelson said
Robyn had no broken bones.
</P>
<P>
	   Katsnelson also said he could find no evidence of multiple strangulations or
signs that Robyn's body had been dragged along the ground. No defensive wounds,
such as cuts to the hands from fighting off an attack, were found.
</P>
<P>
	   Miano began the hearing by telling jurors that the death penalty is not
automatic, even if there are multiple victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross has been convicted of six counts of capital felony, for the four
murders and kidnappings of each victim, and additional sexual assaults against
Stavinsky and Baribeault.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury can find for the death penalty in any of the six counts.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross' defense is expected to present evidence that Ross was abused as a
child and that he suffers from a psychological disorder and a brain abnormality
that may have contributed to his crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   He already is serving two life sentences for killing Tammy Williams, 17, of
Brooklyn,and Debra Smith Taylor, 23, of Griswold, in 1982. He has confessed but
has not been prosecuted for killing two other women in New York.

<HEADLINE> Letterman Return Gets High Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- An estimated 12 million people watched David Letterman's
return to television Monday night after heart surgery, giving the "Late Show"
its best ratings in six years, CBS said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on an instant Nielsen Media Research measurement of the top 47
markets, CBS' "Late Show" had nearly twice the ratings of its competitor, NBC's
"Tonight Show" with Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
	   Only Letterman's first two shows after joining CBS in 1993 and a handful of
programs during the Winter Olympics in 1994 scored higher, CBS said.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday night's audience was three times the size of Letterman's average
audience this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman taped his comeback show five weeks after undergoing emergency
quintuple bypass surgery. He rattled off several jokes about it, but turned
serious when he thanked his doctors and nurses for saving his life.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Cosby was the show's guest host Tuesday. Letterman planned to do the
show Wednesday and Friday this week, and Kathie Lee Gifford was expected to fill
in on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Two pit bulls maul man shoveling snow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A man mauled by two pit bills remained in guarded
condition Tuesday two days after he was attacked while shoveling snow in his
driveway.
<P>
	   Dennis Whitcomb, 51, underwent surgery after suffering extensive wounds to
his face, neck, chest and right arm Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Alerted by neighbors, police said they arrived to find Whitcomb lying face
down in the street while the dogs tore away at his body. Two officers fired
their guns and killed one dog. The other was captured and was being kept at the
city's animal control center.
</P>
<P>
	   The dogs' owner, Joseph Smith, 48, was ticketed for violating a city code
against keeping his animals unleashed and failing to license them. Police also
were weighing criminal charges against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after Rochester Mayor William Johnson called on changes in state law
as a result of the mauling, another pit bull attack was reported in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Tuesday afternoon, a pit bull jumped a fence and attacked several
people including one who was treated at a hospital, police said. Two other
people were injured, but refused to be treated by ambulance personel.
</P>
<P>
	   City police cornered the pit bull and shot it.

<HEADLINE> Election Violence Kills 13 in India  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- Violent clashes and paramilitary raids left 13 people
dead Tuesday during a crucial state parliamentary election in Bihar, widely
regarded as the most lawless place in India.
</P>
<P>
	   Three other states held legislative elections Tuesday, including Orissa,
Haryana and Manipur.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's violence in the final phase of voting in Bihar, though, brought
the state's death toll for the elections to 45. In two earlier rounds this
month, 32 people were killed and 50 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Rapid Action Force paramilitary commandoes gunned down seven men who
were trying to steal and illegally mark ballot papers in Bihar's northern
Beetiah election district, local election officer Sudhir Prasad said.
</P>
<P>
	   Six others were killed in clashes in Bihar's northern districts that border
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
	   Bihar police had been ordered to shoot people trying to stuff ballot boxes
or indulging in violence during the election, which is widely expected to be won
by members of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's coalition, which governs
nationally.
</P>
<P>
	   Election fraud happens frequently in India. Supporters of various political
factions often destroy ballots favorable to a rival, or stuff polling boxes by
stealing fresh ballots and stamping them with a candidate's election symbol.
Symbols, such as a lamp or a bicycle, are used to help illiterate people vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting was peaceful in Orissa and Haryana states.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the northeastern state of Manipur, suspected militants ambushed a
candidate's motorcade, killed three paramilitary soldiers and wounded nine,
United News of India news agency reported. Candidate L. Lala was hospitalized
after the attack, but voting in the state was not affected.
</P>
<P>
	   The ballots will be counted Friday, and early results are expected later
that day.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 5,000 federal paramilitary soldiers fanned out across the 108 election
districts of Bihar. The borders with neighboring Nepal were also sealed to
prevent bogus voters or criminals from entering the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The election is crucial to the political future of Laloo Prasad Yadav, whose
Rashtriya Janata Dal party has been in power for nearly 10 years in the state.
Yadav was forced to step down as chief minister some years ago in a corruption
scandal, but he appointed his wife to the top job.

<HEADLINE> Some Airlines Reject Fare Hike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The latest effort by airlines to boost fares by up
to $30 per round trip has stalled, with several airlines declining to go along
with the move.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston-based Continental started the latest round of increases on Friday,
citing escalating fuel prices, which have doubled in the past year. Five other
large airlines, including Fort Worth-based American, matched the increase.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dallas-based Southwest Airlines, Northwest Airlines and America West
were among the holdouts that chose not to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Faced with rivals offering lower prices on the same routes, American rolled
back its increase two days after putting it in effect, and so did Continental,
Delta Air Lines and several others.
</P>
<P>
	   Just three weeks ago, Continental led another -- and successful -- run at
higher prices, boosting fares $20 per round trip to help compensate for the
increase fuel costs. Fuel is the second-largest expense for airlines, trailing
only labor costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts had predicted the latest increase also would stick because
publicity about rising fuel costs might make it seem reasonable to air
travelers, who are also paying more to fill their gas tanks.
</P>
<P>
	   Terry Trippler, an airline-industry observer for onetravel.com, an online
discount travel service, said he expects the airlines to try to raise fares
again next weekend in another attempt to get all major carriers on board.

<HEADLINE> Parents of Michael Ross victims testify in penalty phase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - The parents of three teen-agers who were killed
by Michael Ross more than 15 years ago choked back their emotions Tuesday and
described for a jury the last time they saw their daughters alive.
<P>
	   Three years after his original death sentence was thrown out on appeal, a
second penalty hearing got underway in Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony of the parents, accompanied by large photo portraits of the
smiling girls, set an emotional benchmark for the prosecution's argument that
Ross deserves to be executed.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross, 40, a former Jewett City insurance salesman, has confessed and been
convicted of killing 14-year-olds April Brunias and Leslie Shelley of Griswold,
Robyn Stavinsky, 19, of Norwich and Wendy Baribeault, 17, of Jewett City.
</P>
<P>
	   A jury of nine men and three women must decide if Ross should get the death
penalty or life in prison. Ross' original death sentence was thrown out in 1997
when the state Supreme Court found prosecutors had withheld some psychiatric
evidence from the defense.
</P>
<P>
	   To find that a murder warrants the death penalty, jurors must decide that
the killing was done in an especially cruel, heinous or depraved way, Judge
Thomas Miano told the jury. The killing must be done in a way to inflict extreme
pain or torture on the victim beyond what was necessary to kill.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury also must find there are no mitigating factors that should spare
the Ross' life, such as a mental incapacity or something about the killer's
history or character, Miano said.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is expected to take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwin Shelley, Leslie's father, testified his daughter was a "beautiful
little girl" who had blond hair, blue eyes and weighed about 85 pounds.
</P>
<P>
	   He last saw her April 22, 1984, as she and April left to go to the movies in
Jewett City.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was Easter Sunday," he said, as he briefly lost his composure on the
witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   He recalled how he made Leslie give him a kiss on the cheek before he would
consent to her trip to the movies.
</P>
<P>
	   April's mother, Ellen Roode, said the last time she heard from April was
when the girl telephoned to say she would be late coming home.
</P>
<P>
	   When the girls did not come home, both families contacted police. Their
bodies were found about 1 1/2 months later.
</P>
<P>
	   Under questioning from defense attorney Karen Goodrow, State Police Capt.
Thomas Snyder admitted Ross led police to the bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Joan Stavinsky testified she became worried about her
stepdaughter Robyn when she failed to come home for Thanksgiving dinner in 1983,
and because she had heard that a girl's body had been found in Norwich.
</P>
<P>
	   Medical examiner Dr. Arkady Katsnelson said his autopsy determined Robyn
died from manual strangulation and was asphyxiated. The strangling cut off blood
supply to the brain by compressing arteries on either side of the neck.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a death could be as quick as 20 seconds, or could take longer,
depending upon how firmly the neck was strangled, he said. Ross was also
convicted of sexually assaulting her.
</P>
<P>
	   Under cross-examination by defense attorney Barry Butler, Katsnelson said
Robyn had no broken bones, even in her neck where she was strangled.
</P>
<P>
	   Katsnelson also said he could find no evidence of multiple strangulations or
signs that Robyn's body had been dragged along the ground. No defensive wounds,
such as cuts to the hands from fighting off an attack, were found.
</P>
<P>
	   Miano began the hearing by telling jurors that the death penalty is not
automatic, even if there are multiple victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross has been convicted of six counts of capital felony, for the four
murders and kidnappings of each victim, and additional sexual assaults against
Stavinsky and Baribeault.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury can find for the death penalty in any of the six counts.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross' defense is expected to present evidence that Ross was abused as a
child and that he suffers from a psychological disorder and a brain abnormality
that may have contributed to his crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   He already is serving two life sentences for killing Tammy Williams, 17, of
Brooklyn,and Debra Smith Taylor, 23, of Griswold, in 1982. He has confessed but
has not been prosecuted for killing two other women in New York.

<HEADLINE> Festival Director Not Quitting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SALZBURG, Austria (AP) -- Gerard Mortier, the director of the Salzburg
festival, has changed his mind about quitting this summer, a year before his
contract expires, the Vienna daily Der Standard has reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Mortier announced the change of heart in an interview to be published
Wednesday in the Vienna daily Der Standard. It was carried in part by the
Austria Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The director of what is one of the world's most prestigious music and stage
festivals was quoted as saying that he consulted numerous cultural figures
before making his decision to stay on.
</P>
<P>
	   Those consulted include French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, former French
Culture Minister Jack Lang and conductor Pierre Boulez.
</P>
<P>
	   In a recent interview with The Associated Press in Salzburg, Mortier said he
was quitting because he distrusts Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party, which
now shares the Austrian government with Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel's
conservative Austrian People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   He also cited unpleasant mail he had received from Austrians.
</P>
<P>
	   "Go to Chechnya," advised one writer on the back of a postcard. Another
writer filled more than a page with anti-Semitic drivel before telling the
director: "Go to Israel."
</P>
<P>
	   Mortier told The Associated Press that the growing amount of hate mail, in
response to his decision to leave his position as director of the Salzburg Music
Festival a year early, reflects a climate he fears will get worse under the new
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Mortier was quoted as saying the Salzburg festival would revert to
a "yodeling contest" after his departure.
</P>
<P>
	   In the interview with Der Standard, Mortier sharply rejected claims that he
had wanted to quit prematurely in order to secure a job in Berlin and because of
a budget problem next year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Press reports to this effect I call high treason," Mortier was quoted as
saying. "There has never been any secret about the (festival) deficit, it
received the board's blessing, and we will make up for it."
</P>
<P>
	   But he also said, "It must be made clear from our side that we don't agree
with this government."

<HEADLINE> Schwarz: I wasn't in precinct for Louima attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The police officer convicted of restraining Abner Louima
while a second cop sodomized the bleeding suspect with a broom handle testified
Tuesday that he wasn't even inside the precinct house when the brutal attack
occurred.
<P>
	   Charles Schwarz, testifying for the first time about that infamous August
1997 night, said he was conducting a routine "field search" of his patrol car
when officer Justin Volpe was assaulting the Haitian immigrant in a lavatory.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was never in that bathroom," Schwarz, 34, told the Brooklyn federal court
jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly nervous but speaking in a calm, clear voice, Schwarz said he had
only accompanied Louima from the patrol car to the front desk of the 70th
Precinct after helping to arrest him during a street riot.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz's lawyer, Ronald Fischetti, asked his client who had escorted Louima
from the desk to the rear of the precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it was Tommy Wiese," Schwarz replied, referring to his partner.
"I'm not 100 percent sure, but I think it was him."
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, Wiese, and Officer Thomas Bruder are on trial in Brooklyn federal
court for conspiring to obstruct justice by concealing Schwarz's role as the
officer who held Louima down during the broomstick attack.
</P>
<P>
	   But Schwarz insisted that he was outside the building, checking his patrol
car for weapons or contraband that Louima might have concealed en route to the
station. Such inspections are standard procedure after an arrest, Schwarz
testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz was convicted last year of violating Louima's civil rights by
assisting in the attack, and faces a possible life sentence. He did not testify
in the earlier trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe interrupted the same trial last May 20 to plead guilty to violating
Louima's civil rights and was sentenced to 30 years. Last week, telling the full
story for the first time under oath, Volpe said that Wiese - not Schwarz - was
present, but did not intervene.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz testified that he was unaware of what happened following Louima's
arrest outside a Brooklyn nightclub until two days later, when detectives from
Internal Affairs began grabbing broomsticks and mop handles from the precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   "I assumed they thought he had been beaten with broomsticks or a mop
handle," said Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   Louima suffered severe internal injuries, including a ruptured bladder and
colon, and spent two months in the hospital after the Aug. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling his arrest "one of the worst moments of my life," Schwarz said, "I
was devastated ... that a United States Marine, a married man, a cop of eight
years, was now being charged with this horrible crime."
</P>
<P>
	   He said phone calls that prosecutors claim are key elements of the
conspiracy were consultations with police union delegates and other cops, but
said he never at any time spoke with Volpe, whom he said he hardly knew.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first trial, the government said phone records showed a call to Volpe
on Schwarz's phone card on Aug. 11, the day the IAB investigation moved into
high gear. Schwarz said on Tuesday that Wiese borrowed his card to make some
calls.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, a police investigator testified that Louima picked his torturer out
of a police photo array, but was unable to identify a second officer in the
precinct house bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Reinaldo Daniels, who tape-recorded a hospital interview with Louima
while heading the department's internal investigation, also admitted under
defense questioning that he improperly corrected errors in his written report.
</P>
<P>
	   The veteran detective conceded that he never showed Louima a picture of
Wiese, who claims that he entered the bathroom as Volpe stood over the Haitian
immigrant, bloody stick in hand.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did he (Louima) tell you the second officer was just standing there, doing
nothing?" Fischetti asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," replied Daniels.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischetti showed jurors four sets of photos, each containing six mug shots
of cops. The same pictures were shown to Louima at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The victim failed to pick out Schwarz from the third array, Daniels
testified, but when he was shown the fourth and last set, which contained
Volpe's mug shot, "his eyes opened up like half dollars."

<HEADLINE> Education Sec.: Teach All Year Long  </HEADLINE>
   By ESTES THOMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley said Tuesday
that teachers must be better paid and work year round if American schools are to
shed outdated ways and improve.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have an old agrarian schedule, an outdated factory model and an
antiquated wage system,'' Riley said during his annual address on the state of
American education.
</P>
<P>
	   The address, Riley's seventh and final, was made before students, elected
officials and educators at Durham's Southern High School, a previously
low-performing public school that turned itself around.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the last 100 years, American education has been defined by certain
assumptions,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One assumption was that the job of a teacher lasted nine months. The
second assumption was that we would always have a ready supply of dedicated
teachers, mostly women, who for relatively low wages would teach our children
their lessons.''
</P>
<P>
	   Riley said he wasn't proposing year-round schools for all children. He said
school schedules were better left to local school boards.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said: ``I believe that making teaching a year-round profession is the
future of American education.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kathleen Lyons, spokeswoman for the 2.5 million member National Education
Association teachers' union, said Riley's proposal is welcome.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are being compensated for much less than what they are actually
working. The year-round plan and increased pay would move us toward treating
teachers as professionals and compensating them as they deserve,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said a teacher's work year could be up to 10 months. The average salary
for a public school teacher was $40,582 during the 1998-99 school year.
</P>
<P>
	   Riley said teachers' pay is not catching up with the demands made on them.
Recent studies show that the annual income gap between experienced teachers with
masters' degrees and people in other fields with the same level of education is
at least $32,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this time of economic prosperity, with state coffers expanding, there
can be no excuse for shortchanging our students and their teachers,'' Riley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Riley released a 29-point report card on education showing improvements in
reading, math and science scores, technology and opportunities for disabled
students. But the report card also showed a worsening of student college debt,
the gap in Internet access between poor and wealthy schools and drug use.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Republicans' official response to Riley's speech, Rep. Heather
Wilson, R-N.M., said Congress over five years has spent $1 billion more than the
Clinton administration has requested.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson said education decisions must be made locally ``by somebody that
knows your child's name.''

<HEADLINE> Tuesday's Commodities Roundup  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A frenzy of speculative buying drove already-soaring palladium futures up
another 16 percent Tuesday to an all-time high on the Comex division of the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, oil rose to nearly another nine-year high and natural gas
and cocoa tumbled.
</P>
<P>
	   Palladium prices have been rocketing higher since November and doubled in
little more than two months amid the virtual absence of top producer Russia from
the export market and heavy demand by the automative and electronics industries.
</P>
<P>
	   The metal is needed to make catalytic converters and semiconductors, widely
used in laptops and cellphones among other portable communications devices.
</P>
<P>
	   With Russian supplies still at a trickle, the palladium market exploded when
trading limits imposed Monday by the Tokyo Commodity Exchange sent buyers
scrambling to other markets to find the metal.
</P>
<P>
	   On the New York Merc, where trading resumed Tuesday after the Presidents Day
weekend, the result was a whopping increase of $115.55 an ounce, to $816.80,
after the March contract reached as high as $835. That's the largest one-day
gain ever for the metal.
</P>
<P>
	   The palladium market has become so wildly volatile and expensive that some
investors have taken to the sidelines, said analyst Dave Meger, who called the
price rise "insane."
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is trading on pure emotion right now," said Meger, senior metals
analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. "The tightness of supply is
something to take note of. But I don't think it's responsible for these surreal
moves now."
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere on the New York Merc, concern over dwindling supplies sent crude
oil up again. The expiring March contract rose 11 cents to $29.62 a barrel,
benefiting from a late trading surge that sent it as high as $30.30 -- just
short of the nine-year high of $30.45 reached last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are worried that heading into a series of key meetings in the next
10 days, there's still no assurance that top world producers led by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will substantially raise
production once their agreement on lowered output expires March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The first of the meetings is Wednesday when oil ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council, including OPEC countries, gather in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
	   But the most critical one is March 2 in London involving the oil ministers
of Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Those three are behind the 11-month-old
agreement that reduced world production by more than 4 million barrels daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy analyst John Kilduff said that while everyone expects oil prices to
come back down to the low to mid $20s per barrel later this year, another spike
to as high as $34 or $35 is possible depending on what OPEC says and ultimately
does.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is real sensitive right now to the various statements coming out
of OPEC officials," said Kilduff, senior vice president at Fimat USA Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not a done deal that there will be an increase in production," he
said, noting that nations such as Kuwait still are holding out against an
increase in production, particularly a large one.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on the New York Merc, unseasonably mild weather nationwide sent March
natural gas futures plummeting 11.8 cents to $2.515 per million British thermal
units.
</P>
<P>
	   In other energy commodities, March heating oil fell .58 cent to 74.87 cents
a gallon and March unleaded gasoline rose 1.82 cent to 84.49 cents a gallon. In
London, April Brent crude from the North Sea rose 65 cents to $26.58 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa continued its long slide amid huge harvests coming out of West Africa
onto a glutted world market. May cocoa fell $20 to $795 a ton on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Schwarz: I wasn't in precinct for Louima attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The police officer convicted of restraining Abner Louima
while a second cop sodomized the bleeding suspect with a broom handle testified
Tuesday that he wasn't even inside the precinct house when the brutal attack
occurred.
<P>
	   Charles Schwarz, testifying for the first time about that infamous August
1997 night, said he was conducting a routine "field search" of his patrol car
when officer Justin Volpe was assaulting the Haitian immigrant in a lavatory.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was never in that bathroom," Schwarz, 34, told the Brooklyn federal court
jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly nervous but speaking in a calm, clear voice, Schwarz said he had
only accompanied Louima from the patrol car to the front desk of the 70th
Precinct after helping to arrest him during a street riot.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz's lawyer, Ronald Fischetti, asked his client who had escorted Louima
from the desk to the rear of the precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it was Tommy Wiese," Schwarz replied, referring to his partner.
"I'm not 100 percent sure, but I think it was him."
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, Wiese, and Officer Thomas Bruder are on trial in Brooklyn federal
court for conspiring to obstruct justice by concealing Schwarz's role as the
officer who held Louima down during the broomstick attack.
</P>
<P>
	   But Schwarz insisted that he was outside the building, checking his patrol
car for weapons or contraband that Louima might have concealed en route to the
station. Such inspections are standard procedure after an arrest, Schwarz
testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz was convicted last year of violating Louima's civil rights by
assisting in the attack, and faces a possible life sentence. He did not testify
in the earlier trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe interrupted the same trial last May 20 to plead guilty to violating
Louima's civil rights and was sentenced to 30 years. Last week, telling the full
story for the first time under oath, Volpe said that Wiese - not Schwarz - was
present, but did not intervene.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz testified that he was unaware of what happened following Louima's
arrest outside a Brooklyn nightclub until two days later, when detectives from
Internal Affairs began grabbing broomsticks and mop handles from the precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   "I assumed they thought he had been beaten with broomsticks or a mop
handle," said Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   Louima suffered severe internal injuries, including a ruptured bladder and
colon, and spent two months in the hospital after the Aug. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling his arrest "one of the worst moments of my life," Schwarz said, "I
was devastated ... that a United States Marine, a married man, a cop of eight
years, was now being charged with this horrible crime."
</P>
<P>
	   He said phone calls that prosecutors claim are key elements of the
conspiracy were consultations with police union delegates and other cops, but
said he never at any time spoke with Volpe, whom he said he hardly knew.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first trial, the government said phone records showed a call to Volpe
on Schwarz's phone card on Aug. 11, the day the IAB investigation moved into
high gear. Schwarz said on Tuesday that Wiese borrowed his card to make some
calls.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, a police investigator testified that Louima picked his torturer out
of a police photo array, but was unable to identify a second officer in the
precinct house bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Reinaldo Daniels, who tape-recorded a hospital interview with Louima
while heading the department's internal investigation, also admitted under
defense questioning that he improperly corrected errors in his written report.
</P>
<P>
	   The veteran detective conceded that he never showed Louima a picture of
Wiese, who claims that he entered the bathroom as Volpe stood over the Haitian
immigrant, bloody stick in hand.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did he (Louima) tell you the second officer was just standing there, doing
nothing?" Fischetti asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," replied Daniels.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischetti showed jurors four sets of photos, each containing six mug shots
of cops. The same pictures were shown to Louima at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The victim failed to pick out Schwarz from the third array, Daniels
testified, but when he was shown the fourth and last set, which contained
Volpe's mug shot, "his eyes opened up like half dollars."

<HEADLINE> Two pit bulls maul man shoveling snow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A man mauled by two pit bills remained in guarded
condition Tuesday two days after he was attacked while shoveling snow in his
driveway.
<P>
	   Dennis Whitcomb, 51, underwent surgery after suffering extensive wounds to
his face, neck, chest and right arm Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Alerted by neighbors, police said they arrived to find Whitcomb lying face
down in the street while the dogs tore away at his body. Two officers fired
their guns and killed one dog. The other was captured and was being kept at the
city's animal control center.
</P>
<P>
	   The dogs' owner, Joseph Smith, 48, was ticketed for violating a city code
against keeping his animals unleashed and failing to license them. Police also
were weighing criminal charges against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after Rochester Mayor William Johnson called on changes in state law
as a result of the mauling, another pit bull attack was reported in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Tuesday afternoon, a pit bull jumped a fence and attacked several
people including one who was treated at a hospital, police said. Two other
people were injured, but refused to be treated by ambulance personel.
</P>
<P>
	   City police cornered the pit bull and shot it.

<HEADLINE> Lufthansa Grounds 26 Boeing Jets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Germany's Lufthansa airline briefly grounded 26
Boeing 747-400 long-haul aircraft for safety inspections and repairs Tuesday
after discovering cracks in lines that carry firefighting agents to the turbine
engines.
</P>
<P>
	   The discovery prompted the Federal Aviation Administration in Washington to
announce plans for similar inspections on Boeing 747s in the United States.
Spokesman Eliot Brenner said the order was likely to allow the airlines time to
do the work rather than requiring immediate action.
</P>
<P>
	   Lines had to be replaced on eight of the 747-400 models, and all the jets
later were returned to service, Deutsche Lufthansa spokeswoman Sigrid Baeumer
said Tuesday evening. A precautionary inspection of six Boeing 747-200s owned by
Lufthansa uncovered no problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cracked lines were discovered early in the day during routine
maintenance of one of the 747-400s, and Lufthansa decided to ground all the
aircraft until they were inspected and their copper lines replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Baeumer said it was the first time the airline had such a problem with the
copper tubing, which is commonly used in aeronautics.
</P>
<P>
	   The grounding forced cancellation of a flight to Tokyo, and passengers were
sent on a later flight from Frankfurt. All but five of the airline's 747-400s
were in Germany; the others were based in Bangkok, Thailand; Buenos Aires,
Argentina; Cape Town, South Africa; Manila, Philippines; and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
	   Lufthansa said it immediately informed Boeing Co. of the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Franzjosef Darius, a spokesman for Boeing in Hamburg, said his company was
grateful for Lufthansa's quick reaction.
</P>
<P>
	   Darius said he was unaware of other airlines reporting similar problems,
adding that fires in the turbine engines were rare but that the lines in
question were critical to dousing any blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   In Seattle, Boeing spokeswoman Debbie Nomaguchi said the company issued a
service bulletin for the same fire-extinguisher tubing in 1995, advising
airlines flying 747-400s to replace it because of problems similar to those
reported by Lufthansa.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are still working to determine if this is an isolated case or if it's
fleet-wide," affecting all 747-400s, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lufthansa spokeswoman Karin Weber said the airline replaced the tubing in
1995 with new Boeing parts, but that the problem was with the new tubing.
</P>
<P>
	   "Boeing is in process of sending out an all-operator message" to advise its
747 customers that Lufthansa found cracked tubes in several planes, company
spokesman Gary Lesser in Seattle said, prior to the FAA announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing customers are being asked to advise the company if they have found
any similar problems while inspecting their aircraft, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 747s in Germany have General Electric engines while most of those in the
United States are powered by Pratt &AMP; Whitney, said Brenner, the FAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that the engines have a four-step fire protection system, of which
the fire extinguisher bottles are the last step.
</P>
<P>
	   There is also a fuel cutoff, fuel drain and firewall protecting the
airplane, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Brenner said the FAA is working with Boeing and United Airlines, a major
operator of the type, to gather information on the planes.
</P>
<P>
	   The 747-400 is a bigger, longer-range version of Boeing's 747, with a
capacity of 416 to 524 passengers and a range of about 8,400 miles. First flown
in 1989, the 747-400 family includes four models.
</P>
<P>
	   The 747-200, depending on variable seating arrangement, carries between 300
and 368 passengers.

<HEADLINE> Liberty Media To Buy Ascent Group  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- Liberty Media Group will buy Ascent Entertainment Group in a
$460 million deal that includes the Denver Nuggets, the Colorado Avalanche, an
arena was well as the company's non-sports assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Liberty will pay $15.25 per share for Ascent, and also assume nearly $300
million in debt. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Liberty officials said Tuesday they will continue to look for a new owner
for the Nuggets, the Avalanche, and the new Pepsi Center stadium in Denver.
</P>
<P>
	   Liberty planned to buy the non-sports assets of the Denver-based Ascent last
year but the deal fell through. The company also provides pay-per-view
programming for hotels and satellite service and maintenance to NBC.
</P>
<P>
	   The unsuccessful Liberty deal was contingent on Ascent selling the teams and
the Pepsi Center. Ascent tried to sell the sports assets to Denver billionaire
Donald Sturm, but the deal collapsed over a city mandate that the teams would
remain in Denver for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Liberty plans to sell the teams and the arena, but will keep Dan Issel as
president and head coach of the Nuggets, Pierre Lacroix as general manager of
the Avalanche and Don Elliman as president of Ascent Sports Holdings.
</P>
<P>
	   Issel and Lacroix just signed long-term deals with Ascent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Denver-based Liberty owns video programming, communications, technology
and internet businesses in the United States, Europe, South America and Asia.
Liberty Media Group common stock is a tracking stock issued by
telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T Corp. Liberty Media Corp., which holds most of the
assets included in the Liberty Media Group, is a wholly owned subsidiary of
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Ascent rose $4.68 3/4 to $14.81 1/4 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. Shares of Liberty Group were down 62 1/2 cents to $50 in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> More accidents, fewer deaths, in 65 mph zones  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The number of accidents increased, but fewer people
died in car wrecks along the 475 miles of New Jersey highway where the speed
limit was raised to 65 mph nearly two years ago, according to a report released
Tuesday.
<P>
	   The state Department of Transportation report recommended that motorists be
allowed to continue driving 65 mph in these designated stretches of highway.
But, the department also said lawmakers should hold off on expanding the higher
limit to other sections of roads.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials said they need another 18 months to further study the
effects of the 65 mph limit before recommending whether to expand it, leave it
as it is or lower the limit back to 55.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers have six months to either accept or reject the transportation
department's report.
</P>
<P>
	   The 18-month study was part of a deal that Gov. Christie Whitman struck with
legislators when she signed the bill raising the limit in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The higher limit is allowed on parts of the Atlantic City Expressway, Garden
State Parkway, New Jersey Turnpike, Routes 18 and 55, and Interstates 78, 80,
195, 287 and 295.
</P>
<P>
	   The study compared accidents and other data on the 475 miles of road from
two 18-month periods - June 1998 to November 1999 and June 1996 to November
1997.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report, accidents increased 18.3 percent, going from about
9,300 to 11,000 after the speed limit was raised.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of people injured in accidents increased nearly 6 percent during
the same time, going from about 4,500 to about 4,800.
</P>
<P>
	   Fatalities, though, dropped 9.6 percent, from 104 to 94.
</P>
<P>
	   "Accidents fluctuate over time," the report said. "It is not possible to
determine whether the increase in accidents in the 65 mph zones represents a
normal fluctuation in accident rates or suggests that increased speed
contributes to increased accidents."
</P>
<P>
	   The report also said that when the speed limit was raised from 55 mph to 65
mph, speeds increased an average of 1 mph in all 65 mph zones, except the New
Jersey Turnpike, where speeds increased 3 to 4 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's real clear to us that 65 mph speed limit has been a success," said
Steve Carrellas, state chapter coordinator for the National Motorists
Association. "We think more mileage of 65 or higher should be added much sooner
than the DOT is recommending."
</P>
<P>
	   But, Richard Retting, transportation engineer at the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety, said the study is too short-term to draw conclusions. Studies
conducted in other states have consistently documented that, over time, speed
kills, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Retting also called the study "naive" because it failed to consider other
factors that can affect accident and fatality rates, including weather.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know, without any doubt, what the long-term effects are of high speed
limits," Retting said. "We know that speed kills people."
</P>
<P>
	   But John Hagerty, New Jersey State Police spokesman, said speed "did not
contribute to any appreciable increase in accidents in the 65 mph speed zones."
</P>
<P>
	   From June 1996 to November 1997, speed contributed to 11.2 percent of all
fatal accidents on these roads when the limit was 55. But, under the higher
limit, speed contributed to only 4.8 percent, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest jump in accidents occurred on a 47-mile stretch of I-78, between
Warren and Union counties, where there was a nearly 32 percent increase in
accidents between the two 18-month periods.
</P>
<P>
	   The best results occurred on a 34-mile stretch of Route 55, from Cumberland
to Gloucester counties, where accidents decreased 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   One lawmaker said the report is proof that motorists should be allowed to
drive 65 mph on other parts of the 10 designated highways that have been deemed
appropriate for the higher limits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Opponents said if we were to open that flood gate, motorists would be
driving 10, 15 mph faster, leading to carnage on the roads," said Assemblyman
Guy Gregg, R-Morris, who has led the fight to raise the speed limit. "For the
most part, the speed remained the same."
</P>
<P>
	   Gregg said he would meet with state officials to try to work out a
compromise. Failing that, Gregg said he would explore the option of pushing
legislation that would expand the higher limit.

<HEADLINE> Japan Trade Surplus Declines in Jan.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world fell in January from the
same month last year, the government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods exported minus those
imported, shrank 30.7 percent to $4.75 billion (522.6 billion yen), the Ministry
of Finance said. The surplus was unadjusted for seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
	   The politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States also fell,
slipping 1.9 percent on year to $4.34 billion (477.8 billion yen).
</P>
<P>
	   Japan is fighting to emerge from its worst economic downturn in 50 years. It
has been under heavy pressure from the United States and other trading partners
to rein in the surplus by bolstering its weak economy to spark demand for
imports.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey governor rebuts Gore but takes swipe at Bradley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman chided Vice President
Al Gore Tuesday for saying that "racial profiling practically began in New
Jersey" but concurred that Bill Bradley did little to address the problem when
he represented the state in the U.S. Senate.
<P>
	   Gore made the comment Monday night during a presidential debate in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Bradley, his challenger for the Democratic nomination, shared several
spirited exchanges over the controversial police practice of stopping motorists
based on their skin color or appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley demanded to know why the vice president has not urged President
Clinton to issue an executive order outlawing the practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Clinton has issued a directive to prepare for an executive order.
He accused Bradley of not addressing the issue during his 18 years in the Senate
and added for emphasis, "you know, racial profiling practically began in New
Jersey, Senator Bradley."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman, a Republican, wrote in her letter to Gore:
</P>
<P>
	   "You must have misspoken when you alleged that racial profiling practically
began in New Jersey. The fact is that racial profiling is a national problem
that the president and the Department of Justice have indicated goes well beyond
state borders."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman also took a shot at Bradley, who narrowly defeated her to win a
third term in the Senate in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   "I understand that you were trying to make the point that Senator Bradley
did little, if anything at all, to address the problem of racial profiling
during 18 years as a United States senator," she wrote. "On that point you are
absolutely on target."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman did not specify what, if anything, a U.S. senator could do on the
issue. Her spokesman, Peter McDonough, said Bradley "could have asked for some
federal intervention" to look into complaints about racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democratic campaigns sought to read Whitman's letter to their benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said Whitman "is obviously in a good position
to judge Senator Bradley's claims about racial profiling. He clearly did little
if anything at all to address the problem that reared its head in New Jersey."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke said, "Once again Al Gore is called on
the carpet for misrepresenting the facts. But the larger point is that Al Gore
could take a key step toward ending racial profiling tomorrow by simply walking
down the hall" and urging Clinton to ban the practice by executive order.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the controversy Tuesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
the Justice Department has made progress since Clinton issued an order last year
for federal agencies to gather information on police stops.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't remember any help coming from Senator Bradley, even though it was
his own backyard," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman herself has been battered by controversy over racial profiling by
New Jersey state troopers.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue exploded in April, 1998, after two troopers shot at a van they had
pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike. Four black and Hispanic men were inside,
and three were wounded. The troopers were indicted on attempted murder charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Last February, Whitman fired State Police Superintendent Carl Williams for
linking drug trafficking to minorities in a newspaper interview on racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   In April, Attorney General Peter Verniero reported that racial profiling is
"real, not imagined," and that blacks are pulled over more often and are far
more likely to be searched.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Act on Gas Additive  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is exploring whether to
regulate the gasoline additive MTBE under a law that controls toxic chemicals, a
first step toward a possible ban, government sources and a lawmaker said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Environmental Protection Agency has submitted for White House review a
general outline for possible regulation of the additive and could issue a notice
for a proposed rule on MTBE within weeks, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   EPA Administrator Carol Browner acknowledged as early as last summer
misgivings about MTBE, the oxygenate used in about a third of the country's
gasoline. Her agency had detected signs that it is contaminating lakes and
groundwater.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are currently in discussions within the administration about the best
approaches that we might take to address these concerns,'' said David Cohen, a
spokesman for the agency. He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Government sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
administration is exploring a broad range of actions to deal with MTBE in part
because Congress has not acted. A number of MTBE bills have been introduced, but
their prospects remain uncertain.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who introduced legislation for a national ban
on use of MTBE in gasoline, said the EPA and White House are considering
regulating the additive under the Toxic Substance Control Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The law regulates use of chemicals. The EPA previously has said it has no
authority to regulate MTBE, and Congress should act to limit its use in light of
evidence the additive is contaminating groundwater.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Browner, Boxer urged the EPA ``to move swiftly'' to phase out
the additive, once touted as the key to cleaner gasoline and reduced air
pollution, particularly from toxic tailpipe emissions.
</P>
<P>
	   She made a similar plea in a separate letter to Jack Lew, director of the
Office of Management and Budget at the White House. ``This is crucial for
California,'' Boxer added in a handwritten postscript on her letter to Lew.
</P>
<P>
	   The MTBE additive is used in all or part of 16 states and accounts for a
third of the gasoline sold in the country, including much of that sold in the
Northeast. Refiners turned to the additive after the 1990 Clean Air Act required
gasoline in areas with serious air pollution to contain at least 2 percent
oxygen by weight.
</P>
<P>
	   MTBE, a leading oxygenate and octane booster, reduces emissions of toxic
chemicals and smog-causing chemicals from automobile tailpipes, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
	   But because MTBE moves quickly through soil and groundwater when gasoline
leaks from underground tanks or is spilled, the additive has been found to
contaminate aquifers and lakes that are the source of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``MTBE has now been detected in groundwater and drinking water in over 41
states,'' maintained Boxer. ``EPA action to completely phase out MTBE is long
overdue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last summer, an EPA advisory panel said that while current levels of MTBE in
water pose no health risk, its use should be dramatically curtailed because of
potential widespread water pollution problems. MTBE has been found to be a
carcinogen and poses health as well as environmental risks, other critics of the
additive have said.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of companies that manufacture MTBE argue the water-quality
fears have been exaggerated, and the additive is crucial to reducing air
pollution.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Swipe At Sen. Ashcroft  </HEADLINE>
   By LIBBY QUAID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats chided GOP Sen. John Ashcroft Tuesday for
accepting an honorary degree from a Southern Christian college that bans
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
	   The criticism came from Senate Democrats' campaign arm in advance of a
Missouri visit by George W. Bush, who is under fire for speaking at the same
college, Bob Jones University. The Greenville, S.C., school, which lost its
tax-exempt status in the 1970s because of racial discrimination, is a popular
stop for many GOP candidates seeking conservative support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is absolutely sickening that John Ashcroft would lend his personal
endorsement and the prestige of his office to the causes of bigotry, racial
separation and anti-Catholicism,'' said Jim Jordan, DSCC political director.
</P>
<P>
	   The school, whose officials would not accept a reporter's phone calls, also
has been accused of intolerance toward Catholics.
</P>
<P>
	   Ashcroft is battling a re-election challenge by Democratic Gov. Mel
Carnahan, whose campaign said Ashcroft should return the honorary degree.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator's spokesman said an honorary degree is a common courtesy that
cannot be taken as an endorsement. ``In this instance, Senator Ashcroft accepted
an opportunity to speak to the student body, and did not then, and does not now,
have knowledge of their specific teachings,'' spokesman Steve Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He totally repudiates attacks on religious denominations or beliefs and
completely embraces the American heritage of the equality of all people and
religious and racial diversity and tolerance,'' Hilton added.
</P>
<P>
	   He also referred questions to Steve Mamanella, spokesman for the St. Louis
archdiocese, who said: ``Certainly, we can say that in all of our experience,
we've never had any reason to believe that Senator Ashcroft in his time as
senator or governor of Missouri has not treated the church or Catholics with
respect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ashcroft filed Senate travel disclosure reports showing he traveled May 7
and 8 to the school. The school paid $741 for Ashcroft's transportation and
lodging.

<HEADLINE> GOP Attacks Clinton's Forest Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In one of their strongest assaults yet on President
Clinton's forest protection effort, GOP senators Tuesday said the initiative
violates federal laws and was crafted secretly with the help of environmental
special interests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have fatally tainted this rule-making,'' Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho,
told Clinton administration officials at a hearing of the subcommittee he
chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the effort violates at least four laws, including the Freedom of
Information Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-Ariz., said the administration should ``declare this
process is invalid and start over,'' and that the administration ``did wrong''
in favoring environmentalists in crafting the initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   But agency officials defended the yearlong process, which could result in
permanent protections of up to 50 million acres of already roadless federal
forest land.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton announced the effort in October and gained accolades from
environmentalists for launching what they called one of the great conservation
efforts of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton officials said they have already gathered 500,000 public
comments and held 200 public meetings on the preliminary, scoping phase of the
rule-making. They said they plan dozens of more meetings after a draft
protection plan is unveiled in May.
</P>
<P>
	   As for suggestions that the Forest Service is limiting public comments,
``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' said Jim Lyons, the Agriculture
Department undersecretary who oversees the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
	   He added, ``We are confident we are following the letter of the law.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP lawmakers have been critical of the plan from the day Clinton announced
it, saying it would restrict access to recreationists, loggers and other forest
users.
</P>
<P>
	   But the GOP criticisms have increased in severity in recent days. Last
Friday, a House subcommittee released a preliminary report drawing the same
conclusions the senators did Tuesday -- that the effort violates laws.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point during Tuesday's hearing of the forests and public land
management subcommittee, eight GOP senators, all from the West, took turns
criticizing the administration and the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do have an agency that's run amok,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska, who chairs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which includes
the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., in criticizing the administration for
sidestepping Congress, said, ``Administrative decree may work great in a
monarchy, but it's a lousy form of policy in a democracy.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Opening Hungary Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- The FBI is opening its first permanent office
abroad in Hungary, a move that will allow agents to work with foreign police in
an investigative task force, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Four FBI agents will help Hungarian police investigate organized crime --
particularly involving Russians -- trafficking in drugs and weapons, money
laundering and other crimes, the U.S. Embassy in Hungary said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI spokesman Bill Carter said in Washington that the agents will be allowed
to carry guns but will not have law enforcement powers. They will accompany
Hungarian police on raids, searches and interrogations.
</P>
<P>
	   The office is expected to open this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The office will be on the premises of the International Law Enforcement
Academy, but there are many details yet to be worked out,'' the deputy
communications director of the Hungarian National Police, Lt. Col. Andras Rozsa,
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   It will operate on the basis of a September agreement signed between FBI
Director Louis Freeh and the Hungarian Interior Ministry. At the signing, Freeh
stressed the need for international police cooperation to combat international
terrorism and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI has 38 offices around the world in which agents are assigned to U.S.
embassies as legal attaches, working with the local foreign police to follow up
leads on cases.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI agents have also worked on investigations abroad alongside foreign
police before, but these were in temporary assignments limited to one case or
several related cases, like the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, or the
embassy bombings in East Africa.

<HEADLINE> Attorneys trade charges at close of Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Amadou Diallo forced police to fire a 41-bullet
barrage at him on his Bronx doorstep by refusing to stop for questioning and
pulling what appeared to be a gun, defense attorneys argued Tuesday.
<P>
	   "That's not unreasonable behavior on their part," attorney John Patten said
in closing arguments at the murder trial of four police officers. "That's
unreasonable on his part."
</P>
<P>
	   Although the black object in Diallo's hand turned out to be a wallet, when
he pulled it out, "that was it," Patten told the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't expect (the officers) to stand there and get blasted away."
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution countered by portraying the defendants as trigger-happy
patrolmen who made a snap judgment that the victim - an unarmed black immigrant
from West Africa "minding his own business" - was really a bad guy lurking in a
bad neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo, 22, "was being looked at in a way that doomed him from the start,"
said prosecutor Eric Warner.
</P>
<P>
	   Patten argued that with bullets ricocheting around the vestibule of Diallo's
apartment building, the defendants thought they were in a firefight, and made a
split-second decision to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers "were wrong," he said. "They made a mistake. But they honestly
believed this guy was shooting at them."
</P>
<P>
	   In a scathing two-hour closing argument, Warner repeated allegations that
the plainclothes officers cornered the victim in the 5-by-7-foot vestibule at
12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999, then, without warning or justification, unleashed 41
bullets. The victim was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner accused the defendants of jumping to false conclusions - and sticking
to them - despite signs Diallo was a "decent man" who lived on a quiet,
working-class street. He singled out Officer Sean Carroll for making the
decision to try to stop Diallo on a shaky "hunch" that he might be a wanted
rapist or robber.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting "wasn't a mistake," Warner said. "It was a terrible series of
conscious decisions."
</P>
<P>
	   Mocking defense claims that Diallo's dimly lighted doorstep contributed to a
tragic mistake, Warner charged that the officers "took a dim view of that block.
... And it was downhill from there."
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo "didn't do anything wrong that night, and they didn't do anything
right," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The closing arguments came after nine days of testimony in the trial of
Carroll, 37, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy, 27. The
defendants - all white - have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was moved to Albany after a judge ruled the defendants could not
get a fair trial in New York City because of the publicity surrounding the case.
The jury was to begin deliberating on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted of murder, the officers face a maximum sentence of 25 years to
life in prison. However, State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi opened the
door for a compromise verdict last week by ruling that jurors would be able to
consider less serious charges such as second-degree manslaughter, which would
mean the defendants could get only probation.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense argued Tuesday there was not enough proof to convict the
officers on any charge. They said a medical examiner's theory that most of the
bullets hit Diallo as he was going down or already on the ground was flawed and
biased.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys also attacked prosecutors for not calling the only eyewitness
other than the officers. Called by the defense, the witness, Schrrie Elliott,
testified that she heard one officer yell "Gun!" before shots erupted, and that
the victim appeared to stay upright.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner said prosecutors considered Elliott too unreliable to put on the
stand. But he also reminded jurors of her testimony that the officers jumped out
of the car with their guns drawn and shot Diallo without telling him to stop.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy's attorney, James Culleton, argued that his client opened fire only
after Carroll and McMellon shot first. Murphy also saw McMellon fall off the
stoop, and assumed he had been shot, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another defense attorney, Steven Brounstein, warned against the
prosecution's "mantra of 41 bullets. ... This is not a case of 41 shots."
</P>
<P>
	   Culleton also said the officers followed police procedure when they stopped
to question Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   "They didn't know he lived in that building," said Culleton. "And they had
an obligation, following proper police procedure, to stop, to walk up to Mr.
Diallo and ask, 'Who are you?' and 'Why are you in this area?"'
</P>
<P>
	   "Why Mr. Diallo acted the way he did to this simple request to talk, we'll
never know," he said.

<HEADLINE> Some Airlines Reject Fare Hike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The latest effort to boost airfares by up to $30
per round trip has stalled, with several airlines refusing to go along.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental started the latest round of increases on Friday, citing
escalating fuel prices, which have doubled in the past year. Five other large
airlines, including Fort Worth-based American, matched the increase.
</P>
<P>
	   But Southwest Airlines, Northwest Airlines and America West were among those
that held out.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, American rolled back its increase two days after putting it in
effect, as did Continental, Delta Air Lines and several others.
</P>
<P>
	   Just three weeks ago, Continental led a successful fare increase, boosting
fares $20 per round trip to help cover higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Fuel is the second-largest expense for airlines, behind labor costs.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls for Talks With India  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Complaining of ``increasingly strident''
statements from India, Pakistan's new foreign secretary urged Indian leaders
Tuesday to accept his country's offer of talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In recent months, Indian policy-makers and leaders have become
increasingly strident in their pronouncements against Pakistan,'' said Inam-ul
Haq, who took over the No. 2 job at Pakistan's foreign ministry last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have responded with a policy of restraint and maturity and have
expressed our willingness to resume dialogue with India,'' he said. ``We live in
a difficult environment. The quest for security and peace has always been at the
core of our foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
	   All topics are open for discussion, said Haq, but the big issue is the
disputed Kashmir region. Both India and Pakistan lay claim to Kashmir, a former
princely state divided between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Five civilians were killed in the region Monday night, when Pakistani troops
fired more than 500 rounds of mortar shells across the border in Kashmir, the
Indian army said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan accused India of firing the first shots and killing three Pakistani
civilians in the encounter. ``Our troops retaliated, hitting selected military
targets,'' Pakistan army spokesman Col. Salaut Raza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cross-border shelling is common in the volatile region.
</P>
<P>
	   Kashmir -- the flashpoint of two previous wars between Pakistan and India --
rose to international prominence in 1998 when the two South Asian nations
exploded nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
	   Both countries claim to have nuclear arms, although neither has spelled out
the type or number of weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kashmir dispute will have to be settled if peace in the region is to be
guaranteed, Haq said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Indian foreign ministry could not immediately be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan wants a vote held on both sides of the disputed border to let
Kashmiris decide whether a reunified Kashmir would become part of India or
Pakistan. Such a vote is guaranteed in a 1948 U.N. resolution. India rejects a
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan also has sought international mediation, and President Clinton, who
is to visit India next month, has offered to try to bridge the divide. However,
India has flatly rejected any outside mediation. Clinton said both countries
have to agree to his intervention before he will do it.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision has not yet been made on whether Clinton will stop in Pakistan on
his trip to the region. The visit was put in question last October after the
army threw out the elected government of Nawaz Sharif and took control.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Gen. Pervez Musharraf has refused to set a timetable for a return to
democracy, saying he wants to clean up a deeply corrupt system and revive a weak
and ailing economy before holding elections.

<HEADLINE> Resignation in Lockerbie Case  </HEADLINE>
   By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- The resignation of Scotland's chief
prosecutor just months before the start of the trial of two Libyans accused in
the 1988 Lockerbie bombing has sparked protests from the families of victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Relatives of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103 said Tuesday they were baffled
by the resignation of Lord Andrew Hardie as the May 3 trial date approached.
Hardie resigned Feb. 15 to accept a judgeship in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just amazes me that he would do this at a time like this,'' said Susan
Cohen of Cape May Court House, N.J., who lost her 20-year-old daughter,
Theodora, in the explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988. ``It seems
to me he had a responsibility to the families to stay.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I find the move at this time baffling,'' said Jim Swire, a spokesman for
the families of British victims whose daughter died in the bombing. ``One would
think that for a Scottish solicitor this trial would be the pinnacle of his
career.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hardie will be replaced by Colin Boyd, Scotland's solicitor-general and the
former No. 2 man on the prosecution team.
</P>
<P>
	   The resignation was the latest in a series of indications raising doubts as
to whether the prosecution's case is as straightforward or watertight as U.S.
and British authorities have asserted.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors maintain that two Libyan men were responsible for placing a
suitcase bomb on a flight originating in Malta and having it transferred onto
the Pan Am airliner in London. The men, employed by the Libyan national airline
in Malta, were allegedly undercover intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
	   But in January, Scottish legal sources reported that a star witness had
backpedalled on his earlier account that he saw one of the men place the
suitcase on the conveyor belt in Malta.
</P>
<P>
	   An investigative report in the Scottish Sunday Herald this week claimed
Hardie resigned ``because he realized that the Lockerbie case was a shambles and
would probably end in acquittal for the two Libyan defendants.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The case,'' it said, ``is plagued with problems including witnesses
changing statements, allegations that original FBI witness statements no longer
tally with witnesses' current account of events and new witnesses coming forward
who will throw the whole concept of a Libyan plot into disarray.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hardie on Friday dismissed the reports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I had ever thought that there was insufficient evidence to justify
proceeding with this case I would have pulled the plug,'' Hardie said.
</P>
<P>
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi surrendered Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah last year to stand trial at this former U.S. air base 24
miles southeast of Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
	   They are charged with the murders of the 270 passengers and residents of
Lockerbie killed when the Boeing 747 exploded over the Scottish town. The
explosion killed 259 passengers and crew -- including 189 Americans -- and 11
people on the ground.

Trucker Protest Turns Frenzied
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMHERST, Nova Scotia (AP) -- The truckers' protest at the Nova Scotia-New
Brunswick boundary turned into a frenzy of roaring engines and angry shouts
Tuesday as several rigs bolted from the blockade.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-day standoff on the Trans-Canada Highway turned ugly shortly after
it appeared the truckers and the RCMP had reached a deal to clear the roadway
and allow trucks through that didn't want to be part of the protest.
</P>
<P>
	   But as some of the trucks started to move to the shoulder of the highway
several vehicles tried to break free of the blockade altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the rigs were stopped by irate protesters who threw themselves in
front of the 18-wheelers.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Fowler, an independent trucker from nearby Truro, Nova Scotia, laid
down on the highway in front of a huge truck driven by an angry driver who was
determined to get back on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   The driver slammed on the truck's brakes just short of Fowler.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know... it's just too hard,'' a visibly shaken Fowler said when
asked why he would risk his life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I figure it's better to die trying than just do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Following the close encounter, RCMP officers imposed order on the situation,
keeping the protesters to one side of the road and allowing several trucks to
slip away from the protest.
</P>
<P>
	   The blockade began Sunday night as a way to draw attention to rising fuel
costs, toll highways and low wages.

Chretien Shrugs Off Bankrupt Firms That Got Job Grants
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien isn't bothered that 51 companies
that got federal job creation grants went out of business before completing
their projects.
</P>
<P>
	   Only communist countries guarantee nobody will go bankrupt, he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a market economy some people fail,'' Chretien told the Commons. ``What
is good about Canada (is) so many are successful.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform deputy leader Deborah Grey was unimpressed by the explanation,
complaining that $12 million in taxpayers money had evaporated instead of
generating jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal records made public Monday showed 51 firms that got money under the
Transitional Jobs Fund between 1996 and 1999 went bankrupt or otherwise closed
their doors before the projects were finished.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Human Resources Department point out that more than 1,000
grants worth $298 million were handed out in those three years.
</P>
<P>
	   They say a failure rate of around five per cent of recipients is acceptable
-- especially since many grants went to businesses in depressed economic regions
with high unemployment.
</P>

Feds Approve Viagra for Use by Veterans
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The federal government has included Viagra on its list of
drugs for which some veterans can receive benefits, raising a protest from one
MP that government has no place in the bedrooms of the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's decision to use public money to reinforce sexual performance with
pills is a first for Canada and came after Veterans Affairs received up to 1,000
requests a month for Viagra since it was approved last March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a go,'' said Veterans Affairs Minister George Baker, who approved the
plan to provide veterans of the First and Second World Wars, Korea and some
younger veterans with up to six pills a month.
</P>
<P>
	   With a $15 pill good for one session, the plan will cost millions, say
federal documents.
</P>
<P>
	   A total waste, said Tory Elsie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With all the problems we have in our Armed Forces, that we would spend any
money on this,'' raged Wayne. ``Now really and truly, I just can't believe this
one. Glory be, for heaven's sakes.

Ujjal Dosanjh To Be Sworn in As British Columbia Premier
</P>
<P>
	   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- Ujjal Dosanjh will be sworn in as
Canada's first Indo-Canadian premier Thursday in Victoria, but a cabinet shuffle
will wait.
</P>
<P>
	   Dosanjh will take over the job from interim premier Dan Miller after he won
a leadership race at an NDP convention last weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Dosanjh is currently the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
	   It's expected Dosanjh won't ask for his new cabinet to be sworn in for at
least another week.

<HEADLINE> New Boeing Talks Scheduled  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. and its striking engineers and technical
workers agreed Tuesday to meet with a federal mediator for new talks in an
attempt to end the 14-day-old strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides confirmed the meetings scheduled for Thursday -- but there were
no signs either had changed its position.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is a sign of hope, but it doesn't mean we're optimistic," said
Bill Dugovich, spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees
in Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the company remains interested in seeking
a resolution.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have not changed our previously held bargaining position but as we have
stated we are interested in seeking a resolution to this situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal mediator Rick Oglesby said neither side has indicated it has any new
proposals. Bargaining teams will meet at the request of the mediators at 10 a.m.
Thursday at the Doubletree Hotel in SeaTac, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's top federal mediator, C. Richard Barnes, was in Seattle talking
with both sides Tuesday and was expected to be present at Thursday's session.
</P>
<P>
	   As the strike entered its 14th day Tuesday, resolve seemed to be growing on
the picket lines.
</P>
<P>
	   Few thought the engineers and technical workers union, known as SPEEA, had
the backbone for a walkout, let alone a prolonged strike. But the engineers --
the brains behind many of Boeing's aerospace programs -- are proving to be more
committed and resilient than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we've shown we're a force to be reckoned with," said Bill Schivitz,
a flight-control engineer in Boeing's military aviation division who was walking
the line Tuesday across the street from his offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Things have not gone well for the company since the strike began Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing has been forced to handle difficult questions regarding its MD-80 and
DC-9 aircraft, inherited from its merger with McDonnell Douglas, after the crash
of Alaska Airlines Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   It has delivered only four airplanes so far this month. In February 1999,
Boeing delivered 47 aircraft to customers.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Tuesday, the German airline Lufthansa briefly grounded 26 Boeing
747-400 jets due to problems with the planes' fire-extinguishing system. Boeing
engineers, mostly SPEEA members, are often called upon to assist airlines with
technical problems like these.
</P>
<P>
	   While SPEEA's dues-paying membership is only around 64 percent of the 22,600
engineering and technical employees covered by the contract, SPEEA claimed as
many as 19,000 workers remained on strike Tuesday -- far more than the number of
actual SPEEA members. Boeing estimates place the number of strikers at 17,000.
Neither estimate has been changed since the beginning of the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   SPEEA members received their last paychecks Thursday, so things might get
more difficult in the coming weeks. However, the Boeing Employees Credit Union
has offered strikers special loans to help cover costs during the strike and has
waived loan repayments until the strike is over.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Hanling is working at his brother-in-law's machine shop when he's not
on the picket line and is also doing a little carpentry. When not on strike, he
is a stress engineer on Boeing's military F-22 fighter jet project.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm staying out here as long as it takes," he said. "I haven't had to take
out any loans or waive any payments yet, so I can do this for quite a while."
</P>
<P>
	   Many striking workers noted that while Boeing was once the only high-tech
employer in town, the Internet economy now offers some appealing options.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we'd all rather see Boeing do well, but if this drags on, I'll
think about sending my resume to other places," said Rick Reuter, a systems
engineer on the Joint Strike Fighter project, a military contract that Boeing
hopes to win.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is competing with Lockheed Martin, and U.S. Air Force officials
have voiced concerns about how the strike might affect Boeing's performance.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can be sure that Lockheed's schedules aren't slipping," Reuter said.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Can Join Merger Defense  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The state of Alaska can join the defense of the $30
billion merger between oil companies BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield, a federal
judge ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Susan Illston granted Alaska's request to enter the case
over the objection of the Federal Trade Commission, which has sued to block the
merger.
</P>
<P>
	   California, Oregon and Washington have filed a separate suit challenging the
merger. Illston agreed to consolidate their suit with the FTC case. A seven-day
hearing on a request by the FTC and the three states for an injunction against
the deal is scheduled to start the week of March 20.
</P>
<P>
	   London-based BP Amoco agreed last March to acquire Los Angeles-based
Atlantic Richfield, known as Arco. The purchase would create the second-largest
non-government oil company, behind Exxon Mobil.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC and the three states say the new company would gain virtual control
of Alaska crude oil supplies to West Coast refineries, with the power to force
price increases at the gas pump. The companies say oil prices are set by the
international market, which would be unaffected by the merger.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska sought to enter the case after the two companies agreed with the
state to sell some of their Alaska holdings, reducing their combined share of
the state's oil production from 70 to 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The state contends the agreement, which is binding only if the merger takes
place, will encourage increased oil production and more competition. Alaska,
heavily dependent on oil revenue, should be allowed into the case to defend its
interests, the state argued.
</P>
<P>
	   FTC lawyer Barbara Boast said the state's agreement with the oil companies
was a separate issue that had no legal connection to the validity of the merger.
</P>
<P>
	   Illston agreed that the oil companies could defend their merger adequately
without the state's help, but said the selloff agreement gave Alaska a stake in
the proceedings that justified its intervention.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian, Israel Talks Stalled  </HEADLINE>
   By DANA BUDEIRI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Negotiations with Israel are still deadlocked,
Palestinians said Tuesday night, expressing disappointment with messages relayed
by a top U.S. envoy from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   In his meeting with Clinton envoy Dennis Ross, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat urged the American administration to intervene in the negotiations,
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are going through a real crisis and the peace process needs to be put
back on track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross relayed Barak's answers to Palestinian demands, including the handover
of three Arab suburbs of Jerusalem as part of an interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Israelis were prepared to consider other Palestinian demands
regarding the overdue handover of 6.1 percent of West Bank land, ``these changes
will not include the three villages around Jerusalem,'' said a senior
Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking after the meeting, Ross said ``certainly there are difficulties,
but we will continue to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, expectations were low that Ross would succeed. Israel has been
resisting U.S. intervention, while the Palestinians have demanded a more intense
mediation effort by Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians have said they would not resume negotiations unless Israel
reaffirms a promise to carry out a West Bank troop withdrawal ahead of a final
peace accord, in addition to the overdue 6.1 percent pullback.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has proposed to skip the next pullback, arguing there was no point in
dealing with interim issues when a final treaty is being discussed. The deadline
for the final status agreement is Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides are also at odds over whether in the interim phase, Israel
alone can determine what areas of the West Bank it will hand over.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli officials have accused the Palestinians of creating an unnecessary
crisis and being inflexible on relatively minor issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know who is scoring points, but I know who is losing -- the peace
process,'' Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said after a meeting with Ross.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said principles were at stake.
Barak's refusal to let the Palestinians have a say in sketching withdrawal maps
indicated that ``there is not even a minimum of partnership,'' Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides have already missed a major peace deadline -- a Feb. 13 target
date for formulating a blueprint for a peace treaty. The Palestinians have
suggested that the framework -- which was Barak's idea from the start -- be
skipped and negotiators try to work on a full treaty instead. Barak has
suggested that May be set as a new deadline for a treaty framework.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli commentators have outlined what they say is Barak's own timetable.
They say that if by the end of April, peace talks with Syria are not in full
swing, Barak will take the first steps toward a unilateral troop withdrawal from
Lebanon, Syria's client state, and only then move ahead full force on the
Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, Barak aide Yossi Kucik said Israel has approved construction
of 27 new vacation cottages on the Golan Heights and will continue building as
long as there is no agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Security officials, meanwhile, have warned Barak that the crisis with the
Palestinians could lead to widespread unrest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
the Haaretz daily said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Two anti-Israeli protests were staged Tuesday in the West Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- An anti-abortion activist who led a 40-day protest last year
demanding the release of political prisoners faces up to seven years in prison
when he goes on trial Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Oscar Elias Biscet has been charged with insulting patriotic symbols, public
disorder and instigating delinquency, said his government-appointed defense
attorney, Sergio Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
	   Biscet, a medical doctor, was arrested Nov. 3 arrest after he allegedly hung
the Cuban flag upside down during a protest as a sign of civil disobedience. It
apparently was that act that most enraged Cuban authorities, for whom the
national flag and other patriotic symbols are sacred.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other government opponents, Fermin Scull Zulueta and Eduardo Diaz
Fleitas, go on trial the same day and face sentences of up to 4 1/2 years each,
said Elizardo Sanchez, president of the Cuban Commission of Human Rights and
National Reconciliation. He did not provide specifics about the charges against
them.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this year, Sanchez said that Cuba's civil rights situation worsened
during the past six months of 1999, with a slight increase in the number of
people submitted to the Cuban justice system for political crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, he said that his commission's ongoing survey showed that 344
people were sanctioned or otherwise processed for political reasons during the
last half of the year, up from 324 during the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   About 20 percent of those processed during the last half of 1999 could be
classified as prisoners of conscience under criteria established by many
international human rights groups, Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government's position is that it holds no political prisoners,
only common criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   Biscet was one of four government opponents who consumed only liquid foods
last summer during a 40-day fast to press their demands for people they said
were held for political reasons. He heads a human rights group that calls itself
the Lawton Foundation, named for a Havana neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Biscet has said he lost his job at a government hospital when he clashed
with authorities over the policy of providing clinical abortions on demand.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Close on Congo Force  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council is ``very close'' to
approving a plan to send U.N. military observers to monitor Congo's cease-fire,
but negotiators must settle some differences, the council president said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very likely that we're going to vote tomorrow (Wednesday),'' said
Argentina's U.N. Ambassador Arnoldo Listre, who holds the rotating council
presidency. ``I think we are close to an agreement, very close.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, which sponsored the resolution, would like it adopted to
coincide with the summit of leaders from six African nations involved in the war
in Congo. The summit begins Wednesday in Lusaka, Zambia.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels launched their campaign in August 1998, accusing Congolese
President Laurent Kabila of mismanagement, corruption and warmongering.
</P>
<P>
	   A cease-fire agreement was signed July 10 by Kabila and his allies --
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- and by Rwanda and Uganda. The main rebel
factions signed on in the weeks that followed.
</P>
<P>
	   But fighting continues in the north and southeast, with both sides accusing
each other of violations. Foreign troops have made no move to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. diplomats cautioned after Tuesday's council meeting and contacts
between governments which continued into the evening that a vote could be
delayed until later in the week.
</P>
<P>
	   The council could not vote before Wednesday because the U.S. Congress
requires 15 days notification of any U.N. peacekeeping operation. No
Congressional objection had been received by Tuesday night, clearing the way for
U.S. approval.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're making good progress and I'm confident we'll come to a final
resolution soon,'' said deputy U.S. Ambassador Nancy Soderberg, the top U.S.
negotiator.
</P>
<P>

cease-fire. The observers would also verify the separation and redeployment of

observers to be deployed.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended a force of 500 military observers
backed by 5,037 security and logistics personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   Some council members who favor a larger force want the resolution to
authorize ``at least'' 500 observers, leaving the secretary-general the option
of beefing up the force if there is a need. Others want the resolution to
authorize ``up to'' 500 observers.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the six nations are expected at Wednesday night's summit to try
once again to save the fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a pro-government militia says it has killed close to 275 Rwandan
and Angolan fighters while defending Congo's southeastern Shabunda region
against rebel attack, state-run radio in Congo's capital of Kinshasa reported
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> GOP Attacks Clinton's Forest Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In one of their strongest assaults yet on President
Clinton's forest protection effort, GOP senators Tuesday said the initiative
violates federal laws and was crafted secretly with the help of environmental
special interests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have fatally tainted this rule-making,'' Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho,
told Clinton administration officials at a hearing of the subcommittee he
chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the effort violates at least four laws, including the Freedom of
Information Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said the administration should ``declare this
process is invalid and start over,'' and that the administration ``did wrong''
in favoring environmentalists in crafting the initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   But agency officials defended the yearlong process, which could result in
permanent protections of up to 50 million acres of already roadless federal
forest land.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton announced the effort in October and gained accolades from
environmentalists for launching what they called one of the great conservation
efforts of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton officials said they have already gathered 500,000 public
comments and held 200 public meetings on the preliminary, scoping phase of the
rule-making. They said they plan dozens of more meetings after a draft
protection plan is unveiled in May.
</P>
<P>
	   As for suggestions that the Forest Service is limiting public comments,
``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' said Jim Lyons, the Agriculture
Department undersecretary who oversees the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
	   He added, ``We are confident we are following the letter of the law.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP lawmakers have been critical of the plan from the day Clinton announced
it, saying it would restrict access to recreationists, loggers and other forest
users.
</P>
<P>
	   But the GOP criticisms have increased in severity in recent days. Last
Friday, a House subcommittee released a preliminary report drawing the same
conclusions the senators did Tuesday -- that the effort violates laws.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point during Tuesday's hearing of the forests and public land
management subcommittee, eight GOP senators, all from the West, took turns
criticizing the administration and the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do have an agency that's run amok,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska, who chairs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which includes
the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., in criticizing the administration for
sidestepping Congress, said, ``Administrative decree may work great in a
monarchy, but it's a lousy form of policy in a democracy.''

<HEADLINE> Truckers protest soaring fuel prices at Capitol  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Independent truckers drove their big rigs Tuesday
through city streets to Capitol Hill to protest diesel fuel prices and demand
tax breaks to offset greatly increased operating costs.
<P>
	   "We're dying," said Douglas Sorantino, a rally organizer and New Jersey
truck driver. "We need help now. If they don't do it tomorrow, we won't be
around 60 or 90 days from now."
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 truckers joined a convoy that began in New Jersey and traveled
through Delaware and Maryland before snaking its way through the nation's
capital to a rally on the Capitol steps.
</P>
<P>
	   Police escorted the truckers, horns blaring, along the protest route and
finally through city streets near the Capitol cordoned off to allow parking for
the huge rigs. The truckers walked to the Capitol, some carrying signs that read
"Enough is Enough" and "Will Work for Fuel."
</P>
<P>
	   Truckers are angry that gasoline prices have been rising steadily since last
March, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut crude oil
production by 7.5 percent, or more than 2 million barrels a day, to boost prices
that had fallen to 12-year lows.
</P>
<P>
	   Increases in diesel fuel prices are costing truckers as much as $100 a day,
some haulers contended. They said the cost eventually will throw them out of
business and wreak havoc on an economy that depends on trucks to transport 90
percent of goods, including food, clothing, cars and appliances.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Hentz, a spokesman for the New Jersey group, said truckers can't
charge enough to meet their overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a funeral procession," he said. "If you don't do something about
the cost of fuel and tolls in the next 60 days, we're buried."
</P>
<P>
	   The trucks were adorned with hand-lettered signs. Among them was one on the
back of a dump truck that read: "Thank a trucker. If you live in it, if you wear
it, if you eat it, we brought it to you."
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Cornell, 35, of Browns Mills, N.J., said he sacrificed $400 by not
working Tuesday and for the cost of the fuel and tolls for the trip. But he said
he thinks it's worth it to make the point.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., who attended the rally, told
truckers, "When your industry comes to a standstill, this nation does, too."
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., sent President Clinton a letter Tuesday saying
rising prices of fuel and home heating oil should be considered "a national
emergency."
</P>
<P>
	   The spiraling costs are perhaps most apparent in the Northeast - Vermont,
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts and Connecticut - where diesel
costs average $1.86 a gallon, the American Automobile Association said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York and the District of Columbia prices have climbed as high as
$2.04 and $1.92 a gallon respectively, AAA said. Meanwhile, motorists are paying
about $1.37 a gallon for unleaded fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the nationwide average for diesel was $1.07 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   With some large trucks averaging just 5.5 miles per gallon and fuel tanks
that hold as much as 150 gallons, truckers say their costs are astronomical.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're gouging us with the prices," said Harry Greco, a driver from
Skippack, Pa. "It's out of control. Something has to be done."
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters want Congress and President Clinton to repeal or suspend a 24
cent federal excise tax paid at the pump on diesel and investigate OPEC.
</P>
<P>
	   "Truckers need immediate financial relief to help offset the escalating
burden of diesel fuel," said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who said he would
introduce legislation proposing a six-month suspension. "These higher costs will
soon be felt by consumers if we don't take immediate action."
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday that repealing the tax is
not a "viable option" since most of the money goes toward building highways that
truckers use.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been doing things to make sure that more product gets (to the
Northeast)," Lockhart said. "We have some evidence now that prices are coming
down, and we'll continue to watch the situation."
</P>
<P>
	   Truckers also are asking the White House to release oil from a government
reserve of almost 600 million barrels. Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan cautioned against tapping the reserve, which he said should be used
only to counter a crisis such as a total shutdown of Middle East oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to diesel fuel and gasoline, the crunch also is being felt by
home heating oil consumers, whose costs have doubled in some parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts believe OPEC will come under increasing pressure - especially from
industrialized nations such as the United States - to raise production at its
meeting in late March. Some caution, however, that such a move won't bring a
precipitous drop in prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will cool them off, and it will shave the peak in summer," said Roger
Diwan, managing director for global oil markets at The Petroleum Finance Co. in
Washington. But he cautioned: "I don't think they are going to cool off
dramatically."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Stand on Taiwan Worries U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration expressed concern Tuesday over
a warning by China that it could use force if Taiwan delays indefinitely
reunification talks with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. diplomats relayed the administration's concerns to Chinese authorities
in Beijing and Washington just a day after China issued the threat in an
11,000-word position paper.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart recalled that the
United States sent two aircraft carriers and other warships to the region to
calm a crisis four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We reject any use of force or any threat of force in this situation,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that peaceful dialogue and bilateral engagement between the
sides is the way to move forward,'' he said. ``We have repeated, I think, in
both actions and words that we view any threat to Taiwan with grave concern.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Stanley O. Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Chinese
position paper appeared to be contrary to ``the policy that is the bedrock of
our relations'' with China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of Congress, where support for Taiwan runs strong, suggested the
administration was not repudiating the Chinese with enough force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to articulate more clearly where we are,'' said Sen. Craig Thomas,
R-Wyo., chairman of the East Asian and Pacific subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said China's statement ``is unacceptable'' and
that the administration had the responsibility to make sure that China ``not
misinterpret where we are -- in one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the State Department, spokesman James P. Rubin said it would be a mistake
to exaggerate the significance of the Chinese statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had much worse periods on this question in the past,'' he said. He
added that the administration is not considering any change in its opposition to
legislation before Congress to strengthen U.S.-Taiwanese military relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said military ties with Taiwan, authorized under the Taiwan Relations
Act, has enabled the United States to be ``second-to-none'' in its support of
the anti-communist bastion. He said that arrangement has served U.S. interests
extremely well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody should doubt our willingness to act in our own national interest,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, China fired nuclear-capable missiles near Taiwan's two largest
ports, prompting the United States to send two aircraft carriers and other
warships to the region.
</P>
<P>
	   China's muscle-flexing at the time was related to impending presidential
elections. The new threat from Beijing appeared aimed at influencing
presidential elections on Taiwan set for next month. Analysts said China seems
intent on discouraging support for the candidate most identified with the
pro-independence sector on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart recalled that in 1996, ``we responded appropriately to what was
viewed as a threat. And that should give you some indication of how we view this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said there has been no change in
U.S. military operations in the Pacific in response to the threat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is only rhetoric at this point,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bacon said ``it would be extremely difficult for China to carry out an
invasion'' of Taiwan, given the Chinese military's limited capacity to execute a
large amphibious operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Lin Chong-pin, Taiwan's vice chairman of a council that handles Taiwan's
China policy, would not directly address the new threat but said tensions would
not ease as long as Beijing refuses to acknowledge that China is split and each
side is controlled by a separate government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until we unify, both sides of course will have different views about what
'one China' means,'' Lin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest flare-up comes amid President Clinton's drive to win
congressional approval of permanent trading benefits for China, part of a deal
to admit Beijing into the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules for
global trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents are likely to seize on the new Chinese stand in hopes of blocking
the trade package. Lockhart insisted that it should not affect the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The agreement is very much in our country's interest and our national
interest,'' he said. ``This is a one-sided agreement benefiting American
business, American workers, American families. We should move forward on that
basis.''

    MACON, Ga. (AP) -- Brown &AMP; Williamson said Tuesday it will close its Macon
cigarette manufacturing plant for a week next month because of slow sales.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bush Tried To Battle With Outsiders  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's supporters unleashed a torrent of
telephone calls and ads from a range of GOP activists trying to make the
difference in the governor's primary contest against John McCain on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain supporters fought back with phone efforts of their own, bearing down
especially in battleground counties around Detroit with a large Catholic vote --
reminding people that Bush visited a South Carolina school that has been
critical of Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside help for the Texas governor was evident everywhere in the state.
Veterans of Michigan Gov. John Engler's successful campaigns called supporters
to get them to vote, as did members of Michigan Right to Life, the state's main
anti-abortion group.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson took to the phones to criticize
McCain. And national anti-abortion and smokers' rights groups flooded the
airwaves with ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Engler campaign organization, which helped the Michigan governor win
three terms, put its resources behind Bush. Campaign workers went through lists
of Engler supporters, asking them to turn out for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's got every single Republican who's ever made a phone call in the last
20 years making phone calls on behalf of Gov. Bush,'' Michigan Republican Party
spokesman Sage Eastman said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a foundation in place,'' said Geralyn Lasher, a veteran of the
Engler administration who is now working for Bush. ``This is how we were
successful. This is the strategy that we've seen in Michigan that wins
elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   Callers read from a script that said, in part, ``After Gov. Bush's big
victory in South Carolina and Delaware, he is campaigning hard across your state
to earn your trust. Gov. George W. Bush is a reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
	   If Engler and his allies missed any likely Bush supporters, Michigan Right
to Life was also on the hunt. The anti-abortion group had its own phone banks
humming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have been pounding their list and really driving the message home,''
Eastman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Right to Life group reported airing at least $27,000 worth of
radio advertisements in Michigan, according to Federal Election Commission
records. And Black Americans for Life spent $2,300 running radio ads against
McCain, FEC records show.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Smokers Alliance, which gets tobacco industry money, has run
ads criticizing McCain's past support of a cigarette tax increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson recorded a phone call that accused a top McCain campaign official
of being ``a vicious bigot who wrote that conservative Christians in politics
are anti-abortion zealots, homophobes and would-be censors. John McCain refused
to repudiate these words.''
</P>
<P>
	   The official in question is former Sen. Warren Rudman, one of five
co-chairmen of McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Rudman angered some Christian conservative leaders in 1995 by defending
retired Gen. Colin Powell against their attacks over abortion. Rudman wrote
about the controversy in a book in which, among other things, he said the
religious right has a lot of ``bigots.''
</P>
<P>
	   While McCain's campaign did not muster nearly as much effort as the Bush
people did Tuesday, it focused sharply on the Catholic vote as well making broad
appeals to independents and Democrats. Phone calls from the campaign cited
Bush's visit to Bob Jones University, the South Carolina college that bans
interracial dating and is said by critics to espouse anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky at first denied the campaign was making such
calls but later conceded it had done so.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush called on some friends in lofty places to counter the tactic instantly.
Governors from nine states immediately rushed to their colleague's defense,
issuing statements Tuesday defending Bush's record.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've known George Bush since we were in college at Yale,'' said one of the
nine, New York Gov. George Pataki. ``He's a man of inclusion, tolerance and
honor. The attacks against him that imply anything other than that are wrong,
malicious and obviously coming from a desperate political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the behest of Bush's campaign, three Catholic senators issued statements
complaining that McCain's organization had made calls to Catholic voters citing
Bush's visit to Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a Catholic, I take offense at any attempt to use religion to frighten
voters,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``George W. Bush is a good a decent
man who doesn't have an intolerant bone in his body. To suggest that Governor
Bush is somehow anti-Catholic is outrageous and obscene.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was so much outside activity that both campaigns sought to use it as a
political weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mr. McCain's making phone calls in this state accusing me of being an
anti-Catholic bigot, and I don't appreciate it,'' Bush said in response to the
calls about Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
	   Opinsky returned fire at the Robertson calls. He called it an example of the
Bush campaign using outside groups to make ``totally false allegations against
John McCain. It's the same tactics they used in South Carolina.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Got No Lift From Mich. Gov.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- The vaunted Engler effect went flat.
</P>
<P>
	   But Texas Gov. George W. Bush professed no disenchantment Tuesday night with
his Michigan counterpart, who had spared no effort to deliver Republican votes
but fell short in the state's presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John's a friend of mine, but if I had to do it over again, you bet I'd
stand by my friend,'' Bush said in Kansas City, Mo., during a stopover where he
began to take the measure of his Michigan defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   Engler had stuck to Bush like glue in a primary campaign that was as bitter
as it was short, describing the state as the Texas governor's firewall against
John McCain. Bush's loss was the most significant yet for a GOP establishment
laying in wait to help Bush and hurt McCain from state to state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I may give the McCain organization a lot of credit on this one and I may
have to take a lot of the blame,'' Engler said on MSNBC. In not countering
McCain's appeal to Democrats, ``I might have made a big strategic error.''
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls indicated the three-term Michigan governor -- a man with
passionate enemies as well as friends -- may have hurt Bush more than helped
him.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about 15 percent of voters said Engler influenced their vote ``a great
deal,'' but those voters went for McCain, nearly 3-to-1. About half of voters
said Engler's endorsement of Bush didn't matter at all.
</P>
<P>
	   A day that began with Bush and Engler gathering over waffles and radio
call-in shows at Jimi's Restaurant in a Detroit suburb stretched into a long
evening of travel west for the Texas governor, punctuated by a Kansas City, Mo.,
airport rally where he appeared both testy and philosophical.
</P>
<P>
	   Absorbing the news that he was losing the primaries both in Michigan and in
Arizona, McCain's home state, Bush pointedly said of Michigan: ``I'm pleased
with the Republican vote,'' even if it was overtaken with McCain's coalition of
Republicans, Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the interesting thing is I won overwhelmingly among Republicans
and like-minded independents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And without identifying his rival, Bush slammed the ``politics of
division,'' referring to calls made to Michigan Catholics by the McCain campaign
noting Bush, while campaigning in South Carolina, had visited a school with a
history of criticizing Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I reject politics of those who try to pit one group of Americans against
another -- of those who try to divide us based upon our race or based upon our
faith,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're better people than that and we need leaders who understand how to
unite Americans. And to those Washington politicians who try to divide us into
boxes and pit us against each other, I say shame on you.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said: ``Let me make it crystal clear: I reject bigotry, I reject
prejudice; I repudiate anti-Catholicism and racism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters also faced accusations of exploiting religious divisions, as
Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson spread the message in recorded phone
calls that a McCain adviser -- who once criticized some religious right leaders
as bigots -- was a ``vicious bigot'' himself.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign said it had nothing to do with Robertson's calls; Engler
said he was not happy the calls were made.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush flew on to California to campaign for that state's huge primary and to
meet Wednesday with Hispanic voters.

<HEADLINE> Liberty Media To Buy Ascent Group  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- Liberty Media Group will buy Ascent Entertainment Group in a
$460 million deal that includes the Denver Nuggets, the Colorado Avalanche and
an arena, as well as the company's non-sports assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Liberty will pay $15.25 per share for Ascent, and also assume nearly $300
million in debt. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Liberty officials said Tuesday they will continue to look for a new owner
for the Nuggets, the Avalanche, and the new Pepsi Center stadium in Denver.
</P>
<P>
	   Liberty planned to buy the non-sports assets of the Denver-based Ascent last
year but the deal fell through. The company also provides pay-per-view
programming for hotels and satellite service and maintenance to NBC.
</P>
<P>
	   The unsuccessful Liberty deal was contingent on Ascent selling the teams and
the Pepsi Center. Ascent tried to sell the sports assets to Denver billionaire
Donald Sturm, but the deal collapsed over a city mandate that the teams would
remain in Denver for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Liberty plans to sell the teams and the arena, but will keep Dan Issel as
president and head coach of the Nuggets, Pierre Lacroix as general manager of
the Avalanche and Don Elliman as president of Ascent Sports Holdings.
</P>
<P>
	   Issel and Lacroix just signed long-term deals with Ascent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Denver-based Liberty owns video programming, communications, technology
and internet businesses in the United States, Europe, South America and Asia.
Liberty Media Group common stock is a tracking stock issued by
telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T Corp. Liberty Media Corp., which holds most of the
assets included in the Liberty Media Group, is a wholly owned subsidiary of
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Ascent rose $4.68 3/4 to $14.81 1/4 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. Shares of Liberty Group were down 62 1/2 cents to $50 in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Claims Success in E. Timor  </HEADLINE>
   By HEATHER PATERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- An Australian-led force lowered its flag over East
Timor for a final time Wednesday, leaving the recovering territory to the U.N.
administrators who will guide it toward full independence.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove presided over the ceremony outside his
multinational force's Dili headquarters. He will officially relinquish control
to the U.N. group later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   When the 19-nation force was deployed in September, East Timor was in chaos,
with buildings on fire and gunshots from anti-independence militias and maverick
Indonesian troops echoing across the capital, Dili.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, hundreds of thousands of East Timorese who were forced to flee the
bloody mayhem are trying to rebuild their shattered lives and hope their
homeland will be independent within a few years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is one of the most complex, challenging and most successful military
operations we have ever run,'' Cosgrove said Tuesday in a farewell speech to his
troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Cosgrove is scheduled to depart on an Australian navy ship, leaving the U.N.
force under the command of Lt. Gen. Jaime de los Santos of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
	   The multinational troops, known as Interfet, supervised the largely peaceful
withdrawal of Indonesian soldiers from East Timor and had the territory under
its control within seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the massive destruction before they arrived, skirmishes with
militias and Indonesian troops were few. The peacekeepers killed one Indonesian
police officer and six militia men.
</P>
<P>
	   Two soldiers died, one in a car accident and another from illness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very relieved about the low cost in human terms with violence
virtually stopping after our arrival, low cost in lives to Interfet and our
adversaries,'' Cosgrove said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesia's military is accused of helping the anti-independence militias
launch the violence after East Timor's people overwhelmingly voted for
independence from Indonesia in a U.N.-supervised ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   A state-appointed human rights report and a separate U.N. investigation have
accused former military chief Gen. Wiranto of being ultimately responsible for
the terror and destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   President Abdurrahman Wahid dropped Wiranto as security minister last week
over the allegations, and state prosecutors are considering whether to file
charges against him and other senior Indonesian commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-star general had repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Yasril Ananta Baharuddin, head of a parliamentary commission that
scrutinizes the military, said Wiranto will be summoned before parliament in
early March to answer questions about the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want firsthand information from Wiranto himself,'' the legislator said.
</P>
<P>
	   The anti-independence militias are still active in Indonesian-controlled
West Timor, where members stoned a U.N. team on Tuesday and disrupted the return
of 1,000 refugees back to East Timor. No one was injured but only 179 people
made it across the border, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. peacekeepers are well-armed, with automatic weapons, and have
authority to use them to defend themselves and carry out their jobs. It is
anticipated that the troops deployed along the West Timor border would be more
heavily armed to deal with militias than peacekeepers elsewhere in the
territory, U.N. officials said.

<HEADLINE> Two pit bulls maul man shoveling snow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A man mauled by two pit bills remained in guarded
condition Tuesday night two days after he was attacked while shoveling snow in
his driveway.
<P>
	   Dennis Whitcomb, 51, underwent surgery after suffering extensive wounds to
his face, neck, chest and right arm Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Alerted by neighbors, police said they arrived to find Whitcomb lying face
down in the street while the dogs tore away at his body. Two officers fired
their guns and killed one dog. The other was captured and was being kept at the
city's animal control center.
</P>
<P>
	   The dogs' owner, Joseph Smith, 48, was ticketed for violating a city code
against keeping his animals unleashed and failing to license them. Police also
were weighing criminal charges against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after Rochester Mayor William Johnson called on changes in state law
as a result of the mauling, another pit bull attack was reported in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Tuesday afternoon, a pit bull jumped a fence and attacked several
people including one who was treated at a hospital, police said. Two other
people were injured, but refused to be treated.
</P>
<P>
	   City police cornered the pit bull and shot it.

<HEADLINE> School Gets Vivid Lesson on Safety  </HEADLINE>
   By KELLY KURT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORT GIBSON, Okla. (AP) -- The teen-ager standing on stage in short sleeves
and jeans looked like he had nothing to hide -- until he pulled a knife from his
pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   And then came a machete. And another. He drew a handgun from a front pocket,
and three more from his waistband. He reached down his baggy pants leg and up
came a rifle.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time Chris Dorn's pockets were empty, an arsenal lay before the high
school sophomore. And the audience of school, police and emergency officials had
a better idea of what they face in their efforts to keeping schools safe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He can double the number of weapons just with a jacket on,'' Michael Dorn,
school safety specialist and Chris' father, said Tuesday during the school
security workshop sponsored by the Oklahoma Schools Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 people came to learn about school safety in the town where in
December, a 13-year-old boy shot four students outside Fort Gibson Middle
School.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the country's third school shooting of the year. In May, a
15-year-old boy in Conyers, Ga., wounded six students. And in April, two
students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., shot 12 students and a
teacher to death, before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   A national study found more than 100,000 students carry a gun to school each
day, but only 4,000 student gun expulsions were reported to the U.S. Department
of Education last year, Dorn said.
</P>
<P>
	   While schools cannot ensure safety, they can enact strategies that make
schools safer, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dorn, who works for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, said enforcing
dress codes and reducing ``triggering behaviors'' such as fights and bullying
can help make a difference. Schools also have used random locker inspections and
surprise classroom searches to foil potential acts of violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also discussed creating emergency plans for schools that would include
everyone, from the local police to the school bus drivers.
</P>
<P>
	   Fort Gibson already had a crisis plan when the December attack took place.
The district has since started using a metal detector at special events, added
security cameras and limited building access, Superintendent Steve Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just being mentally prepared can help,'' Wilmoth said.

<HEADLINE> Legend Airlines Postpones Launch  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRISTY LEMIRE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Legend Airlines postponed its debut flights from Dallas Love
Field after the Federal Aviation Administration found several problems during an
inspection Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dallas-based startup initially had planned its first flight Feb. 29, but
aircraft inspectors on Tuesday found about 60 items that would not pass
certification, said John Clabes, spokesman for the FAA's regional office in
Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some of them are fairly simple things they overlooked when they redesigned
the airplane. Some are major," said Clabes, who would not specify what the
problems were.
</P>
<P>
	   Legend president and CEO T. Allan McArtor said the airline has asked the FAA
to delay the certification process for a few days to perfect the installation of
custom-designed gourmet kitchens and in-flight television systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Each DC-9 in Legend's fleet is being reconfigured to seat 56 passengers and
to add satellite telephones, live television and power outlets for portable
electronic devices. In addition, the airline has developed new kitchens that
will require FAA engineering approval.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a lot of things that weren't ready -- very, very minor things. ...
There was absolutely nothing of major importance at all," McArtor said Tuesday
night in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   "The primary delay problem for us is the technologically advanced system --
the television, the galleys, the laptop power supply."
</P>
<P>
	   McArtor said the airline must rework the flight schedule, and said any
customers who have booked seats on canceled flights will be placed on Delta Air
Lines or offered full refunds. Legend also is offering a buy-one, get-one-free
deal for inconvenienced passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   McArtor said he would know later this week how many flights would be delayed
and when the first flights would be rescheduled. He would not say how much money
the delays would cost the airline.
</P>
<P>
	   Clabes said the FAA recommended that Legend begin flying in early March.

<HEADLINE> Cuba: Diplomat Is Not a Spy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba reiterated its denial of U.S. charges that one of its
diplomats in Washington engaged in espionage, saying Tuesday that all of the
official's dealings with a U.S. immigration officer suspected of spying for the
communist country were public and legal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To recruit people to undertake espionage is not conceivable nor has ever
been undertaken by officials in our Interests Section in Washington,'' the Cuban
government said in a lengthy statement carried by state news media.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement admitted that Mariano Faget, a Cuban-born supervisor with the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, had contact with officials at the
Cuban Interests Section in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   But they discussed migration accords between the two countries and illegal
entries into the United States by Cubans, not sensitive intelligence matters,
the government said.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget was arrested in Miami last week on charges of passing classified
information to Cuba's communist government.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami Herald on Tuesday identified the diplomat targeted for expulsion
as Jose Imperatori. Neither Washington nor Havana has named the Cuban official
ordered to leave the United States by the end of this week, but the government
statement did name Imperatori as someone Faget had talked to in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   Havana has accused Washington of inventing the spy charges to block the
return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba and has said it will
not willingly withdraw the official.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials have said the two cases are unrelated and that Faget has not
been involved in decisions involving Elian. The U.S. State Department said
Tuesday the official will lose his diplomatic privileges if Cuba continues to
insist that he remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been at the center of a U.S.-Cuban custody dispute since he was
found Thanksgiving Day lashed to an inner tube off the Florida coast. His mother
and 10 others died when their boat capsized during an attempt to flee Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   His father and the Cuban government have demanded the boy's return. Elian's
Miami relatives have gone to court to block an INS ruling that ordered him
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami Herald, citing three U.S. officials it did not name, said
Imperatori met with Elian's grandmothers, Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana,
after they arrived at a Miami airport for an aborted attempt to meet with their
grandson on Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said Imperatori, based in Washington, ordered the
grandmothers' jet fueled after a tense standoff at Kendall-Tamiami Executive
Airport and accompanied them on the return flight to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers met with Elian on Jan. 26. It is unknown whether Imperatori
was with them during their second visit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government statement also viewed as ``extremely strange'' the
sudden illness of U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who was to rule Tuesday
on attempts by Elian's Miami relatives to block his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore was assigned Tuesday to replace
Hoeveler, who was hospitalized over the weekend for an apparent stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of Cuban athletes and coaches, headed by Olympic medalists Javier
Sotomayor and Alberto Juantorena, gathered Tuesday for the latest in an almost
daily string of rallies pressing for the boy's return to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida filed a brief
urging the court to appoint an attorney to determine whether a ``reasonable,
coherent asylum claim can be made on Elian's behalf,'' said executive director
Howard Simon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If not, then Elian should be returned to the custody of his father,'' said
Simon.

<HEADLINE> Officer Testifies in Shootout Case  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Fire Department ambulance driver testified Tuesday he
left a bleeding bank robber in a street after the 1997 North Hollywood shootout
because he believed the gunman was ``at death's door'' and could not be helped.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Richard Skier, a 14-year emergency medical technician, said he was told
by police at the scene to ``get out of here'' and that he and his partner feared
they were about to be shot by other gunmen believed to be loose in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Skier was a witness in the trial of a civil rights lawsuit that claims
police allowed robber Emil Matasareanu, 30, to bleed to death. The suit, filed
on behalf of the gunman's children, names the city and two now-retired officers
as defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Matasareanu was shot 29 times in the Feb. 28, 1997, gunbattle that wounded
11 officers and six civilians. Matasareanu's partner, Larry Eugene Phillips Jr.,
26, died when he shot himself at the same time a police bullet hit him.
</P>
<P>
	   The shootout between the robbers, clad in body armor and blasting at lightly
armed police with automatic weapons, was broadcast to the nation by TV news
helicopters. Matasareanu was felled in a close-quarters firefight with a carload
of officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Skier testified he saw Matasareanu lying in the street, his body riddled
with wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I looked at Mr. Matasareanu and he looked like he was at death's door,''
said Skier. ``I didn't think I could drag him 50 feet to my ambulance without
making his injuries worse. And I thought it best to get out of there with a
civilian who could be helped.''
</P>
<P>
	   Skier said he was already violating Fire Department rules by entering a
hostile area where gunfire had been erupting moments before.
</P>
<P>
	   Of a police officer who told him and his partner to get out of there, he
said, ``I think the officer was trying to save me and my partner by telling us
to leave. ... We were in imminent danger of getting killed and he (Matasareanu)
looked like a dead body.''
</P>
<P>
	   James Vojtecky, a retired detective named in the suit, testified he did not
want Matasareanu to die, and that he believes the gunman kept moving about on
the ground because he wanted to bleed to death.
</P>
<P>
	   As jurors watched videotape of Matasareanu, Vojtecky said, ``The suspect is
moving around. He's trying to commit suicide.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was your impression that the man on the ground was trying to kill
himself?'' said attorney Stephen Yagman, representing the gunman's children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes,'' the detective said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yagman showed jurors a videotape in which two officers are seen slapping
hands in a congratulatory gesture and one of them then kicked the fallen
Matasareanu.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wasn't anywhere near the suspect or I would have stopped that garbage,''
Vojtecky said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Got No Lift From Mich. Gov.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- The vaunted Engler effect went flat.
</P>
<P>
	   But Texas Gov. George W. Bush professed no disenchantment Tuesday night with
his Michigan counterpart, who had spared no effort to deliver Republican votes
but fell short in the state's presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John's a friend of mine, but if I had to do it over again, you bet I'd
stand by my friend,'' Bush said in Kansas City, Mo., during a stopover where he
began to take the measure of his Michigan defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   Engler had stuck to Bush like glue in a primary campaign that was as bitter
as it was short, describing the state as the Texas governor's firewall against
John McCain. Bush's loss was the most significant yet for a GOP establishment
laying in wait to help Bush and hurt McCain from state to state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I may give the McCain organization a lot of credit on this one and I may
have to take a lot of the blame,'' Engler said on MSNBC. In not countering
McCain's appeal to Democrats, ``I might have made a big strategic error.''
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls indicated the three-term Michigan governor -- a man with
passionate enemies as well as friends -- may have hurt Bush more than helped
him.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about 15 percent of voters said Engler influenced their vote ``a great
deal,'' but those voters went for McCain, nearly 2-to-1. About half of voters
said Engler's endorsement of Bush didn't matter at all.
</P>
<P>
	   A day that began with Bush and Engler gathering over waffles and radio
call-in shows at Jimi's Restaurant in a Detroit suburb stretched into a long
evening of travel west for the Texas governor, punctuated by a Kansas City, Mo.,
airport rally where he appeared both testy and philosophical.
</P>
<P>
	   Absorbing the news that he was losing the primaries both in Michigan and in
Arizona, McCain's home state, Bush pointedly said of Michigan: ``I'm pleased
with the Republican vote,'' even if it was overtaken with McCain's coalition of
Republicans, Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the interesting thing is I won overwhelmingly among Republicans
and like-minded independents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And without identifying his rival, Bush slammed the ``politics of
division,'' referring to calls made to Michigan Catholics by the McCain campaign
noting Bush, while campaigning in South Carolina, had visited a school with a
history of criticizing Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I reject politics of those who try to pit one group of Americans against
another -- of those who try to divide us based upon our race or based upon our
faith,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're better people than that and we need leaders who understand how to
unite Americans. And to those Washington politicians who try to divide us into
boxes and pit us against each other, I say shame on you.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said: ``Let me make it crystal clear: I reject bigotry, I reject
prejudice; I repudiate anti-Catholicism and racism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters also faced accusations of exploiting religious divisions, as
Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson spread the message in recorded phone
calls that a McCain adviser -- who once criticized some religious right leaders
as bigots -- was a ``vicious bigot'' himself.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign said it had nothing to do with Robertson's calls; Engler
said he was not happy the calls were made.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush flew on to California to campaign for that state's huge primary and to
meet Wednesday with Hispanic voters.

<HEADLINE> Constituencies Battle in GOP Contest  </HEADLINE>

   An AP News Analysis
By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The struggle for the Republican presidential nomination
has become a tale of two constituencies, the party faithful rallying behind
Texas Gov. George W. Bush while independents and Democrats flock to Sen. John
McCain, winner of Tuesday's primary in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   That gives each man a different claim to take into the multistate
competition in the weeks ahead -- McCain that his message of reform makes him
better positioned to lead the GOP to victory this fall, and Bush arguing that
Democrats are making mischief and will return to their own party in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews with voters leaving their polling places in Michigan indicated
that Republicans accounted for slightly less than half the ballots cast, and
that Bush won them overwhelmingly. Independents accounted for roughly a third of
the votes, and McCain ran as well with them as Bush did among Republicans.
Democrats accounted for nearly 20 percent of the vote, and McCain was the
overwhelming winner among this group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've never seen a candidate like John McCain who went out to rent
Democrats for a day,'' third-term Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Bush supporter,
argued as the results were tabulated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain isn't party building, he's party borrowing and there's a big
difference,'' he said. Bush himself asked Republicans in the runup to the
primary not to allow Democrats to dictate their choice.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's surrogates and staff argued the other side, buttressed by a CNN-USA
Today-Gallup poll released earlier in the day that showed McCain trumping Gore
59 percent to 35 percent in a hypothetical fall matchup.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to make a special plea tonight to my fellow Republican,'' the
Arizona senator said after the votes were counted. ``I am a proud Reagan
conservative,'' he added, mentioning his commitment to the military and his
opposition to abortion. ``Don't fear this campaign, my fellow Republicans. Join
it, Join it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, said the Arizona senator is
demonstrating on a national scale the very cross-party appeal that Bush has
shown in Texas and hopes to ride to the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is Al Gore's worst nightmare,'' argued Davis. ``John McCain's creating
a new majority tonight. He showed some of his ability to do that in New
Hampshire and here in one of the key states for the fall.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's Michigan victory was critical to him. It was the first of the
industrial states to vote, one of a number of swing states that will be pivotal
to the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
	   In terms of the nominating campaign, his own aides said in advance he was in
trouble if he lost in Michigan on the heels of his drubbing in South Carolina
last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's prospects are now refreshed -- he also won Tuesday's GOP primary at
home in Arizona -- and even before the votes were counted he and Bush were
pointing toward next week's primaries in Washington state and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain leads in the polls in Washington, and Bush in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Those elections will set the stage for March 7, when 13 states hold
primaries and caucuses and select 613 delegates to the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
	   The primary rules governing whether independents can vote vary from state to
state, something Bush and McCain must factor into their decisions about how to
spend their time and money.
</P>
<P>
	   The pattern the exit polls found in Michigan first emerged in New Hampshire,
site of the first primary Feb. 1. There, McCain, fueled by his call for
government reform, won by 18 points despite running behind Bush among
Republicans. Independents and Democrats accounted for 44 percent of the vote
that night, and McCain won them handily.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush bounced back more than two weeks later in South Carolina, where the GOP
faithful turned out in large numbers. They accounted for 61 percent of the
primary vote, and allowed the Texas governor to swamp McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   That made Michigan round three in the primary campaign, as McCain said over
and over in the runup to Tuesday's vote. This time, the exit polls said
self-identified Republicans accounted for 47 percent of the vote -- well below
the number only three days earlier in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush won two-thirds of their votes, roughly the same as in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain defeated Bush by almost as big a margin among independents, who
accounted for roughly a third of the vote, and by an even bigger margin among
Democrats who cast an estimated 20 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   As the vote rolled in, Davis predicted that ``soon the Republican party and
its organizations will see that the best chance for maintaining majorities in
the House and Senate and the governorships'' lie with a McCain candidacy.

<HEADLINE> Ex-China Internee Sues Mitsubishi  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A Chinese immigrant sued two major Japanese
corporations on Tuesday, alleging he was among thousands of Chinese civilians
who were brutalized and forced to work as slaves during World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Shang-Ting Sung, a naturalized U.S. citizen, says he was interned by
Japanese soldiers at age 10 and forced for years to work in mines owned and
operated in China by Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsui Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit is among a growing number of civil actions filed against big
Japanese companies under a California law that specifically allows the filing of
forced-labor lawsuits against foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
	   In Japan, Minoru Sasaki, a spokesman for Mitsui Mining Co., said the company
could not comment because its American subsidiary was unable to confirm the suit
was filed.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of Mitsubishi Corp. did not immediately return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Sung's lawsuit is the first in the United States to be filed on behalf of a
Chinese civilian, said Sheldon Harris, a California State University,
Northridge, emeritus professor of history who has written extensively about
Japanese atrocities during the war.
</P>
<P>
	   Other lawsuits filed in this country have been brought on behalf of former
American prisoners of war who worked in slave labor camps.
</P>
<P>
	   Sung, about 69, lives in the suburban San Gabriel Valley east of Los
Angeles. He said he isn't sure about his exact age because his birth records
were destroyed during the war.
</P>
<P>
	   Sung's suit seeks class-action status for thousands of other Chinese
civilians who allegedly performed slave labor for the Japanese.

<HEADLINE> What Mich., Ariz. Exit Polls Show  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A look at voters' thinking in Michigan and Arizona, according to interviews
at polling places.
</P>
<P>
	   MICHIGAN:
</P>
<P>
	   --PARTY MEMBERSHIP: Just over half of voters were independents or Democrats,
and they overwhelmingly backed Sen. John McCain. Texas Gov. George W. Bush
easily won among Republicans, taking two-thirds of that vote. But McCain won
two-thirds of the independents and 80 percent of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   --NEW TO THE GOP: Nearly one in three voters were participating in their
first Republican primary, and they preferred McCain by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   --PHILOSOPHY: McCain won among the self-described liberals and moderates,
who together made up about half the electorate. Bush easily took the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   --ENGLER INFLUENCE: Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Bush supporter, may have
hurt more than helped. Only about 15 percent of voters said Engler influenced
their vote ``a great deal,'' but those voters went for McCain, nearly 3-to-1.
About half of voters said Engler's endorsement of Bush didn't matter at all.
</P>
<P>
	   --RELIGIOUS RIGHT AND ABORTION: Bush took two-thirds of Christian
conservative voters and had a solid edge among those who believe abortion should
be illegal all or most of the time. But about four out of 10 voters said
abortion should be legal all or most of the time, and McCain took a solid
majority of these votes.
</P>
<P>
	   --STRAIGHT TALKER: About half of voters said McCain says what he believes
and not just what people want to hear. Only about four in 10 said the same about
Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   --ISSUES: Moral values was the most popular issue, and most people who chose
it also chose Bush. Bush also took those who picked taxes or abortion. But
McCain won large majorities of those most interested in world affairs, campaign
finance reform, education or the combination of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   --QUALITIES: Bush won among voters who most wanted someone who could win in
November or someone who best represents conservative values. McCain took those
who cared most about a candidate's military record or who wanted someone who was
not a typical politician.
</P>
<P>
	   --BLACK VOTE: Only about one in 20 voters was black, mostly Democrats who
crossed over into the GOP primary, and they overwhelmingly went for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   --INCOME: McCain's supporters tended to have lower incomes; Bush backers
were generally wealthier.
</P>
<P>
	   --VETERANS: McCain took a majority of the veterans and managed to edge Bush
among non-veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   --UNION VOTERS: McCain took a majority of union voters in Democratic
households, but Republican union workers were more likely to vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   --CAMPAIGN FINANCE: Most voters thought campaign finance reform would help,
not hurt, the political process. A majority of them preferred McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   --TIMING: About four in 10 voters made their minds up within the past week.
</P>
<P>
	   --ATTACKS: About four in 10 voters said Bush attacked McCain unfairly, and
nearly as many said that of McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   --BUSH SMARTS: About one in three voters said Bush does not have the
knowledge needed to serve effectively as president.
</P>
<P>
	   --McCAIN HYPOCRISY: More than four in 10 voters said McCain says one thing
and does another on campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ARIZONA:
</P>
<P>
	   --ACROSS THE BOARD: McCain won in every age, income and education group.
</P>
<P>
	   --VETERANS: McCain overwhelmingly won veterans, and he took a majority of
non-veterans, too.
</P>
<P>
	   --PARTY MEMBERSHIP: McCain won a majority of Republicans and an overwhelming
majority of independents.
</P>
<P>
	   --IDEOLOGY: Bush won a majority of those who called themselves very
conservative, but McCain took the liberals, moderates and somewhat conservative
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   --BUSH STRONGHOLDS: McCain did reasonably well even among groups that are
natural Bush strongholds. He took two in five votes among those with a favorable
opinion of Bush and one in five of those who thought Bush has a better chance
than McCain to win in November.
</P>
<P>
	   --CONSERVATIVES: The most conservative voters preferred Bush. He and McCain
split the religious right, those who believe abortion should always be illegal
and those who said cutting taxes is more important that strengthening Social
Security. McCain solidly won the group that said Social Security was the
priority.
</P>
<P>
	   --TEMPER: About one in four voters said McCain didn't have the temperament
to serve effectively as president, and Bush took the overwhelming majority of
these votes.
</P>
<P>
	   --CAMPAIGN FINANCE: Most voters said campaign finance reform will help, not
hurt, the political process. McCain won two in three of their votes. Bush easily
took the group that said it will hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   --STRAIGHT TALKER: About six in 10 said McCain says what he believes and not
just what people want to hear. Only about four in 10 said the same about Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   --ISSUES: McCain overwhelmingly won groups who said world affairs, campaign
finance reform or the combination of Social Security and Medicare was the most
important issue. He also won those who cared most about moral values or
education, though it was not as lopsided. Bush easily won those who picked
abortion or taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   --QUALITIES: McCain was winning among those who cared most about a
candidate's military record, about picking someone who was not a typical
politician and someone who stands up for what he believes in. Bush was winning
those who most wanted someone who could win in November or who best represented
conservative values.
</P>
<P>
	   --GENDER: Most of Bush's supporters were women, and most of Alan Keyes'
backers were men. McCain's supporters were closely divided between men and
women.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The exit polling was conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of the AP
and television networks ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC.
</P>
<P>
	   In Michigan, the poll results were from interviews of 2,284 voters in 45
precincts around the state. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 2.5
percentage points, larger for subgroups.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, the poll results were from interviews around the state of 2,136
voters in 40 precincts on Tuesday and 260 absentee voters surveyed by telephone
Feb. 15-19. The margin of sampling error for the combined results was plus or
minus 2.5 percentage points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> No. 17 Iowa St. 89, No. 14 Texas 77  </HEADLINE>
    By CHUCK SCHOFFNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Marcus Fizer scored a career-high 35 points and made one
huge play after another as No. 17 Iowa State recovered from a slow start to beat
No. 17 Texas 89-77 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State (23-4, 11-2 Big 12) broke down a Texas team that had allowed an
average of just 55 points in its five previous games and pulled into a tie with
Oklahoma State for first place in the league with three games to play. Texas
(19-7, 10-3) dropped one game back.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Nurse added 20 points for Iowa State, which trailed 8-0 and was down
14 before taking a 38-37 halftime lead on Jamaal Tinsley's 3-pointer at the
buzzer and leading the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Tinsley and Stevie Johnson each scored 12 points, with Johnson getting all
of his in the second half on 5-for-5 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   This night belonged to Fizer, who scored on drives, dunks and turnarounds
and even made two 3-pointers. He also grabbed nine rebounds, handed out a
career-high five assists, blocked two shots and made two steals.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous high for the 6-foot-8 junior, who missed his first four shots,
had been 32 against Oklahoma State last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State played the last half without its tallest player, 6-9 Paul
Shirley, who broke his foot late in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Mihm and Ivan Wagner led Texas with 17 points each and Darren Kelly
scored 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State opened the second half with a 7-0 run -- five points by Johnson
and a basket by Fizer on a drive against the 7-foot Mihm -- to go up 45-37. The
taller Longhorns got no closer than five points after that.
</P>
<P>
	   Two straight 3-pointers by Nurse stretched the lead to 52-41 and Iowa State
maintained a comfortable cushion until Texas drew to 66-61 on Mihm's reverse
layup with 6:36 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   But Iowa State answered. The 6-4 Johnson slipped inside for a basket and
Fizer beat Mihm off the dribble for another bucket to make it 70-61. The
Cyclones then went into a four-corner setup with Tinsley running things to
preserve the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   It grew to 79-65 when Fizer got the ball in the right corner, drove the
baseline and dunked with 2:08 left. The Cyclones wrapped it up by making eight
straight free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   As Fizer was at the line with 39.9 seconds left, the crowd chanted "One more
year. One more year," a plea for him to return for his senior season instead of
entering the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State's starters played the entire second half except for Fizer, who
left with 7.3 seconds remaining to a thunderous ovation.
</P>
<P>
	   The 89 points were the most scored against Texas this season. Arizona scored
88 on Dec. 4.

<HEADLINE> Thai Air To Stay With Star Alliance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai Airways International said Wednesday that it
would remain in the Star Alliance linking more than half-a-dozen major airlines,
which last week it said it was considering leaving.
</P>
<P>
	   In a news release, the airline said reports of the possibility of Thai
Airways leaving the grouping were "incorrect."
</P>
<P>
	   "Thai's President, Thamnoon Wanglee, has never said that the airline wanted
to leave the alliance and confirms that Thai would remain in the alliance," said
the airline's announcement, dated Tuesday but sent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue arose last week after Thamnoon told journalists that the airline
had asked its financial adviser "to consider whether it is better to stay with
the Star Alliance or whether it is better to leave."
</P>
<P>
	   Thai Airways' more powerful regional rival, Singapore Airlines, is scheduled
to join Star in April. The group also includes United Airlines, Lufthansa, Air
Canada, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Scandinavian Airlines System and
Varig.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision to review Star membership came after figures showed Singapore
Airlines cost Thai Airways $10 million last year by taking over some
non-alliance code-sharing agreements with Lufthansa on flights from Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Thai Airways is preparing to sell a stake to a strategic partner
later this year.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After a 10-month search, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
nominated a management expert from Singapore on Tuesday to take charge of
streamlining U.N. operations and eliminating waste and fraud.

<P>
	   As U.N. inspector-general, Dileep Nair will be in charge of the Office of
Internal Oversight Services, which was established in 1995 under pressure from
the United States and some other countries to reform the U.N.'s bloated
bureaucracy and cut costs.
</P>
<P>
	   In a note to the General Assembly, the secretary-general recommended Nair
for a single five-year term as director of the office with the rank of
undersecretary-general. The General Assembly is expected to approve the
appointment shortly.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector-general's job is considered one of the most important at the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Nair is currently managing director of DBS Bank, the Development Bank of
Singapore, which is the country's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a happy ending to a long, tortuous 10-month process,'' U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said. ``We're looking forward to his turning in a strong
performance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nair will replace Karl Paschke, a career diplomat from Germany who headed
the office from its creation until he stepped down late last year. Nair is
expected to start on April 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Nair worked for many years in Singapore's elite administrative service,
initially in the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1986, he was appointed deputy secretary in the Ministry of Trade and
Industry and three years later he transferred to the Ministry of Defense as
deputy secretary in charge of manpower, finance and information technology.
</P>
<P>
	   Nair became chief executive officer of POSBank, which was Singapore's
national savings bank, in 1997. The following year, POSBank was acquired by DBS
Bank and he became managing director in charge of creating a processing and
servicing hub for the DBS Group.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, Nair served as a member of the U.N. efficiency task force that
advised the secretary-general on aspects of U.N. reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Presenting his final report in October, Paschke said his office had saved
the United Nations $70 million during his five-year tenure by identifying and
targeting areas of waste and fraud.

<HEADLINE> Japan Crown Prince Attacks Press  </HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH COLEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese Crown Prince Naruhito on Wednesday criticized media
coverage of his wife's pregnancy and miscarriage last year as ``deplorable,'' in
a statement marking his 40th birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   The pregnancy, reported first by the national Asahi newspaper, triggered a
media frenzy, with camera crews trying to track Crown Princess Masako's every
move and staking out her parents' home.
</P>
<P>
	   After officials announced on Dec. 31 that Masako had been pregnant but
suffered a miscarriage, the Asahi faced a wave of public criticism that its
report had placed the princess under harmful pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   In comments at a news conference on Monday and released on Wednesday,
Naruhito accused the media of reporting the pregnancy too soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do find it truly deplorable that ... at a highly uncertain stage before
medical examinations had even taken place, a great amount of reporting was
conducted,'' the crown prince said.
</P>
<P>
	   Naruhito, the heir to the throne held by his father, Emperor Akihito, also
accused the media of prying into the couple's private life and publishing false
information. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope that in the future, such issues will be handled in a more prudent
and considerate way, taking the nature of the matter into consideration,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first time Naruhito had publicly criticized reporting over
Masako's brief pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   After six years of marriage, Naruhito and Masako have yet to have a child,
raising concerns about the future of the imperial line since only men can
succeed to the throne in Japan. Naruhito's brother Akishino has two children,
but they are both girls.
</P>
<P>
	   After the miscarriage, the Asahi defended its coverage, arguing that the
royal family are public figures and that imperial succession is of great
interest to the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Naruhito said Masako was steadily recovering, and he thanked the public for
messages of support. Masako, a Harvard graduate, was a diplomat before her
marriage to Naruhito.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Conservatives Rally To Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain successfully countered George W. Bush's
conservative appeal in Michigan on Tuesday by building a big advantage among
moderates and by reaching broadly outside the party, exit polls indicated.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic participation in Michigan's Republican primary was twice that of
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats and independents heavily favored McCain, while Bush was drawing
strong support from Republicans. GOP voters made up less than half the total
voters, according to exit polls by Voter News Service taken for The Associated
Press and the television networks.
</P>
<P>
	   Four years ago, Republicans made up almost two thirds of the total vote in
the state's GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
	   In Macomb County just north of Detroit, independent voter Linda Szymanski,
said she voted for McCain because: ``I like the honesty thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he deserves a shot at least of making it to the general
election,'' said the 45-year-old mother of two. ``I'm not real happy with the
presidency and the Bush family line and the Clinton family line. I'd like to see
some honesty in there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan Gov. John Engler's high-profile and personal push for Bush appeared
to pay few dividends.
</P>
<P>
	   A sixth of voters interviewed in exit polls said he had a great deal of
influence on their decision -- but they tended to vote for McCain. About the
same number said he influenced them somewhat and they tended to back Bush. Half
said he was not an influence at all. Engler said his failure to counter McCain's
Democratic appeal might have been ``a big strategic error.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most voters said they wanted a candidate who was not tied to Republican
party leaders, and they tended to vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, McCain was backed overwhelmingly by most demographic groups in
his home state, according to the exit polls. McCain even led Bush among
self-described Republicans in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   MICHIGAN
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates put most of their campaigns' emphasis on Michigan, where
some Republican voters expressed concern about the role played by
non-Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Comben, a 40-year-old computer developer and conservative who
generally votes Republican, said he made certain to vote for Bush because of
concerns the race would be tight. And he was worried about ``the concerted
effort by Democrats to drum up support for McCain just to spite Engler.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, governor of Texas, had better than a 2-to-1 edge among Republicans,
while McCain had a similar edge among independents and an 8-to-1 advantage among
Democrats, who made up almost a fifth of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
	   Three fourths of Bush's overall vote was Republican and the rest
independent. Conservatives made up two-thirds of Bush's support, while moderates
made up a third. Four of 10 were religious conservatives, while just over half
were not. Almost two-thirds were abortion opponents. More than half his
supporters thought issues were more important than personal qualities.
</P>
<P>
	   A fourth of McCain's supporters in Michigan were Republican, four of 10 were
independent and almost a third Democrats. Almost half described themselves as
moderate, just over a fourth were conservative and a fourth said they were at
least somewhat liberal. Almost six of 10 of his voters said personal qualities
were more important.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain seemed to connect with Michigan voters on themes that helped him win
big in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of Michigan voters credited McCain with saying what he believes
and not just what people want to hear. Only about four in 10 said the same about
Bush. About half said McCain was a real reformer, while just over a third said
Bush was a reformer. McCain won a majority of the veterans, about a fifth of all
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll results were from interviews of 2,284 voters in 45 precincts around
Michigan. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 2.5 percentage points,
larger for subgroups.
</P>
<P>
	   ARIZONA
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona's GOP primary, McCain was winning among those who cared most
about a candidate's military record, about picking someone who was not a typical
politician and someone who stands up for what he believes in. Bush led among
voters who most wanted someone who could win in November or who best represented
conservative values.
</P>
<P>
	   Marie Neville, 74, of Phoenix said her vote for McCain was as much a vote
against Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't like George Bush because he always has a smirk on his face,'' she
said, ``and I think any president that has a grin on his face all the time is
probably going to lie to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, the poll results were from interviews around the state of 1,411
voters in 40 precincts on Tuesday and 260 absentee voters surveyed by telephone
Feb. 15-19. The margin of sampling error for the combined results was plus or
minus 3.5 percentage points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Bush Got No Lift From Mich. Gov.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- The vaunted Engler effect went flat.
</P>
<P>
	   But Texas Gov. George W. Bush professed no disenchantment Tuesday night with
his Michigan counterpart, who had spared no effort to deliver Republican votes
but fell short in the state's presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John's a friend of mine, but if I had to do it over again, you bet I'd
stand by my friend,'' Bush said in Kansas City, Mo., during a stopover where he
began to take the measure of his Michigan defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   Engler had stuck to Bush like glue in a primary campaign that was as bitter
as it was short, describing the state as the Texas governor's firewall against
John McCain. Bush's loss was the most significant yet for a GOP establishment
laying in wait to help Bush and hurt McCain from state to state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I may give the McCain organization a lot of credit on this one and I may
have to take a lot of the blame,'' Engler said on MSNBC. In not countering
McCain's appeal to Democrats, ``I might have made a big strategic error.''
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls indicated the three-term Michigan governor -- a man with
passionate enemies as well as friends -- may have hurt Bush more than helped
him.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about 15 percent of voters said Engler influenced their vote ``a great
deal,'' but those voters went for McCain, nearly 3-to-1. About half of voters
said Engler's endorsement of Bush didn't matter at all.
</P>
<P>
	   A day that began with Bush and Engler gathering over waffles and radio
call-in shows at Jimi's Restaurant in a Detroit suburb stretched into a long
evening of travel west for the Texas governor, punctuated by a Kansas City, Mo.,
airport rally where he appeared both testy and philosophical.
</P>
<P>
	   Absorbing the news that he was losing the primaries both in Michigan and in
Arizona, McCain's home state, Bush pointedly said of Michigan: ``I'm pleased
with the Republican vote,'' even if it was overtaken with McCain's coalition of
Republicans, Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the interesting thing is I won overwhelmingly among Republicans
and like-minded independents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And without identifying his rival, Bush slammed the ``politics of
division,'' referring to calls made to Michigan Catholics by the McCain campaign
noting Bush, while campaigning in South Carolina, had visited a school with a
history of criticizing Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I reject politics of those who try to pit one group of Americans against
another -- of those who try to divide us based upon our race or based upon our
faith,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're better people than that and we need leaders who understand how to
unite Americans. And to those Washington politicians who try to divide us into
boxes and pit us against each other, I say shame on you.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said: ``Let me make it crystal clear: I reject bigotry, I reject
prejudice; I repudiate anti-Catholicism and racism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters also faced accusations of exploiting religious divisions, as
Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson spread the message in recorded phone
calls that a McCain adviser -- who once criticized some religious right leaders
as bigots -- was a ``vicious bigot'' himself.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign said it had nothing to do with Robertson's calls; Engler
said he was not happy the calls were made.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush flew on to California to campaign for that state's huge March 7 primary
and to meet Wednesday with Hispanic voters.

<HEADLINE> McCain Wins Mich., Ariz. Primaries  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- John McCain thumped George W. Bush in a two-state sweep
Tuesday night, rallying a ``new McCain majority'' of independents and Democrats
in Michigan and winning his home state of Arizona to seize momentum for a
two-week blitz of Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching out to Republican voters who backed the Texas governor in
overwhelming numbers in Michigan, the senator told supporters, ``Don't fear this
campaign, my fellow Republicans. Join it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, humbled by defeat, said, ``This is a marathon and I'm going to be in
it all the way to the end -- and some primaries you win and sometimes you
don't.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's is the latest victory in a see-sawing Republican nomination race.
The Arizonan won New Hampshire's leadoff primary in a landslide, lost the
followup showdown in South Carolina and won Michigan by a narrow margin. It
further damaged Bush's hard-fought image as the inevitable GOP nominee, and
propelled both men toward a March 7 showdown in 13 states,
</P>
<P>
	   ``This means we're going to go charging into Super Tuesday,'' said state
Sen. John Schwarz, McCain's chairman in Michigan. Even before winning his double
header, McCain narrowed Bush's financial advantage and closed the gap in
national polls since New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   In Michigan, Bush and McCain forged mirror-image coalitions: Bush vote was
supported by two-thirds of Republicans, and McCain ventured outside the party
for a similar-sized force of Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Open to all comers, Michigan's primary actually drew more non-Republicans
than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters bitterly dismissed McCain's victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain isn't party building, he's party-borrowing,'' said three-term
Michigan Gov. John Engler, who accused the senator of ``renting Democrats'' for
the night. Engler had promised to carry Michigan for Bush, and took blame for
the defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's response: ``Be a man.''
</P>
<P>
	   --In Michigan, with 55 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had
376,452 votes, or 50 percent, and Bush had 334,111, or 44 percent. Former
ambassador Alan Keyes had 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --In Arizona, with 14 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had 60,738
votes, or 64 percent, and Bush had 31,528 votes, or 33 percent. Keyes had 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victories earned him all 30 delegates from Arizona and at least 16
of the 58 delegates in Michigan, closing his gap with Bush. McCain has 60
delegates to date, compared to Bush's 60. A candidate needs 1,034 delegates to
win the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told The Associated Press that GOP leaders backing Bush will peel
away when they start realize his cross-party coalition would beat Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I look more electable, we'll start drawing more Republicans,'' said
McCain, who received just one fourth of the GOP vote in Michigan ``What I
believe we are assembling is the new McCain majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   With an American flag serving as a backdrop, McCain told supporters later,
``I am a proud Reagan conservative. I love the Republican Party. It is my
home.'' And he courted Republicans who backed Bush on the assumption the Texan
was the most likely to succeed. ``We are Al Gore's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews with voters as they left polling places showed that more than
half of the Michigan voters were non-Republicans -- independents and Democrats
who voted in far larger numbers than in 1996. Three-quarters of McCain's vote
came from the non-Republicans, and three-quarters of Bush's vote came from
bedrock Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and television
networks, conducted the interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   In a whirlwind 48 hours after the South Carolina primary, Bush and McCain
traded accusations of negative campaigning in Michigan. Each complained that the
other was using automated phone calls to voters to make inflammatory religious
attacks.	   Bush drew fewer number of bedrock Republicans than in South
Carolina. McCain's mixed breed of voters -- blue-collar economic conservatives,
union members and Baby Boomers -- voted in far larger numbers than in the
previous contest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's coalition was reminiscent of the voters who put Ronald Reagan into
the White House then became a battleground for Democrats and Republicans in
subsequent presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain did better among veterans than in South Carolina, and appeared to
have greater success convincing voters that he was the race's true reformer and
straight talker. In addition to his success among Democrats and independents,
McCain earned the support of an overwhelming percentage of new voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush voters were younger, more affluent, anti-abortion and strongly
conservative. They cited his conservative values as their top reason for voting
for him. Religious right voters also preferred Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Four in 10 voters said both candidates attacked unfairly, though the
bickering seemed to leave Michigan voters with a more negative impression of
Bush than McCain. That is a reverse of polling from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, McCain won the majority of Republicans, even as one in four
voters in his home state said the senator didn't have the temperment to serve
effectively as president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaigned side-by-side in Michigan with Engler, who appeared to draw
some backlash from voters -- of those who said Engler's support affected their
vote a great deal, two-thirds actually voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Following contests in tiny New Hampshire and Delaware, remote Alaska and
conservative South Carolina, Michigan tested the candidates' ability to appeal
to a large, diverse electorate.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to the March 7 contests, Bush was flying to Missouri and
California after the voting in Michigan. He has operations in all 13 states that
vote that day.
</P>
<P>
	   Lacking Bush's money and organizational strengths, McCain plans to pinpoint
his political activities. California and Ohio will be major McCain targets, as
he tries for come-from-behind victories in two states that award all their
delegates to the winner.
</P>
<P>
	   In contests a week away, McCain was setting the agenda. After McCain's team
put out word that they would not compete hard in Virginia's Feb. 29 primary to
focus on Washington State, Bush decided to cut short a Virginia trip this
weekend and head to the West Coast state.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush also would
increase his criticisms of McCain, starting with complaints that the senator's
campaign accused him of anti-Catholic bias. Look for Bush and his TV ads to call
into question McCain's ``Washington-style'' attacks, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan was fertile ground for McCain's populist pitch; the state supported
the independent presidential bid of Teddy Roosevelt in 1912 and gave Ross Perot
19 percent of its vote in the 1992 election. Pat Buchanan's anti-trade populism
earned him a third of the vote in the 1996 GOP primary.

<HEADLINE> New Judge Assigned in Gonzalez Case  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A new judge was assigned to the Elian Gonzalez case Tuesday
after the previous one was hospitalized with a stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore was randomly picked by computer and
will meet the schedule set by his predecessor, U.S. District Judge William M.
Hoeveler, to begin hearing the case the week of March 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoeveler had planned to hold a hearing Tuesday on whether the court has
jurisdiction in the case, but the arguments were postponed after he suffered a
mild stroke over the weekend. A new date for Moore to hear those arguments was
not immediately set.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian is at the center of a custody battle involving some of his relatives
in Miami and his father in Cuba, who wants him returned. At immediate issue is
whether the federal court can intervene in the decision by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to send the 6-year-old back.
</P>
<P>
	   The case has now become even more complex: Manuel ``Manolo'' Gonzalez, one
of Elian's great-uncles in Miami, backs the boy's father and filed a request in
court Friday for temporary custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore was director of the U.S. Marshals Service in Washington when he was
appointed to the federal bench by President Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is very fair,'' said Kendall Coffey, an attorney for Elian's
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez. ``I think the court is well-served by him taking
the case.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hoeveler, a veteran federal judge who presided over the trial of former
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, was assigned the Elian case after another
judge withdrew because of a possible conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoeveler, 77, was taken to the hospital by ambulance with slurred speech
Sunday, unable to move his right leg and arm. He was reported in serious but
stable condition Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Manuel Gonzalez, who was briefly admitted to a hospital Monday after
complaining of heart palpitations and numbness in his left arm, was chased by
about two dozen protesters outside the federal building Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of those chasing him carried Cuban flags and yelled, ``Communist!
Communist!'' Courthouse guards and attorneys escorted him into the building.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida filed a brief
urging the court to appoint an independent attorney to determine whether a
``reasonable, coherent asylum claim can be made on Elian's behalf,'' said Howard
Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   The ACLU of Florida argues Elian should have the right to challenge in court
the INS decision to send him back to his father. Government lawyers contend a
judge cannot interfere in immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday turned down the appeal of an Arizona man
who asked the justices to ``cut short'' legal and political maneuvering and
order the boy immediately returned to his father.

<HEADLINE> No. 17 Iowa St. 89, No. 14 Texas 77  </HEADLINE>
    By CHUCK SCHOFFNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Marcus Fizer scored a career-high 35 points and made one
huge play after another as No. 17 Iowa State recovered from a slow start to beat
No. 14 Texas 89-77 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State (23-4, 11-2 Big 12) broke down a Texas team that had allowed an
average of just 55 points in its five previous games and pulled into a tie with
Oklahoma State for first place in the league with three games to play. Texas
(19-7, 10-3) dropped one game back.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Nurse added 20 points for Iowa State, which trailed 8-0 and was down
14 before taking a 38-37 halftime lead on Jamaal Tinsley's 3-pointer at the
buzzer and leading the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Tinsley and Stevie Johnson each scored 12 points, with Johnson getting all
of his in the second half on 5-for-5 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   This night belonged to Fizer, who scored on drives, dunks and turnarounds
and even made two 3-pointers. He also grabbed nine rebounds, handed out a
career-high five assists, blocked two shots and made two steals.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous high for the 6-foot-8 junior, who missed his first four shots,
had been 32 against Oklahoma State last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State played the last half without its tallest player, 6-9 Paul
Shirley, who broke his foot late in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Mihm and Ivan Wagner led Texas with 17 points each and Darren Kelly
scored 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State opened the second half with a 7-0 run -- five points by Johnson
and a basket by Fizer on a drive against the 7-foot Mihm -- to go up 45-37. The
taller Longhorns got no closer than five points after that.
</P>
<P>
	   Two straight 3-pointers by Nurse stretched the lead to 52-41 and Iowa State
maintained a comfortable cushion until Texas drew to 66-61 on Mihm's reverse
layup with 6:36 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   But Iowa State answered. The 6-4 Johnson slipped inside for a basket and
Fizer beat Mihm off the dribble for another bucket to make it 70-61. The
Cyclones then went into a four-corner setup with Tinsley running things to
preserve the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   It grew to 79-65 when Fizer got the ball in the right corner, drove the
baseline and dunked with 2:08 left. The Cyclones wrapped it up by making eight
straight free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   As Fizer was at the line with 39.9 seconds left, the crowd chanted "One more
year. One more year," a plea for him to return for his senior season instead of
entering the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State's starters played the entire second half except for Fizer, who
left with 7.3 seconds remaining to a thunderous ovation.
</P>
<P>
	   The 89 points were the most scored against Texas this season. Arizona scored
88 on Dec. 4.

    MONTREAL (AP) -- Jeff Hackett made 27 saves for his first shutout of the
season, and Benoit Brunet scored with less than seven minutes left in the
Montreal Canadiens' 1-0 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The win was Montreal's sixth in a row, its longest winning streak since
seven straight in November 1997. The Canadiens are 12-2-2-2 since Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Hackett, who has won his last five games, got his first shutout since last
March 24 at Edmonton. Hackett, 6-1-1 in his last eight starts, and teammate Jose
Theodore have combined for six shutouts this season. Theodore is tied with the
Buffalo's Martin Biron for the individual lead with five.
</P>
<P>
	   Brunet redirected Patrice Brisebois' slap shot from the point past Sean
Burke at 12:34 of the third, just seconds after Phoenix defenseman Radoslav
Suchy left the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadiens captain Saku Koivu, who returned after missing the previous 40
games with a dislocated left shoulder, assisted on Brunet's goal with a pass to
Brisebois at the point.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Rucinsky, Montreal's leading scorer with 38 points, needed five
stitches to close a cut to the inside of his lower lip when he was struck in the
mouth by Phoenix defenseman Stan Neckar's stick in the first period.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Flunked Drug Test  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- New York Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry tested
positive for cocaine on Jan. 19 and might once again be suspended from baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   A high-ranking baseball official, speaking on the condition he not be
identified, said Tuesday the commissioner's office is investigating and a
decision whether to take disciplinary action likely would be made by Thursday at
the latest.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry is tested two or three times a week as part of his no-contest
plea on May 26, 1999, to charges of cocaine possession and soliciting a
prostitute. He was sentenced to 18 months of probation and 100 hours of
community service.
</P>
<P>
	   The official did not say what disciplinary action the sport was likely to
take against Strawberry. But given his past penalties, a suspension that would
last most if not all of this season appears likely. Rich Levin, the spokesman
for commissioner Bud Selig, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and general manager Brian Cashman also
declined comment on the news, first reported by WTVT in Tampa and WLWT in
Cincinnati. WLWT obtained the three-page report on the probation violation from
the Florida Department of Corrections and made it available to The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight-time All-Star, who came back from colon cancer surgery in October
1998, was counted on the Yankees to be their primary designated hitter this
season following the retirement of Chili Davis.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Yankees manager Joe Torre gave a hint that something may have
been up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have a sense something will happen here that will stir the pot,'' Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry, who has been working out at the Yankees complex, could not be
contacted after positive test became known. He lives a gated community, Cheval,
just north of Tampa in the suburb of Lutz.
</P>
<P>
	   He already has served two drug-related suspensions.
</P>
<P>
	   The first, for 60 days, was in 1995 after he tested positive for cocaine.
The second, from April 24 to Aug. 4 last season, came after he was arrested in
Tampa last April 4 for possessing 0.3 grams of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry, who turns 38 next month, didn't rejoin the Yankees until Sept.
1, but hit .327 with three homers and six RBIs. In the postseason, he batted
.333 (5-for-15) with two homers and four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Feb. 8 report by correction probation specialist Shelley J. Tomlinson,
which was approved by deputy regional director Nancy L. Ham and signed by
Hillsborough County Circuit Judge Florence Foster, said Strawberry did not make
a statement about the violation on the advice of his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   The report did not ask that Strawberry's probation be revoked or modified.
It recommended Strawberry ``remain under supervision with enhanced treatment
sanctions and continued urine monitoring 2-to-3 times per week.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the report said Strawberry should receive ``updated
substance-abuse evaluation'' and have weekly counseling and continue to attend
Alcoholics Anonymous/Narcotics Anonymous meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Joel Solomon, the medical adviser to the players' association,
recommended ``an enhancement of his aftercare program consisting of regular
individual therapy sessions while in Tampa and also once he moves to New York,''
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida Department of Corrections regional director Joe Papy said Strawberry
has been tested by baseball three times a week since May and that the Jan. 19
result was the only one that has returned negative.
</P>
<P>
	   Papy said the recommendation for enhanced supervision and treatment was
typical in cases like Strawberry's because officials anticipate relapses.
Substance abuse counselors will determine the best way to help the outfielder
after meeting with Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What they try to do is determine why someone who's been getting three
negatives a week all of a sudden tests positive ... Something had to happen,''
Papy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry, the 1983 National League Rookie of the Year, has a .259 career
average with 335 homers and 1,000 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
	   His relapse with drugs last spring came while he was undergoing
chemotherapy, which he claimed led to depression.
</P>
<P>
	   He had surgery on Oct. 3, 1998, to remove a 16-inch portion of his large
intestine to rid him of a cancerous colon tumor almost 2 1/2 inches long. At the
time, doctors said the cancer did not appear to have spread.
</P>
<P>
	   At Strawberry's sentencing, Florida Circuit Judge Jack Espinosa Jr. ordered
him to stay out of bars and asked police and prosecutors to supply Strawberry
with a map of Tampa ``hot spots'' to avoid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This really isn't about baseball,'' the judge said. ``It isn't about your
job, but about you. ... This is about what's in your heart and what's in your
mind.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you stop producing, nobody will care about you,'' he added. ``If this
is the picture of life after baseball, it's not pretty. This is only an
opportunity. I hope you make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Without being asked, Strawberry replied: ``I will.''
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry spent the first eight seasons of his career with the New York
Mets, then became a free agent and signed with the Dodgers, his hometown team
while growing up in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dodgers released him on May 26, 1994, in the midst of his 28 days at the
Betty Ford Center for a substance-abuse problem. San Francisco signed him the
following month but released him the following Feb. 8 following the positive
cocaine test that led to the 60-day suspension.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry's latest problem is likely to help Tim Raines, Roberto Kelly and
possibly Felix Jose, who are in camp on minor league contracts trying to make
the team. Nick Johnson, another possibility, hasn't played above Double-A but
hit .345 at Double-A Norwich with 14 homers and 87 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricky Ledee and Shane Spencer, who had been expected to battle for a spot in
left field, also are possible replacements at DH along with Jim Leyritz,
reacquired last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife, Charisse, is five months pregnant with the couple's third child.
Strawberry also has two children from a previous marriage.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Edge Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks declined Wednesday morning on profit-taking
and continued selling of cross-held issues. The dollar was lower against the
yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which had been up some 138
points early in the session, shed 17.54 points, or 0.09 percent, to 19,373.04 at
the end of the morning session. On Tuesday, the average closed down 153.17
points, or 0.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 110.36 yen, down 0.84 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and
also below its late New York level of 110.70 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei average opened modestly higher Wednesday as
investors were encouraged by Tuesday's gains in New York, where the Dow Jones
industrial average rose 85.32 points to close at 10,304.84.
</P>
<P>
	   But prices moved into negative territory toward the morning session close on
profit-taking and selling of cross-held issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese companies often unwind shares they hold in other companies prior to
the close of each fiscal year, which ends March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's recovery on Wall Street offered some relief to the Tokyo market,
which has been increasingly anxious about the prospect of a major downward
correction in U.S. stocks. On Friday, the Dow Jones index tumbled 295.05 points,
or 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 0.47 points, or 0.03 percent, to 1,644.12. The TOPIX closed
down 36.13 points, or 2.15 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar was under selling pressure
against the yen amid the euro's strength against the greenback. On Tuesday, the
euro rose against the dollar on speculation some European nations may raise
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Against the Japanese currency on Wednesday, the euro was traded at 110.06
yen, down from 111.31 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8300
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8550 percent. Its price rose 0.21 point to
99.74.

<HEADLINE> Notes, Quotes From Campaign Trail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) -- First George W. Bush put a line in his stump speech
that sounded suspiciously like John McCain's complaint about soldiers on food
stamps.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, the Texas governor started tooling around in a bus like McCain's
``Straight Talk Express,'' but fancier.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, the Bush campaign is replicating another idea that, while hardly new,
has been used to good effect by McCain: confetti and balloons.
</P>
<P>
	   After noticing how often and well McCain's picture played in newspapers and
magazines because of his frequent use of confetti, streamers and balloons, the
Bush camp has tried with mixed results to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
	   At campaign events over the past week, confetti blowers have dribbled out
colored paper after Bush has finished his speech. After one in Charleston, S.C.,
Bush jumped as explosives detonated overhead to send confetti falling his way.
</P>
<P>
	   On several occasions, netting on the ceiling that was supposed to let
balloons cascade down has instead released all at once, dropping a clump of
balloons that hid Bush from the television platform.
</P>
<P>
	   And after a speech at Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, the
blowers blew but only a smattering of confetti flew.
</P>
<P>

<P>
	   58 -- Number of Republican delegates at stake in Michigan's primary Tuesday.

<P>
	   30 -- Number of Republican delegates at stake in Arizona's primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   VOTER'S VOICE:
</P>
<P>
	   ``People say they don't like it, but it works. People don't like wrestling,
but they watch it.'' Steve Comben, 40, of suburban Detroit, on negative
campaigning. He voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   THIS DATE FOUR YEARS AGO:
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Dole said Republicans would lose in the House, Senate, and state
legislatures if Pat Buchanan won the GOP nomination. But he denied he was
picking on Buchanan or trying to get other GOP leaders to do so. ``We're just
talking about some of his ideas,'' Dole said in Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan, saying GOP leaders are the ones risking party unity, ruled out
running as an independent if denied the Republican nomination, because he would
``not do anything to re-elect Bill Clinton.'' Buchanan rode a wagon in a parade
in Tucson, Ariz., where he ignored some boos and catcalls.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   TUESDAY'S ROUNDUP:
</P>
<P>
	   McCain sweeps Bush in GOP primaries in Michigan and his home state of
Arizona, with Keyes finishing third in both contests. Pulling his criticisms of
Al Gore together into a single theme, Democratic rival Bill Bradley said his own
views on abortion, guns and other issues were ``clear, consistent, reliable.''
``What do we really know about Al Gore?'' he asked. Gore took the day off in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   WEDNESDAY'S TRAIL:
</P>
<P>
	   McCain heads to Washington state to meet voters in Spokane and Bremerton.
Bush discusses the election with Hispanic voters for a Univision special in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley makes an economic speech at Columbia University in New York before
flying to Washington state, where he will remain for about a week. Gore
discusses senior citizen health issues and rising prescription drug costs in
Deerfield Beach, Fla.

study of Mexico's Indian cultures, died Monday. He was variously listed from 88
to 90.
</P>
<P>

continuing to write brief columns last year for the daily La Jornada. For
decades, he edited the cultural section of newspapers such as El Nacional,
Novedades and Unomasuno and promoted the works of generations of young Mexican
writers.
</P>
<P>
	   Benitez also served as Mexico's ambassador to the Dominican Republic from
1990 to 1994.
</P>

the chair once occupied by jazz legend Count Basie, died Feb. 13. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
	   When Basie died in 1984, it was Carson who took his place as the band's
pianist, managing ``to suggest Mr. Basie's manner without adopting it, using
single-note lines that are a variant of Mr. Basie's lines, and dropping gentle
but propitious chords behind the soloists.''
</P>
<P>
	   His jazz career began in San Francisco in the 1970s, where he played and was
a jazz disc jockey on WCSM radio.

from the 1930s to the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   For most of his career, he worked with his wife, Eleanor, running news and
business departments at newspapers in Coos Bay, Pendleton and Astoria, where he
was known for his powerful editorials and community-minded news pages.
</P>
<P>
	   He worked at a number of papers, including the Oregon Journal, The
Oregonian, The East Oregonian, and the Coos Bay Harbor (now the North Bend
News). His work earned him a number of journalism awards and he sat on the

<HEADLINE> Philly Paper Mistakenly Prints Joke  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Inquirer mistakenly printed a note
Tuesday suggesting editorial board members would ``roll their eyes and chuckle''
at readers who called to offer comments.
</P>
<P>
	   The message was part of a gag page made last week for a departing staffer,
said Chris Satullo, acting editor of the newspaper's editorial board.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The reason why someone thought to make joke of it ... is because this
board has been extremely open and aggressive at getting responses from readers
and creating new forms for getting readers' voices out there,'' Satullo said.
``Our only defense, as we stand here red-faced, is our record. Those are not our
true feelings.''
</P>
<P>
	   The editorial page message typically concludes: ``The Editorial Board will
respond to as many calls as possible.'' Tuesday it read: ``The Editorial Board
members will roll their eyes and chuckle at your remarks.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear why the mistake was printed, so no one has been reprimanded,
Satullo said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was noticed after a reader left a message starting, ``You may
chuckle at what I say but ...'', and two others said they chuckled at the
mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm glad someone got a laugh because I didn't,'' Satullo said.

<HEADLINE> Flyers 3, Blackhawks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Valeri Zelepukin had a goal and an assist and rookie
Brian Boucher made 22 saves as the Philadelphia Flyers beat Chicago 3-1 Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   John LeClair scored his 300th NHL goal, and Daymond Langkow also had a goal
for the Flyers, who won their third straigh and stretched their unbeaten streak
to four.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Amonte scored for the Blackhawks, who are 2-4-0 in their last six.
</P>
<P>
	   Boucher made a number of spectacular saves, especially in the first period.
He stopped close shots by Steve Sullivan and Josef Marha, kicked away Amonte's
attempt while sliding on the ice and denied Anders Eriksson's followup slap
shot.
</P>
<P>
	   LeClair got the Flyers on the board at 12:21 of the first, converting a
wrist shot from the slot after taking a pass from Keith Jones, who played in his
100th NHL game.
</P>
<P>
	   LeClair, who leads Philadelphia with 31 goals, got a prolonged standing
ovation from the sellout crowd of 19,742 when his milestone was flashed on the
scoreboard midway through the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Zelepukin made it 2-0 with a fluke goal only 23 seconds into the second. His
shot from the far side bounced off the skate of Chicago's Boris Mironov, then
hit the left post before rolling into the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Amonte, who leads the Blackhawks with 30 goals, scored on a power play at
3:18 of the third when he deflected Doug Gilmour's shot while standing to the
right of the crease.
</P>
<P>
	   Langkow then broke an 0-for-24 drought on the power play at 5:53 of the
period to make it 3-1. Langkow picked up Mikael Renberg's pass deep in the
Flyers zone, skated in and beat goalie Jocelyn Thibault with a wrist shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The Flyers played without their two top centers. Eric Lindros was a late
scratch after suffering back spasms in pregame warmups and Keith Primeau has
missed five games since fracturing a rib against Buffalo on Feb. 12.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mexico Drug Czar Gets More Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The disgraced former head of Mexico's anti-drug effort
was hit with a new, 40-year sentence on drug charges on Tuesday, the federal
attorney general's office reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said that a Mexico City judge sentenced Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo
to 40 years for promoting the transportation of cocaine, for organized crime and
for bribery.
</P>
<P>
	   He already was serving a nearly 32-year sentence on firearms charges. The
new penalty is added to the earlier one, so he faces 71 years in prison, the
attorney general's office said. He also is being prosecuted on charges of
abusing authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez Rebollo, an army general, was arrested in February 1997 on charges
of taking bribes from the powerful Juarez drug smuggling cartel to ease its
operations while cracking down on those of its rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   A co-defendant, Horacio Montenegro Ortiz, was sentenced to 21 years in
prison on Tuesday for aggravated bribery. Montenegro is a former state police
chief in the western state of Jalisco, where Gutierrez Rebollo was based in the
army before taking over as national anti-drug chief.

<HEADLINE> No. 19 Maryland 76, Clemson 63  </HEADLINE>
    By DAN LEWERENZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- It was supposed to be a showdown between two standout
sophomore guards. Instead, it was another sophomore, Maryland's Lonny Baxter,
who stood out.
</P>
<P>
	   Baxter scored 25 points Tuesday night, leading No. 19 Maryland to a 76-63
victory over Clemson.
</P>
<P>
	   The strategy was simple, Baxter said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just pounded the ball inside. That's what starts our offense," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Baxter scored 16 points before halftime, single-handedly staving off a
Clemson rally midway through the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Baxter's performance overshadowed the matchup between the Atlantic Coast
Conference's two leading scorers, sophomore guards Will Solomon and Juan Dixon.
Solomon finished with 12 points, and Dixon scored 11. Both came in averaging
21.6 points in league play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers (9-17, 3-10) used an 8-0 run to pull within 22-16 with 10:01
left. But Maryland (20-7, 9-4) answered with a 10-0 run of its own, the first
five points coming from Baxter, to go up 32-16. The Terrapins led 37-25 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   "Baxter took the game over inside unlike any other player we have faced this
season," said Clemson coach Larry Shyatt.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers slowed Baxter by starting the second half in a zone, but he came
on again late in the game. Baxter's fast break dunk with 3:43 left gave Maryland
its biggest lead at 74-52.
</P>
<P>
	   The second half was a veritable foulfest, with Maryland committing 12 fouls
in the second half and Clemson committing 11. Both teams combined for seven
fouls in one 1:26 stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland reached the bonus with 13:31 left, and Clemson was in the bonus 17
seconds later.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we fouled," Maryland coach Gary Williams said. "Clemson is a good
team. Adam Allenspach, to his credit, he's a guy who has improved every year.
He's a problem for us inside."
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Blake scored 14 points for Maryland, hitting four of five 3-pointers,
and added a game-high six assists.
</P>
<P>
	   "Blake did a very good job as far as when to shoot and when to pass," Shyatt
said. "He didn't force any shots. Our guys knew when to shoot. When we are open,
we are supposed to shoot."
</P>
<P>
	   Clemson was paced by Allenspach's 20 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The win extended Maryland's ACC win streak to seven games and was the
Terrapins' fifth straight over the Tigers.

<HEADLINE> Russia: 'No Way Out' for Chechens  </HEADLINE>
   By NICK WADHAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Thousands of rebels in Chechnya's mountains have ``no
way out'' as Russian forces backed by artillery and air attacks close in on
them, Russia's defense minister said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   About 20,000 Russian troops nearly completed a blockade of the Argun Gorge,
a key passage into the rugged slopes of Chechnya's mountains, the military said
Tuesday. Russian warplanes and helicopter gunships flew more than 150 combat
missions over the area in 24 hours, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interfax news agency, citing sources at a Russian base in Khankala, said
a Russian helicopter was lost Tuesday in the Argun Gorge. The Defense Ministry
made no immediate comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian strategists remained concerned about a rebel resurgence, and have
warned repeatedly over the past weeks that rebels are planning substantial
attacks for Wednesday. The day is both a Russian holiday honoring the military
and a traditional Chechen commemoration of the beginning of their mass
deportation to Central Asia in 1944 under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
</P>
<P>
	   Apparently in response to those concerns, Russia closed all its border
crossings into Chechnya on Tuesday. Russia previously has shut border crossings
for periods ranging up to several days at a time.
</P>
<P>
	   In southern Chechnya, the rebels maintained their tight grip on the village
of Duba-Yurt at the entrance to the Argun Gorge, according to the news agency
Interfax. But Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the fighters ``have no way out
anymore,'' Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   But the rebels, skilled in guerrilla techniques, have repeatedly shown
during the 5-month-old war that they are able to slip through Russian lines.
They have mounted surprise attacks on Russian-held towns, and many fighters
broke out of the capital, Grozny, this month, even though the city was
encircled.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ruins of Grozny, troops appeared tense on Tuesday, generally sticking
close to their checkpoints and bunkers. Soldiers were overheard discussing
rumors that the Chechen warlord Khattab was leading a band of 700 fighters to
attack Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
	   Human Rights Watch said Tuesday it had documented accounts of a massacre of
Chechen civilians that could be the worst atrocity of the war.
</P>
<P>
	   The group said at least 62 people died in Aldi, on the outskirts of Grozny,
in a two-day rampage that began Feb. 5. It said about 100 soldiers
systematically robbed and shot civilians. The troops also committed several
rapes and hurled grenades into basements where residents were hiding, the group
said, citing survivors' accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has repeatedly denied reports that its troops have taken part in
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
	   While Russian aircraft slammed the mountains with bombs and rockets, troops
moving toward the rebels' mountain stronghold of Shatoi seized heights near the
villages of Makhkety and Selmentazhen, the military said. Up to 5,000 fighters
are concentrated around Shatoi, Interfax reported, citing military sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Soldiers have been fighting the rebels at the entrance to the Argun Gorge
for weeks, and the flank offensive on villages east of the gorge seemed aimed at
encircling the separatists.
</P>
<P>
	   In a tacit acknowledgment of the rebels' ability to maneuver around Russian
troops, Sergeyev said his forces were determined to wipe out the rebels before
spring melted the mountain snow, which could open new escape routes.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of rebels tried to break out of the Argun Gorge and into neighboring
Georgia, but were fought back by Russian border guards, the news agency
ITAR-Tass reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid concerns about attacks on Wednesday, security precautions have been
taken at airports and train stations across Russia. Police in far-flung cities
have been carrying out security sweeps, focusing on people originating from the
Caucasus Mountains area.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, police officers were placed on 12-hour shifts, with no leave
allowed until Feb. 29, Echo of Moscow radio reported. In other cities, Police
also were placed on alert, Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials have warned of alleged Chechen plans to stage terrorist
attacks and airplane hijackings in Russia. Moscow already has blamed Chechen
rebels for four bombings of apartment houses last fall that killed some 300
people.
</P>

	   The Kremlin has cited those attacks, along with the preceding invasion of
the southern region of Dagestan by Chechnya-based Islamic militants, as part of
the reason it sent troops to Chechnya in September.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies 85, Bulls 81  </HEADLINE>
    By NANCY ARMOUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- With Shareef Abdur-Rahim sick with the stomach flu, Michael
Dickerson picked up the slack.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson scored 25 points and grabbed six rebounds, and Bryant Reeves added
15 points and seven rebounds Tuesday as the Vancouver Grizzlies beat the Chicago
Bulls 85-81.
</P>
<P>
	   After losing their first seven games to the Bulls, the Grizzlies now have
won two straight.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdur-Rahim, the Grizzlies' leading scorer with 20.8 points a game, came
down with the flu Monday night and skipped the team's practice Tuesday morning.
He stayed in the starting lineup, though, playing 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   He only scored eight points -- two off his season low -- but he grabbed 14
rebounds, including a key defensive board after Hersey Hawkins' missed free
throw with 14.8 seconds left and the Grizzlies clinging to an 82-79 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Elton Brand scored 20 of his 25 points in the first half, but the highlight
of the night for Chicago might have been the John Starks lovefest going on in
the stands.
</P>
<P>
	   Starks, loathed by Chicago fans for his thuggery as a New York Knick,
impressed the fans with his hustle in the first three quarters and actually had
them chanting "We want Starks! We want Starks!" with 6:53 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   He drew a huge cheer when he went in, and more yelling and screaming when he
made two free throws to bring the Bulls within 79-74 with 3:31 left. There was
another big roar when he drilled a 3-pointer to cut Vancouver's lead to 82-78
with 1:27 left.
</P>
<P>
	   He finished with 17 points on 6-of-9 shooting and also had four assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson opened the fourth quarter with three free throws, giving Vancouver
a 71-64 lead with 10:36 left. But the Grizzlies went the first six minutes
without a field goal, letting the Bulls cut the lead to 72-71 on Ron Artest's
free throw.
</P>
<P>
	   Dennis Scott finally made a jumper from the left wing with 6:20 left,
following it with a buzzer-beater jumper and a 3-pointer. Abdur-Rahim pushed the
lead to 82-75, dunking and then making the second of two free throws with 1:46
left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grizzlies led 28-19 after the first quarter, but Starks and Randy Brown
staged their own 11-2 run in the first 3 1/2 minutes of the second. After
shooting a blistering 65 percent in the first quarter, the Grizzlies made only
one of their first 12 shots. Grant Long finally made another basket with 4:08.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls for Talks With India  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Complaining of ``increasingly strident''
statements from India, Pakistan's new foreign secretary urged Indian leaders
Tuesday to accept his country's offer of talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In recent months, Indian policy-makers and leaders have become
increasingly strident in their pronouncements against Pakistan,'' said Inam-ul
Haq, who took over the No. 2 job at Pakistan's foreign ministry last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have responded with a policy of restraint and maturity and have
expressed our willingness to resume dialogue with India,'' he said. ``We live in
a difficult environment. The quest for security and peace has always been at the
core of our foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
	   All topics are open for discussion, said Haq, but the big issue is the
disputed Kashmir region. Both India and Pakistan lay claim to Kashmir, a former
princely state divided between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Five civilians were killed in the region Monday night, when Pakistani troops
fired more than 500 rounds of mortar shells across the border in Kashmir, the
Indian army said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan accused India of firing the first shots and killing three Pakistani
civilians in the encounter. ``Our troops retaliated, hitting selected military
targets,'' Pakistan army spokesman Col. Salaut Raza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cross-border shelling is common in the volatile region.
</P>
<P>
	   Kashmir -- the flashpoint of two previous wars between Pakistan and India --
rose to international prominence in 1998 when the two South Asian nations
exploded nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
	   Both countries claim to have nuclear arms, although neither has spelled out
the type or number of weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kashmir dispute will have to be settled if peace in the region is to be
guaranteed, Haq said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Indian foreign ministry could not immediately be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan wants a vote held on both sides of the disputed border to let
Kashmiris decide whether a reunified Kashmir would become part of India or
Pakistan. Such a vote is guaranteed in a 1948 U.N. resolution. India rejects a
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan also has sought international mediation, and President Clinton, who
is to visit India next month, has offered to try to bridge the divide. However,
India has flatly rejected any outside mediation. Clinton said both countries
have to agree to his intervention before he will do it.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision has not yet been made on whether Clinton will stop in Pakistan on
his trip to the region. The visit was put in question last October after the
army threw out the elected government of Nawaz Sharif and took control.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Gen. Pervez Musharraf has refused to set a timetable for a return to
democracy, saying he wants to clean up a deeply corrupt system and revive a weak
and ailing economy before holding elections.

<HEADLINE> Illinois 87, No. 16 Indiana 63  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN KELLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- Cory Bradford hit five of Illinois' 13 3-pointers
and scored 26 points as the Illini rode long-range shooting to an 87-63 rout of
No. 16 Indiana on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Illini (18-7 overall, 10-4 Big Ten) have won seven straight and nine of
10 since starting the conference season 1-3.
</P>
<P>
	   Kirk Haston and Jeffrey Newton scored 17 each for Indiana (18-6, 8-5), which
was coming off a loss to No. 6 Ohio State last weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana dropped consecutive games for the first time this season in large
measure because leading scorer A.J. Guyton continued to struggle. Guyton, held
without a basket the last 13 1/2 minutes of the Ohio State game, made just one
Tuesday night and scored three points. He averages almost 21 a game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hoosiers did themselves in early. Indiana spotted Illinois a huge
first-half lead by giving the ball away 13 times. Seven of those turnovers were
steals.
</P>
<P>
	   Illinois started burying the Hoosiers under 3-pointers midway into the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucas Johnson's 3-pointer at the 13:50 mark of the first half started the
Illinois bombing. Bradford followed with consecutive 3s and Johnson added
another to spark a devastating 24-4 run that lasted nearly seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Reserve Sean Harrington's 3-pointer gave Illinois a 37-14 lead with 7:12 to
go in the half. Illinois stretched that lead to 43-16 before Indiana awoke to
score nine straight points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hoosiers couldn't challenge, however. Illinois, leading 49-28 with 55
seconds left in the half, converted Frank Williams' steal into a 3-pointer by
Bradford at the buzzer that made it 52-28 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradford, Williams and freshman center Brian Cook each had 3-pointers as the
Illini built a 66-36 lead with 13:10 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Kyle Hornsby's 3-pointer with 4:20 left got Indiana within 80-58, the
closest the Hoosiers could get.

<HEADLINE> Suns 86, Nuggets 67  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHOENIX (AP) -- Reserve Rodney Rogers scored a game-high 17 points as the
Phoenix Suns routed the Denver Nuggets 86-67 Tuesday night in their best
defensive effort in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The 67 points were the fewest allowed by the Suns since an 88-65 victory
over the Chicago Bulls on March 6, 1975. Phoenix also set a franchise mark for
fewest points allowed in a half, holding Denver to 25 first-half points on
10-of-40 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns' season-high eighth straight home win moved them into sole
possession of fourth place in the Western Conference, a half-game ahead of the
Utah Jazz. The Suns had been in eighth place as recently as Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Gugliotta and Clifford Robinson each added 12 points for the Suns, who
outscored the Nuggets 43-16 in the final 20 minutes of the first half en route
to a 25-point halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nuggets' nine second-quarter points also were a season low. Denver was
just 3-of-14 from the floor in the period and had only one field goal over the
final 6:56 of the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Antonio McDyess scored 10 of the Nuggets' first-half points and finished
with 12 despite shooting 4-of-13. James Posey led the Nuggets with 14.
</P>
<P>
	   McDyess scored six of Denver's first nine points, including a rim-rattling
dunk that gave the Nuggets a 9-7 lead with 8:32 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Gugliotta gave the Suns the lead for good two minutes later on a 15-foot
jumper from the baseline.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson, who scored 50 in the teams' last meeting in Phoenix, hit a pair of
3-pointers and Rogers and Jason Kidd also had 3-pointers as the Suns closed the
quarter on a 14-4 run for a 29-16 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns led 75-37 after three quarters and by as many as 40 in the fourth.

<HEADLINE> Bruins' McSorley Suspended for Hit  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA PODELL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The NHL indefinitely suspended Marty McSorley on Tuesday
after the notorious enforcer knocked out and bloodied an opposing player with a
stick-swinging blow so savage that police in Canada are investigating.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston defenseman, known more for his fists than his finesse, struck
Vancouver's Donald Brashear, another renowned tough guy, across the right temple
and he crumpled to the ice.
</P>
<P>
	   Brashear's head struck the ice as his helmet came off, his body twitching
and blood oozing from his nose. He sustained a concussion and will be out for at
least two to three weeks, the Canucks said Tuesday after he was evaluated
overnight at a Vancouver hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Brashear was released from the hospital and came to GM Place to meet with
team trainers Tuesday, but did not comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The NHL will convene a hearing Wednesday to determine how long the
suspension will last and any further punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   With only 2.7 seconds remaining Monday night, and the Canucks holding a 5-2
lead, McSorley skated up -- out of Brashear's view -- and swung his stick with
both hands against Brashear's head.
</P>
<P>
	   "I apologize to Donald Brashear and all the fans who had to watch that,"
McSorley said Monday. "I embarrassed my hockey team. ... I got way too carried
away. It was a real dumb play.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm still in shock at what I did," he said. "I have to come to terms with
what I did. There's no excuse. It was so stupid, I can't believe I did it."
</P>
<P>
	   Police, deluged with calls from angry fans, are investigating and said they
will consult with the NHL.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a situation here where it would appear, or that it's been alleged,
that there was a fairly vicious attack by one person on another," said constable
Anne Drennan, a spokeswoman for the Vancouver police.
</P>
<P>
	   She said police have not yet interviewed Brashear or McSorley and she
doesn't know how long the investigation will take. The findings will be sent to
a prosecutor, who will decide whether to file charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Canucks general manager Brian Burke, once the NHL's chief disciplinarian,
said the police should stay out.
</P>
<P>
	   "Leave this stuff on the ice; leave it to the National Hockey League," Burke
told Vancouver radio station CKNW. "We don't need the Vancouver police
department or the RCMP involved in this."
</P>
<P>
	   Referee Brad Watson declared the game over with the remaining seconds
unplayed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We couldn't believe what we saw and didn't know what to do," Canucks left
wing Brad May said. "It was crazy out there. I have no respect for that guy ever
again. Anybody who has ever had respect for him should lose it.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's our big brother out there," May said of Brashear. "He sticks up for
our team, he's the toughest in the league. To get hit like that, it's just
uncalled for."
</P>
<P>
	   McSorley, who received a match penalty for attempt to injure, has lasted 17
years in the league because of his ability to fight and protect his more skilled
teammates. He has been suspended at least five other times in his professional
career.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a shocker," Boston captain Ray Bourque said. "I've never been a part
of anything like that or witnessed anything like that. There is no way to
justify it."
</P>
<P>
	   The longest suspension the NHL has ever imposed for an on-ice hit was a
21-game banishment given to Washington's Dale Hunter for a blindside check of
the New York Islanders' Pierre Turgeon after a goal in a 1993 playoff game.
</P>
<P>
	   McSorley is best known for serving as Wayne Gretzky's protector with the
Edmonton Oilers and then with Los Angeles as the two were traded together in one
of hockey's biggest deals.
</P>
<P>
	   "Marty has always been an honest player," said Vancouver captain Mark
Messier, a teammate of McSorley's on the Oilers' Stanley Cup teams. "He has
always been a tough player and he's always played the game hard and played the
game tough.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've never recalled him doing anything like that before. It was tough to
watch knowing him and watching Donald, a teammate. It was a dangerous play. We
can't allow that to happen in the league."
</P>
<P>
	   Brashear, 28, fought with McSorley just two minutes into Monday's game and
clearly got the best of his 36-year-old opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   He landed several hard lefts before dragging McSorley down to the ice.
McSorley challenged Brashear again in the first period, but Brashear skated
away, leaving McSorley with a double-minor for cross-checking and roughing and a
10-minute misconduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Brashear also was involved in a goal-mouth tangle that caused a knee injury
to Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
	   As on-ice policemen, Brashear and McSorley are natural rivals by job
description.
</P>
<P>
	   "Brash fought him one time and beat him and beat him bad like he always does
against him," Vancouver's Markus Naslund said. "I don't know if he was so
embarrassed and gutless that that is the way he's got to take it out."
</P>
<P>
	   McSorley, who has only two goals and three assists, said he was again trying
to goad Brashear as the game was ending.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've done that with so many guys, so many times, but I don't know what
happened," he said. "There's no excuse."
</P>
<P>
	   In only 27 games this season, McSorley is second on the Bruins with 62
penalty minutes. With 3,381 career minutes, McSorley trails only Dave "Tiger"
Williams and Hunter on the NHL list.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have gotten involved in several previous on-ice conflicts in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1970, Wayne Maki of the St. Louis Blues and Ted Green of Boston were the
first NHL players taken to court after a stick-swinging duel at a September 1969
preseason game. Green, who fractured his skull, and Maki, who was not injured,
were acquitted of assault charges.
</P>
<P>
	   In the most recent, Minnesota's Dino Ciccarelli was sentenced to one day in
jail and fined $1,000 in 1988 for striking Luke Richardson several times in the
head with his stick.

<HEADLINE> Israel: Hamas Wounded 40 Israelis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A militant Islamic cell uncovered by Israeli and
Palestinian security forces was apparently responsible for planting four bombs
that injured 40 Israelis, the Israeli army said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The cell belonged to the Hamas group, which is opposed to the peace process
between Israel and the Palestinians. Most members of the cell were students at
An-Najah University in the West Bank city of Nablus, the army spokesman said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the bombs, which was planted close to the Israeli-Palestinian liaison
office in the West Bank city of Ramallah, was discovered in time and defused.
Another exploded in the Israeli coastal resort of Netanya, but nobody was hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   The third, also planted in Netanya, injured 20 passers-by on Nov. 7, and the
last exploded on Jan. 17 in Hadera, northern Israel, injuring the same number.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israelis uncovered the cell after they arrested one of its members on
Jan. 30 in Netanya, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 20, a Palestinian was killed and another seriously injured when a
bomb went off inside their car in the northern West Bank. They too belonged to
the cell, the army said. The two planned to place the bomb at a nearby Jewish
settlement, Israeli media reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian police arrested 50 students from An-Najah and another ten
were arrested by the Israelis, students said.
</P>
<P>
	   Security officials in Nablus said about a dozen Hamas supporters had
confessed to belonging to Izzedine al Qassam, the military wing of Hamas, which
has killed scores of Israelis in bombing attacks in Israel in recent years.

<HEADLINE> McCain Wins Mich., Ariz. Primaries  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- John McCain thumped George W. Bush in a two-state sweep
Tuesday night, rallying a ``new McCain majority'' of independents and Democrats
in Michigan and winning his home state of Arizona to seize momentum for a
two-week blitz of Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching out to Republican voters who backed the Texas governor in
overwhelming numbers in Michigan, the senator told supporters, ``Don't fear this
campaign, my fellow Republicans. Join it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, humbled by defeat, said, ``This is a marathon and I'm going to be in
it all the way to the end -- and some primaries you win and sometimes you
don't.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's is the latest victory in a see-sawing Republican nomination race.
The Arizonan won New Hampshire's leadoff primary in a landslide, lost the
followup showdown in South Carolina and won Michigan by a narrow margin. It
further damaged Bush's hard-fought image as the inevitable GOP nominee, and
propelled both men toward a March 7 showdown in 13 states,
</P>
<P>
	   ``This means we're going to go charging into Super Tuesday,'' said state
Sen. John Schwarz, McCain's chairman in Michigan. Even before winning his double
header, McCain narrowed Bush's financial advantage and closed the gap in
national polls since New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   In Michigan, Bush and McCain forged mirror-image coalitions: Bush vote was
supported by two-thirds of Republicans, and McCain ventured outside the party
for a similar-sized force of Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Open to all comers, Michigan's primary actually drew more non-Republicans
than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters bitterly dismissed McCain's victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain isn't party building, he's party-borrowing,'' said three-term
Michigan Gov. John Engler, who accused the senator of ``renting Democrats'' for
the night. Engler had promised to carry Michigan for Bush, and took blame for
the defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's response: ``Be a man.''
</P>
<P>
	   --In Michigan, with 67 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had
462,823 votes, or 50 percent, and Bush had 409,490, or 44 percent. Former
ambassador Alan Keyes had 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --In Arizona, with 45 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had 135,047
votes, or 60 percent, and Bush had 80,473 votes, or 36 percent. Keyes had 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victories earned him all 30 delegates from Arizona and at least 19
of the 58 delegates in Michigan, narrowing his gap with Bush. McCain has 63
delegates to date, compared to Bush's 64. A candidate needs 1,034 delegates to
win the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told The Associated Press that GOP leaders backing Bush will peel
away when they start realize his cross-party coalition would beat Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I look more electable, we'll start drawing more Republicans,'' said
McCain, who received just one fourth of the GOP vote in Michigan ``What I
believe we are assembling is the new McCain majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   With an American flag serving as a backdrop, McCain told supporters later,
``I am a proud Reagan conservative. I love the Republican Party. It is my
home.'' And he courted Republicans who backed Bush on the assumption the Texan
was the most likely to succeed. ``We are Al Gore's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews with voters as they left polling places showed that more than
half of the Michigan voters were non-Republicans -- independents and Democrats
who voted in far larger numbers than in 1996. Three-quarters of McCain's vote
came from the non-Republicans, and three-quarters of Bush's vote came from
bedrock Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and television
networks, conducted the interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   In a whirlwind 48 hours after the South Carolina primary, Bush and McCain
traded accusations of negative campaigning in Michigan. Each complained that the
other was using automated phone calls to voters to make inflammatory religious
attacks.	   Bush drew fewer number of bedrock Republicans than in South
Carolina. McCain's mixed breed of voters -- blue-collar economic conservatives,
union members and Baby Boomers -- voted in far larger numbers than in the
previous contest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's coalition was reminiscent of the voters who put Ronald Reagan into
the White House then became a battleground for Democrats and Republicans in
subsequent presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain did better among veterans than in South Carolina, and appeared to
have greater success convincing voters that he was the race's true reformer and
straight talker. In addition to his success among Democrats and independents,
McCain earned the support of an overwhelming percentage of new voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush voters were younger, more affluent, anti-abortion and strongly
conservative. They cited his conservative values as their top reason for voting
for him. Religious right voters also preferred Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Four in 10 voters said both candidates attacked unfairly, though the
bickering seemed to leave Michigan voters with a more negative impression of
Bush than McCain. That is a reverse of polling from South Carolina.
</P>

some backlash from voters -- of those who said Engler's support affected their
vote a great deal, two-thirds actually voted for McCain.

<P>
	   Following contests in tiny New Hampshire and Delaware, remote Alaska and

to California after the voting in Michigan. He has operations in all 13 states

northern Virginia in an attempt to win the state's 56 delegates Feb. 29. After

earned him a third of the vote in the 1996 GOP primary.

<HEADLINE> McCain Buoyed by Win  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Only three days earlier, John McCain was all bravado as he
glared from the podium and vowed to crush George W. Bush, the Texas governor who
had stolen his New Hampshire thunder by winning the South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But the truth is that McCain had not been nearly that confident about his
chances in the Michigan Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Phew!'' McCain exclaimed as he watched from the protective comfort of his
own couch, as the earliest, razor-thin results from Michigan rolled in from the
television.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We jumped up and we were excited,'' said the understated political
director John Weaver, who persuaded McCain to run in the first place and sat
next to him at the crucial moment. ``We didn't say anything. Nothing needed to
be said.''
</P>
<P>
	   A while later, McCain was standing before an adoring crowd, soaking up his
duo of primary victories in Michigan and his home state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today, Michigan sent a powerful message across America -- a message that
our party wants real reform from the real reformer,'' he said, playing off of
Bush's own claim to be a ``reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator rolled out a new campaign phrase --``a McCain
majority''-- during the victory speech, and asserted: ``We are Al Gore's worst
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
	   But his road ahead is long and geared most immediately to the West Coast.
McCain is going Wednesday to Washington state but plans to spend seven of the
next 12 days in California, competing for that state's huge haul of delegates in
the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   No longer planning to simply cede Virginia to Bush, McCain also planned at
least to run some ads in the northern part of the state. Virginians vote
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan was McCain's lifeline, aides acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
	   Everything about his body language earlier in the day indicated his
confidence was not high.
</P>
<P>
	   Casting a vote for himself during his only event, McCain
uncharacteristically stayed clear of reporters and cut off questioning when it
strayed beyond general topics. Before he could be asked about Bush's charge that
he was spreading rumors that the Texas governor was anti-Catholic, McCain turned
his back on the press gaggle and jumped into his bus.
</P>
<P>
	   As Bush campaigned in Michigan until the polls there closed, McCain stayed
at home with his family through the afternoon, creating a media blackout that
was unusual for a candidate who promised during the heady days of his New
Hampshire campaign to ``kill 'em with access.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Med Mistakes Reported  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants to require fuller accounting of
deadly mistakes occurring daily in America's hospitals, but skeptical senators
said Tuesday his plan lacks details and the money to make it work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a worthy endeavor,'' Clinton said as he predicted bipartisan
support for a national plan to cut medical mistakes. At the same time, he tried
to convince doctors and hospitals that reporting serious problems need not lead
to more malpractice lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton wants a nationwide system to report and analyze medical mistakes,
similar to the airlines' reporting program for aviation accidents and safety
risks. He is pressing states to begin reporting within three years, but he
cannot force them to without separate legislation from Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House plan follows an independent report last year that missteps
by medical staff kill between 44,000 and 98,000 hospitalized Americans each year
-- equivalent to a jetliner crash every day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reporting is vital to holding health care systems accountable for
delivering quality care, and educating the public about the safety of their
health care system,'' Clinton said Tuesday. ``It is critical to uncovering
weaknesses, targeting widespread problems, analyzing what works and what doesn't
and sharing it with others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton endorsed many of the recommendations in that report from the
Institute of Medicine, including establishing a goal of reducing medical
mistakes by half within five years.
</P>
<P>
	   He also asked Congress for $20 million to set up a national clearinghouse
for patient safety, as the institute recommended. The institute is part of the
National Academy of Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress to
advise the government on scientific matters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a balanced, commonsense approach based on prevention, not
punishment, based on problem-solving, not blame-placing,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Medical Association and other large lobbies staunchly oppose
mandatory reporting, fearing that it opens hospitals and doctors to lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We live in an extraordinarily litigious environment,'' said Dr. Nancy
Dickey, past president of the AMA and a spokeswoman for the doctors' group.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House replies that while its plan offers consumers more
information about the safety records of individual hospitals, it would keep key
details about who did what to whom out of the hands of claims attorneys.
</P>
<P>
	   At a joint Senate subcommittee hearing Tuesday, several lawmakers offered
general endorsements for Clinton's approach but said they are confused as to how
the reporting system will work and who will pay for it.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, they noted that Clinton's proposed $20 million budget is for
research, not reporting. That leaves states on their own unless Congress steps
in with cash. In contrast, a bill already introduced by Sens. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, would provide grants to states to help start
reporting systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Specter said he supports mandatory reporting, even though powerful medical
lobbies oppose it. Specter complained, however, that the Clinton plan urges all
50 states to have mandatory reporting systems within three years but specifies
no sanctions if they don't.
</P>
<P>
	   Specter added that Pennsylvania already has a mandatory reporting system but
few hospitals actually comply.
</P>
<P>
	   Already 18 states have varying requirements for reporting medical errors,
but they're scattershot in what they require and how reports are analyzed or
used. Consequently, the Institute of Medicine said few state programs are
effective.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, worried that small rural hospitals, some with
as few as 10-15 beds, already are struggling economically and cannot afford to
establish a reporting system.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also announced several new requirements that do not need
congressional approval, including an immediate mandatory reporting requirement
for the 500 Defense Department-administered hospitals that serve an estimated 8
million people. The Health Care Financing Administration will require error
reduction plans this year in all 6,000 hospitals that participate in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration has a year to develop new standards to help
prevent medical mistakes caused by sound-alike drug names or look-alike
products. The agency also will devise new standards for labels that highlight
common problems such as errors in dosage size.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Taken together, these actions represent the most significant effort our
nation has ever made to reduce medical errors,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Air To Stay With Star Alliance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai Airways International said Wednesday that it
would remain in the Star Alliance linking more than half-dozen major airlines,
which last week it said it was considering leaving.
</P>
<P>
	   In a news release, the airline said reports of the possibility of Thai
Airways leaving the grouping were "incorrect."
</P>
<P>
	   "Thai's President, Thamnoon Wanglee, has never said that the airline wanted
to leave the alliance and confirms that Thai would remain in the alliance," said
the airline's announcement, dated Tuesday but sent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue arose last week after Thamnoon told journalists that the airline
had asked its financial adviser "to consider whether it is better to stay with
the Star Alliance or whether it is better to leave."
</P>
<P>
	   Thai Airways' more powerful regional rival, Singapore Airlines, is scheduled
to join Star in April. The group also includes United Airlines, Lufthansa, Air
Canada, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Scandinavian Airlines System and
Varig.
</P>
<P>
	   Star Alliance is one of a handful of such groupings in which airlines
cooperate in certain services and offer passengers benefits such as the right to
consolidate frequent flyer mileage acquired from different member airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision to review Star membership came after figures showed Singapore
Airlines cost Thai Airways $10 million last year by taking over some
non-alliance code-sharing agreements with Lufthansa on flights from Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Thai Airways is preparing to sell a stake to a strategic partner
later this year.

<HEADLINE> McCain Wins Mich., Ariz. Primaries  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- John McCain thumped George W. Bush in a two-state sweep
Tuesday night, rallying a ``new McCain majority'' of independents and Democrats
in Michigan and winning his home state of Arizona to seize momentum for a
two-week blitz of Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching out to Republicans backing the Texas governor in overwhelming
numbers, the senator told supporters, ``Don't fear this campaign, my fellow
Republicans. Join it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, humbled by defeat, said, ``This is a marathon and I'm going to be in
it all the way to the end -- and some primaries you win and sometimes you
don't.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's is the latest victory in a see-sawing Republican nomination race.
The Arizonan won New Hampshire's leadoff primary in a landslide, lost the
followup showdown in South Carolina and won Michigan with room to spare. It
further damaged Bush's hard-fought image as the inevitable GOP nominee, and
propelled both men toward a March 7 showdown in 13 states,
</P>
<P>
	   ``This means we're going to go charging into Super Tuesday,'' said state
Sen. John Schwarz, McCain's chairman in Michigan. Even before winning his double
header, McCain narrowed Bush's financial advantage and closed the gap in
national polls since New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   In Michigan, Bush and McCain forged mirror-image coalitions: Bush vote was
supported by two-thirds of Republicans, and McCain ventured outside the party
for a similar-sized force of Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Open to all comers, Michigan's primary actually drew more non-Republicans
than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters bitterly dismissed McCain's victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain isn't party building, he's party-borrowing,'' said three-term
Michigan Gov. John Engler, who accused the senator of ``renting Democrats'' for
the night. Engler had promised to carry Michigan for Bush, and took blame for
the defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's response: ``Be a man.''
</P>
<P>
	   --In Michigan, with 73 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had
501,278 votes, or 50 percent, and Bush had 443,196, or 44 percent. Former
ambassador Alan Keyes had 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --In Arizona, with 49 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had 137,891
votes, or 60 percent, and Bush had 81,981 votes, or 36 percent. Keyes had 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victories earned him all 30 delegates from Arizona and at least 19
of the 58 delegates in Michigan, narrowing his gap with Bush. McCain has 63
delegates to date, compared to Bush's 64. A candidate needs 1,034 delegates to
win the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told The Associated Press that GOP leaders backing Bush will peel
away when they start realize his cross-party coalition would beat Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I look more electable, we'll start drawing more Republicans,'' said
McCain, who received just one fourth of the GOP vote in Michigan ``What I
believe we are assembling is the new McCain majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   With an American flag serving as a backdrop, McCain told supporters later,
``I am a proud Reagan conservative. I love the Republican Party. It is my
home.'' And he courted Republicans who backed Bush on the assumption the Texan
was the most likely to succeed. ``We are Al Gore's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews with voters as they left polling places showed that more than
half of the Michigan voters were non-Republicans -- independents and Democrats
who voted in far larger numbers than in 1996. Three-quarters of McCain's vote
came from the non-Republicans, and three-quarters of Bush's vote came from
bedrock Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and television
networks, conducted the interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   In a whirlwind 48 hours after the South Carolina primary, Bush and McCain
traded accusations of negative campaigning in Michigan. Each complained that the
other was using automated phone calls to voters to make inflammatory religious
attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush drew a smaller percentage bedrock Republicans than in South Carolina.
McCain's mixed breed of voters -- blue-collar economic conservatives, union
members and Baby Boomers -- voted in far larger numbers than in the previous
contest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's coalition was reminiscent of the voters who put Ronald Reagan into
the White House then became a battleground for Democrats and Republicans in
subsequent presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain did better among veterans than in South Carolina, and appeared to
have greater success convincing voters that he was the race's true reformer and
straight talker. In addition to his success among Democrats and independents,
McCain earned the support of an overwhelming percentage of new voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush voters were younger, more affluent, anti-abortion and strongly
conservative. They cited his conservative values as their top reason for voting
for him. Religious right voters also preferred Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Four in 10 voters said both candidates attacked unfairly, though the
bickering seemed to leave Michigan voters with a more negative impression of
Bush than McCain. That is a reverse of polling from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, McCain won the majority of Republicans, even as one in four
voters in his home state said the senator didn't have the temperment to serve
effectively as president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaigned side-by-side in Michigan with Engler, who appeared to draw
some backlash from voters -- of those who said Engler's support affected their
vote a great deal, two-thirds actually voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Following contests in tiny New Hampshire and Delaware, remote Alaska and
conservative South Carolina, Michigan tested the candidates' ability to appeal
to a large, diverse electorate.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to the March 7 contests, Bush stopped in Missouri, then flew
to California after the voting in Michigan. He has operations in all 13 states
that vote that day.
</P>
<P>
	   Emboldened by victory, McCain decided Tuesday night to air TV ads in
northern Virginia in an attempt to win the state's 56 delegates Feb. 29. After
losing South Carolina, he told his staff to ease up their efforts in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's main focus, however, will be California. He plans to spend seven of
the next 12 days in the state that awards 162 delegates to the March 7 primary
winner, sources said. He is counting on his strong showing in New Hampshire to
give him a boost in New England states that day.
</P>
<P>
	   With McCain now setting the agenda, Bush has decided to cancel a Virginia
trip early next week to to head to Washington state instead, keeping pace with
McCain, who will be there Wednesday.

</P>
<P>
	   Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow said in a statement that Louis
Farrakhan Jr. was charged with two felony counts of aggravated battery in

<P>
    MONTREAL (AP) -- Jeff Hackett made 27 saves for his first shutout of the
season, and Benoit Brunet scored with less than eight minutes left in the
Montreal Canadiens' 1-0 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The win was Montreal's sixth in a row, its longest winning streak since
seven straight in November 1997. The Canadiens are 12-2-2-2 since Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Hackett, who has won his last five games, got his first shutout since last
March 24 at Edmonton. Hackett, 6-1-1 in his last eight starts, and teammate Jose
Theodore have combined for six shutouts this season. Theodore is tied with the
Buffalo's Martin Biron for the individual lead with five.
</P>
<P>
	   Brunet redirected Patrice Brisebois' slap shot from the point past Sean
Burke at 12:34 of the third, just seconds after Phoenix defenseman Radoslav
Suchy left the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadiens captain Saku Koivu, who returned after missing the previous 40
games with a dislocated left shoulder, assisted on Brunet's goal with a pass to
Brisebois at the point.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Rucinsky, Montreal's leading scorer with 38 points, needed five
stitches to close a cut to the inside of his lower lip when he was struck in the
mouth by Phoenix defenseman Stan Neckar's stick in the first period.

<HEADLINE> Japan Trade Surplus Declines in Jan.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world fell in January to its
lowest level in two years as recovering domestic demand and surging oil prices
fueled imports, the government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods exported minus those
imported, shrank 30.7 percent compared to the same month last year to $4.75
billion (522.6 billion yen), the Ministry of Finance said. The surplus was
unadjusted for seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the smallest monthly tally since January 1998, when the surplus hit
$3.68 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States also fell,
slipping 1.9 percent on year to $4.34 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the tenth straight month in which Japan's overall surplus fell from
levels a year earlier. Analysts said budding domestic demand, together with a
strong yen, continues to spur growth in imports.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the smaller surplus is mainly due surging imports reflecting the
economic recovery in Japan," said Kazuhiko Ogata, senior economist at ABN AMRO
Securities (Japan) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
	   The shrinking surplus also shows the effect of surging oil prices, which
boosts the value of the country's imports, analysts said. Crude oil prices more
than doubled in January from a year earlier to $25.70 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Those two factors are likely to continue to support import growth, analysts
said. They predicted the surplus will continue shrinking in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
	   But some said they believe exports will catch up in the coming months, as
demand around the globe continues to firm. That could slow the trend toward a
smaller surplus or, according to some, even turn the trend around.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan is fighting to emerge from its worst economic downturn in 50 years. It
has been under heavy pressure from the United States and other trading partners
to rein in the surplus by bolstering its weak economy to spark demand for
imports.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Boy Dragged To Death From Car  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. (AP) -- A six-year-old boy who became tangled in a seat
belt outside his mother's car as the vehicle was being stolen died Tuesday after
being dragged for miles at speeds up to 80 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was ``hanging out of the side of the car bouncing'' down Interstate
70 as horrified motorists honked their horns and flashed their lights at the
fleeing vehicle, said Fred Byam, one of four men who helped capture the man
suspected of stealing the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   Jake D. Robel was killed after he was dragged more than four miles.
</P>
<P>
	   Four men in two trucks and a car finally surrounded the stolen vehicle after
it left the highway and stopped at a stoplight on a busy Independence road.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the men got a rope from his car and tied the suspect's legs when he
tried to run.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspect was trying to push the boy out of the car when the boy became
tangled in the seat belt, authorities said. The suspect was in custody.
</P>
<P>
	   The car was stolen when the boy's mother left it running while she ran into
a store to get a sandwich.

<HEADLINE> No. 17 Iowa St. 89, No. 14 Texas 77  </HEADLINE>
    By CHUCK SCHOFFNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMES, Iowa (AP) -- The most valuable player in the Big 12 Conference? Iowa
State's Michael Nurse has no doubt: teammate Marcus Fizer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he might have showed that tonight," Nurse said after Fizer scored a
career-high 35 points in No. 17 Iowa State's 89-77 victory over 14th-ranked
Texas on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   With Fizer making one huge play after another, Iowa State (23-4, 11-2 Big
12) broke down a team that had allowed an average of just 55 points in its five
previous games and pulled into a tie with Oklahoma State for first place in the
league with three games to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas (19-7, 10-3), unable to hold a 14-point lead against the smaller,
quicker Cyclones, dropped one game back in the league race.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what you'd label this group of ours, but they're special in my
mind and they really battled, they accepted the challenge," Iowa State coach
Larry Eustachy said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought once we started getting to their perimeter guys and contesting
shots and making it difficult for them to throw it inside -- that was our game
plan -- and once we got our game plan on the court, we took advantage of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Nurse added 20 points for Iowa State, which trailed 8-0 and was down 26-12
before taking the lead for good at 38-37 on Jamaal Tinsley's 3-pointer at the
halftime buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Tinsley and Stevie Johnson each scored 12 points, with Johnson getting all
of his in the second half on 5-for-5 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   This night, however, belonged to Fizer, who scored on drives, dunks and
turnarounds and even made two 3-pointers. He also grabbed nine rebounds, handed
out a career-high five assists, blocked two shots and made two steals.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous high for the 6-foot-8 junior, who missed his first four shots,
had been 32 against Oklahoma State last season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was disappointed in our post play," Texas coach Rick Barnes said. "Fizer
is a big, strong guy, but so are our post men. Tonight, he got the best of us.
His ability to score off the dribble is what really hurt."
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Mihm and Ivan Wagner led Texas with 17 points each and Darren Kelly
scored 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State played the last half without its tallest player, 6-9 Paul
Shirley, who broke his foot late in the first half. As a result, the Cyclones'
starters played the entire second half except Fizer, who went out to a
thunderous ovation with 7.3 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   With Shirley out, the 6-4 Johnson often had to guard Mihm, a 7-footer.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's one of the gutsiest performances -- this will be my 10th year as a
head coach -- that I've ever had," Eustachy said. "We just really showed a lot
of toughness."
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State opened the second half with a 7-0 run -- five points by Johnson
and a basket by Fizer on a drive against Mihm -- to go up 45-37. The Longhorns
got no closer than five points after that.
</P>
<P>
	   Two straight 3-pointers by Nurse stretched the lead to 52-41 and Iowa State
maintained a comfortable cushion until Texas drew to 66-61 on Mihm's reverse
layup with 6:36 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   But Iowa State answered. The 6-4 Johnson slipped inside for a basket and
Fizer beat Mihm off the dribble for another bucket to make it 70-61. The
Cyclones then went into a four-corner setup with Tinsley running things to
preserve the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   It grew to 79-65 when Fizer got the ball in the right corner, drove the
baseline and jammed the ball through the hoop with 2:08 left. The Cyclones
wrapped it up by making eight straight free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   As Fizer was at the line with 39.9 seconds left, the crowd chanted "One more
year. One more year," a plea for him to return for his senior season instead of
entering the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
	   Fizer kept his concentration and made both shots.
</P>
<P>
	   The 89 points were the most scored against Texas this season. Arizona scored
88 on Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's tough to come in here and lose," Mihm said. "If we get another shot at
Iowa State, that would be great, but if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. I
played hard tonight and my shots felt good, but sometimes you have those
nights."

<HEADLINE> Quebec Police and Protesters Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEBEC CITY, Quebec (AP) -- Police in riot gear fired tear gas and dodged
Molotov cocktails and billiard balls Tuesday evening, during a clash with about
2,000 protesters outside a meeting of young people and civic leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   One police officer suffered a broken elbow after being struck by a billiard
ball. Police said protesters also threw rocks and snowballs.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd eventually dispersed and there were no reports of arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting -- bringing together politicians, business leaders and youth
groups to advise the government on youth policy -- was called off for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the violence began as the protesters, who included activists,
students and communist party members, gathered as the meeting was about to open
in the city's Grand Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said protesters tried to force their way in to the building,
prompting the clash with police.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the protesters said they were there hold a counter-meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Ste-Marie, one of the demonstration's organizers, said later that
his group had not planned to have a violent protest.

	   DETROIT (AP) -- John McCain thumped George W. Bush in a two-state GOP
presidential primary sweep Tuesday, rallying a "new McCain majority" of
independents and Democrats in Michigan and winning his home state of Arizona.
Bush declared: "This is a marathon and I'm going to be in it all the way to the
end -- and some primaries you win and sometimes you don't." With 73 percent of
Michigan's precincts reporting, McCain had 501,278 votes or 50 percent, and Bush
had 443,196, or 44 percent. With 49 percent of Arizona's precincts reporting,
McCain had 137,891 votes, or 60 percent, and Bush had 81,981, or 36 percent.

Closing Arguments in Diallo Case

	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In closing arguments Tuesday, a defense attorney said
Amadou Diallo, killed in a barrage of 41 bullets, gave four white police
officers no choice but to open fire when he refused to stop for questioning and
drew what they thought was a gun. Although the black object in Diallo's hand
turned out to be a wallet, when he pulled it out, "that was it," attorney John
Patten told the jury. "You can't expect (the officers) to stand there and get
blasted away." Prosecutor Eric Warner portrayed the defendants as trigger-happy
patrolmen who made a snap judgment that the victim -- an unarmed West African
immigrant "minding his own business" -- was really a bad guy lurking in a bad
neighborhood.

   BRECKENRIDGE, Minn. (AP) -- A man whose friend died in a truck tug-of-war
after an argument over who had the most powerful pickup was sentenced Tuesday to
a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Bobby G. Olson, 34, pleaded guilty last month to criminal vehicular homicide
