<TEXT>
<P>
Phnom Malai, Cambodia, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Royal
Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) has finished the work of integrating
breakaway Khmer Rouge forces, Co-Defense Minister Tea Chanrath
said today.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at an integration ceremony at Malai Mountain,
on the northwest border with Thailand, this morning. Tea Chanrath
said the breakaway Khmer Rouge officers and soldiers in the
provinces, from the northern Banteay Meanchey Province to the
southern Kampong Chhnang Province, had all been incorporated into
the RCAF, but he did not specify the number of troops who defected.
</P>
<P>
An officer from the defense ministry said nearly 10,000
breakaway Khmer Rouge soldiers had turned to the RCAF since early
October.
</P>
<P>
In the ceremony at Phnom Malai, one of the major bases held by
troops loyal to split Khmer Rouge leader Ieng Sary, more than 500
officers and soldiers representing 1097 troops from Khmer Rouge
Division 450 received new RCAF uniforms and kits.
</P>
<P>
Phon, newly-appointed commander of Division 450, said the men
of his division joined the RCAF for national reconciliation and to
end the bloody war between Khmers.
</P>
<P>
A soldier named Nareth told Xinhua that he was joining the RCAF
on his own will.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to a peaceful life -- we hope for
national unity and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was also attended by a second Co-Defense Minister,
Tea Banh, and former commander of Division 450, Sok Pheap.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the co-defense ministers attended another
incorporation ceremony at Pailin, a former stronghold of the Khmer
Rouge further south of Phnom Malai.
</P>
<P>
At Pailin, about 700 officers and soldiers representing a group
of 2507 people from Khmer Rouge Division 415 declared they were
joining the RCAF.
</P>
<P>
Ieng Sary, former Commander of Division 415 EE Chhean, and the
division's new commander, Touch Phary, attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The incorporations came three months after Ieng Sary split with
Khmer Rouge leaders and declared reconciliation with the royal
government in August.

HARARE, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Home Affairs Minister Dumiso
Dabengwa today declared all demonstrations illegal after police
dispersed a group of University of Zimbabwe students gathered in
campus to demonstrate against the new university fee system.
</P>
<P>
The students planned to march onto central Harare to express
their opposition to the Ministry of Higher Education's
announcement that university students would now have to pay 50
percent of their fees.
</P>
<P>
The policy, which is aimed at reducing the government
expenditure, has since proved unpopular with many organizations,
including teachers' and human rights organizations.

<P>
Addressing the students at the campus shortly after the failed
demonstration, Dabengwa said police would not hesitate to deal
with those who disobeyed the warning.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the students were stopped while on campus, a
group of about 50 made it into the city center and were also
dispersed by riot police.

<HEADLINE> France Invites 40 European Leaders to Attend 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- France has invited 40 heads of
state or government of European countries to attend a summit in
France during the second quarter of 1997, said Slim Kallas,
president of the Council of Europe, in Strasbourg today.
</P>
<P>
The date and place for the summit will be decided as soon as
possible, Daniel Tarschys, secretary general of the pan-European
organization said.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda are the key issues concerning Europe: the
protection and defense of the pluralistic political system and the
supremacy of law in central and eastern Europe and Russia, said
Tarschys.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second summit of its kind to be held after the
Vienna summit in 1993, which was attended by nearly all European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 summit will follow the inter-governmental conference
of the European Union and the NATO summit to be held early next
year.
</P>
<P>
Strasbourg and Paris are two places most likely to be chosen
for the summit, because of their logistic facilities.
</P>
<P>
The idea of holding such a summit was proposed and voted by the
parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe in September.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Finance Michel Barnier issued invitation
cards to the summit to all members of the Council of Europe during
a session of the Committee of Ministers of the Council held
Wednesday evening and today.

economic situation had deteriorated during the 4-month rule of the
government.

Mujibur and his family members, except Hasina and her sister,
as well as some ministers of the then Mujibur's regime were
assassinated in a military coup on August 15, 1975.

<HEADLINE> EC Announces New Programs For Chinese Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today unveiled four new programs to help push the reform process
in China.
</P>
<P>
The four programs include a village governance program, a
junior managers' program, a norms and standards cooperation
program and Asia-investment program, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Under the programs, EC will help nurture local governments in
Chinese villages, train young European managers to do business
with China, help European and Chinese firms understand each
other's technical standards and boost investment in China, said an
EC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The village governance program, the first EC-proposed
initiative on social reform in China, is designed to strengthen
self-government at village level in China, where the practice of
electing village committees has spread since the 1978-1987 period.
</P>
<P>
The EC would carry out the program by providing training and
technical assistance to the civil affairs departments at central,
provincial and local levels, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the EU-China junior managers' program was to
provide a pool of young European managers fluent in Chinese and
well versed in the business culture of the country, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The norms and standards cooperation program aimed at improving
awareness and the exchange of information in this field,to boost
international trade between the two sides, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
As for the Asia-Invest program, the spokesman said it was
designed to support contacts between European and Chinese
companies in order to foster investment.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was originally developed for South and
South-East Asia, and was now being extended to China.

<P>
CAIRO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy, who is here on a visit designed to "clear atmosphere"
between the two countries, said today the Israeli-Egyptian tie can
serve as a classical model for the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is viewed, by Israel and by all others, as an important
and essential nation," Levy told a joint press conference with his
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa following talks with President
Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Describing his meeting with Mubarak as "very good," Levy lauded
the president's efforts to push forward the Arab-Israeli
negotiations and the "extremely important" Egyptian-Israeli
relations, which he said could become a model for other countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Israel and Egypt will make joint efforts
to overcome the obstacles on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Levy stressed the importance of solving Palestinian-Israeli
problems through joint cooperation and respect for the principle
of peace. Meanwhile, he indicated that Syrian-Israeli negotiations
hinge on the Syrian side.
</P>
<P>
"Peace comes to serve all parties to the Middle East problem,"
Levy said, adding that Israel regards the peace process as an
aim that comes at the core of its policy.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that hindrances blocking the Middle East
peace march dominated today's talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace should be built on balance, agreement
and justice and not imposition on the other party, Moussa quoted
Mubarak as saying. "Any progress made in the Palestinian-Israeli
peace track would help promote the other peace tracks."

BUCHAREST, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Union of Social
Democracy, which ranked third in the parliamentary elections, has
pledged support in Romania's presidential run-off for Emil
Constantinescu, whose Convention of Romania (CDR) has just won the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The two parties signed the support agreement today.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, former Prime Minister Petre Roman,
chairman of the union, urged the electorate to vote for
Constantinescu in the final contest to be held on November 17.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu is facing a strong rival -- incumbent President
Ion Iliescu, who led the first presidential election held on
Sunday by 32.40 percent of the vote, against the 27.76 percent of
Constantinescu's, though the president's Party of Social Democracy
(PDSR) was behind the CDR in the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to elect representatives from the CDR
as chairman of the Chamber of Deputies (lower house), and prime
minister, and those from the union as chairman of the Senate
(upper house), deputy prime minister and foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The basic targets of the future coalition government, set out
in the agreement, include halting the deterioration of social and
economic life within six months, reforming taxation, increasing
social pensions, releasing control on the foreign exchange rate,
and further privatizing.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Electric Power Increases Worldwide: US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Nuclear power continued to
be a major source of electricity in 1995, accounting for 22
percent of the total worldwide electricity generation, said the
U.S. Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
A 125-page report released here today by the Energy Information
Administration (EIA) of the department said worldwide, nuclear
power plants generated 2,223.5 terawatthours in 1995, which is a
4.3 percent increase in world nuclear power generation from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The EIA report, entitled "Nuclear Power Generation and Fuel
Cycle Report 1996," also noted that last year, five commercial
nuclear units became operable throughout the world, and two units
were retired, bringing the total to 437 units by the end of the
year. In 1995, nuclear units had a combined total capacity of
344.4 net gigawatts-electric (GWe).
</P>
<P>
There were 85 nuclear power projects under construction at the
end of last year, including 32 units in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
The report projected that up to the year 2000, the worldwide
nuclear capacity would reach the range between 359.4 GWe and 367.7
GWe. By the year 2015, the worldwide nuclear capacity is projected
to range between 333.3 GWe and 455.2 GWe. Most of the growth will
take place in the Far East, mainly in Japan, China and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
For the United States, the total nuclear electric capacity is
projected to be 64 GWe by 2015 as compared to 99 GWe in 1995. The
U.S. share of the world nuclear capacity will drop from the
current 28 percent to between 22 and 19 percent while that of Far
East will increase from the current 18 percent to between 26 and
29 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pak Caretaker Gov't to Introduce Election Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani Caretaker
government will introduce certain reforms in the election rules, a
caretaker Minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a function in Lahore, the capital city of Punjab
province, Pakistani Caretaker Minister of Information and
Broadcasting Irshad Haqqani said the accountability was the first
priority of the caretaker government.

concrete measures against corruption and price hike.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Demands Further Rate Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England has become
much more pessimistic about the outlook for inflation in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The bank's quarterly Inflation Report said that last week's
quarter-point increase in base rates was not sufficient to ensure
that inflation would fall below the government's 2.5 percent
target.
</P>
<P>
"The short-run outlook for inflation has deteriorated" since
August, the bank said. "Even after the recent increase in official
interest rates of 1/4 percentage point, it remains more likely
than not that inflation will be above the target at the end of the
forecast horizon."
</P>
<P>
The new forecast in the report anticipated inflation falling
below 2.5 percent next year, but the bank now expected the rate to
rise towards 3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report argued that the recent strength of sterling should
not be seen as a substitute for the necessary monetary tightening.
Interest rates should continue to be raised even if this caused an
unwelcome further strengthening of the pound, it insisted.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Cates at the investment bank UBS said, "The report is
not very good news for Chancellor Clarke. He thought he might
silence the bank in the run-up to the election by raising base
rates last week.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, the bank has piled on the pressure and given us a
very gloomy view of where it thinks inflation will lie if he does
not tighten monetary policy again," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank strongly hinted that the only way for Clarke to arrest
the rise in sterling, which is starting to disturb manufacturers
and exporters, would be to announce an increase in taxes or a
sharp cut in public expenditure, in the budget this month.

<HEADLINE> Situation Worsens Among Refugees in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The hellish situation among more
than 1 million refugees in eastern Zaire is worsening, as the
refugees are "dying like flies," the Agence France Presse (AFP)
quoted Western sources in Zaire as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources, who have contacted Europeans remaining in Goma,
said that the 1 million people are on the verge of "dying in
horrifying conditions."
</P>
<P>
Some local inhabitants in Goma region and around Lake Kivu,
which is 25 kilometers north of Goma, told Westerners in Goma that
the situation is like hell among the 1 million refugees, who are
stacked in a small bay of Lake Kivu without food and drinkable
water for several days.
</P>
<P>
Some non-governmental humanitarian organizations tried in vain
to enter eastern Zaire today.
</P>
<P>
Five exploration teams of the Medecins sans Frontiers tried to
enter Zaire from Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda through different
border points, but were blocked on the border by the government
forces of these countries or rebel forces in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France is intensifying its diplomatic campaign to
dispatch a 5,000-man multinational force to eastern Zaire to save
the lives of more than 1 million people.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Peacekeeping Troops Command Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. army general today
replaced a U.S. navy admiral as the commander-in-chief of the
NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) which has been peacekeeping
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
General William Crouch took over the IFOR post from Admiral
Joseph Lopez at the Sarajevo airport ceremony which was attended
by NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, NATO's supreme commander
General George Joulwan and more than 200 guests.
</P>
<P>
With the change of commanders, the 50,000-strong IFOR will be
operating under the Allied Land Forces Central Europe, of which
Crouch is the commander-in-chief, rather than under the Allied
Forces Southern Europe, which is still commanded by Lopez.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Lopez said that the IFOR has achieved
success in bringing about peace in Bosnia, but challenges still
remain such as obstacles to freedom of movement and return of
refugees, slow progress in arms reduction and demining.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Bosnian people to "demand peace and forgo
hatred" since "IFOR soldiers cannot bring you lasting peace... and
true peace must come from within."
</P>
<P>
General Crouch said that under his command, the IFOR will fully
implement the terms of the Dayton peace accord in the same
even-handed, professional manner as it has been doing in the past
seven months.

<HEADLINE> Israel Unveils New High-Tech Unmanned Aerial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel Aircraft Industries
(IAI) has recently unveiled a new high-tech unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV), according to a report of the latest issue of
bi-weekly Israel Business Today.
</P>
<P>
The Firebird 2001, a remote-controlled UAV, was designed and
constructed by IAI's Malat division to help combat forest
fires. The demonstration of the new aircraft's features was
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service
and the University of Montana.
</P>
<P>
The Firebird 2001 successfully demonstrated that it can
deliver real time, highly accurate data regarding a fire's size,
speed, perimeter and movement.
</P>
<P>
Using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) mapping and forward-looking infrared
(FLIR) cameras, firefighters and fire managers will be able to
instantly receive dynamic, visual and statistical information
about a wildfire.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was attended by fire managers from across
the U.S. and Canada. Representatives from fire-fighting aircraft
companies also reviewed the show.
</P>
<P>
Following the Firebird 2001 UAV demonstration, Dan Bailey,
forest fire management officer at the Lolo National Forest in
Montana, said: "As we move into the next century in the wildland
fire arena, it is important that we take advantage of new
tachnology that will help us deal with the ever-increasing
complexity of wildfire suppression. The use of unmanned aircraft
system in fire surveillance, intelligence gathering, firefighter
safety and cost effectiveness is a step in this direction."
</P>
<P>
An IAI spokesman explained that the UAV is controlled from a
ground-based station, which also receives primary data from
on-board computers. Images can then be delivered to fire camps,
dispatch centers, field offices and any other location with a
compatible computer and modem.
</P>
<P>
The Firebird 2001 has a mission endurance of six hours and an
altitude ceiling of 15,000 feet.

<HEADLINE> IRA Bomber Jailed for 14 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A British army deserter who
bombed a military barracks more than 22 years ago was jailed for
14 years Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Peter McMullen, 49, who extradited from the United States to
face the trial is expected to be free in days as a result of time
spent in custody in America.
</P>
<P>
The accused, a former cook with the Parachute Regiment who
joined the Irish Republican Army, had pleaded guilty to the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
McMullen admitted planting four bombs in the English
headquarters of another regiment which had many soldiers serving
in Northern Ireland at the time. More than 100 soldiers escaped
injury when the bombs rocked the barracks in 1972.
</P>
<P>
"This was a bad case," Judge Arthur Myerson of the York Crown
Court told McMullen. "It was carefully planned by you and it was
daringly executed."
</P>
<P>
McMullen had fought extradition from the United States since
1978. He finally gave up his fight in March and flew back from New
York escorted by British police.
</P>
<P>
Under normal rules, McMullen would have served nine years and
eight months of his 14-year sentence. The judge allowed to be set
against the nine years and three months in custody in the U.S.
and the time spent in custody in Britain since his return.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urges Israeli Businessmen to Attend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu urged today businessmen to attend the Cairo
economic conference slated for November 12-14, saying economic
links are an important part of peace.
</P>
<P>
He issued the call when he addressed a meeting in Tel Aviv
preparing for the economic conference.
</P>
<P>
Despite the cool diplomatic climate prevailing in the region,
Netanyahu said Israeli business leaders should attend the Cairo
conference to underscore the links between commerce and peace.
</P>
<P>
"Business is good for Jews, Arabs and peace," he told leading
Israeli businessmen and trade representatives from Oman, Tunisia
and Morocco, who also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel will send a high-level delegation to the third Middle
East and North Africa Economic Conference despite it has been
downgraded from a summit to a ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The delegation includes ministers of foreign affairs, trade
and industry, finance, transportation, and communications. Trade
and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky will head the mission.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky expressed optimism about the Cairo conference, which
he hoped would promote economic cooperation despite the
unfavorable political atmosphere. He said that 84 Israeli
leading business leaders would participate in the forthcoming
conference.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Israeli delegation wished to promote
business in order to advance the peace process through reaping
economic benefits. "I think that, in spite of the immediate
political atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the immediate political scene, there are deep
strategic interests on all sides to have progress in political
directions and economic cooperations. And because there are
strategic interests, I think it (Cairo conference) will be
successful," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to downplay the hostile attitude taken by Egypt's
Chamber of Commerce which has allegedly asked the government to
exclude Israel from the meeting, U.S. Ambassador to Israel
Martin Indyk tried to persuade Israeli business community to
ignore the reports.
</P>
<P>
Indyk visited Cairo last week and held meetings with several
Egyptian ministers and business leaders. He assured the Israeli
businessmen that they would be welcomed by Egypt, which was
eager to do business with Israel and to improve business ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line in Cairo is going to pay Israel a friendly
environment to do business. And I hope you put aside the fear,
and focus on the opportunity," Indyk said.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo conference, a follow-up of the Amman summit last
year and the Casablanca summit in 1994, is a regional major
conference created against the backdrop of the Israeli-Arab
peaceful reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
However, the peace process has lost its momentum and
Israeli-Arab relations have plunged into crisis since June when
Israeli hardline Likud government took power. This has cast
heavy shadow over the prospects for economic cooperation and
joint development in the region, which is lagging behind in the
fast-growing world.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Vow to Continue Ledra Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Greek Cypriots said here today
that they decided to continue their sit-in protest at the Ledra
Palace check-point on a daily basis, starting this weekend,
despite of government and U.N.'s opposition.
</P>
<P>
A group of Greek Cypriots, led by parliament member Marios
Matsakis, has been at the check-point over the past three
weekends trying to dissuade foreign tourists from visiting the
Turkish-controlled northern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Turkish Cypriots' side closed the Ledra
Palace check-point in retaliation to the Greek Cypriots' protest,
 preventing the enclaved Greek Cypriots from returning to their
homes in the north.
</P>
<P>
Matsakis today held a 90-minute-meeting with Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides and Justice Minister Alecos Evangelou, in the
presence of police chief Panicos Hadjiloizou to discuss the
situation.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, he said "we have informed the ministers
about the unanimous committee decision and told them we believe
we must not give in to blackmail from the Turkish Cypriot side."
</P>
<P>
He said the ministers did not give him any "particularly
serious reasons as to why this protest should end."
</P>
<P>
"We shall continue our protest on a daily basis as from this
weekend. We are not in confrontation with the Turkish Cypriots,
and we wish to live with them in peace," Matsakis said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.N. spokesman Waldemar Rokoszewski said that the
U.N. Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus will seek clarifications from
the Turkish Cypriot side concerning the closing of the Ledra
Palace check-point in retaliation to Greek Cypriot protest.
</P>
<P>
He was later quoted as saying that the U.N. has been given
assurances by the Turkish Cypriot side that they would not
obstruct any Greek Cypriots or Maronites from crossing into and
from the northern island.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the situation at the Ledra Palace
check-point will not deteriorate, noting that "this depends very
much on both sides."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has already made representations to the Cyprus
government about Greek Cypriot protest at the Ledra Palace
check-point.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said Wednesday that
 the government does not encourage such type of protest and
would rather see a different type of protest.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has welcomed the Cyprus government's attempts to
persuade protest organizers to alter the shape of their protest.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
A 180-kilometer-long buffer zone across the island, which
separates the island into two parts, is patrolled by a
1,200-strong U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the Turkish invasion, a total of 20,000
Greek Cypriots and Maronites were living as enclaved in the
northern Cyprus. But their number has reportedly dropped to
about 500.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Forms his Third Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 7 (Xinhua) -- After nearly half a month of
bargaining, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri formed
tonight a half-Moslem-half-Christian government, the third since
Hariri came to office in October, 1992.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a meeting between President Elias Hrawi and
Hariri tonight, the Presidential Palace issued a decree
announcing the president's approval of the new government's
formation.
</P>
<P>
In his 30-member cabinet, Hariri himself holds the portfolios
of minister of finance and minister of posts and
telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
The other prominent members in the cabinet include Deputy
Prime Minister and Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr, Defense
Minister Mohsen Dalloul and Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
The new government was formed after apparent interference of
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, the 52-year-old billionaire prime minister and a
Sunni Moslem, surprised Lebanon's two other top leaders, namely
Hrawi and House Speaker Nabih Berri, Tuesday by a previously
unannounced visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
He held a four-hour meeting in Damascus with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad. Well-informed official sources said that the
meeting was focused on the new government's formation.
</P>
<P>
The visit came following reports that the three top leaders,
better-known as "troika," failed to reach an agreement on the
distribution of portfolios after they had agreed on the lists.
</P>
<P>
Tonight's meeting between Hrawi and Hariri was the third
since the prime minister came back from the Syrian capital.

<HEADLINE> Former Quebec Lt.-Gov. Apologizes to Jews, Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Quebec
Lieutenant-Governor Jean-Louis Roux apologized to Jews and
veterans, a day after quitting his post.
</P>
<P>
"I ask everyone to be generous enough to forgive me," Roux was
quoted as saying by local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
Roux resigned Tuesday for wearing a Nazi swastika and
participating in a march that degenerated into an anti-Jewish riot
in 1942.
</P>
<P>
"I committed an error by giving in, no matter how little it
was, to the anti-Semitic feelings which were poisoning our spirits
at that time.... I ask all my co-citizens to have the generosity
to excuse and pardon me," he said.
</P>
<P>
Roux, a former senator and well-known actor, was appointed
Quebec's 26th lieutenant-general by Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien in September.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French news magazine L'actualite, Roux
said he wore a Nazi symbol and participated in an
anti-conscription demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Before resignation, he explained that wearing the swastika on
the sleeve of his lab coat was the result of "a medical student's
mischievous desire to show off and be provocative."
</P>
<P>
It "in no way corresponded to any political conviction or
ideology on my part," he said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy of
Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko today raised alarms on the
South Africa's arms sales to countries involved in the war in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean envoy, Kabuya Lumuna, told a press conference here
today that he had briefed South African President Nelson Mandela
on the situation in Zaire and expressed the concern of Kinshasa
over the arms sales to Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Mandela had announced a suspension of
South Africa's weapon sales, worth 18.5 million U.S. Dollars, to
Rwanda alleged to have been assisting Tutsi rebels' fighting
against the Zairean government.
</P>
<P>
During the last two weeks, the Tutsi rebels have gained
control over the 1,000-kilometer long strip of land in eastern
Zaire bordering Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi uprising broke out following Zaire's attempt to
expel them out of the region where generations of Tutsi
immigrants have been residing during the last 200 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zairean envoy also attacked the Tutsi-led
governments of Rwanda and Burundi which he said had sent troops
to help the Tutsi rebels occupy the Zairean land.

PARIS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The political crisis faced by the
Zairean government of Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo worsened today
as college students occupied the parliamentary building in
Kinshasa for two hours, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Two students were shot dead by police who were ordered to shoot
those who defied a government ban of demonstration in the capital
Kinshasa, according reports by the Agence France Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The students have been protesting for more than one week what
they called "laxness" of Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo in
dealing with the war situation in the eastern Kivu region of the
country.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 college students from the University of
Kinshasa and other higher schools of Zaire took to the street
today, calling for the resignation of Kengo Wa Dondo and support
to "war effort against Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda," according to
AFP.
</P>
<P>
The students carried the corpses of two of their colleagues
killed through the main streets of Kinshasa before storming the
Palace of People where the deputies were having a full session.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the government seemed to be resigned today in
front of the protesters who accused it of "high treason" facing
the aggression of Rwanda.

private villa in southeast France and appeared extremely weak

<HEADLINE> NASA Launchs Surveyor for Mars Research Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- NASA's Global Surveyor, a
space probe designed to assemble a detailed global portrait of
Mars from orbit, took off Thursday, beginning a busy decade of Mars
voyage.
</P>
<P>
Launched from Florida aboard a Delta rocket after one day delay
because of bad weather, the 2300-pound Surveyor is the first in a
Mars-bound fleet of 10 American, two Russian and one Japanese
space missions lining up for departure over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
According to NASA, the Surveyor will cruise for 10 months and
arrive at Mars in September 1997. Then it will rely on a
fuel-saving technique to dip repeatedly into the thin upper
fringes of Martian atmosphere to slow its momentum.
</P>
<P>
Four months after it reachs Mars, the spacecraft will settle
into a 375-kilometer-high orbit around the red planet's poles. In
March 1998, the craft is to begin compiling a database on the
Planet's surface, atmosphere and interior structure throughout a
full Martian year (687 Earth days).
</P>
<P>
Then the Surveyor will photograph landmarks such as the polar
caps and the winding ancient channels that scientists believe one
flowed with mighty rivers of liquid water.
</P>
<P>
The six instruments aboard the Surveyor are designed to deduce
Martian mineral composition; gather data on dust clouds, water
content and other aspects of the atmosphere; and search for a
Martian magnetic field. A laser altimeter aboard will determine
the heights of mountains and the depths of valleys.
</P>
<P>
After Global Surveyor, Russia's Mars '96 will be launched on
November 16 to study Mars from orbit as well as deploy two small
landers and two robots; NASA's Mars Pathfinder is set for launch
on December 2 to deploy the first roving robot explorer on the red
planet.
</P>
<P>
According to NASA, the planned 13 international Mars missions
have three major themes: to search for evidence of life and water;
to understand the Martian climate and its lessons for Earth; to
study the geology and other resources that might support human
explorers in next century.

<HEADLINE> Action Against Corruption to Start in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's caretaker
government decided to take stern action against plunderers of
national wealth, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The action would be totally impartial, transparent and under
due process of law, according to the official sources.
</P>
<P>
There will be no victimization on political or any other
grounds, said the sources, adding however, nobody will be spared
as the government does not believe in any sort of favoritism.
</P>
<P>
The 13-member caretaker government was sworn in Tuesday after
President Farooq Leghari dismissed the government of Benazir
Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
The interim setup promised to fight against corruption and set
a good trend of governing before the new government comes into
force.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the government will ensure that the
accountability process is taken to its logical end in the shortest
possible time.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, the government hopes that only cases of
gross corruption would be reported as it would not be possible to
process petty cases of corruption due to the short span of time.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government said that it would hold fresh
elections on February 3, 1997 in accordance with the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Political parties have insisted that the most important task of
the interim government should be to hold free and fair election in
due time.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government has solicited the general public to
come out with complaints and evidence about cases of gross
corruption or misuse of official position.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Corruption Cell has been set up in the Ministry of
Interior.
</P>
<P>
Complaints about corruption, along with relevant information,
substantiating corruption charges can be addressed to this cell,
giving name and correct address of the complainant.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the federal government expects that similar
action will be taken by the provincial governments in respect of
provincial employees.

NICOSIA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Russia signed here

<HEADLINE> Party Led by Pakistani Cricket Star to Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Imran Khan, the most popular
cricket star of Pakistan and chief of a new party named
Tehreek-e-Insaaf, said here today that his party would contest
forthcoming elections in February next year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Imran Khan said, "We will
endeavor to field our candidates on all the seats, who have
honesty, integrity and competence."
</P>
<P>
"This is our unshakable commitment to the people of Pakistan,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out any possibility of entering into alliance with any
of other political parties.
</P>
<P>
Imran Khan was a classmate of former prime minister Benazir
Bhutto's at Oxford University in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Leading Pakistan's national team to win the Cricket World Cup
1988, Imran Khan became the hero of the country where cricket is
the most popular sport.
</P>
<P>
He became a controversial figure last year when he married the
daughter of a British millionaire in Britain, while Pakistani
people want their hero to marry a Pakistani girl who is also a
Muslim.
</P>
<P>
Coming back to Pakistan with his wife this year, Imran Khan
took to politics and founded Tehreek-e-Insaaf.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to fight against the rampant corruption in the country
and won certain public support.
</P>
<P>
However, his party is still too small to pose any threat to the
Pakistan People's Party led by Benazir Bhutto and Pakistan Muslim
League (Nawaz group) led by Nawaz Sharif, the top two players in
Pakistan political arena.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the ouster of the Benazir Bhutto government, Imran
Khan demanded the setting up of an independent election commission
before the next elections.
</P>
<P>
The election commission would strictly scrutinize candidates
and would not accept nomination papers from people who were bank
loan defaulters or tax evaders, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has great respect for Caretaker Prime Minister
Miraj Khalid who is a fine and honest man.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said Tehreek-e-Insaaf has withdrawn the demand of
carrying out accountability process before election because "this
process might take much longer time."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy in Rwanda to Negotiate Refugee Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- United Nations mediator Raymond
Chretien arrived today in Rwanda to talk with Rwandan leaders
about the refugee crisis in war-ravaged eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"All the world is watching Rwanda," Agence France Presse (AFP)
quoted the Canadian diplomat and U.N. envoy for the Great Lakes
crisis as saying on arrival at Kigali, the first stop of his peace
mission in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to come to Kigali as soon as possible and spend as
much time as possible in the coming weeks in order to try to bring
a solution to the problems of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is expected to talk with Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu and Vice-President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame, in
order to seek their support for the deployment of a
U.N. humanitarian force in Zaire to help the refugees.
</P>
<P>
"The only very, very urgent question is the need to bring food,
medicines and aid to the refugees as early as possible. Not in the
weeks to come, but in hours and days to come," he said.
</P>
<P>
The easiest supply routes pass through Rwanda, which has an
estimated 1.2 million Hutu refugees in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has said the refugees should come home, but the Hutu
refugees feared revenge by Tutsi people for the 1994 genocide by
Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Before going to Rwanda, Chretien met with Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko in France.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said that Mobutu was very "informed" about what was
going on in his country, as well as about the declaration of the
Nairobi summit of the Great Lakes countries on the deployment of a
multinational force in the Kivu region of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu, who is in France for cancer treatment, promised to do
his best to help maintain calmness in the region to let the
international community to bring aid to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Chretien will fly to Kinshasa this evening or on Saturday to
talk with leaders of the Zairean government on the refugee
crisis.

<HEADLINE> UK Aircraft Carrier to Visit Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The British aircraft
carrier, Invincible, is to dock at the Saudi Arabian eastern
port of Al-Jubil on November 17, the British Embassy in Riyadh
said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
The 20,000-ton aircraft carrier is currently in Dubai, the
United Arab Emirates, according to the Saudi Press Agency (SPA).
</P>
<P>
The Invincible is on a tour to the Gulf region, which also
involves six other British navy ships either in the Gulf or en
route to the area to show London's interest in the regional
security.
</P>
<P>
During its presence in the Gulf, the carrier will hold
military exercises with friendly naval forces in the region, the
embassy statement said.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Soames, Britain's minister of state for armed
forces, was quoted by Gulf media as saying during a visit to
the region earlier this month that London planned to deploy a
huge naval force in the Gulf in the coming months to show Iran
and Iraq that the United States was not policing the area alone.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the biggest British naval deployments in the
waterway would be made in February and March next year.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Harris, British ambassador to the United Arab
Emirates, was also quoted as saying recently that the ships "are
a concrete demonstration of our interest in the region."
</P>
<P>
He said: "the fact that we are here in strength enables us to
keep a close watch on the situation to help the U.N. resolutions
to be fully implemented and to demonstrate...that we will not
allow Iraq to become an aggressor again."
</P>
<P>
Regarding Iran, he said the country "is a problem because we
know that it is sometime a difficult neighbor for the Gulf
states."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China-Funded Stocks Bullish In Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Stocks of China-funded
companies in Hong Kong have been riding on bullish waves in the
local market this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Vickers Ballas, an investment research entity, the
price index of 11 China-backed counters has surged 44 percent in
the first ten months.
</P>
<P>
These counters command 90 percent of the total market
capitalization of the 40 China-funded companies registered and
listed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, these firms have expanded their presence into
trade, retailing, manufacturing, properties, shipping and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
CITIC Pacific and Guangdong Investment, leaders of this stock
group, have been selected as constituent stocks of the Hang Seng
Index, which mirrors 33 blue chips listed on the Hong Kong bourse.
</P>
<P>
The bullish momentum has been fueled by market sentiment that
China is heading into a new growth cycle, said Herbert Lau, an
analyst with Vickers Ballas. China has succeeded in cooling down
an overheating economy thanks to the tightening macro-economic
measures adopted since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Lau believed that the listed firms, with a big exposure to the
domestic market, will benefit from the gradual improvement of
monetary policy and the surging of investment activities in China.
</P>
<P>
With the approach of 1997, the links between Hong Kong and the
inland area will be increased to provide more development
opportunities for these firms, added Lau.
</P>
<P>
Continued "parental support" is another reason for many
investment fund managers to chase up the China-related counters.
These investment vehicles are well positioned to purchase quality
assets at reasonable prices from their mainland-based parent
companies, or seek high-yield projects in China for acquisition,
said a strategist at Credit Lyonnais Securities (Asia) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of firms have purchased toll roads and bridges,
power stations and other capital projects in China since early
this year.
</P>
<P>
Spin-off is also a force driving up the stock prices of these
firms, said the Credit Lyonnais analyst. China Resources has
separated its properties subsidiary, which went public in Hong
Kong today.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, Credit Lyonnais Securities forecast that
these China-related counters will continue to be the hot ones
since more assets injections, acquisitions and spin-offs are
expected in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Some investment managers, however, are not so optimistic. They
warn that the aggressive expansion could put a strain on human and
financial resources of a company, and eventually lower profits.
</P>
<P>
Not all China-funded companies are doing as well as CITIC
Pacific and Shanghai Industrial, whose stocks have risen 40
percent and 100 percent in value, respectively, this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by HG Asia, a Hong Kong-based
securities company, many smaller and lesser known firms lack
transparency, earnings potential and credible management.

GENEVA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) today defended itself against the
criticism of inefficiency in solving the refugee problem in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We did the best we could," UNHCR spokeswoman Ruth Marshall
said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
It was impossible to separate militia from innocent people who
needed to be protected, said Marshall.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the 40 camps along the Zairean border
housing about 1.2 million Rwandan and Burundian refugees, most of
them ethnic Rwandan Hutus, have been used by Rwandan Hutu militia
as bases for launching attacks on the Tutsi-led governments in
Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The refugee agency has been cut off from about 600,000 refugees
in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR, which complained of insufficient assistance from the
international community, called for the establishment of a relief
corridor and a security guarantee for providing assistance to the
refugees.

<HEADLINE> ABU Condemns FIFA on Selling World Cup Broadcast Rights to ISL/Kirch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific Broadcasting
Union (ABU) Friday strongly criticized football's world governing
body the International Football Federation (FIFA) for its earlier
decision to sell the broadcast rights to the 2002 and 2006 World
Cups to a European commercial media group.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's deal with ISL/Kirch, a European commercial marketing
consortium, drew wide, fierce criticism from the delegates who
attended the nine-day General Assembly of the regional
broadcasting organization which closed here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Mikio Kawaguchi, Director of Japan's
leading broadcasting company NHK and Vice-President of the ABU,
said ABU members "were shocked and deeply disappointed" over the
FIFA decision to sell the rights to ISL/Kirch, instead of to its
good, long-time partner -- the Inter-Union Consortium of
Broadcasting Unions.
</P>
<P>
"Amid commercialization spurred on by the great increase in the
number of media organizations and channels, competition among
broadcasters has intensified.
</P>
<P>
"This fierce competition has prompted rights holders in sports
and other fields to put priority on profit-making, at the expense
of public welfare and the promotion of sports.
</P>
<P>
"The skyrocketing cost to broadcast the Olympics and other
major sporting events has exceeded the limits of our tolerance,
and we are caught in a dilemma between the public nature of
broadcasting and the reality of financial constrains," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said behind FIFA's original decision to grant
World Cup broadcast rights collectively to the Inter-Union
Consortium of Broadcasting Unions had always been the idea that
major sports events should be accessible to a maximum number of
viewers at a minimum cost.
</P>
<P>
It condemned the FIFA's change of mind as leading to a handful
of pay television media taking a monopoly over major sports
events, which would result in the manipulation of viewers.
</P>
<P>
The ABU meeting unanimously supported Kawaguchi's statement and
called on other broadcasting unions to follow the ABU's lead on
the issue.

HONG KONG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A group of 237 Vietnamese
migrants left for Ho Chi Minh city today on a voluntary
repatriation flight.
</P>
<P>
With their departure, the overall population of Vietnamese
migrants in Hong Kong has fallen below 10,000 for the first time
since December, 1988.
</P>
<P>
As of noon today, there were 9,924 Vietnamese migrants in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, 11,413 Vietnamese migrants
have returned home. In October alone 1,772 people left, the
highest monthly figure in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Brian Bresnihan, the refugee coordinator, expressed
satisfaction at the pace of repatriation. "If the current
repatriation trends continue, it should be possible to close all
camps by the middle of 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
The process was sped up since 1,041 Vietnamese migrants in the
Whitehead Detention Center volunteered to go home in advance of
the forthcoming cycle of Orderly Repatriation Program flights,
according to the official. In recent weeks, the Vietnamese
authorities agreed to let voluntary repatriation flights land in

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Riot Police Brace for Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's riot police,
responsible for crowd control, went on alert today amid calls by
trade unionists and human rights campaigners for a nationwide
demonstration against the deteriorating health delivery system.
</P>
<P>
Health delivery in Zimbabwe's major centers was plunged into a
crisis 20 days ago when nurses, who form the bulk of the service,
went on strike to press demands for improved working conditions.
</P>
<P>
Harare's two major hospitals were deserted and riot police
cordoned the public off the Africa Unity Square area, a popular
gathering place for demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Armed with baton sticks and tear-gas canisters, riot police
could be seen at strategic places in readiness to contain any
disturbances that may arise.
</P>
<P>
Trade unionists, human rights groups and civic organizations
have called on the government to stop pretending that all is well
in the health sector, saying people's lives were at stake.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals are discharging patients prematurely as most wards
are being closed and only genuine emergency cases are being
handled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the public service commission issued letters of
dismissal to all striking nurses and some of those who returned
to work after the deadline.

<HEADLINE> Record Attendance for ABU General Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific Broadcasting
Union (ABU) closed here on Friday its 33rd General Assembly, held
for the first time in Hong Kong with a record-setting attendance
of 500 participants from 42 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Hugh Leonard, ABU's Secretary-General, described the nine-day
meeting "very, very successful" while its president, Dato Jaafar
Kamin, called for the implementation of the strategy and financial
plans of the organization, which he described as the "most
important thing for us".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of the General
Assembly, Leonard said: "From our point of view, these meetings
during the last nine days were very, very successful."
</P>
<P>
Kamin said that efforts had been made "to place ABU in a better
condition, stronger condition at the year 2000 and beyond".
</P>
<P>
And he called on the Asian broadcasters to unite as one as "we
will be more effective if we talk to the world as a block," with
the concept of "Asia Speaks Out".
</P>
<P>
"While the ever expanding advertising markets will present
revenue opportunities to commercial broadcasters, funding will be
a key concern to those broadcasters who are not supported by
commercial revenues," Kamin said.
</P>
<P>
ABU members expressed their anger at a decision earlier this
year by football's world governing body FIFA to sell the broadcast
rights to the 2002 and 2006 World Cups to a European, commercial
marketing consortium, ISL/Kirch.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Mikio Kawaguchi of Japan, one of ABU's
vice-presidents, slammed the decision as "profit-oriented" and
said it will lead to a handful of pay television media taking a
monopoly over major sporting events".
</P>
<P>
The meeting unanimously supported Kawaguchi's statement and
requested other broadcasting unions to follow the ABU's lead on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
As to the issue of program piracy, the main topic of this
year's assembly, ABU members agreed that the problem was not
something in Asia alone but a matter of growing concern for
broadcasters world-wide.
</P>
<P>
Delegates agreed to pursue the idea of forming an international
organization to take legal and other actions when possible in an
effort to stamp out this increasing problem.
</P>
<P>
Next year's General Assembly is to be held in Seoul, Republic
of Korea.

<HEADLINE> France Tries to Bring Allies Into Action in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- France is desperately trying to
bring its Western allies into an international intervention in
eastern Zaire where many of the 1.2 million refugees reportedly
are dying in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
France today pleaded with the United States to "decide rapidly
the participation by (U.S.) contingents" in such a multinational
force in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that for this operation of extreme urgency, the
necessary multinational force should be composed of fairly equal
parts of the American, African and European contingents," said
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry also said that it is answering about 30
questions posed by Washington over the dispatch of such an
intervention force.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major today issued a jointly
declaration with French President Jacques Chirac on the necessity
to deploy the intervention force, but failed to give precise
commitment on sending British troops to eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Major, who met with Chirac at an annual Franco-British summit
in Bordeaux, said that it is possible that London would send
troops to Zaire, but he was not sure yet whether this would be a
good thing to do.
</P>
<P>
French diplomatic circles said that the French initiative was
gaining more support, but it remained unclear whether it could be
realized.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council is due to resume its
session on Zaire today in New York, but the current chairman of
the council, Indonesian ambassador Nugroho Wisnumurti, refused to
give a precise date for the adoption of a resolution giving green
light for a military intervention in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany Thursday jointly presented a proposal on
sending the intervention force, which Paris hopes would have a
two-month U.N. mandate and would be authorized to use force if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
So far only Spain and a number of West African French-speaking
countries have expressed support to the French proposal.

<HEADLINE> Car Motivated by Solar and Electric Power Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A car which runs on both solar
energy and electric power today debuted in Nanjing, the capital
city of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other cars, the new vehicle is topped by a large panel
which absorbs solar energy.
</P>
<P>
Several automobile experts praised the car's technical
performance, saying it runs smoothly on the highway, has a quiet
engine, and accelerates and stops easily.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Tingzhu, the car's designer and director of
the Hailiang Solar Energy Research Institute in Lianyungang,
Jiangsu Province, the vehicle is mainly operated by electric
power. The institute has found an effective way to turn solar
energy to electricity when sunlight is available, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under normal conditions, the car can run for four hours
non-stop at a speed of 45 km per hour, and its top speed can reach
88 km per hour, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The specialists said the car has reached the standard of
similar vehicles developed in the United States and Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition center for new
architectural technology and products opened here today.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the Ministry of Construction said that
the center will showcase building materials, kitchen utensils and
sanitary equipment. Its aim is to raise the level of housing
construction and auxiliary facilities, and also change the current
chaotic state of the building materials market, he added.
</P>
<P>
The display area of the new facility initially covers 1,500
square meters. Some 1,000 types of quality products from the
first group of 200 Chinese and overseas enterprises will be
exhibited at the center, which are mainly kitchen and toilet
building materials, and energy-efficient equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, 900 million sq m of apartments have
been completed in China each year over the past decade, ranking
first in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall quality of housing construction and
related facilities are not satisfactory, the official pointed
out. Problems such as leaking taps and flush toilets are very
common, resulting in numerous complaints from the public.
</P>
<P>
With China's large-scale housing construction now underway, the
demand for building materials has also risen in different
localities, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He added that the new center will serve as a bridge between
customers and manufacturing enterprises, and help reduce various
intermediary procedures involved in materials circulation. It also
will provide quality products and the latest technological
information for housing construction, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Vows Administrative Reform, China Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today expressed his determination to tackle
administrative reform, which has emerged as the biggest challenge
to Japan's new leadership.
</P>
<P>
He also called for stronger ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who was re-elected for a second term Thursday, said
his new cabinet would carry out thorough administrative reform
through streamlining the bureaucracy, reducing regulations and
devolving government power.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not carry out these reforms, there will be no future
for Japan," he told a nationally televised press conference.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the people will support what we begin and will not
intervene to protect individual interests," he said, citing strong
opposition when the government privatized the Japanese National
Railways a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would establish, later this month, an
advisory body on administrative reform under his direct
jurisdiction, in line with a policy accord hammered out between
the Liberal Democratic Party and its two political allies, the
Social Democratic Party and New Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
The body would finalize draft plans on reform to be formed into
a bill for submission to an ordinary Diet (parliament) session
starting in January 1997. The reform plans should be fully
implemented within five years of the bill becoming law, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new government would also reform the Bank of Japan and the
Finance Ministry, Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Hashimoto was hoping to remove the influence of
bureaucrats in policy-making through the reorganization of
government ministries and agencies.
</P>
<P>
Asked about China relations, Hashimoto said: "Promoting
Japan-China ties is vital for the prosperity of the whole
Asia-Pacific region, as well as of the international community."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to support China's reform and open-door
policy. We will maintain our efforts to help China speedily join
the World Trade Organization so that there can be more cooperation
between China and the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Japan-United States relations, the prime minister promised
to make efforts to work out a formal decision with the United
States at the end of this month on the streamlining of the
U.S. military presence in the Okinawa Prefecture.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 8 (Xinhua) -- An advance force of United
States peacekeepers from Bosnia Thursday reached a U.S. military
base in Hungary, signalling the beginning of a large-scale
withdrawal of troops from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,400 out of the 15,000-strong U.S. force serving in
Bosnia, part of the NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR),

alliance was created, and the Americans make up the largest
national contingent.
</P>
<P>
About 60,000 international peacekeepers were stationed in
Bosnia after the warring parties signed a peace accord last
December, ending a war of almost four years.

<HEADLINE> Unique Stamp Sold for Record 2.3 Million Dollars (Corrected With Price) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A single postage stamp issued in
1855 was sold at public auction today, for a record 2.875 million
Swiss francs (2.26 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The record price paid for the "Treskilling Yellow" stamp almost
doubled the sum it fetched at another auction six years ago.
</P>
<P>
The stamp is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as
the most valuable object of any type by weight, volume and density.
</P>
<P>
It changed hands among collectors since first auctioned in
1885. It was last sold in May 1990 for 1.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Geneva-based Irish auctioneer David Feldman, who made the last
sale, also conducted Friday's sale at a Zurich hotel. Bidding
started at 900,000 Swiss francs (709,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Friday's buyer was a Stockholm-based stamp dealer, acting for
an unnamed private client.
</P>
<P>
The world's most precious postage stamp was found by a Swedish
schoolboy, Georg Backman, in a drawer at his grandmother's house
in 1885.
</P>
<P>
It is the only yellow version of an 1855 three-shilling issue,
Sweden's first postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
All others that have survived the wear and tear are green, and
for many years the yellow one was believed to be a fake until
scientific tests proved otherwise in the 1970s.

will provide a powerful guarantee for Hong Kong's stable
transition, adding that he was fully confident that Hong Kong's
future will be bright.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks in Pudong New
Area of Shanghai will be allowed to handle business in Chinese
currency on a trial basis within this year.
</P>
<P>
Xu Kuangdi, Mayor of Shanghai, disclosed this at an

According to Mayor Xu, China's central government has empowered

policies, Pudong is allowed to open its foreign trade market to
domestic areas, and gradually open foreign trade market to foreign
businesses, open its financial market to foreign businesses to an
appropriate extent, and start all commercial activities, except
retail sales, in its Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone.
</P>
<P>
The mayor explained that in the first five years of the 1990s,
Pudong's development focused on the construction of infrastructure
facilities, and in the later five years, the development is
concentrating on multiple functions, including finance, trade and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, other provinces,
municipalities, autonomous regions and central government
departments, have initiated 46 new foreign trade companies in
Pudong, bringing the total number to 58.
</P>
<P>
Overseas banks and financial organizations have also set up 192
representative offices in Shanghai, with the total assets reaching
13.1 billion U.S. dollars. Some 41 of them have started to earn
profits one or two years ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, a dozen overseas financial organizations have applied
for establishing their sub-branches in Pudong.
Meanwhile, many trans-national corporations have also prepared to
shift their regional headquarters to Pudong. This is in the wake
of the decision by the Yaohan Group of Japan, which took lead by
moving its regional headquarters to Pudong New Area.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 people from 90
countries are expected to participate the Cairo economic
conference to be opened Tuesday, according to conference
organizer the World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
Disclosing the figure in a statement today, WEF Chairman
M. Klaus Schwap said the participants' number has surpassed all
expectations.
</P>
<P>
He said the third economic conference for the Middle East and
North Africa will afford a unique opportunity to the world
community of businessmen to cooperate with the governments of the
region.
</P>
<P>
He added that positive interaction between governments and
businessmen, and the private sector to be represented by some
1,200 board chairmen of world and multinational companies, will
be a decisive factor that may ensure the success of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The number of participants at either the previous conferences
in Casablanca in 1994 and in Amman last year did not exceed 750.
The status of representations of big companies at the previous
conferences were much lower -- merely at advisers' level, noted
Schwap.
</P>
<P>
He also called for an appropriate atmosphere to push the
Middle East peace process forward so that the process of regional
cooperation may continue.
</P>
<P>
He spelled out the necessity of continued reconciliation
efforts to enhance confidence among world businessmen who are
coming to invest in the region.
</P>
<P>
Schwap added that several countries are already requesting to
host the economic conference of 1998, including Tunisia and
Turkey. Qatar will be hosting the coming conference of 1997.

BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, vice chairman of
the Central Military Commission, told visiting Bangladesh Chief of
Staff of the army Mahbubur Rahman here today that China is an "all
weather" friend of Bangladesh, and in spite of dramatic changes in
the world, the deep-rooted friendship between the two countries
has remained strong.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also a state councillor and defense minister, said he
believes that Mahbubur's current China tour will help promote the
progress of friendly cooperation between the two countries and
their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Bangladesh strongly oppose hegemonism and power
politics, and agree that the so-called "China threat" advocated by
some western countries is totally groundless, Chi reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Chi also briefed the guests on the achievements China has made
in its reform as well as the construction of the army.
</P>
<P>
Mahbubur said that China and Bangladesh and their armed forces
have always maintained good cooperative ties, expressing the hope
that the relationship would be further developed.
</P>
<P>
Mahbubur also conveyed Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina's kind regards to Chi.

<HEADLINE> Sino-ROK Joint-Venture in Shandong Prosperous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-ROK joint-venture to
produce ceramics in east China's Shandong Province has developed
rapidly over the past three years, ranking first in the country's
dishware industry.
</P>
<P>
The Weifang Meilin Ceramics Co., Ltd. is located in Weifang
City, which is known for its handcrafted kite. It was set up in
1992 by the Weifang Ceramics Factory in Shandong and the Sakyin
Group Company in the Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the company recorded a sales volume of 53.4 million
yuan, and 14 million yuan profits and taxes, 37 percent and 64
percent higher than in 1994, respectively.
</P>
<P>
To promote production and occupy markets, the factory mapped
out a plan in the early 1990s to attract foreign funds for new
equipment and technological development.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Weifang used 2.5 million US dollars from the
Australian government to buy advanced equipment, which helped it
increase the production ability from 400,000 sets of dishwares to
700,000 sets high grade dishwares a year.
</P>
<P>
To date, the factory and the joint-venture can produce a total
of 1.25 million sets of dishwares, which are exported to Japan,
ROK, Russia, and Singapore, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan
regions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, two more joint-ventures were recently established
by the factory and foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Unique Stamp Sold for Record 2.3 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A single postage stamp issued in
1855 was sold at public auction today, for a record 2.875 Swiss
francs (2.26 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The record price paid for the "Treskilling Yellow" stamp almost
doubled the sum it fetched at another auction six years ago.
</P>
<P>
The stamp is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as
the most valuable object of any type by weight, volume and density.
</P>
<P>
It changed hands among collectors since first auctioned in
1885. It was last sold in May 1990 for 1.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Geneva-based Irish auctioneer David Feldman, who made the last
sale, also conducted Friday's sale at a Zurich hotel. Bidding
started at 900,000 Swiss francs (709,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Friday's buyer was a Stockholm-based stamp dealer, acting for
an unnamed private client.
</P>
<P>
The world's most precious postage stamp was found by a Swedish
schoolboy, Georg Backman, in a drawer at his grandmother's house
in 1885.
</P>
<P>
It is the only yellow version of an 1855 three-shilling issue,
Sweden's first postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
All others that have survived the wear and tear are green, and
for many years the yellow one was believed to be a fake until
scientific tests proved otherwise in the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Official: Israel's Mideast Policy Harms Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Middle East policy has
an adverse impact on regional economic cooperation, a senior
Egyptian official said on eve of a large regional economic
conference.
</P>
<P>
As many as 88 countries from all over the world and 56
international and regional organizations will participate in the
third economic conference for the Middle East and North Africa due
to take place in Cairo from November 12 to 14.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua Thursday, the Assistant
Coordinator of the Conference Ahmed Abul Kheir said the prevailing
climate of the Cairo economic conference is different from those
that prevailed the previous Casablanca conference in 1994 and the
Amman conference in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The political climate in the Middle East region has changed
since the Likud bloc assumed power in Israel and began to pursue
intransigent policies against the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Such Israeli policies would render regional economic
cooperations doubtful and uneasy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon will boycott the conference because they
entertain the view that unless peace is achieved in the Middle
East they cannot take part in any conference or be party to
regional cooperation that embraces Israel.
</P>
<P>
The official added that Libya, Iraq, Sudan and Iran will not
attend the conference as they were not invited.
</P>
<P>
On the future of economic cooperation between the Arab states
and Israel, Abul Kheir said it hinges upon progress in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the topics for discussion at the
conference are numerous and diversified, all of which are related
to economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Abul Kheir said the Cairo conference will listen to follow-up
reports on three regional establishments -- a bank, a tourism
organization and a business council -- which were approved at last
year's Amman conference.
</P>
<P>
It will then discuss the executive mechanisms for the Middle
East Bank for Cooperation and Development to be seated in Cairo,
the Tourism and Travel Agents Organization in Tunis, and the
Businessmen Council in Amman,
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Bank whose capital has been fixed at five
billion dollars to be shared by 18 countries, the Egyptian
official said that no country has so far signed the basic statutes
of the Bank. They are awaiting the United States, the largest
financier of the Bank which is to contribute 21 percent of the
paid capital.

<HEADLINE> Former Indian PM Rao Gets Bail in Criminal Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- India's former prime minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao today got an anticipatory bail in the bribery
case of four MPs and an interim bail in the St. Kitts forgery
case.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi High Court granted Rao anticipatory bail till
November 20 in the 35 million rupees (1.17 million US dollars )
bribery case. A division bench in the court directed that in the
event of arrest of Mr. Rao either by the police or by the trial
court, the accused would be released on a personal bond of 100,000
rupees (3,003 US dollars) and a surety in the like amount.
</P>
<P>
Rao, who has already got bail in the Pathak cheating case, has
been summoned to appear before the trial court in the bribery case
on November 13.
</P>
<P>
Rao with other former ministers had reportedly bribed four MPs
in 1993 to secure their vote in favor of the Rao government facing
no-confidence motion tabled by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Delhi High Court today granted Rao an
interim bail in the St. Kitts forgery case. Justice Mahajan
reserved the final order on the bail application of Rao after
hearing the Central Bureau of Investigation counsel on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Prem Kumal rejected the bail
application of Rao on November 5 and directed him to surrender
before his court on or before November 14.

<HEADLINE> Airbus to Join China's 100-Seater Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The European consortium of
Airbus Industrie is to join China's program to develop a 100-seat
passenger jet, Xinhua is told on the on-going '96 China
International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in this booming
south China city.
</P>
<P>
Sources with both the Aviation Industries of China (AVIC) and
Airbus Industrie have confirmed that talks are underway for the
latter's participation in the AE100 program, presently a joint
program between the Aviation Industries of China, Aero
International Asia (AIA) and Singapore Technologies Pri. Co.(STPL)
</P>
<P>
AVIC President Zhu Yuli said the Chinese side anticipates
Airbus Industrie's joining the program, and he was "quite
optimistic" on the prospects of the two sides joining hands in
the program with an estimated cost of 1.7 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
AIA, the European partner in the AE100 program, is a joint
venture between Alenia of Italy, and two shareholding companies
in the consortium - Aerospatiale of France and British
Aerospace. At present, the three partners in the AE100 plan have
agreed on the share pattern of China with 46 percent, AIA with 39
percent, and STPL with 15 percent, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The president asserted that Airbus's participation will not
change the agreed share pattern.
</P>
<P>
Designating the program as a strategic step in the development
plan for its commercial aircraft manufacturing industrial, China
has insisted on a leading role in the joint program, including
being the biggest shareholder and the final assembly line of the
plane being located in China.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Rue, President of Airbus Industrie China, called the
Chinese side's desire to see this program part of the Airbus
family "a significant vote of confidence" in the consortium's
strength as a leader in both international lab industrial
programs, and marketing and product support.
</P>
<P>
All the partners of both Airbus and AIA have agreed that "a
suitable mechanism should be found inside Europe to allow this to
go ahead," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tang Xiaoping, director of AVIC's International Cooperation and
Trade Department, confirmed that the future AE100 passenger jet
will be aimed at both the domestic and the international markets,
and Airbus' advanced manufacturing technologies and mature
marketing system will help enhance the competitiveness of the new
plane.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese and the European sides have concurred that
AE100 planes and the Airbus family will overlap only to a small
extent. A319, at present the smallest one in the Airbus family,
has 134 seats, while the biggest of the AE100 family is expected
to have 137 seats.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA), one of the two
bigger shareholders in Airbus Industrie, has played some role in
bring about the consortium's imminent participation in the
program. From the very start, DASA had been vying with industrial
giants such as Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Aerospatiale to be
the western partner in the program.
</P>
<P>
The German company's official stand is that "participation in
China's 100-passenger regional airliner is a major goal of
Daimler-Benz Aerospace", and its chief Manfred Bischoff holds the
100-seater can only be successful if allied to Airbus.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts predict that the world market will have the
demand of 3,000 passenger jets from now to the year 2002, and
about one third of those new planes will be 100-seaters.
</P>
<P>
Faced with such an alluring prospect, the world's leading
aircraft manufacturers are all developing new generations of
100-seat jets, including Boeing 737-700 and MD-95, and major
aircraft engine companies such as CFM International BMW-Rolls
Royce and Pratt &AMP; Whitney, and others focusing on production of
aircraft parts and components are also developing products
suitable for the new 100-seaters.

<P>
Beijing, November 8 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily will tomorrow
carry a speech made by Jiang Zemin at a municipal fire prevention
conference in Shanghai on October 13, 1986, when he was the city's
mayor.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that all people, cadres in particular, must place
the greatest importance on fire prevention. "The responsibility is
weightier than Mount Tai," he stressed, calling it a very
important link in economic development, and pointing to hidden
dangers that are more dangerous than fires that can be seen.
</P>
<P>
He said that dangers are hidden in such places as the idea of
leaving things to chance and in backward fire-fighting facilities.
</P>
<P>
Fire prevention is much more important than disaster relief, he
said, and "Fighting fires has produced many heroes and heroic
deeds, but still we must admit that a fire is a bad thing."
</P>
<P>
A practical managerial system must be worked out by various
units and must be put into practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because winter is coming, the possibility of fires will grow,
he said, expressing the hope that the meeting will promote
fire-prevention measures.
</P>
<P>
A fire awareness promotion campaign is usually carried out
throughout China when winter comes.

<HEADLINE> Air Sports Club to be Founded in Zhuhai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- An international air sports club
is to be established in Zhuhai, a city in the booming Pearl River
Delta in south China's Guangdong province where China's first
international aviation and aerospace show is in progress.
</P>
<P>
The air sports club jointly run by Zhuhai city and the Sports
Aviation Association of China will be built into the largest air
sports base region-wide and then country-wide, said Jiang
Qionghui, head of the preparatory committee of the club.
</P>
<P>
Ten trainer planes, including China-made ones and the K8
trainers jointly developed by China and Pakistan, will be used in
the club, and more light aircraft such as the China-made AD,
according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said the club will also train pilots in accordance with
standards issued by the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC), and licenses will be granted to those qualified.
</P>
<P>
Air sports started in China with training of light aircraft
pilots in the 1950s. At present China has light aircraft pilot
training bases in the China Air Sports Club in Beijing, the Anyang
Air Sports School in Henan Province, and another air sports club
in Shenzhen adjacent Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Despite an air sports market with great potentials predicted,
the development of this market has been forestalled by lack of the
guarantee of relevant policies, laws and regulations, as well as
airfields, training opportunities and airspace.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the air traffic control departments of the
armed forces, the chief air traffic management authorities in
China, have voiced its support for the Zhuhai Air Sports Club,
and the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (SPCSC) is
formulating flying management measures for air sports clubs.
</P>
<P>
To create a favorable environment for development of flying
sports, the CAAC, SPCSC and the Aviation Industries of China are
demanding that airspace below 600 meters be open to public use.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that areas around Zhuhai provide big numbers of
air sports fans, and it is estimated that fans in Hong Kong, Macao
and the Pearl River Delta area alone are able to spend 100 million
yuan on air sports each year.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the establishment of the Zhuhai
International Air Sports Club is to greatly promote air sports in
the south China region, and Hong Kong and Macao.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Government Revises 1996 Growth Down to 6 Pc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
revised its 1996 economic growth forecast down to about six
percent and predicted that the 1997 growth will be in the range of
five to seven percent, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI)
said today.
</P>
<P>
In releasing the Third Quarter 1996 Economic Survey of
Singapore, the MTI said that it revised its 1996 growth forecast
to about six percent as overall economic growth of the country
weakened to 3.2 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
It said that there are some recent indications of a pick-up in
US semiconductor orders and demand for personal computers, which
suggests higher year-end festive demand. However, it said,
manufacturing performance is likely to remain weak in the fourth
quarter due to the high base last year.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors like construction and business services are
expected to remain healthy, it said. Given the 7.2 percent growth
in the first three quarters of the year and the prospects of the
fourth quarter, the MTI said the growth for the whole year of 1996
would be about six percent.
</P>
<P>
Market consensus suggests that global electronics demand will
be healthy in 1997. Therefore, the MTI's preliminary 1997 growth
forecast is in the range of five to seven percent, it said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Likely to Send Troops to Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said today that British troops may be sent to Zaire to help
the country ravaged by ethnic fighting and starvation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a BBC radio interview at an Anglo-French summit
in Bordeaux, France, Major said that he was not yet certain that
it was the right thing to do, but he added "I don't rule that out".
</P>
<P>
Major noted that there was no doubt that Britain would be
involved in the international relief action in Zaire, saying "it
is certainly possible".
</P>
<P>
"Clearly it would be desirable if there was a large contingent
of African troops," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that Britain may be involved in some way,
maybe it is logistic support. We would certainly be prepared to
play our part," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British prime minister stressed: "you can't just
send troops into the region without the consent of the people in
the region. So I think we have to approach this in the proper
manner."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that French President Jacques Chirac looked set
to persuade Major during the two-day summit to send British troops
as part of a 5,000 multinational force to Zaire.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Quotes Added Chinese President Meets With US Congressman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin met here
today with Bill Archer, the chairman of the US House of
Representatives' Ways and Means Committee. Archer is the first
member of US Congress to visit China since the US election.
</P>
<P>
In welcoming Archer, Jiang commented on the good opportunities
that exist for improvement in Sino-US relations, and said that the
two sides should make efforts to use these opportunities, to
increase contacts, expand cooperation, and deal with existing
problems to further develop bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang sent a letter of congratulations to President Clinton
shortly after the election, in which he expressed hope that during
his second term the two countries can, on the basis of the three
Sino-US communiques, and can "work together to bring healthy and
stable Sino-US relations into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that maintaining good relations is not
only in the interests of the two peoples but will also help
maintain stability and prosperity in the world and the
Asia-Pacific region in particular, and added that good Sino-US
relations will help the two countries contribute to a peaceful,
stable, and prosperous new century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that China has always placed
importance on Sino-US relations and has made an effort to improve
and develop them.
</P>
<P>
"I have noticed that developing Sino-US relations has become
the common goal of both the Republican and Democratic parties of
the United States," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In history, he pointed out, both political parties made
contributions to the development of Sino-US relations. The door to
Sino-US relations was opened under Republican President Richard
Nixon and the two countries established diplomatic ties when the
Democrat Jimmy Carter was in office.
</P>
<P>
Archer said he believes the results of the US presidential
election will not have an adverse influence on US-China relations,
and that either the US government or the Congress will continue to
support the development of US-China relations.
</P>
<P>
The United States and China share many common interests and the
two sides should make a joint effort to build a closer
relationship, although differences between the two countries still
exist, Archer said.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, he said, he has
always called for further expansion of economic and trade ties
between the US and China, greater support for China's entering the
World Trade Organization, and granting China permanent
most-favored-nation trade status, and added that he will continue
to work for these ends.
</P>
<P>
Archer arrived here today at the invitation of the Chinese
People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shuqing, president of the Chinese People's Institute of
Foreign affairs, was present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Prime Minister on Boycott to Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Zairean Prime Minister Kengo
wa Dondo explained that the Boycott of the regional summit on
eastern Zaire's crisis by his government was sanctioned by a
legislative session, the "Daily Nation" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a fax statement addressed to Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi who chaired the summit, the Zairean leader said that any
negotiation about the insecurity in the Great Lakes region should
be tied to the withdrawal of foreign troops from its territory.
</P>
<P>
Though Zaire did not attend the summit which sought to find a
peaceful solution to the crisis in eastern Zaire, he appreciated
President Moi's concern to safeguard peace and stability in his
country.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka yesterday said that it
was an erroneous impression that Zaire's absence at the summit
was a protest against the summit.
</P>
<P>
A decision made at the Nairobi summit urged the United Nations
to send a peace-keeping neutral force to protect over one million
refugees in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko of
Zaire endorsed proposals for a multi-national force to bring
relief to the stranded refugees and help them return to Rwanda
and Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Urban Life Now Part Of Shanghai Farmers' Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Computers, art works and safes
that began to be popular among China's rich urban a few years ago,
have begun making their way to rich farmers' doors in suburban
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"Computer fever" has begun to hit suburban areas, said Xing
Chunlu, a general manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Great Wall
Computer Corporation Group, one of China's major computer
companies.
</P>
<P>
Xing says that the number of computers he's sold to suburban
customers is several times what it was last year, and many buyers
are farmers. In Chunshen Village in Songjiang County, over 100
households have bought computers.
</P>
<P>
He Deming, the village's party secretary, says that children in
rural areas need to learn to use computers in urban areas, and the
village itself has automated its administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
In the past, collecting things was the pastime of urban
dwellers, but many farmers are now interested in collecting
things, such as stamps, paintings, antiques, newspapers, and even
waterwheels, windwheels, rushes and bamboo hats.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement in their standard of living, the farmers
have even begun to install safes in their houses. One department
store in Songjiang County sold 15 strongboxes in one week. Farmers
use them for large sum of cash, bonds, contracts and gold.
</P>
<P>
In the past, only urban households hired maids, but today, many
farmers are hiring them.
</P>
<P>
Wang Longsheng, a farmer in Sanjiaoyang Village in Fengxian
County, used 200 yuan (25 U.S. dollars) to hire a baby sitter to
look after his child, while he sells clothes, earning much more
than that small amount.
</P>
<P>
Many other rural households use laborers to do their laundry,
cooking, taking their children to and from school, and looking
after the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai farmers also no larger drink river or well water,
since 99.5 percent of the rural households have tap water, and
some have even gotten water suppliers to bring bottled water to
their homes for drinking and cooking with.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Growth Rate Down to 3.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economic growth
declined further to 3.2 percent in the third quarter from the 7.5
percent level a quarter ago, as a result of the sustained
moderation in the world electronics demand, the Ministry of Trade
and Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
In releasing the Third quarter 1996 Economic Survey of
Singapore, the ministry noted that regional economies had also
slowed down as they were similarly affected by the global
electronics downturn.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said on Thursday night that the
current economic slowdown was no cause for alarm as the country's
economy "is fundamentally sound."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that he was confident that growth would
be healthy next year and that Singapore should still be able to
achieve a steady growth rate of six to eight percent in the medium
term.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released by the Ministry of Trade and
Industry, the manufacturing sector fell by 4.3 percent compared
with a 6.5 percent growth a quarter ago, while the major
non-electronics industries also performed weakly due to a mixture
of cyclical and industry-specific factors.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the global marine industry remained weak,
while the petroleum products and petrochemicals industries were
affected by both maintenance shutdowns and keen competitions, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The financial and business services sector grew more slowly at
6.6 percent and growth in the financial services sub-sector
remained moderate at 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that this was due to sluggish performance in
the stockbroking industry as sentiments remained weak due to the
economic slowdown and uncertainty over US interest rates, as well
as slower growth in domestic banking loans.
</P>
<P>
As the transport and communications sector grew more slowly at
6.2 percent and the commerce sector at a weak rate of 2.7 percent,
the growth in the construction sector remained healthy at 14
percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's survey showed that the growth in the
construction sector was driven mainly by the residential and civil
engineering segments which accounted for 62 percent of total
certified payments in the quarter.

<HEADLINE> Some 100 Million Kg Of Chinese Cabbage For Beijing 's Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The capital of China has 105
million kilograms of Chinese cabbage available for the city's
residents during the traditional sales peak, which started last
Friday and ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This figure exceeded the municipal government's plan for the
period. The rural area is expected to supply 210 million kilograms
of cabbage for the winter season, up through February.
</P>
<P>
The city has set up more than 200 sales center in each of its
18 districts and counties to provide this favorite vegetable at
discount prices, which are subsidized by the government.
</P>
<P>
It has been a long tradition for urban residents in Beijing and
other northern cities to store the cheap cabbage at home to eat
during the winter time, and the mountains of cabbage and long
queues of people are a familiar sight on Beijing streets.
</P>
<P>
Although dependence on cabbage has dropped significantly in
recent years because of a more diverse supply of vegetables and an
improvement in the people's standard of living, but the humble
cabbage remains one winter staple in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that local cabbage output is expected to drop
by 20 percent this year because of natural conditions. In 1989, it
produced a record 700 million kilograms, but since that time,
production has dropped annually.

<HEADLINE> World Oil Demand to Remain strong, Says OAPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The world oil demand will
remain strong in 1997 and beyond and this necessitates a growth of
oil producing capacity for the Organization of Arab Oil Exporting
countries (OAPEC), said a latest study by the Kuwait-based
organization.
</P>
<P>
The study said the demand is expected to go up by 1.7
million barrels per day (BPD) to reach 73.2 million BPD in
1997 with the main part of it going to the developing
countries which would import an additional amount of 1.1 million
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Demand of the OAPEC oil has slightly grown since the beginning
of this year thanks to the unusual cold weather in the northern
hemisphere, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The faster pace widely predicted for international economic
development next year would also contribute to the oil demand
growth trend, the study added.
</P>
<P>
A separate quarterly issue published by the OAPEC earlier this
year said the oil consumption growth in the Asia-Pacific region
will continue to be robust over the next decade while demand of
the industrial countries would also go up.
</P>
<P>
To meet the expected increase of world oil demand, Arab
oil-producing countries will need to invest over 139 billion
U.S. dollars by 2010 to expand their energy sector, according to
OAPEC sources.
</P>
<P>
They singled out the areas most likely to be expanded as oil
and gas exploration, existing field development, the improvement
of transport facilities for crude oil, gas and petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
Independent estimates have shown that three OAPEC major oil
producers Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates will
need to spend more than 50 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000
to expand their crude oil sectors.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has approved plans to develop its giant desert
Shaybah oil field to produce around 500,000 BPD and maintain the
Kingdom's aggregate output capacity at 10 million BPD by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the UAE both intend to raise capacity to over
3 million BPD from around 2.5 million BPD at present, while
Iraq said that it needs nearly 30 billion U.S. dollars to
nearly double its production capacity to 6 million BPD.
</P>
<P>
To secure technology and funds for projects to boost their
output capacity, the OAPEC oil producers are poised to readmit
foreign partners they ousted three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates has been opening its oil industry to
foreign partners while the Saudis are ready to follow suit. The
United Arab Emirates has retained foreign partners from Japan,
France and Britain which currently enjoy 40 percent share in its
energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Observers here indicated that the high oil prices since the
second quarter of this year would prompt the oil producing
countries to speed up their steps in tapping their oil production
potentialities.
</P>
<P>
The price of OPEC crude increased from 19.3 to 20 dollars per
barrel in July and August, a growth of 3.7 and four dollars over
the same period last year, according to the OAPEC study.
</P>
<P>
Proven crude oil reserves in the ten OAPEC countries totals
636.2 billion barrels, amounting to 60.84 percent of the total
world reserves, according to OAPEC data.
</P>
<P>
The OAPEC was established in 1968 with the aim of promoting
cooperation between the members and maintaining their oil
interests. It groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt, the United Arab
Emirates, Iraq, Bahrain, Libya, Algeria, Qatar and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Fishery Made Key Sector in Uganda's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Fishery has been playing a
important role in Uganda's national economy in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The fish export industry in Uganda has grown at a tremendous
rate. The country first exported its fish some six and a half
years ago, but now it has 13 fish processing factories with a
total of installed production capacity o 73,000 tons per year
These factories are also in charge of fish exportation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Uganda Export Promotion Council, the
country's fish exports rose by nearly 2,500 tons in 1995. Uganda
exported nearly 9300 tons of fish in 1995 compared with 6810 tons
in 1994. The council says that Uganda has earned 20 million U.S.
Dollars from fish exportation per year during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The estimated catch of fish from Ugandan fresh water bodies
has also increased from 213,000 tons worth 77 million Dollars in
1994 to 220,000 tons worth 110 million Dollars in 1995, according
to the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the catch increase, 50 percent of the country's
protein now comes from fish while the figure was much lower a few
years ago. In 1994, Uganda registered six percent of its gross
domestic product (GDP) from fisheries sector while the figure for
1995 rose to 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Uganda covers an area of 241,139 square kilomettres, 17
percent of which is fresh water bodies, that is 42,904.7 square
kilometres.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's fresh water bodies boast over 300 fish species which
also have a big potential for exports.
</P>
<P>
Fish farming is vigorously pursued in some 16 of the 39
districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
Out of the fish production in 199, about 180 tons worth
60,000 Dollars were from fish farming activities. About 3,000
ponds were utilized by an estimated 1,230 farmers whose
activities are backed by an increase in fish fry poduction in the
breeding centres in some districts.
</P>
<P>
In this endeavour, the Uganda Coopertion Fishing Union which
has 30 registered societies with 50 members each has recently
made plans to build 1,000 more fish ponds in the country's
districts.
</P>
<P>
However, the industry is also affected by fishing malpractices
including exploitation of immature fish, use of illegal fishing
methods and gears and water hyacinth which covers all bays of
Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga, River Nile in Uganda and, to a small
extent, Lake Albert, which are all leading to the extinction of
some species.
</P>
<P>
Ksuch practices and water hyacinth have affected 60,000 people
directly employed in the industry and 500,000 others indirectly
involved in the sector.
</P>
<P>
In order to expand fishing production, theUugandaCooperative
Fishing Union last month held a fisheries show and trade fair
here in a bid to restore fish through improved methods and better
technology.
</P>
<P>
Fishing industry in the country has once experienced losses of
about 25 percent of the total production. This loss can be
reduced to less than 10 percent by improvement in extensive
delivery to fishermen and fish processors.
</P>
<P>
Early this year the Uganda anti-smuggling unit impounded 180
fishing nets on Lake Victoria because fishmen used these nets to
catch immature fish, actually their behaviour impairs economic
growth in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are still 2,900 illegal nets on
Uganda's big lakes such as Victoria, Albert and Kyoga, which are
denying the nation of revenue. It is estimated that one illegal
beach net causes a loss of 30,000 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
On fight against water hyacinth, the Ugandan government has
since 1995 deployed several floating weed harvesters on lakes
of Victoria, Kyoga, Albert and the Albert-River Nile water way.
</P>
<P>
In late February 1995, the government made the decision: where
the weed proves stubborn, chemicals are needed to be applied.

<HEADLINE> Israel Ready to Sponsor Courses for Tanzanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel plans to sponsor
courses to be taken in Israel next year by about 30 Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
The official "Daily News" today quoted the Second Secretary of
the Embassy of Israel, Janathan Meidan, as saying that his
country had various advanced short courses to offer to
Tanzanians, especially in agriculture, labour and co-operative
studies.
</P>
<P>
Meidan, who is based in Nairobi, Kenya, told the newspaper
here on Thursday, "we are committed to helping developing
countries in various fields they feel they are lagging behind."
</P>
<P>
He said the short term courses offered by his country were
open even to private entrepreneurs and Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs) only if they applied for them.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli diplomat said 16 Tanzanians were in Israel last year
undertaking various courses while his country plans to have 23 people
from Tanzania this year.
</P>
<P>
The number of Tanzanians sponsored by his country for studies
in Israel was smaller than that from Kenya which sends about 90
people every year, according to the Israeli diplomat.
</P>
<P>
He explained this was because Israel had diplomatic ties with
Kenya for a longer time than with Tanzania, which severed
relations with Isreal about 30 years ago but restored them only
two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Negotiates Oil Exploration Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
entered new negotiations with three companies on the exploration
of oil in the Lake Albert region, reported the local daily "the
Monitor" today.
</P>
<P>
These companies include TDC Energy and Azania House from the
United States and Heritage Oil and Gas of Britain.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the actions taken by the Ugandan government to
continue its efforts to explore for oil after Jerry J. Ward, an
American investor fooled Ugandan top government officials and
swindled 190,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ward entered into a 20 million Dollar contract with the
Ugandan government for oil exploration in the Lake Albert region
early last year.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has been hunting for Ward and is hiring
an international law firm to bring him to book.
</P>
<P>
On March 20, 1991, the Ugandan government signed a contract with
Petrofina, a Belgian company for petroleum exploration on Lake
Albert. The Belgian company abandoned the work in 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Brand-name goods produced in
China are still popular in Shanghai, China's largest economic
center, in spite of the large number of foreign brands, a recent
market survey has shown.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, Shanghai Volkswagen, which produced
170,000 Santana cars last year, has half of the domestic market,
which is covered with domestic steel products, washing machines,
refrigerators and garments.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the Industrial Economic Research
Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Economic and Trade Commission
and the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Economic Society.
</P>
<P>
It showed that foreign items, such as color televisions,
air-conditioners, video recorders and cameras, as well as soft
drinks, cosmetics and food have a large share of the Shanghai
market.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zhiyi, president of the Shanghai Municipal Economic and
Trade Commission, says that the proportion of well-known foreign
brands on Shanghai's shelves is still small, and many
foreign-funded enterprises produce products under a Chinese
label.

<HEADLINE> Disney Fights Against Piracy in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Disneyland
corperation will pump one million U.S. dollars in its fight
against counterfeiting of its watches in Saudi Arabia next year,
according to Saudi daily Arab News.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday publication of the paper available here today
quoted a local trading company General Manager Hussain Al-Bayouk
as saying that "fake Disney watches are being sold at prices
which are 75 percent cheaper than the original brand," thus
causing the corporation a loss of nearly 80 percent of its market
share to the pirates.
</P>
<P>
The manager said the fake watches, coming mainly from the Far
East, which closely resemble the original brand and are being
palmed off at cut-throat prices to the unwary customer.
</P>
<P>
He said the local agents are selling these fake products
without any license from Disney.
</P>
<P>
He said the Disney Corporation is not the only sufferer and
mentioned without naming a well-known Swiss watch which is being
sold for 80 Saudi Riyals (21 U.S. dollars) against the original
price of 14,000 to 16,000 Saudi Riyals (3,733 to 4,266
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Disney's market share in the Gulf Cooperation Council
countries including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar currently stands at 80 million
U.S. dollars annually.

<HEADLINE> Former Thai PM Calls for Ensuring Safety of Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Thai prime minister
Chatichai Choonhavan has demanded the government to take action to
ensure the safety of campaigning candidates and canvassers.
</P>
<P>
Chatichai, who is leader of the Chart Pattana (national
development) Party, said on Thursday that the government,
especially the Interior Minister (Banharn Silpa-Archa), should be
held responsible for the murder of a canvasser for his party in
the eastern province of Chachoengsao, 80 kilometers east of
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Chong Pumpradab, a provincial councilor and canvasser for a
Chart Pattana Party candidate in the province, was killed on
Wednesday night after gunmen opened fire on the stage during a
campaigning rally. Five others were also injured.
</P>
<P>
The shooting demonstrated that politicians were "at war" and
not competing in an election, Chatichai said.
</P>
<P>
"The shooting occurred in front of 200 to 300 people. How can
candidates campaign when their lives are at risk?" Chatichai said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not safe," said Chatichai.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was sure the murder was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Since campaigning officially began three weeks ago, several
campaign-related killings have been reported throughout the
country and bullet-proof vests are in great demand, with their
sales rising sharply.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry has decided to set up an
operation center to curb violence in the run-up to the November 17
election.
</P>
<P>
Police nationwide have been ordered to remain on full alert
against acts of violence ahead of the election.

<HEADLINE> China Moves To Improve Health of Poor Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The system will be established across the country to guarantee
basic services for poor farmers at the lowest possible cost and to
reduce the number of poor farmers suffering from diseases, Cai
Renhua, director general of the Department of Health Policy and
Law under the Ministry of Public Health, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The system has proven very effective, but needs support from
the central and local governments," he noted. It is meant to curb
the rising health care costs, to relieve poor farmers of
medical burdens, to increase preventative health services, and to
provide the necessary health care.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign health-care specialists attending a
national symposium on health policy and management in
poverty-stricken rural areas, have suggested that a national
program on rural development and poverty alleviation includes a
rural health care plan for poor areas.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the government to spend more money on health
care and provide economic support for poor farmers suffering from
diseases.
</P>
<P>
A health-care study in three poverty-stricken counties in
western China showed that the government accounts for 50 percent
of health-care funds for poor areas, while individual spending
accounts for 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Because the local economy is underdeveloped, it is difficult
for local governments to put more funds into health care for
farmers or for them to raise money themselves, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Poverty relief and other special funds provided by the
central government are often used for special development
projects.
</P>
<P>
According to Cai, the rural health care reform is not meant to
increase the number of doctors and nurses, but to change the the
existing system's methods of raising and allocating money to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of rural medical services.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need of shifting existing health care
services paid for by farmers to a community or township
cooperative health care system, he explained.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Thai Mystery Group Calls for Politicians' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Mysterious "friends of OR
group" posters have appeared in Bangkok streets and no one seems
to know what or who the Thai letter "OR" in the name stands for.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 yellow campaign posters and banners, carrying a
terse message "let OR get in too", have been placed throughout the
capital of Thailand since late October.
</P>
<P>
The Thai letter "OR" is often transcribed into the English
letter "a".
</P>
<P>
Passers-by are wondering that the posters might have been put
up by supporters of certain politicians whose names begin with the
letter "OR", or "a" in their English spellings, such as former
prime minister Anand Panyarachun, caretaker deputy prime minister
Amnuay Virawan, or some less-known candidates running for the
November 17 general election.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the letter represents, the posters are so perplexing
that even Governor of Bangkok Bhichit Rattakul failed to make out
what it meant and ordered the posters be taken down.
</P>
<P>
The mystery was not unraveled until Thursday noon when AIDS
activists showed up at a rally in Silom road, a bustling
commercial and financial center, to claim that it was their
masterpiece, with the letter standing for "AIDS".
</P>
<P>
Jon Ungphakorn, chairman of "friends of OR group", a
non-governmental organization (NGO) on AIDS, said that the main
aim of their campaign was to urge politicians and future
government leaders to care for AIDS patients and solve the AIDS
problem in the country.
</P>
<P>
Jon said politicians must be "serious" about tackling AIDS and
related problems because they affect all sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
"The country's economy will definitely be affected if more
attention is not paid to the AIDS problem because most people
infested with the disease are of working age," he said.
</P>
<P>
Members of the group, wearing yellow T-shirts bearing their
logo, distributed leaflets explaining the intention behind their
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The leaflets said many more people die of AIDS than as a result
of accidents.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the medication required for over 800,000
HIV-infected persons in the country who would one day develop
AIDS, something should also be done to support their families, the
leaflets said.
</P>
<P>
During a short distance march, group members shouted slogans
demanding attention and action from the government.
</P>
<P>
Before the group announced itself at the rally, a large crowd
gathered around, but after the group identified itself with a
cause for AIDS sufferers, they soon dispersed, feeling
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
However, the group's concern did receive support from a Palang
Dharma (virtue force) Party candidate who happened to be
campaigning at that time in the area, Orathai Kanchanachusak,
whose name begins with an "or".

CANBERRA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar became
slightly firmer against the U.S. dollar today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was traded at 78.38 U.S. cents on the
close from 78.34 U.S. cents on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local traders said the Australian dollar spent the day
consolidating at the present level. They expected the local
currency to drop to below 78 U.S. cents in the short term due to
big sale orders from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 87.85 yen against the Japanese
currency from 87.95 yen yesterday. It was still under the pressure
of a weakening U.S. dollar against the yen.

<P>
The Australian dollar was traded firmer against the German mark
at 1.1860 marks from 1.1773 marks.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Successful in Reducing Infant Mortality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has made
significant strides in improving lives of under five children by
reducing infant mortality from 191 per 1,000 live birth in 1988
to 159 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Country
Representative, Agness Akosua Aidoo, said here on Thursday that
Tanzania, through the government, communities and individuals,
had managed to improve the welfare of children in many areas.
</P>
<P>
This was in response to the UN Data from mid-decade reviews
made last September to review progress made since the 1990 World
Summit for Children held in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Summit, attended by 71 heads of state and government,
adopted a set of goals for children to be achieved by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Aidoo said Tanzania had also recorded achievements in reducing
malnutrition among children.
</P>
<P>
"While in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia the number of
malnourished children is rising, in Tanzania severe malnutrition has
been reduced by 60 percent and moderate malnutrition by 40 percent
among more than one million children in 60 districts of the country
covered by the UNICEF-supported Child Survival, Protection and
Development (CSPD) program," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The number of measles cases dropped from 33,000 in 1984 to 3,558 in
1994 and the number of measles deaths from 2,800 to 88 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The statement praised Tanzania as the first country in eastern
and southern Africa to meet the mid-decade coverage goal for salt
iodation.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF representative said in the statement that access to safe
drinking water had increased to 70 percent and traditional sanitation
facilities by 90 percent.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian General Urges Israel To Talk on Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian officer
Thursday called on Israel to break a two-year-old logjam in
Middle East arms control negotiations by agreeing to discuss
nuclear disarmament, reported the Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Major General Marouf Bakhit Nader, a member of the Jordanian
General Staff of the Jordanian armed forces, said Israel cannot
achieve security in the region by refusing to discuss Israel's
alleged nuclear arsenal. The Arabs believe that Israel possesses
some 200 atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
"The Arabs perceive that Israel's refusal to sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) now or at any time is an attempt
to maintain their strength over the Arab states," Nader told a
conference on "War in a Changing World," held at Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nader, also the highest-ranking military officer in the
Jordanian delegation to the multilateral arms control talks which
were suspended two years ago, said Jordan wants the talks to
continue despite Arab's differences with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which has pledged to observe the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons, has said it will not discuss
nuclear issues until all the states in the region, including
Iran and Iraq, sign peace treaties.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the then prime minister Shimon Peres said Israel
would agree to start nuclear disarmament talks two years after
the conclusion of a comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Peres's view, Nader said "We don't need to spend so
much time to decide whether the peripheral states (Iran and Iraq)
are so relevant."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Avows No Give-in to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government last
night continued to accuse striking health workers of being
"irresponsible", warning that appropriate act would be taken
against them.
</P>
<P>
Acting public service, labour and social welfare minister
Nathan Shamuyarira, who has already fired some 700 nurses and a
few doctors for being involved in the strike, said the industrial
action was illegal and no negotiations would be possible under
such circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"The government is conscious and aware of the hardship on the
ordinary people and this is because of the action of some few
doctors and nurses who deserted their professional ethics," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are standing firm on our principles that doctors and
nurses should not use the strike as a weapon. That door is closed
and it is not going to be useful because they will get nothing in
the area of the strike," he added.
</P>
<P>
The nurses have been on strike for 18 days now and were joined by
junior doctors, therapists and senior consultants after police
arrested two doctors on charges of inciting the strike by nurses and
contravening sections of the law and order act.
</P>
<P>
The nurses are pressing for increased night allowances and the
introduction of a risk allowance, while the doctors are demanding
better salaries and working conditions as well as the reinstatement
of fired nurses.
</P>
<P>
The strike has brought health delivery at a standstill with the
country's major referral centres in Harare, general hospitals in the
provinces and other public health centres unable to offer any
services.

<HEADLINE> 2 Western Countries Accused of Discrediting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's ruling party, the
Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD), has charged two western
countries for scheming to discredit the presidential and
parliamentary elections scheduled for November 18 in Zambia, the
"Times of Zambia" reported today.
</P>
<P>
MMD campaign committee publicity chairman Vernon Mwaanga
disclosed in Lusaka on Thursday that the two western countries
have offered huge sums of money as rewards to established local
election monitors who have been asked to oversee the electoral
process at all costs and declare the poll result unfree and
unfare.
</P>
<P>
Mwaabga, however, declined to mention the names of the two
countries. He noted, "this is tantamount to interference in the
affairs of Zambia as a nation and greatly undermines the
integrity of some of our local monitors".
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has been disturbed by the finding and will
soon diplomatically complain to the two countrie, Mwaanga said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Astronomers To View Sun From Outer Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Astronomers are
co-operating with their German colleagues in implementing plans
for the world's largest solar telescope, a 1.2-ton model that is
one meter in diameter.
</P>
<P>
"A research report will be signed by the two sides soon, and
subject to government approval, involving 600 million yuan in
total investment, half from each side, will be put into the
project to get it to the design stage," sai Ai Guoxiang, a member
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the head of the project.
</P>
<P>
He explained that part of the project has already been carried
out for design and production of the telescope.
</P>
<P>
The telescope will be put in space in 2001 or 2002. It has 0.1
arc second of angular resolution, the same as the Hubble Space
Telescope.
</P>
<P>
"The Hubble telescope is useful for night astronomy (weak
light) and the solar telescope for daytime use (strong light). It
is significant for research on the impact of solar eruptions on
outer space and on man's environment," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was only after two major technological breakthroughs, the
solar magnetic field telescope and the multichannel solar
telescope, that it was possible to build the large solar
telescope. The largest land-based symmetrical solar telescope now
being built is 90 cm in diameter.
</P>
<P>
"The advantage of space astronomy lies in great wavelength,
continuous coverage, omni-directional observation, and avoiding
disturbances produced by the earth's atmosphere," Professor Ai
noted.
</P>
<P>
Next year will be a crucial year for the solar telescope
project, when an 80-cm-dia. solar telescope will be sent up as
high as 32 km in a hot air balloon to do tests for the outer space
telescope.

CHENGDU, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan, China's most populous
province, has turned out to be the province that has benefitted
most from World Bank loans in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province in southwest China leads other parts of China
in the number of World Bank-funded projects and size of loans,
with 42 projects in Sichuan receiving 2.4 billion US dollars worth
of loans from the bank.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the bank's loans to Sichuan, which is largely
agricultural and which has more than 100 million people, has been
used to support agricultural development and the alleviation of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The loans have been used in all of Sichuan's 83 poverty-ridden
counties, promoting the development of basic industries,
education, public health, and poverty reduction, a provincial
official said.
</P>
<P>
China joined the World Bank in 1980, and in the past four years
has been the bank's largest borrower. By July 10, the
international financial body had extended loans for 174 Chinese
projects, with committed lendings adding up to 25.2 billion US

NAIROBI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
imposed a ban on beef, milk and milk products from Europe and
cautioned the dairy farmers and traders against importing such
products with immediate effect, the "Kenya Times" newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Director of Veterinary Service R.S. Kimanzi
as saying yesterday that illegal import of beef, animal, milk and
milk products were on the increase in the east African country,
posing a major threat to its people and animals.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that import of such products was banned until a
further clarification on mad cow disease had been established.
</P>
<P>
Animals in Kenya were vulnerable to the mad cow disease
causing virus Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), the Kenyan
official added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kenya imposed a ban on the import of animal feed
which Kimanzi said contained bone tissues of animal carcasses.
</P>
<P>
The bone meal could be infected with BSE because of the
recycling process of animal carcasses, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Bringing China's River in the Air Down to Earth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China's most notorious waterway
is fast becoming known as the country's River in the Air.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tons of silt and debris have lifted middle and
lower reaches of the mighty Yellow River - causing a constant fear
among millions living in its shadow.
</P>
<P>
As dykes reach higher into the sky to hold back the elevated
river, the worry is that if the untamed Yellow River breaches its
man-made barrier it will engulf thousands of acres with a tidal
wave of disaster and tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Work is now well advanced on a multi-billion dollar dammed
reservoir in the upper reaches, where silt and deposits can be
trapped for 20 years, to enable Chinese experts to have enough
time to deal with the problem of rising dykes in the middle and
lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
The major means of controlling the river until now has been to
raise the height of the dykes along the river. But scientists say
they will not raise the dykes in an unlimited way because it would
leave a dangerous "skyrocket river" for coming generations.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River is China's second largest after the Yangtze
River, and known for containing the most silt and deposits in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Every year, the river carries 1.5 billion tons of silt, of
which one billion tons are washed to the sea and the rest
deposited in Henan and Shandong provinces in the lower reaches of
the river, forcing the river bed to rise steadily.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that the river bed in Shandong had risen by
eight to ten centimeters annually. It is four to six meters higher
than the land outside the dykes, and a dozen meters higher in
Kaifeng City, Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades and more, the Chinese Government has
organized massive manpower three times to reinforce the dykes.

<P>
Many people living alongside the path of the Yellow River still
worry about the threat of the river as it rises, along with its
ever growing dykes.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi Derong, senior engineer and Deputy Director of
the Shandong Yellow River Administrative Bureau, said that
scientists have succeeded in reducing by 300 million to 400
million tons, the amount of silt and deposits, by suspending and
transferring silt.
</P>
<P>
"The silt and deposits in the Yellow River mainly come from the
upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, where there is less
vegetation and severe soil erosion. The Chinese Government has
raised millions of US dollars to improve the soil conditions," Shi
explained.
</P>
<P>
While planting trees, shrubs and grass, people have also built
many dykes along the tributaries to stop soil and sand from being
washed into the river. They also have built large reservoirs to
deposit silt, and used water control projects to wash silt out to
the sea.
</P>
<P>
Shi expected that the massive Xiaoliangdi Water Control
Project, still under construction on the Yellow River in Henan
Province, has a designed storage capacity of 7.2 billion cubic
meters of silt. When it is completed by the end of this century,
it will be able to prevent the silt from being washed to the lower
reaches for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"This will offer a period for us to further study and curb the
silting problem in the river," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ministry of Water Resources has imported 100
large dredgers to remove silt and deposits from the river.

<HEADLINE> Jewell Asks for Retraction of "Libelous" News Articles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Richard Jewell, who had been
named suspect for the Olympic bombing but was cleared last month,
has given Atlanta's two daily newspapers one week to retract a
series of articles that he said were libelous.
</P>
<P>
Jewell attorney Lin Wood said in a letter that the Atlanta
Journal and the Atlanta Constitution should retract 20 "libelous"
statements in as conspicuous and public a manner as they first
appeared before the deadline of next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statements were excerpts from articles that ran in both
papers over a three-day period from July 30 to August 1 just after
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ridiculed, accused and
vilified an innocent man," Wood said in the letter addressed to
newspaper attorney Peter Canfield.
</P>
<P>
Jewell, 33, was working as a security guard near Centennial
Olympic Park on July 27 when he spotted a suspicious-looking green
knapsack.
</P>
<P>
He alerted police and helped to clear the area of
concert-goers. A bomb hidden in the knapsack exploded later,
killing two people and injured over 100 people.
</P>
<P>
Three days later an edition of the Atlanta Journal identified
him as one of the main suspects of the bomb investigation.
</P>
<P>
The FBI agents and some reporters watched his movement day and
night until the Justice Department publicly cleared him of
suspicion in the case last month.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Celebrates Its 65th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency celebrated
its 65th founding anniversary in its birthplace Ruijin on
Thursday, vowing to carry forth its fine tradition.
</P>
<P>
The news agency grew out of the Red China News Agency, which
released its first news story about the first National Congress of
the Chinese Soviet on November 7, 1931.
</P>
<P>
Ruijin, a small city in east China's Jiangxi Province, was the
headquarters of the Red Army in the 1930s. The Chinese Communist
Party created the news agency to let the outside world know about
its principles and activities, and to inspire its soldiers and the
people.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based agency now has thousands of clients
worldwide, and it is one of the most authoritative news organs in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Fan Xinde, a member of the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection of the Chinese Communist Party, said at a commemoration
meeting that Xinhua has always adhered to the Party spirit and the
principles of proletarian news reporting, and has been responsible
for both the Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Xinhua's merits and rules, such as
investigating facts by going deep into the realities of life, a
serious manner in covering news, a careful and precise working
style, tight working procedures and strict discipline, be held and
carried forth.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua set up a center for revolutionary history education in
Ruijin last year, and it has sent six groups of cadres to study
there. It also helped build a "Hope School" to aid children who
are too poor to go to school in the region.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A Malaysian court jailed a
60-year-old former national coach Friday for molesting two junior
athletes, according to a report from Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
Ramanathan Chelliah was sentenced to a total of eight years on
two charges of molesting the female athletes, then aged 15 and
16, in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
Ramanathan was jailed four years for each offence but will only
serve four years as the sentences are to run concurrently.
</P>
<P>
Sessions court judge Umi Kalthum Abdul Majid Friday said the
court viewed the offence as serious since Ramanathan, as the
coach who was entrusted with training the athletes, broke that
trust by taking advantage of two naive girls.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Before starting her studies in
biology at Tianjin Normal University, 22-year-old Pong Lijuan
never considered donating time to help the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Pong now joins her classmates on Saturdays to help an old
couple they call "Grandpa" and "Grandma" Wu, both over 70, who
live in Xinxing Street in the Heping District of Tianjin, north
China's largest port city.
</P>
<P>
For the past four years, the volunteer service group of young
people has assisted many elderly people, like the Wu's, with
housework and shopping, and easing the pangs of loneliness.
</P>
<P>
The helping-hand movement, which was initiated in the district
in 1988 with just a handful of people, has now grown into an army
of 50,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
"Through helping others, we've learned about the hardships of
life, and feel that we should show more consideration for the
whole society, instead of only for ourselves," Pong said.
</P>
<P>
Cao Dongmin, a male member of Pong's group, said many young
people would like to do more for society.
</P>
<P>
Today, the movement has spread to every corner and every sector
in this commercial center of the city, and some 500,000 residents
living in Heping try every way to help solve everyday problems
they encounter.
</P>
<P>
Wu Dehua, a cadre in the district, said, "Under the
circumstances of market economy, the contributing spirits are not
far away from the masses, instead, they are even closer."
</P>
<P>
Du Huoxian, 59, an ordinary woman, has successively won a
"model volunteer" title for three years. She has devoted all her
spare time to looking after older neighbors, free of charge.
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing nothing special, but offering them a helpful hand,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Widowed Sun Lanfang died at the age of 91. But the hospital had
never thought that there were so many people who had looked after
her.
</P>
<P>
"Sun was too old to take care of herself. But all her neighbors
came to help, and finally the woman died in peace. All this help
was given by those who are not her relatives," said one of her
neighbors during attending the funeral.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988 when the movement started, increasing number of
residents have joined volunteer service teams with their
expertise, including local officials and disabled persons.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the district elects ten model and capable officials,
and an insurance company donated one million yuan (one US dollar
equals 8.3 yuan) worth of insurance for them. And the district
cable television station broadcasts pictures of model volunteers
every evening.
</P>
<P>
When Gao Zhengshan, a neighborhood cadre, was hospitalized,
many people swarmed to the hospital to comfort him. Some of the
visitors were those who Gao had helped, but many more were unknown
to him.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jianguo, Chen Lihe and Yang Datong, all disabled people,
jointly run an electric applicance repairing service, and with the
help of the community, their business is booming. However, they go
onto the street to offer free services twice a month.
</P>
<P>
"Although we are disabled people, we can also serve the whole
society. In this community, we serve as both beneficiaries and
contributors," Yang Datong said.

<HEADLINE> Baby Girl Born in Sky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese baby has been born
with her head really in the clouds. The infant decided to make her
arrival thousands of meters high in the sky as expectant mom Yuan
Juan was aboard a domestic airline.
</P>
<P>
When the passengers realized that they had an extra passenger
aboard they burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
Yuan and her husband, Peng Shaoyun, who works with the Urumqi
Oil Transport Company, boarded the plane at Urumqi, capital of
northwest Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Their destination was
Changsha, capital of central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Both mother and child are in a good condition after they were
rushed to a hospital at Zhongchuan airport in Lanzhou, capital of
Gansu Province, where the airplane made an unscheduled landing.
</P>
<P>
Sources say there are only few cases of airborne births reported
in the country, as it is extremely dangerous to give birth aboard
high flying aeroplanes.
</P>
<P>
The drama started on November 5 when the airplane took off for
Changsha from Urumqi via Xi'an, with 110 passengers aboard,
including Peng Shaoyun and Yuan Juan, according to the China
Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
Peng was accompanying Yuan, his nine-months pregnant wife.
</P>
<P>
Soon after boarding the plane, Yuan began feeling unwell. At
11:25 am when the plane was high over Inner Mongolia, her
condition became even worse. She came to realize her great pains
were birth contractions. The plane was about to welcome passenger
number 111.
</P>
<P>
When the captain learned what was happening he decided to land
at Xi'an airport after consulting ground control. But Yuan was in
such a critical condition that it would be late if the plane
stayed airborne as far as Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The captain changed his mind and decided to head for Zhongchuan
airport, which was even nearer. Ground control then gave the plane
priority treatment, and asked the local hospital to get things
ready within eight minutes for an urgent delivery.
</P>
<P>
But when the plane touched down at the airport, Yuan had
already safely given birth to a baby girl in the sky, under the
care of all passengers and crew.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Opposition Unites to Oust President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Romania's two main opposition
groups joined forces today in a bid to win next week's
presidential election run-off and oust incumbent president Ion
Iliescu.
</P>
<P>
Former premier Peter Roman, who came third in the first round
of the election on November 3, has led his Social Democratic Union
(USD) party into an alliance with the Democratic Convention of
Romania (CDR), whose chairman Emil Constantinescu came second in
the ballot and will now face Iliescu in next Sunday's run-off.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu won 32 percent of the vote in the first round, with
Constantinescu securing 28 percent. So, the 21 percent of the vote
captured by Roman will play a crucial role in deciding the outcome
of the second-round election.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the USD and CDR also sets down a
power-sharing formula for the new parliament which was also
elected in last week's ballot.
</P>
<P>
In return for the USD's support, the CDR, which gained most
votes in the general election, will give Roman's party three
ministerial portfolios in the new government - first deputy prime
minister, foreign minister and speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
The CDR won 30.7 percent of the votes for the Senate and 30.17
percent of the votes for the Chamber of Deputies, compared with
23.08 and 21.52 for Iliescu's Party of Social Democracy (PSDR).
</P>
<P>
To form a government, Constantinescu needs the 13.16 percent
support Roman's USD won in the Senate and 12.93 percent in the
Chamber.
</P>
<P>
With that support now secure, Iliescu has conceded that his
party will now go into opposition.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the new coalition government's policies
will embody the campaign manifestos of both parties, including tax
cuts, currency liberalization and steps to curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
The government will also work to become one of the first group
of former Warsaw Pact countries to joint NATO and the European
Union around the year 2000.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Two days after the general
elections in which President Bill Clinton was reelected, there are
still one Senate and six House seats that remain undecided.
</P>
<P>
Election officials said that California and Oregon were still
counting absentee ballots and Texas is to hold a runoff election
for three House races.
</P>
<P>
In Oregon, one Senate and one House race remained undecided. In
California, two winners were yet to be named in House contests.
</P>
<P>
The results of the one Senate and three House races will not be
announced until next week at the earliest and a runoff election is
set for December 10 effected by a late court redistricting
decision, according to election officials.
</P>
<P>
However, the outcome will not affect continued Republicans'
control over both the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
In the House, the Republicans succeeded in safeguarding their
majority, winning 225 seats against the Democrats' 204 on
Tuesday. Their advantage, however, shrunk from the 236-198
pre-election lead.
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Republicans added one seat to a 54-45 lead with
the Oregon race still undecided, bettering their 53-47 majority
before the Election Day.

The six airlines, classified into two classes, are Nepal
Airways, Necon Air, Gyan Enterprises, Alpine Air, and Nepal
Transcontinental Airlines of Class A and Everest Air Ltd. of Class
B, sources from the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to them, Class A airlines are authorized to fly in
short- and long-distance routes while a Class B one could only
operate short- and medium-distance flights.
</P>
<P>
The would-be international airlines have to get an air
operation certificate from the International Civil Aviation
Organization after fulfilling all necessary procedures, an
official of the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism and Civil Aviation Ministry said in a press release
issued Thursday that its move to permit private airlines into
international sector will help promote the country's tourism
industry and the government's Visit Nepal Year 1998 program, which
is targeted to attract 500,000 foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen involved in the tourism sector here have been
asking the government to allow private airlines to operate
international flights so as to increase the number of air travel
arrivals to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
So far only the state-owned Royal Nepal Airlines in the country
has the right to fly on international routes.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainians Commemorate October Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Ukrainians today
celebrated the anniversary of the 1917 October Revolution as
left-wing parties called for unity in the struggle for political
power and property.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10,000 people, mostly from left-wing political parties
and organizations such as the Communist Party and the Socialist
Party, paraded and gathered outside an exhibition hall, once a
museum dedicated to Lenin.
</P>
<P>
Alexandr Moroz, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine and
of the Socialist Party, called on Ukrainians to give up extreme
slogans and activities and to unite and fight for political power
and against the privatization of property.
</P>
<P>
Although ideological differences made it impossible for parties
to unite, Moroz told the crowd, left and right-wing political
parties could compromise.
</P>
<P>
Also at the rally, Petr Simonenko, first secretary of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party, criticized the
government's economic austerity and privatization policies which
he said had led to declining production, rising prices and falling
living standards.
</P>
<P>
The government has introduced tough policies aimed at reducing
inflation, limiting the decline in growth, reducing the budget
deficit, and privatizing state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
Simonenko called on the government to take concrete measures to
guarantee people's social security.
</P>
<P>
After the rally, Simonenko and Moroz placed flowers at the feet
of the Lenin statue in Kiev.
</P>
<P>
At a rally organized by the People's Movement of Ukraine,
participants called on President Leonid Kuchma to pursue a
nationalist policy and abolish the national holidays of November 7
and 8.
</P>
<P>
These were public holidays across the former Soviet Union to
celebrate the October Revolution which overthrew the Tzarist
regime in Russia and led to the setting up of the Soviet Union in
1922.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Warned of Rising Current Account Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has called on ASEAN countries to reduce current account
deficit and increase domestic savings to fend off external
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
"Large net private capital inflows have tended to raise
aggregate expenditures, increase inflationary pressures, and widen
current account deficits in all major recipient countries," IMF
Managing Director Michel Camdessus said at a closed-door seminar
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the participants at the two-day conference on
macro-economic problems of ASEAN, Camdessus said, "despite their
good performance, ASEAN member countries are not immune to the
adverse effects of large capital inflow."
</P>
<P>
To enable ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) to
maintain its economic performance, he underlined the need for the
regional grouping to reduce their dependence on offshore loans, to
see that foreign capital inflow must be on long-term basis, and to
foster their domestic banking system besides enhancing the role of
their governments.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said the greatest threat to stability was posed by
more volatile short-term capital inflows.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN countries have been the center for foreign
investments looking for high returns and healthy fundamentals. But
they had, at the same time, increasingly complicated monetary
management.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's share of total foreign investment received by
developing countries was estimated at an average of about 25
percent during the 1990s, compared with just a trickle in the
1970s, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being attended by 249 participants, including
finance ministers, governors of central banks in the ASEAN
countries and IMF representatives.

<HEADLINE> India's Street Children Take to Dangerous Addictions: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Street children in
metropolitan cities in India have taken to dangerous addictions --
glue, petrol, Xerox solution and erasing fluid used in typing,
said a study.
</P>
<P>
Many die of severe complications related to glue sniffing, but
they continue the abuse as "it either adds something to their life
or temporarily solves the problem. Glue, for instance, lessens
their hunger pangs," said the study.
</P>
<P>
The study, funded by the United Nations Drugs Control Program,
was undertaken jointly by the National AIDS Control Program, the
World Health Organization, UNICEF and the Union Ministry of
Welfare.
</P>
<P>
Children use rags picked up from streets for glue and petrol
sniffing. They wear these after dipping them in petrol or some
other solvent. This also increases their susceptibility to skin
infections, the study said.
</P>
<P>
"The effect is longer and more damaging as compared to other
drugs. Impaired memory, loss of appetite and damage to lungs are
some of the long-term effects," the study added.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the risks to their health, these substances make
children prone to accidents. A number of children in Mumbai
(Bombay) had accidents on rail tracks as they could not judge
their distance from oncoming trains, the study said.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi, capital of India, Mumbai and Calcutta have around
100,000 street children each. The findings will be discussed
initially at regional conferences, followed by a national
conference to be held in New Delhi next week.

<HEADLINE> 7 Foreign Bank Offices in Bangkok to Become Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Ministry of
Thailand has granted full-branch licenses to seven foreign bank
offices in the country to upgrade their offshore banking units.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in 20 years that full-branch licenses have
been granted to foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
The upgrading of foreign offshore banking facilities, also
known as Bangkok international banking facilities (BIBF), to full
branches is another step toward liberalization of Thailand's
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The licenses, granted on Thursday, will allow the seven foreign
banks to concentrate on retail banking.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance hopes that the seven banks, including
Bank of China, will help expand business opportunities between
Thailand and their home countries.
</P>
<P>
Of the six other banks, three are from Japan (the Industrial
Bank of Japan, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, and Sumitomo Bank), one from
Germany (Dresdner Bank), one from France (Banque National de
Paris), and one from Canada (Bank of Nova Scotia).
</P>
<P>
The ministry considered the licenses on the basis of the amount
of trade with each bank's country base, so the new banks have a
wide customer base, according to caretaker Finance Minister
Chaiyawat Vibulsawasdi.
</P>
<P>
The seven bank branches are expected to begin operating next
year, bringing the total number of foreign banks in Thailand to
21.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Credit Down in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Consumer credit in the
United States dropped by 2.7 percent to 1.17 trillion U.S. dollars
in September, the first decline in more than three years, the
Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts were surprised at the decline and said that it further
illustrated the near-stall in personal consumption in the country
during the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said that decrease follows a 5.2 percent increase in
August. It was the first drop since consumer credit in the
U.S. slipped by 0.3 percent, or 200 million dollars, in May of
1993.
</P>
<P>
Credit growth has slowed down considerably in recent months
from the double-digit gains of the past two years as consumers
grew more debt weary. Meanwhile, banks have tightened their
lending standards as the U.S. economy slowed and delinquency and
bankruptcy rates soared.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said that automobile loans fell by 3.1 percent after
posting a 2.2 percent gain in August. This represented a drop of 1
billion dollars and the loans were down to 372.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The category that includes loans for mobile homes, education,
boats, trailers and vacations plunged by 9.1 percent in September,
wiping out a 6.3 percent gain the previous month. The decline of
2.6 billion dollars left debt in this category at 344.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
Revolving credit, which includes credit cards, registered the
only gain. But the 2.6 percent advance was considerably slower
than the 6.7 percent increase in August. The total debt of this
category increased to 455.6 billion dollars in September.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of the U.S.
economic activities and a decline of consumer debt shows that the
nation's economy is slowing down continuously.
</P>
<P>
The government had reported earlier that consumer spending
had slowed to a 0.4 percent annual growth rate in the third
quarter from a 3.5 percent pace during the first half of the year.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Leaders to Hold Informal Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- An informal summit of ASEAN
leaders will be held here on November 30, which will also be
attended by heads of government from Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar,
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
"According to plans, the meeting will be held on November 30
for a whole day," Alatas said here last night after returning from
a trip abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), formed in
1967, now comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia and Laos are set to join the group next year at the
ASEAN ministerial meeting in Kuala Lumpur. Member states are still
deliberating the entrance of Myanmar amidst strong international
criticism of Yangon's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
The informal summit is expected to kick off with discussions
between the seven ASEAN leaders, followed by talks later in the
afternoon with leaders from the three prospective members.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said that despite planned preparatory meetings, a rigid
agenda of discussion is not expected. "Topics of discussion would
be left to the leaders themselves."
</P>
<P>
The informal summit is held at least once every three years
between formal summits and it is aimed at drafting directions for
ASEAN activities in light of the latest international
developments.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN leaders last met at the fifth summit in Bangkok in 1995.

cults and religious sects whose activities a government minister
described today as "destructive and harmful to individuals,
families and society."
</P>
<P>
Minister for the Family Martin Bartenstein said the government
was prepared to do all it could, including taking legal measures,
to crush the cults whose effects on society were being felt daily.
</P>
<P>
The minister was publicizing an anti-cult pamphlet calling on
people to empower themselves through knowledge not through
misguided religious factions.
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet lists all the characteristics of the 22 most
active cults in the world. It warns that there are about 50,000
cult and religious sect members in the country and some 200,000
sympathizers, with numbers on the rise.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Guerrilla Leader to Withdraw From Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Gaspar Ilom, one of the
leaders of the guerrilla forces fighting against Guatemalan
government troops, today announced his withdrawal from the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla leader said in a statement issued here that his
withdrawal from the peace talks was a gesture to "avoid
difficulties and to guarantee equanimity and favorable conditions
for the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Ilom is the top leader of the Organization of People in Arms
(ORPA), one of the four guerrilla organizations forming the
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG).
</P>
<P>
The reason for his withdrawal, he said, is a URNG member's
kidnapping of a wealthy woman.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan peace talks were suspended after a member of the
guerrilla forces participated in the kidnapping of an 86-year-old
wealthy woman on August 25, as a way of fundraising, as claimed by
guerrilla sources.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla forces admitted the kidnapping, but said it
occurred "without their knowledge or authorization."
</P>
<P>
Ilom said that he would appoint an ORPA member to represent his
organization in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan government and the URNG initiated peace
negotiations in April 1991 in an effort to end the country's
36-year-old civil war, the longest in Latin America, which has
claimed about 100,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Bank Governor Predicts Prosperity for Canadians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Gordon Thiessen, governor of
Bank of Canada, has said that the pace of economic growth will
pick up soon in his country in response to past interest rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
Years of hard times are about to pay off in prosperity for
Canadians, the central bank governor was quoted as saying by
today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Since the spring of 1995, the Bank of Canada has lowered its
target range for overnight loans to 3.5 percent from 8.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The easing in monetary policy so far "will lead to a higher
rate of economic activity in the year ahead" that will bring down
the unemployment rate, Thiessen predicted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the combination of the bank's fight against
inflation and layoffs in the public and private sectors in the
early 1990s is "creating the foundation for a growing and
prosperous economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Canada's jobless rate for October will be released,
which is widely expected to be 9.7 or 9.8 percent, down from 9.9
percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Given a higher-than-expected jobless rate, Thiessen would be forced
to initiate another round of rate cuts, analysts here said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister Denounces Naturalizing Rush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish sports minister told a
newspaper on Thursday that he disliked the efforts by top soccer
clubs to naturalise foreigners in order to evade limits on foreign
players.
</P>
<P>
"I am against giving Turkish citizenship to foreigners who
block the progress of local players," Bahattin Seker, minister in
charge of sports, told the soccer daily Fanatik.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it right for a few clubs, in their quest for
championship or other gains, to ensure superiority over less
greedy clubs by breaching the limit on foreigners," Seker said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish clubs, facing the rule that three foreign players at
any one time, are rushing to have some of their top foreign
players naturalized.
</P>
<P>
Turkish champions Fenerbahce have already applied for Nigerian
players Augustine "Jay Jay" Okocha and Uche Okechukwu to become
Turkish nationals, taking the names Muhammed Yavuz Okocha and
Abdulkerim Rahim Uche.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul's clubs Besiktas and Galatasaray are also expected to
follow suit.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Festival Opens In Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China's latest festival was
enjoying the sweet scent of success just thirty minutes after it
opened here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
It took just that time for festival goers to clinch deals for
50,000 tons of one of the country's most loved
commodities ... sugar.
</P>
<P>
Lovers of honey and all things sweet have gathered in Nanning,
capital city of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, to sing
songs and draw pictures in celebration of sugar.
</P>
<P>
At the first China Guangxi Sugar Culture Festival, which opened
on Thursday, poets and painters praised the thousand-year-long
sugar-making history in the country, while theorists summoned
seminars for studying it.
</P>
<P>
The early business transactions took place amid performances
given by 400 dancers and singers from grass-roots artistic troupes
of sugar plants.
</P>
<P>
With 108 sugar plantations, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region is the biggest sugar producer in China, with production
reaching 2.33 million tons last year, 37 percent of the total
output of the country.
</P>
<P>
Sugar is a daily favorite for the Chinese, especially for people
living in the southern provinces. It is a necessity for making
many famous Chinese delicacies.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people like to connect certain products to a cultural
phenomena, injecting a profound meaning into it. Similar festivals
include celebrations for tea and the watermelon, all representing
China's rich cultural heritage and a prosperous life.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Soldiers Killed in Clashes With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Five Philippine soldiers were
killed and six others wounded during two days of fighting between
government forces and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
guerrillas in southern Zamboanga del Norte Province, local press
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said heavily armed MILF rebels fought a two-hour
gun battle with a brigade of the Army's Fourth Infantry Battalion
in a village in Siocon earlier Monday morning, leaving two
soldiers serious wounded.
</P>
<P>
The following day, the rebels, led by Commander Karim Lumiguez,
overran a detachment of the Fourth Infantry Battalion in a nearby
village, killing all four soldiers guarding the detachment.
</P>
<P>
The number of casualties was not yet known on the rebel side
who withdrew to the hinterlands, the reports said. The Southern
Command has sent reinforcements to the area to chase the fleeing
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The latest casualties brought to 17 the total number of
soldiers killed and to 40 that of wounded in the tit-for-tat
fighting between the government forces and the MILF rebels
beginning later last month in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The two clashes occurred just two days before the government
and the MILF began their exploratory talks to hammer out a
temporary ceasefire between the two sides and pave the way for
formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In Tipo-Tipo city in another southern province, Basilan, the
government forces continued their pursuit of the MILF rebels, who
ambushed the chasing government troops Monday, killing seven
soldiers and captured eight others.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos administration has hoped to make peace with the MILF,
which became the biggest anti-government group in the country
after the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front struck a peace
deal with Manila in September.
</P>
<P>
Peace with the MILF will help develop economy in the southern
Philippines, which has been shattered by decades of war between
the government and Muslim separatists.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeking Replacement for Outgoing Cabinet Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
met privately Thursday with Vice President AL Gore and White House
chief of staff Leon Panetta to seek replacements for cabinet
vacancies after the exodus of a number of top administrators
including Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said the talks would
focus first on replacing Secretary of State Christopher, who
resigned earlier in the day, and Panetta, who has indicated a
desire to leave the White House for a possible run for the
California governorship.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said that the three were meeting privately to avoid
some of the usual speculation and leaks that have dominated the
process in the past.
</P>
<P>
He said that Clinton may possibly be ready to announce
Panetta's replacement as early as Friday, while the search to
replace Christopher was expected to take some longer time.
</P>
<P>
Clinton hinted that he might even cross the party lines in his
considerations, landing a Republican or two.
</P>
<P>
With all the vacancies, the newly re-elected U.S. president
said that he would "cast a wide net" in his new government
personnel replacement search.
</P>
<P>
A formal meeting between Clinton and his full Cabinet was
scheduled for Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Several Cabinet departures are expected as Clinton begins to
structure his next administration. Christopher's resignation was
the first of a wave of expected exits from the administration as
the Clinton begins his second term.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry, Commerce Secretary Mickey
Kantor, Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, Transportation Secretary
Federico Pena and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, Housing
Secretary Henry Cisneros are all stepping down, according to
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said he was leaving because "the time simply has
come for someone else to pick up the baton."
</P>
<P>
Christopher said he would return to his law practice in
California in January, while making himself available for local
and international assignments, but said he could not envision
himself being Clinton's special Mideast envoy.
</P>
<P>
He declined to venture an opinion on who should take his place,
but offered some advice for Clinton in choosing a successor:
"Somebody who has the capacity to provide forceful leadership,
someone who has great tenacity, someone who has a lot of endurance
and stamina."

<HEADLINE> TWA 800 Downed by U.S. Navy Missile, Former Kennedy Aide Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Navy missile accidentally
shot down TWA flight 800 off New York on July 17, killing all 230
passengers aboard, the former press spokesman for the late
U.S. President John Kennedy, claimed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Salinger was quoted by Agence France Presse as saying
that the information was given to him by someone with close
links to the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have repeatedly denied speculation that TWA
Flight 800 was accidentally shot down by "friendly fire" from a
U.S. missile. They have still failed to find the cause of the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Salinger, a former White House aide, made his claim in front of
150 airline company officials from 20 countries attending the
Cannes Airlines Forum in the French Mediterranean resort.
</P>
<P>
Salinger said a document from a U.S. secret service agent
showed that the Boeing 747 airline had entered an area where the
U.S. Navy was carrying out missile tests.
</P>
<P>
The airline was flying lower than its scheduled altitude of
20,000 feet that day because another plane above it was beginning
a descent to the airport in Providence, Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
But in a tragic error, the airport control tower failed to
inform the Navy, Salinger said.
</P>
<P>
The investigation into the crash said that the center fuel tank
of the Boeing 747 exploded, and fire damage was found in the right
wing's fuel tank. But the cause of the explosion has never been
officially decided.
</P>
<P>
James Kallstrom, the FBI agent heading the investigation,
denounced the friendly-fire theory last month as an "outrageous
accusation."
</P>
<P>
However, many eye witnesses reported seeing a streak of red
flashing across the night sky, similar to that of a missile, just
before the plane exploded.

<HEADLINE> China to Establish 50 Engineering Research Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China will establish another 50
engineering research centers in the coming five years to help turn
major research findings into production realities.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Planning Department of the State Science
and Technology Commission said today that the centers will focus
on agricultural abd social developments and the industrialization of
high and new technology projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that the centers will undertake projects for
high-efficiency crop output, regional development, scaled breeding
of domestic animals, environmental protection, development of
resources, pharmaceuticals, information, advanced manufacturing
techniques, clean energy, new materials and biological technology.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the State Science the Technology Commission has
approved 69 state engineering research centers, and put 500
projects into industrial production.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the science achievements applied to
production by the research centers have generated 2.2 billion yuan
(275 million U.S. dollars) in sales revenues, and 440 million yuan
(55 million dollars) in net profits.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the 69 engineering research centers
have hired some 9,600 scientists and technicians from 61 research
institutions, 10 universities and nine major state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of the centers is also a major step
taken by the commission to further implement the restructuring of
scientific research institutions.

<HEADLINE> 1996 Voter Turnout Near Historic Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the
American eligible voters sat out the Bill Clinton-Bob Dole contest
on the Election Day Tuesday, press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The number of ballots cast stood at 92.7 million out of 196.5
million of voting age, or 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for Study of the
American Electorate, said substantial numbers of absentee ballots
not yet counted in Washington and Oregon would raise the final
percentage.
</P>
<P>
He expects the final turnout to be 48.8 percent of those
eligible, down from 55 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Robert Y. Shapiro, a political science professor at Columbia
University, said Clinton's lead in the polls held down this year's
turnout.
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said voters in 1992 were upset about the state of the
economy and turned against Bush.
</P>
<P>
While Ross Perot's presence in that race stirred voter
interest, it may have had something to do with people staying away
on Tuesday, Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
Forrest Maltzman, an assistant professor of political science
at George Washington University, said voter turnout goes down when
people think they know the outcome.
</P>
<P>
Ricki Seidman, executive director of Rock the Vote, which aims
to get young people to vote, said money wasn't spent to bring more
voters out but only to reach those people who were likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
J. P. Monroe, a professor of political science at the University
of Miami, said the low turnout is a concern.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Economy Grows by 1.9 percent in Three Quarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Peru's gross domestic product grew
by 1.9 percent in the first three quarters this year, compared
with the same period of 1995, official statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
The GDP in the first quarter grew by 0.3 percent, the second
2.8 percent and the third 2.4 percent, the Peruvian National
Institute of Statistics and Information said.
</P>
<P>
The output of agriculture and livestock increased by 5.0
percent, mining 3.2 percent, and commerce 2.7 percent, while
fishing and construction dropped by 4.4 percent and 6.4 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Fishing activity suffered a drop of 11.1 percent in September
mainly due to the long lasting interdiction that affected the
sector until a short time ago.
</P>
<P>
The 5.6 percent drop in the construction sector resulted from
the lesser supply of Portland cement in the local market and the
38.5 percent drop in the sale of asphalt.

<HEADLINE> Perry: U.S. to Build Pragmatic Partnership with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States is to
build a new security relationship with Russia and support the
integration of Russia into the new security structure of Europe,
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Denver Rotary Club Luncheon, Perry said that his
nation's evolving partnership with Russia was based on three
vitally important security objectives: assisting Russians in
dismantling their nuclear legacy from the Cold War; building a
strong and constructive relationship with the Russian military;
and supporting the integration of Russia into the new security
structure of Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said, the cornerstone of the new partnership is the
Nunn-Lugar program, named for the two senators who sponsored the
underlying legislation. The purpose of the program was to provide
funding, equipment and assistance to help the nations of the
former Soviet Union safeguard and dismantle much of their nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that the Nunn-Lugar program has assisted in the
dismantlement of 4,000 nuclear warheads and the destruction of 800
launchers.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S.-Russian military relations, Perry said that better
military-to-military relations could "help the Russians
professionalize and restructure their forces in a way that
supports emerging democratic institutions in Russia."
</P>
<P>
Perry, who has visited Russia recently, said that he told the
Russians that the U.S. strategy was maintaining a cooperative
security relationship with Russia including increased exchange of
bilateral education.
</P>
<P>
On the integration of Russia into the European security
structure, the defense secretary said, the modal for the
integration is Russia's participation in the Implementation Force
(IFOR) operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He said the peacekeeping troops from the two countries now are
serving together, sharing a camp and working together on a daily
basis to carry out the IFOR military mandate.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Court Bans Mrs. Marcos From Going Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine court Thursday
denied for the third time the plea of former first lady, Imelda
Marcos, for permission to seek eye treatment in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The anti-graft court said there is no need for Mrs. Marcos, who
is suffering from glaucoma, an eye disease that may lead to
blindness, to travel to the U.S. since she can find competent
doctors in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The court said Mrs. Marcos, unlike any ordinary individual who
could invoke his right to travel, had to show a strong evidence
that a doctor based in any foreign country was the only one who
could save her from death.
</P>
<P>
However, the court emphasized, Mrs. Marcos failed to show there
would be any difference between an operation conducted by American
doctors and that by Filipino doctors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court said, allowing Mrs. Marcos to travel
abroad would put her beyond the reach of Philippine courts.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos was convicted in 1993 of two graft cases and
sentenced to a maximum of 24 years in jail. Released on bail, she
needs court approval to go abroad.
</P>
<P>
Complaining of a heart-ailment and a worsening hearing
condition, Mrs. Marcos has attempted twice to obtain court
approval to travel abroad and was refused by the court.

QUITO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran President Abdala
Bucaram will pay a state visit to Peru at the beginning of the
next year, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram today accepted the invitation of his Peruvian
counterpart Alberto Fujimori, which was officially confirmed on

</P>
<P>
This would be the first official visit to Peru by an Ecuadoran
president in more than 50 years.

<P>
In his letter of invitation, Fujimori told Bucaram his
willingness to continue the intense diplomatic conversations aimed
at a final solution to the territorial "impasse" existing between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The letter also expresses the interest of the Peruvian
government and people in finding a final solution to the border
conflict between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador and Peru were locked in a large-scale border conflict
in January 1995. Ceasefire was achieved 50 days later through the
mediation of the Rio De Janeiro Protocol Countries comprising
Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States.

MEXICO CITY, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexico has made its first
bond issue on the Italian market, launching five-year floating
rate bonds worth 500 billion Italian lire (about 325 million
U.S. dollars), Mexican finance authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
The Finance and Public Credit Ministry (SHCP) said in a
statement that the bonds will be placed by Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell and JP Morgan Securities, as well as by leading agents
and a group of the main European financing institutions.

<P>
The bonds have a five-year maturity term and carry a variable
interest rate fixed every three months, two percentage points above
the key Italian Libor variable rate.
</P>
<P>
The bonds were issued in Italy to widen Mexico's base of
international investors and to take advantage of the favorable
financial conditions in Italy compared with other world markets,
the SHCP said.
</P>
<P>
The money raised from the bond sale will be used to pay off the
Mexican government's short term debts.

JAKARTA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
will pay a state visit to Jordan next week before proceeding to
Rome, Italy, to attend a world food summit to be held there, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Jordan on November 11-14 is reciprocal to one made
by King Hussein to Indonesia in 1986, while the trip to Italy on
November 15-16 is to address the world food summit, Minister/State
Secretary Moerdiono said last night in his office here.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said the purpose of the visit to Jordan is to forge
friendship and explore the possibility of promoting economic and
trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Besides a meeting with King Hussein, President Soeharto and his
host will also witness the signing of an agreement on investment
protection and on commercial shipping, said Moerdiono.
</P>
<P>
In Rome, Soeharto is scheduled to address the world food summit
and is expected to "tell of Indonesia's experience in developing
its agriculture."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia changed from one of the world's largest rice
importers in the 1970s to a self-sufficient rice producer in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The five-day summit will be held from November 13 to 17 and at
least 173 heads of state and other international organizations
will attend the summit, reports said.

BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A total of 100,000 young people
have applied for enrollment in the Chinese People's Liberation
Army, China's armed forces, since a recruitment drive started in
Beijing on November 1.
</P>
<P>
At present, 96 percent of the applicants, whose ages are

This year, the local government has formulated a series of
regulations to ensure the quality of army applicants, and set up
enrollment offices at neighborhood, county, district and municipal

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Management of Foreign Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen the
management of foreign capital for a more effective utilization, a
senior official with State Planning Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The country should pay more attention to the benefits which
such capital generated rather than the investment amount, He Ju,
deputy director of the Commission's department of foreign capital
utilization, was quoted as saying by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
From this year, central government started to conduct strict
overall planning with regard to overseas capital's scale,
structure and destinations, he noted at a seminar.
</P>
<P>
He urged all enterprises using foreign capital to set up
debt repayment funds and reserves.
</P>
<P>
The country attracted 250 billion US dollars of overseas
funds by the end of 1995, including 135 billion US dollars in
direct investment and 115 billion US dollars in foreign debts,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Now the country's individual savings deposits stand at about
3,800 billion yuan (457 billion US dollars), and the growth rate,
which has stood at more than 30 percent this year, is predicted to
be maintained during the first half of the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
So the overseas capital's utilization should be aimed at
improving the technological level of domestic enterprises and the
quality of their products while strengthening the enterprises'
ability to take part in international competition.

<P>
NANCHANG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The first Chinese edition of
the "Autobiography of Mao Zedong," written by well-known American
journalist Edgar Snow, has been discovered in the city of Jian in
central China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The book is reportedly kept in good condition by its owner, Xu
Yongzhong, who works in a flour factory in Jian. Xu said his
father bought the book in Nanchang in 1939.
</P>
<P>
Experts claim the book is of great importance for the study of
Mao's early life and the Chinese Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the publication of the English and Chinese versions of
"The Red Star Over China" in the 1930s, Edgar Snow (1905-1972)
wrote an autobiography of Mao, the leader of the Chinese
revolution, based on a series of lengthy interviews.
</P>
<P>
It was soon translated into Chinese and became very popular.
</P>
<P>
The first-edition autobiography, translated by Zhang Zonghan
and published in Yan'an in the autumn of 1937, is 70 pages long
and includes a full-length sketch of Mao.
</P>
<P>
The four-chapter book also contains sketches and captions of
well-known Communists Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Peng Dehuai, Liu Bocheng
and Zhang Wentian, together with a biography of Mao's ex-wife, He
Zizhen.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Dismisses Change in U.S. Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Cuba has dismissed a change in
the United States' attitude toward the country following the
re-election of U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the final result of these elections is, no change is
seen in what is already known -- Clinton as president, and a
Republican Congress, said Marianela Ferriol, acting
spokeswoman of the Cuban Foreign Ministry, today.
</P>
<P>
The recent U.S. elections do not mean a change in the
composition of the U.S. political force, which would favor the
enforcement of the international law, she added.
</P>
<P>
The United States hardened the economic embargo against Cuba in
March this year when it enacted the Helms-Burton bill that foresees
retaliation against enterprises that do business with Cuban firms.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton bill has been counter-productive for the
U.S. government since it has generated a growing international
rejection, Ferriol said.
</P>
<P>
Havana's strategy and action guidelines, internal as well as
international, are not based on a hypothetical hope on the
recently elected administration of the United States, said the
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Cuba will go ahead with its development plans and its normal
life, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Cuba expects to have a new round of talks on migration issue
with the United States before the end of this year, she added.

<HEADLINE> Desert Encroaches Upon 93 Percent of Patagonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Environmental experts are
calling on the government to act to reverse the desertification
which they claim now affects 93 percent of Patagonia in southern
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The experts, who backed their claims with satellite data,
warned that environmental damage caused by the encroachment of the
desert would increase unless action is taken to stop the advance.
</P>
<P>
Satellite data gathered over the last six years shows that 73.5
million hectares of the 78.8 million hectares of land making up
the Patagonia region is now affected, covering the provinces of
Neuquen, Rio Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that more than a third of Patagonia is
suffering medium to serious land degradation, with another third
suffering serious to very serious damage.
</P>
<P>
Three quarters of South America's 391 million hectares of land
is now affected by desertification, with Patagonia accounting for
18 percent.

TEGUCIGALPA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- One person died and 17
others, including two children, were injured today when a hand
grenade thrown from a passing car exploded in Honduras' main
courthouse.

A security guard at the building was killed in the blast, which
happened at 11.20 a.m. local time (1720 GMT). Two children, two

injured, said police sources.
</P>

The courthouse is the site of the Callejas case as well as
proceedings against former army officers accused in the

<HEADLINE> Estonia-Scotland World Cup Qualifying Match to be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Organising Committee for the
FIFA World Cup decided in Zurich Thursday that the World Cup
qualifying match in European Group 4 between Estonia and Scotland
is to be re-organised.
</P>
<P>
The match in Tallinn had not been played on October 9 as
scheduled, because the Estonian team failed to turn up for the
kick-off which FIFA had fixed at 3 p.m. after the floodlights had
been found to be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The Committee endorsed a decision by the Committee Bureau that
that game should be played at the latest by March 16 1997. In
principle, the match should be held in Tallinn, depending upon
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
The costs for Scotland of the re-arranged match are to be borne
by FIFA.
</P>
<P>
The Committee considereed that there had been extenuating
circumstances which had prevented the Estonian team from playing
at the re-arranged time.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will decide at its meeting on
November 23 if disciplinary measures are to be taken against the
Estonian Football Association.
</P>
<P>
After viewing a video of the recent tragedy in Guatemala when
over 80 people were killed, the Committee also decided that the
Flores Mateo stadium in Guatemala City is to be used for no
matches until further notice. The qualifying matches
Guatemala-Costa Rica and Guatemala-Trinidad and Tobago are to be
re-scheduled by the FIFA Organising Committee.
</P>
<P>
Because of the political situation in Liberia, the Committee
also decided that the qualifying match between Liberia and Tunisia
on November 10 will be played in Accra, Ghana, with the
cooperation of the Ghana Football Association.

BELGRADE, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's film director
Dragan Kresoja and cameraman Milos Stefan Kresoja, were killed
when a helicopter crashed in the Danube river off Belgrade
Wednesday afternoon, official sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Kresojas, father and son, were filming a documentary about
Belgrade, according to Tanjug news agency report, quoting a
statement by official sources.
</P>
<P>
Dragan Kresoja was making a film about a popular Belgrade
picnic spot when his helicopter had engine trouble and crashed
into the river.
</P>
<P>
Kresoja, 50, began his film career in the 1960s and had made

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says DPRK Appears to Cancel Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
on Thursday that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
appeared to have backed off a planned ballistic missile test.
</P>
<P>
Charles Kartman, deputy assistant secretary of state for East
Asian affairs, said, "we believe that they've now stopped the
preparations" for a medium-range missile test.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.S. State Department sent a "very strong
message" to Pyongyang not to carry out the test for fear of
stoking instability in Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
DPRK denounced U.S. and other countries' complaints in a
statement on October 23 that any such test was a matter of DPRK's
sovereignty "and no one else is entitled or has any ground to
meddle with it."
</P>
<P>
Kartman said the cause of the apparent cancel of the missile
test might be that DPRK did hear concerns from U.S. and other
countries and "they had some second thoughts."
</P>
<P>
"But I don't know that those second thoughts are going to be
long-lasting ones," he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Administration Made Decision on Bosnia Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Senate committee
report said Thursday that the State Department made the decision
not to oppose Iranian arms for Bosnian government forces in 1994
without let Congress, the Pentagon and the CIA know about it.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Intelligence Committee said that the U.S. "green
light" for Iran to provide arms to the Muslim-led government, at
the same time that the U.S. publicly supported a U.N. embargo on
such arms, created confusion among U.S. officials, particularly
defense and intelligence officials who did not know the change in
policy.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the report was an April 1994 meeting between
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and U.S. Ambassador Peter
Galbraith at which Galbraith, under orders from Washington, said
he had "no instructions" regarding a U.S. response to proposed
Croatian shipments of arms, mainly from Iran, to the beleaguered
Muslims in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The reply was to signal that the United States would not object
to the arms transfers, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration decision was made at a time when
Congress was debating whether to ignore the U.N. embargo and
unilaterally lift the arms embargo to help the Muslims defend
themselves from Serbian attacks.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., the ranking Democrat on the committee,
said the administration policy was ultimately successful as the
Bosnian Muslims survived and U.N. troops stayed.
</P>
<P>
But he said giving the green light to Iranian arms shipments,
"allowing something to happen that wasn't permitted under U.S.
law," was "fraught with risks."
</P>
<P>
A House International Relations subcommittee last month issued
a harsher report on the same subject, saying the Clinton
administration had recklessly endangered U.S. interests by not
objecting to the flow of U.S. arms.

<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
all reversed Wednesday's gains and ended in the negative
territories today, with London being the poorest performer and
losing 35.3 points.
</P>
<P>
Depressed futures and heavy derivative-related selling dragged
the London market down to close a whisker over 3,900, an
eight-week low, on the FTSE 100 index.
</P>
<P>
Dealers cited fears of higher domestic interest rates and
worries over the durability of the recovery in Europe.
</P>
<P>
German shares on the Frankfurt market were lower at the close
but off the day's earlier lows, 15.97 points down on the DAX-30
index, depressed by a lower US dollar and weaker bond market.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that a flat forecast for German electronic firm
Siemens and a sharp fall in its shares also subdued the market.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in Paris had been in the negative for all the day,
but Wall Street's rebound from an earlier 27-point fall helped the
market return to its opening levels and end just below Wednesday's
closing high, down 1.56 points at 2,211.81.
</P>

London's FTSE index of 100 leading British shares was 35.3

<HEADLINE> France Proposes to U.N. Two Month Mandate for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- France today heightened its
pressure on the United Nations Security Council by presenting a
project resolution on the deployment of an intervention force in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) cited the project resolution as
saying that the mandate for such a multinational force will be two
months and that the use of force by the intervention force should
be authorized.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council did not make any decision when it ended
its session at 18:00 GMT today, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
The project resolution is a combination of a French proposal
and a German proposal for solving the present refugee crisis in
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted diplomats attending today's session in New York as
saying that some countries are still reserved over the objective
and method in dispatching such an intervention force.
</P>
<P>
Reports from eastern Zaire said that many among the more than
one million refugees in the Kivu region are dying and that an
unprecedented human disaster is on the verge of breaking out.
</P>
<P>
The project resolution presented by France aims to authorize
the member countries of the United Nations to take necessary
actions to guarantee the safe distribution of humanitarian aid to
the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The operation is based on "urgency, temporariness and in
cooperation with the U.N. Secretary General and the Organization
of African Unity," said the project resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution cited the Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which
allows the use of force in such interventions.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Creation of Good Economic Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese representative
Yuan Shaofu today urged the international community to implement
the spirit of Midran Declaration and create a conducive economic
environment for the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) of
the U.N. General Assembly, Yuan said that the process of the
globalization and liberalization of the world economy is a contest
in economic power and technical capabilities, which has created
opportunities for economic growth and development and at the same
time presented serious challenges to the weak economies that fine
themselves in a disadvantageous position in the contest.
</P>
<P>
The low level of economic development and technology of the
developing countries as a whole and their lack of essential
competitive edge makes it difficult for them to benefit from
globalization and liberalization in short or medium terms, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The least developed countries and those with a fragile economic
structure in particular face an increasingly great danger of
marginalization as a result of their weak economic foundation and
unstable internal environment, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the development of the developing countries has
lagged behind will seriously impede the development of the world
economy as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only when more countries are mainstreamed in the economic
development of the world, can development be truly globalized," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As some western countries intend to weaken or even abolish the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), he
said that UNCTAD is the only intergovernmental body within the UN
system that considers trade, investment and other related issues
from the perspective of development and in a comprehensive manner.
</P>
<P>
"UNCTAD with 188 member states is the most universal
intergovernmental body on the question of trade and development
and therefore should become an important and integral part of the
global multilateral trade system and continue to participate from
the perspective of development in the formulation of policies and
rules governing global trade so that they can reflect, in a
balanced manner, the interests of all countries and especially the
effects they may have on the developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that a link should be established between UNCTAD
and the World Trade Organization so that they can compliment,
support and interact with each other.

<HEADLINE> Canada Calls for Immediate Cease-fire in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
calls for an immediate cease-fire in eastern Zaire in order to
permit the creation of humanitarian corridors.
</P>
<P>
Canada holds that an immediate cease-fire is "a necessary and
essential condition for the creation of humanitarian corridors for
the transportation and delivery of emergency humanitarian
assistance, and for the voluntary return home of Rwandan refugees
living in this region."
</P>
<P>
"In support of Special Envoy Ambassador Chretien's mission,
Canada urges the UN Security Council to consider the request made
at the Nairobi Summit to deploy a neutral force to ensure the
establishment of safe humanitarian corridors," said Canadian
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"For its part, Canada is prepared to consider how these
corridors could be protected. Their creation may be greatly
facilitated by a cease-fire adhered to by all parties involved in
the conflict," Axworthy noted.
</P>
<P>
Canada remains extremely preoccupied by the worsening of the
political situation, he said, adding that his country has asked
the Rwandan government to do whatever is necessary to encourage
Rwandan refugees, confined in Zaire as well as in Tanzania, to
return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Canada "is especially concerned about the
well-being of the women and children who are innocent victims of
the conflict," said Canadian Minister for International
Co-operation Don Boudria.
</P>
<P>
When conditions permit, Canada is prepared to support
humanitarian aid efforts to help save lives, prevent the spread of
disease and ensure the safe return of refugees to their homes,
Boudria indicated.

<HEADLINE> UK New Car Sales at Record High in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Strong demand from private car
buyers fuelled an unexpected surge in car sales last month to the
highest level for that month since records began, the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figures issued by the SMMT showed that October's new car
sales, at 154,733, were 13.3 percent higher than the 136,605
achieved in the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Sales to private buyers, which have been sluggish all year,
were up 21 percent year-on-year, far out-performing the 7.5
percent increase in the fleet and business sales.
</P>
<P>
The figures bring total sales for the first 10 months of this
year to 1.81 million, up 4.7 percent on the period's 1.73 million
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said that only a sharp downturn in the next
two months will prevent this year's total market exceeding the 2.0
million level for the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, imports increased their penetration of the market and
accounted for 62.2 percent of total sales last month, up from 57.5
percent a year ago, which lifted imports' share for the first 10
months to 62.3 percent, from 59.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The top ten best-sellers in October were: Ford Fiesta, Ford
Mondeo, Ford Escort, Vauxhall Vectra, Vauxhall Astra, Vauxhall
Corsa, Peugeot 306, Volkswagen Golf, Rover 400 and Rover 200.

<HEADLINE> Qiao: China Opposes Taiwan's "Two Chinas" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
said here this evening that China strongly opposes Taiwan's
policy of "Two Chinas" and "One China, One Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Qiao made the remarks in his official talks with Mustafa
Kalemli, speaker of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the Taiwan authority has been pursuing the
so-called "elastic diplomacy" on the international platform in
recent years, adding that China firmly opposes this because the
Taiwan issue is linked with China's territorial integrity and the
feelings of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China also opposes any country which has
diplomatic ties with China to make official contacts with the
Taiwan authority.
</P>
<P>
Qiao expressed appreciation and gratitude to the Turkish
government for its "One China" policy and its position of not
establishing official contacts with the Taiwan authority.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese NPC chairman also briefed the host on the
situation of the economic development of China since the economic
reform started in the late 70s.
</P>
<P>
It is a common desire of China and Turkey to strengthen their
economic and trade cooperation, said Qiao, adding the two
governments will make joint efforts to encourage companies of
both countries to increase contacts.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kalemli said: "We attach great importance to
this visit by Chinese NPC Chairman Qiao Shi and his
delegation. There exist very friendly ties between China and
Turkey and there exists not any problem between the two countries
on the diplomatic platform."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Turkish parliament hopes to further develop
the existing good relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, Kalemli hosted a grand banquet in honor
of Qiao and his delegation.

<HEADLINE> Canada Hopes Clinton to Delay Anti-Cuban Provisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has
expressed the hope that U.S. President Bill Clinton will continue
to postpone implementation of the harshest elements of the
Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was passed last spring, attempts to strangle
Cuba by punishing its trading partners.
</P>
<P>
It allows U.S. companies and citizens to sue foreign firms that
"traffic in properties" seized by the Cuban government, and
prohibits executives of these firms from entering the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The law's extraterritorial nature has been strongly criticized
by U.S. allies, such as Canada. It has also been challenged in the
WTO and NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
In July, Clinton suspended the lawsuit provision for six months
in an effort to diffuse international outrage over the measures.
</P>
<P>
With Clinton now elected for a second term, the Canadian
government is hoping that the lawsuit provisions will continue to
be postponed.
</P>
<P>
"He made the decision with an election campaign on, and now he
won't have that kind of pressure...He will be able to move in the
direction of not applying court action," Canadian Trade Minister
Arthur Eggleton was quoted as saying by today's newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton must currently renew twice a year his decision to
suspend the lawsuit provisions.
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that he'll make it a more long-term thing so we
don't have to go through this every six months," Eggleton said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien raised the "No.1
irritant" during a brief phone call Wednesday to congratulate
Clinton on his election victory, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is expected to pursue the issue farther when he meets
Clinton later this month in Manila at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum.
