BRONCOS HAVE NO PROBLEM SENDING COWBOYS TO 0-4 IN PRESEASON
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DENVER _ With the NFL cutdown to 65, plus exemptions, coming up
Tuesday, you might say the Cowboys can see dead people.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys players and coaches alike watched in horror last night
as free-agent return specialist Darran Hall fumbled away the
opening two kickoffs in a 36-23 loss to Denver at Mile High
Stadium, and for the Cowboys it was all downhill after that.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (0-4) had its traditional preseason ``dress rehearsal''
go off _ well, a bit rocky _ before 69,143. The Cowboys are 1-13 in
preseason games since 1998, including 1-2 in the next-to-last, or
dress-rehearsal, game.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this preseason, Troy Aikman and the Cowboys'
first-team offense failed to find the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' first- and second-team defense _ in other words,
everyone who is going to play this season _ had an even longer
night as the Broncos picked up nearly eight yards a snap (223 yards
on 30 plays) in the first half alone.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be confirmed, but even Todd Helton of Coors Field
fame had a couple of hits off the Cowboys last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, we weren't able to put pressure on their
quarterbacks \RBrian Griese or Gus Frerotte\S. As a result, they
were able to hit some big plays in the passing game,'' Cowboys
coach Dave Campo said. ``Offensively, we moved the ball well in the
early going ... \Rthen\S didn't handle their blitz very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who was 7-for-20 for 95 yards, was sack-free for the
third time this preseason. But he was flattened a half-dozen times
just as he released the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys played without Emmitt Smith (calf strain) and Rocket
Ismail (sprained thumb). Subbing for Smith for the fourth
consecutive game, Chris Warren rushed for 45 yards on eight carries
(5.6 average).
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who played the entire first half, generated pass plays
of 24, 18 and 14 yards on strikes to Wane McGarity, Joey Galloway
and Jackie Harris, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We held back with some of our goal-line offense,'' Aikman
said. ``We had some trouble later on when they started sending
everybody on blitzes. With more of a game plan in place, we'll do
some things \Rin the regular-season\S to help out our guys
up-front.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until Arkansas rookie quarterback Clint Stoerner was in the
game did the Cowboys score actual touchdowns: Stoerner to Chris
Brazzell for 21 yards with four minutes, 55 seconds left in the
third quarter and Stoerner on a 50-yard scramble after fumbling the
snap with 7:01 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, however, had taken a 31-6 lead when Stoerner, who
has all but locked up the No. 3 quarterback job, and the Cowboys'
backups started making noise. Stoerner engineered drives that
produced 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys use preseason games to evaluate players, but this
didn't keep Campo from labeling this loss as ``disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely nothing went right for the Cowboys on this steamy
night in the Rockies, unless you applaud a preseason game in which
the front-liners are able to walk off under their own power.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys even managed to whiff against the NFL instant-replay
challenge system. There were two challenges, with both favoring the
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Aikman thought he had his first touchdown
pass of the preseason ... but instant replay took it away.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman hooked up with Galloway on a fade route from the Denver
14 on the Cowboys' second possession. Aikman lofted the ball into
the left corner of the end zone. Galloway ran under it. Cornerback
Terrell Buckley was toast on the play.
</P>
<P>
   To the naked eye, it was a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The replay camera, however, showed Galloway's second foot coming
down barely out of bounds. Broncos coach Mike Shanahan's challenge
was upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Although Aikman came right back to hit Galloway on the next play
to give Dallas first-and-goal at the 3, the Cowboys eventually had
to settle for a chip-shot field goal by rookie Tim Seder.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the first half _ which took 1 hour, 50 minutes to play
_ the Cowboys' coaching staff challenged a 21-yard touchdown pass
from Brian Griese to tight end Byron Chamberlain of Fort Worth
Eastern Hills in the left corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the replay camera agreed with the naked eye, and
Chamberlain's TD catch against Pro Bowl linebacker Dexter Coakley
stood up, giving the Broncos a 24-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The second half belonged to Stoerner and the Cowboys' offensive
backups. It wasn't much of a moral victory, however.

PARK SHOWS NO SIGN OF ILLNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chan Ho Park is proof that what doesn't kill you
will make you stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after being scratched in Florida with a flu bug so
intense he threatened the health of his Los Angeles Dodgers
teammates, Park went the distance in an overpowering 4-1 victory
over the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually felt better from being sick,'' said Park, who
struck out 10 and limited the Mets to just four hits. ``I wanted to
keep going today. They asked me how I felt after the eighth inning
and I didn't even answer them. I was going to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   After giving up a Derek Bell home run with one out in the first,
Park allowed just three singles and two walks the rest of the way
for the sixth complete game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with Bell's homer you just knew he was on his game,''
Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter said. ``Bell hit a good pitch, and we
knew our offense would get the run back. Chan Ho had a fastball
that was just blowing by hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, who had a complete game June 13 against Arizona, now has
allowed three or fewer runs in his past eight starts. Park is 3-3
during that stretch with a 2.68 ERA (16 earned runs, 53 innings
pitched). He has been particularly tough on the Mets, going 2-0
this year with an 0.56 ERA (1 ER, 16 IP).
</P>
<P>
   ``When you throw your fastball when you're ahead in the count,
and then throw your breaking ball when you're behind, it is tough
to make adjustments,'' New York manager Bobby Valentine said of
Park. ``He had good control with both pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Park became ill Wednesday in Florida, forcing the Dodgers to fly
him home ahead of the team and go with right-hander Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Bell always has hit Park well. Entering the game,
Bell was 6 for 14 lifetime with six RBI. ... Despite hitting three
homers in his past two games, Sheffield had been struggling, going
4 for 25 on the Dodgers trip to Atlanta and Florida. ``I told him
to just relax and we will get him some help,'' Johnson said.
``Obviously, he did not take my advice.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros hit his 28th homer in the third inning Saturday, his
first in three weeks. It was the 239th of Karros' career, which is
fourth in Dodgers history. He needs three more to catch Roy
Campanella for third. Duke Snider is first (389), followed by Gil
Hodges (361). ...
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's sellout was the Dodgers' sixth this season. Five have
come on promotional giveaway days and one was opening day. The team
has drawn 2,176,641 through 57 dates and are on a pace to draw
3,093,121. The Dodgers have drawn more than three million the past
four years and 14 times overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers do lead the league in one category. Saturday's
victory was the 39th come-from-behind win of the season. The Mets
are second with 35. ... What does Mike Piazza mean to the Mets'
lineup? In games when Piazza has an RBI, the Mets are 38-13. When
Piazza doesn't, the Mets are two games under .500.

SHAKY TIGER RETAINS LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ To almost desperate calls for any semblance of
a challenge, Tiger Woods discovered there were many takers in
Saturday's third round of the 82d PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf
Club. So, for the first time in his summer of utter domination,
Woods's walk into the history books must first hurdle some
competition.
</P>
<P>
   No-name competition, some will say, but it's competition just
the same, said Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of guys with a chance to win and I'm fortunate
to be one of them,'' said Woods, who struggled through some
back-side miscues but birdied the par-5 18th to finish a
2-under-par 70 for a 203 total, enabling him to retain the same
cushion he had started with _ one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Bob May (66) and Scott Dunlap (70) share second place, J.P.
Hayes (68_205) is alone in fourth, and Australian lefthander Greg
Chalmers (66_206) roared into fifth. Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal
moved into a share of sixth by tying the lowest round in major golf
history (63_207) on a day when scoring opportunities were
plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   The late slide appeared to frustrate Woods, who owned 54-hole
leads of 10 and six shots in overwhelming wins at the US Open and
British Open. Was it disturbing not to have added some cushion?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' said the man who is attempting to join Ben
Hogan as the only players to win three modern majors in a season,
as well as be the first to defend the PGA Championship since Denny
Shute in 1937. ``Given the fact I wasn't really striking the ball
that good, I'm OK with 70.''
</P>
<P>
   At 13 under, Woods is casting a shadow upon players who forced a
mad dash to the media guides.
</P>
<P>
   May, a 31-year-old PGA Tour rookie who honed his game in Europe,
started at 6 under, turned quietly in 34, then knocked down pins in
a four-birdie, five-par back-side 32.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap, 37, has the same number of PGA Tour wins as May and
Chalmers _ that is, zero _ and knew his pairing with Woods had
drawn smirks. ``Probably much like the golfing world, I was
wondering how I was going to do,'' he said after matching Woods
shot for shot, something far more heralded players have not been
able to do.
</P>
<P>
   His goal, said Dunlap _ who had previously made just four cuts
in the majors _ was to ``have enough guts to stand in there and go
toe-to-toe. Today, I passed that test.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods birdied both par 5s on the front (for the tournament, he
has played them in 11 birdies, one par), but so did Dunlap, to stay
just one back. Woods then birdied the ninth, Dunlap settled for
par, and the cushion was two.
</P>
<P>
   But crazy things were going on at Valhalla, and the rush up the
leaderboard was in high gear. Olazabal, most noticeably, was
lighting it up with his birdies (nine) and pars (nine), matching a
mark that has been recorded by six in the PGA Championship, 12 in
other majors.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, marquee names such as Phil Mickelson (31) and
Davis Love (34) made moves on the front to give Woods even more to
stare at as he peeked at leaderboards along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Very surprisingly, Mickelson (69) and Love (72) fell back with
back-side 38s to settle into a group at 7-under 209 and out of the
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   However, gentlemen of far less stature in the world of
professional golf did not follow such a route of reversal.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, for instance. Compared to May, Dunlap, and Chalmers, he
has a rich resume _ the 1998 Buick Classic victory _ but until his
birdie at the 18th sealed a round of 66, many were wondering how he
had come into view. The same could be said for Chalmers, whose
rookie year on the tour has yielded just two top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Trivial matters to Woods, who has stressed all week that he
cares not about historical matters, but only about the matter at
hand. As thousands of spectators filed home, many of them
satisified that some overwhelming underdogs had slapped the giant
with some of his own medicine, Woods was headed to the range.
Memories of some back-side miscues were fresh on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 12th hole, where Woods _ who had gone out in 33 and
birdied the par-5 10th to get to 15 under _ slammed a 3-wood left
into trees, recovered nicely with an 8-iron to the front slope,
then pitched to about 15 feet. ``Hit a good putt, just misread
it,'' said Woods, who turned his third bogey of the tournament into
his first double-bogey when he inexplicably pushed a 2-footer
right.
</P>
<P>
   When Dunlap drained his birdie putt, Woods was on the short end
of a three-shot swing, tied for the lead at 13 under.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rectified all that in a hurry,'' said Dunlap, who had
missed a handful of short birdie putts leading up to the 12th. ``I
felt like I kind of got let off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   He got back on the hook when he missed the green at the par-3
14th and made bogey, but was back tied for the lead when Woods came
over the top of a 6-iron at the par-4 15th. With arguably the worst
shot he's hit all year, Woods ended up in thick hay well left of
the pin, pitched down a slippery slope, but made bogey to fall to
12 under.
</P>
<P>
   As that sequence was unfolding, May was making par at the 18th
to finish at 12 under. The man whose claim to fame is a
come-from-behind win over Colin Montgomerie at the British Masters
was a stunning addition next to the imposing name of Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pressure on me,'' said May with a light laugh when told
that today he'd be paired with Woods. ``He's supposed to win. I'm
not.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove that he agreed with May, Woods reached the 542-yard
closing hole with a driver and 3-wood, then two-putted for birdie
to put himself in a position that fits quite comfortably. Twenty
times he has built a 54-hole lead. Eighteen times he has held it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of players out there, which is going to make it even
more of a challenge,'' said Woods. ``I am going to have a good time
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was arguing with him. Especially the no-name contenders.

GREATNESS COMES WITH HIGH PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ As you walk Valhalla Golf Club's grounds with
Tiger Woods, you can see and hear those who are magnets to his
hype.
</P>
<P>
   You see their faces, tanned and sunburned from camping out. They
wait for hours just to get a glimpse. They fight a variety of
annoyances _ dragonflies, bluegrass, photographers, reporters _
that might interfere with their Tiger moment. They are young and
old golfers who dream of being so talented; they are young and old
entrepreneurs who dream of being so rich; they are young and old
women who dream of being his girlfriend. If Tiger were to win every
major for the next decade, it wouldn't be enough to satisfy them.
</P>
<P>
   But the more you walk with Woods, the more you detect another
strong Valhalla emotion. Fatigue. Tiger Fatigue. There are
thousands of people who are simply tired of him.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of his commercials. Tired of his privileges (he is flanked
by two Jefferson County police officers at all times). Tired of the
way his language has become a sports cliche (remember, he was the
first to say, ``I didn't have my `A' game today''). And,
especially, tired of the way he has turned golf into a soap opera.
That is, you can watch for a few minutes and predict the ending.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the same Sunday during the final round of the PGA
Championship. Woods has a one-stroke lead over Scott Dunlap and Bob
May. He will be paired with May, who used to live a 20-minute drive
from the Woods home in California. When May left college, one of
his first sponsors was actor Joe Pesci. His mother is employed by
the PGA of southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap played with Woods Saturday and will tee off 10 minutes
before him Sunday. He is a thoughtful man who proudly praises
anyone from Ronald Reagan to Woods to Buddy Guy.
</P>
<P>
   May and Dunlap are great stories. They just won't be holding the
$900,000 first-place check. Woods will. When you can make
definitive statements like that in sports, it bothers some people.
The magic in our games is supposed to be rooted in the mystery of
them. But 24-year-old Tiger Woods has become the modern equivalent
of the old Yankees and Celtics. Just fill in the appropriate date
on the championship trophies, because you know they are going to
win them.
</P>
<P>
   That will be the story Sunday, and the contrarians will be
prepared. Dunlap heard some of them Saturday as he walked with
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I heard my name called as much as Tiger's,'' he
said. ``Not everyone wants the favorite. There is always the
rooting for the underdog, but I think the people could feed on the
fact that I was hanging in there and playing well (a 2-under-par
70). And then I fed off them. So it was just a nice relationship
going there.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Woods had his own relationships going. One young man
motioned for a policeman to meet him at the ropes lining the
fairways. When the officer arrived, the young man said, ``Can't you
talk to Tiger and ask him to hook a brother up with an autograph?''
The officer said no and went back to protecting Woods. As he stood
there, he heard many fans who were ready to see something new.
Woods was asked about that after his 2-under 70 _ his version of a
bad day. He was asked if he felt like Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm that big, that muscular,'' he said. ``From
the size of Goliath, from what they tell in fairy tales, he is a
pretty big guy. I'm only 6 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious Woods didn't like the question. So he was asked
if he could sense the upset vibe, raging like a groundswell, around
the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``People, I think, have an incessant need to yell and be heard,
whether they are yelling for me or yelling for Scott or for Bob or
whomever is playing. They just have the incessant need to yell. I
guess their vocal cords just need to be tested,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods knows he will hear from them again Sunday, for several
reasons. There are purists who don't want to see him threaten the
47-year-old record of Ben Hogan. There are those who like rooting
against corporations and, let's face it, with Nike outfitting him
and Buick taking care of his wheels, Woods is quite a
representative of corporate America. (The only problem I have with
that is this: Tiger is too young for Buick. I haven't seen too many
24-year-olds driving new Buicks. Have you?)
</P>
<P>
   It's only natural some players have tired of Woods. They aren't
irritated with the man as much as they are with the attention he is
given. They are asked about him constantly in interview sessions,
with some questions bordering on insulting, such as, ``Are you
intimidated by Tiger?'' With the emergence of Woods, there has been
less television time for other golfers on the Tour, unless those
golfers are fortunate enough to be in Woods's group.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wishes of some anti-Tiger people, Woods will win his
third major this year. He will do it because Saturday was the day
to beat him, and no one could do it. Dunlap missed 4- and 5-foot
putts. Jose Maria Olazabal torched the course with a 63 and is
still four shots behind. May played well, and he will play with
Woods Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After all that, look who is still in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic rises and collapses are both marketable, so the Tiger
backlash is not surprising. But it's a waste of time. As Woods
said, the only thing screaming will change is the screamer's vocal
cords. Sunday, at least, the leaderboard will remain intact.

OLAZABAL BEAMING AFTER 63 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ For so many months, so many tournaments, so
many rounds of golf, the pleasant smile was missing. Scowls, looks
of befuddlement, and slams of the golf club had taken its place.
</P>
<P>
   Golf, a game he had played with such success for nearly 15
years, had become difficult for Jose Maria Olazabal. ``The
confidence was gone,'' said the 34-year-old Spaniard, whose silky
skills had earned him his second Masters victory in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, but not forgotten, because what Olazabal did Saturday
pumped fuel into a spirit that had been a huge part of the game
since the Ryder Cup Matches of 1987, when he splashed upon the
world golf stage. In Saturday's third round of the PGA Championship
at Valhalla Golf Club, Olazabal posted the lowest score in major
golf history _ a brilliant 9-under-par 63. From hanging over the
cut line after his 76 Thursday, Olazabal this morning finds himself
just four shots behind Tiger Woods, tied for sixth at 9-under 203.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking to find more or less the same game as I had
yesterday,'' said Olazabal, in reference to Friday's 69 that
secured him a spot into the weekend. ``Obviously, as the round went
on, I liked my chances a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Six others have shot 63 in a PGA Championship; 12 others have
posted that number in either the Masters, US Open, or British Open.
No wonder Olazabal, whose woeful work with the driver rendered him
a part-time player at last September's Ryder Cup matches, was
gushing.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied the par-5 second, then made three more birdies to get
to the turn in 32. Nice, but on a day when Franklin Langham would
go out in 31 and others would jump out of the gate just as quickly,
Olazabal didn't have anyone looking through the record books. He
was, after all, just 4 under for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just relaxed today,'' he said. ``I was playing with
Blaine (McCallister) and he speaks Spanish, so we were relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   You may find players taking Spanish lessons and begging for
spots with McCallister because Olazabal put on a clinic on the
back. He hit every fairway (13 of 14 on the day) and every green
(15 total) coming in, made five more birdies, including four
straight starting at the par-4 12th, and shot 31.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing to think that this is a guy who shot 81 last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just confidence,'' said Olazabal, who needed just 24 putts,
though quite honestly his crisp, dead-on iron play had him in range
the entire backside. It brought back memories of the 61 he shot at
par-70 Firestone at the World Series of Golf in 1990.

   ``I think this one was as good as that,'' said Olazabal, who won
that tournament by 12 shots. Can he do it again? Shoot another 63
and overtake Woods? ``I think 18 under has a chance,'' he said,
laughing. ``But it is not certain, that is for sure.''

   MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT RESERVATION, Conn. _ The Prince still
reigns, but it was a hard reign Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   World Boxing Organization featherweight champion Prince Naseem
Hamed hammered out Augie Sanchez with a vicious right-left-right
combination at 2:34 of the fourth round at the Bingo Hall at
Foxwoods Casino. Sanchez was out before he hit the floor, but in
the rounds before he was knocked senseless, Sanchez dropped Hamed
once, wobbled him several times, bloodied his mouth, put a mouse
under his right eye, left a nasty welt under the left, and showed
Hamed to be a flawed diamond at best.
</P>
<P>
   Despite finding himself in the toughest fight of his career,
Hamed never wavered in his search for the perfect opening, however,
and when it came he exploded three punches off Sanchez's face that
drove him to the floor. Referee Michael Ortega knew instinctively
what he had seen. He grabbed Hamed, signalling the fight was over
even though Sanchez was valiantly trying to get up.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, Sanchez was up, but his eyes were dead and staring
into a crowd he could not see. Seconds later, Sanchez slumped back
to the floor, one body part at a time, and lay nearly motionless
for long minutes as doctors administered to him. Finally, he came
to, but he still was carried from the ring on a stretcher, a
precautionary measure that made clear the fierce punching power of
the tiny man from Sheffield, England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanchez was very lethargic in his responses,'' said ringside
physician Michael Schwartz. ``He was talking slurred. He had some
abnormal neurological responses in the pupils.''
</P>
<P>
   That will happen to you when the tiny Yemeni battler blasts you.
It is why Hamed, despite his many flaws, is 35-0 with 31 knockouts.
But those flaws are also why Sanchez (26-2) was rocking him and
knocking him about with the kind of authority that has to make
Hamed's family management team reconsider proposed fights with
Marco Antonio Barrera and Erik Morales, heavyhanded world champions
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Within three rounds, Sanchez had twice dropped Hamed, although
none was called a knockdown for reasons no one but Ortega could
understand. Sanchez rocked Hamed a third time as well, in the
second round. That Sanchez got no official credit for those
knockdowns was baffling to those who watched, because usually when
one is hit in the head and falls to the floor it is defined as a
knockdown. But apparently not when fistic royalty is involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt my feet were off balance, but I thought he should have
gotten the knockdown,'' even Hamed conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed's mouth was bloodied as well by then, and although he was
smiling, he was smiling with a face that had a nasty welt under the
right eye. Yet the powerful featherweight was doing damage to
Sanchez as well every round, and by the end of those three rounds,
Sanchez's face was swelling and bloodied and he was clearly
laboring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell when I hit him with my right hook, it really hurt
him,'' Hamed said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when those rights came in a roaring stream with a
left in between them. When they do, people tend to go down. And
that was the case with Sanchez, who later was taken to Backus
Hospital in Norwich, Conn., with what was believed to be a
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an exciting night,'' Hamed said. ``Drama, excitement.
I just hope there's nothing wrong with him. He hit me and he hurt
me a couple of times, but I got up and knocked him out. You do see
Naseem always get up and knock him out.''
</P>
<P>
   You saw it Saturday &UR;  &LR; night for sure, because even when Hamed was
bleeding and baffled by Sanchez's attack, he was always looking to
drop bombs on Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   When he did, the lights went out for Augie Sanchez. But while
they were still on, they may have revealed why Hamed has so
judiciously avoided the likes of Kennedy McKinney, Junior Jones,
Barrera, and Morales. According to Hamed, it has been the fault of
all those fighters who chose to avoid him. But after the way
Sanchez battered him before he fell, it made you wonder.

WILSON HEADS US TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
 TRIALS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The sport of gymnastics guarantees pain. Muscles are
torn, bones broken, wills shattered. Orthopedic surgeons call to
order their annual convention with a prayer that American kids
never will lose the urge to tumble like salmon hurtling up the
stream to Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the bountiful, unbridled glee that filled the FleetCenter
with the naming of the US men's Olympic gymnastics team
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night _ with no one happier than senior statesman John
Roethlisberger, now a three-time Olympian _ there was also the
obvious pain of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   In all, six men were chosen to compete in Sydney, including
26-year-old superstar Blaine Wilson, the five-time national
champion. But the blueprint designed more than a year ago by USA
Gymnastics, establishing the final selection process, made it clear
there were no guaranteed tickets Down Under for anyone placing
lower than fourth after the trials.
</P>
<P>
   For Jamie Natalie, who finished fifth overall, that ultimately
meant making the team as an alternate. Morgan Hamm and
Roethlisberger, who finished ranked sixth and seventh,
respectively, were given the two at-large berths. Natalie will get
to the Games and could perhaps compete, but he left here with the
alternate's ``A'' stitched over his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like they changed it,'' said a philosophical and
subdued Natalie, discussing the selection process. ``I mean, it's
been in place for over a year, and I think it worked. I knew it
beforehand, and I'm slightly disappointed at being an alternate,
but . . . it's not like (the process) was made up out of thin
air.''
</P>
<P>
   Natalie's name was the first one called when Bob Colarossi,
president of USA Gymnastics, stood on the corner of the floor
exercise mat and revealed the identities of the members of the 2000
Olympic team to the crowd of 13,182. Colarossi then named the Hamm
brothers, Morgan and Paul, followed by Steve McCain,
Roethlisberger, Sean Townsend, and the show-stopping Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   For approximately 40 minutes following the night's final
routine, all 17 gymnasts were held together in a waiting room well
off the floor while the nine-member selection committee reviewed
performance scores and considered the different competitive
scenarios that might await in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   They scribbled on pads, scratched heads, and figured in a way
head coach Peter Kormann said might only be understood by a
gymnastics expert. Sometimes decisions are centered in logic, but
finalized by instinct. Something told the powers that be that a
Roethlisberger-Morgan Hamm ticket could win key votes _ those of
the judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty tough,'' said Kormann, describing the selection process
that by definition defines lives and breaks hearts. ``It's a
difficult decision, and no one wants to make it, but we feel we've
assembled the best team possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Roethlisberger, who overcame major knee surgery to return to
competition, wept when his name was called. He badly botched
Thursday's preliminary round, scoring 12th, and began
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's finals lodged in seventh place. He needed to
string together a bunch of 9's, and he knew even that might not be
enough to turn heads. He stood up to the challenge, cranking off
marks of 9.45 (floor exercise), 9.475 (pommel horse), 9.675
(rings), 9.40 (vault), 9.425 (parallel bars), and 9.625 (high bar).
The old man was sailing to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the heart and soul of this team,'' said Townsend,
thrilled over Roethlisberger's inclusion. ``We need him on this
team, I'll tell you right now. If we're down, he'll bring us up.
He's like the father of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, though, Wilson is the star. He was first in
the prelims and finals at the nationals, and he repeated the feat
here in the Hub. Kormann calls him the Tiger Woods of gymnastics,
and he is convinced Wilson could win the all-around competition at
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Pete talks a lot,'' said the selectively brash Wilson.
``I don't like to think what he talks about.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson finished his day by sticking his landing on a vault that
earned a 9.95. His low mark for the day was a pair of 9.65s on the
pommel horse and vault. He's the closest thing the US men have had
to Mary Lou Retton. He only lacks the high-wattage smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to win,'' said Wilson. ``I think we are
going to win it all. Look at the amount of talent we had standing
on the floor.''

REVOLUTION HAVE A BLAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution discovered a winning formula
and revived their playoff hopes Saturday. They stifled Tampa Bay's
Carlos Valderrama and Mamadou ``Big Mama'' Diallo, the most potent
scoring combination in Major League Soccer, taking a 2-1 victory
with an 88th-minute goal by Imad Baba.
</P>
<P>
   Baba collected a clearance about 22 yards from the goal, calmly
controlled it, and slammed a shot just inside the left post for his
first goal in the run of play since May 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, who play host to Columbus Saturday, are tied
with Colorado for the eighth and final playoff spot with 36 points,
with five matches remaining. Tampa Bay has 47 points and is in
first place in the Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think quickly in those situations,'' Baba said.
``The ball came out of the defense and I had to decide whether to
hit it or cross it. I went for the shot and caught (Scott) Garlick
standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Garlick, the Mutiny goalkeeper, was not often standing still in
this match. But though Garlick made some excellent stops, this shot
was nearly impossible to save.
</P>
<P>
   The play capped an unlikely sequence of events, ending with a
ping-ponged clearance. Substitute Jamar Beasley bounced a shot
across the goal area, and Garlick attempted to make a diving stop
with his left hand. The shot went over the end line, and linesman
Richard Eddy signaled a corner kick. Garlick disputed the call, and
continued to do so after the match, pursuing the refereeing crew
led by Richard Heron.
</P>
<P>
   John Harkes's corner was cleared to Joe Franchino, who sent in a
right-footed shot that was cleared by Ritchie Kotschau. The
clearance was deflected by Steve Trittschuh, directly to Baba.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution concentrated more on stopping the Mutiny than on
creating offense for most of the match.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Eyre, playing only his second complete game and first game
since July 22, kept Diallo, who was playing as a lone striker, from
adding to his MLS-leading total of 22 goals. Leonel Alvarez helped
stifle Valderrama. And the Mutiny had little else to offer,
partially because of fatigue caused by a 2-1 overtime victory over
the MetroStars Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution closed down the midfield. But the Mutiny seemed
capable of closing the defense, as central defenders Joe Addo and
Trittschuh were seldom threatened until late in the match. The
Revolution's best offensive weapon was the dribbling of Wolde
Harris, who extended his scoring streak to six games, one short of
the league record set in 1997 by Raul Diaz Arce of D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   Harris converted his 14th goal of the season after Eric Wynalda
laid off a pass from the penalty arc to Baba on the right. Baba's
cross found Harris unmarked after Trittschuh had dropped off at the
far post.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, though, quickly squandered their advantage, as
they had in a 2-1 overtime loss to the MetroStars last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutiny earned a free kick in the 78th minute. Harkes and the
Mutiny's Manny Lagos clashed while Lagos was on the ground, leading
to a chaotic scene in which Diallo and Franchino also clashed and
Diallo was cautioned. Valderrama then confronted Rusty Pierce in
attempting to take the free kick, and nearly four minutes after the
foul the kick was finally executed. Valderrama curled the ball to
the far post, and Steve Ralston headed in the tying goal in the
81st minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``One mistake almost cost us the game,'' Revolution coach
Fernando Clavijo said. ``It's mind-boggling to me. It was the same
thing as in New York, and we paid the price for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo's substitutions, though, paid off. Wynalda provided a
reliable presence in the middle of the attack, and Beasley added
dynamism on the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very difficult game because of the pressure they
placed on us,'' Valderrama said. ``Diallo did not score because
they marked him well and they marked me well.''

SPARKS HOPE TO GET EVEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Sparks plan to get back to
team basketball, the very thing that got them this far, and the
very thing that was missing from the opener of the WNBA Western
Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   It's about survival now.
</P>
<P>
   After being the aggressors in the regular season, the Sparks
backed themselves up in a corner with their 77-56 devastating loss
to the three-time defending champion Houston Comets Thursday. Now
they must perform today in Game 2 of the best-of-three series or
look ahead to next year. Game 3 will be played at 7 p.m. Monday if
the Sparks even the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win Sunday,'' Sparks coach Michael Cooper, who will
be receive the WNBA Coach of the Year award before the game. ``Once
we do that then we can worry about Monday. We know that they (the
Comets) are going to come in (prepared) because they are the
champions and they know what winning is all about. I like our
chances, having to have a chance to win Sunday at home rather than
down in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   The roles are reversed now. In the conference finals last
season, the Sparks won the first game at home and dropped the next
two in Houston. But even for them to do the same they must play a
better brand of basketball than they did Thursday. It was the
Sparks sloppiest game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot ourselves in the foot,'' Cooper said. ``We had 23
turnovers and that is so uncharacteristic of us. Throwing the
basketball away no one is going to get into their rhythm. We were
getting shots. The ones that we were getting were the ones that we
had to take because we felt like it was our time to shoot. And that
is not like us. I think we had something like 10 or 11 assists.
We're the No. 1 team in the league as far as assists. We have to
take care of the basketball. We're a very unselfish team. When
we're doing that we're on top of our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the game tape was difficult, Sparks center Lisa Leslie
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe that for such a big game that we came out
with such a lack of intensity and that was probably the most
disappointing part,'' she said. ``It would have been one thing if
we would have made the effort, but we were in quicksand for some
reason. I mean everybody. We just have to come out with much better
intensity level and play harder and get after the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the lack of intensity, part of the problem was allowing
the league's most valuable player Sheryl Swoopes ``to get into her
rhythm,'' Cooper said. Swoopes was 5 of 8 for 10 points in the
first half and finished with a game-high of 22. Also Cynthia Cooper
scored 15 of her 21 points in the first half. He said the Sparks
must contain at least one of the Comets' Big Three players, which
includes Tina Thompson, in order to win.
</P>
<P>
   Houston coach Van Chancellor declined to say what the Comets did
different defensively, but they were doubling down on Leslie and
DeLisha Milton in the low post and doing a great job of setting up
traps. The Sparks shot 36 percent from the field; well below the 44
percent they shot in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor said the Sparks loss was definitely a wakeup call for
them and expects a more competitive game today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned. I think L.A. has a lot of pride,'' Chancellor
said. ``They will play hard, but I also think we'll play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks guard Tamecka Dixon, one of many who struggled
offensively, going 1 of 9 from the field, said the way to even the
series is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at it it's a very basic thing that we need to do
- control the boards, execute our offense and keep the turnovers
down,'' Dixon said.

SHEFFIELD MAKING HIS CASE FOR MVP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One campaign has moved out of town, and another
has rolled in to take its place. Sheffield 2000 is holding its
convention at Dodger Stadium this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield has been stating an eloquent case for winning the
National League Most Valuable Player Award, hitting three home runs
in 21 hours against the New York Mets' strong pitching, including
his 39th and 40th homers of the season in the Los Angeles Dodgers'
4-1 victory Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Sheffield was able to show off for the New York
press. It helps that Sheffield's display Saturday occurred on
national TV, in the second of three consecutive Dodgers appearances
on Fox's game of the week. It helps that he is winning the
comparison with MVP rival Mike Piazza (who homered and singled in a
run to lead the Mets Friday, and sat out the ensuing day game).
</P>
<P>
   It helps, as well, that this is happening at the end of a
two-week period in which Sheffield's candidacy has been taken
seriously for the first time by the national press. It is making
its way onto the cover of Baseball Weekly and into Sports
Illustrated, and earning the Dodgers star opportunities to tell his
story on ESPN's ``Sunday Conversation'' and major-league baseball's
weekly media conference call.
</P>
<P>
   An MVP candidacy is, after all, no one-man endeavor. It requires
contributions not just from the player but from team publicists and
the news media (even before the votes are cast by members of the
baseball writers association), and from teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the weakness of the Sheffield candidacy - the
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   To win the award, Sheffield must fend off Piazza, Colorado's
Todd Helton, St. Louis' Jim Edmonds, Chicago's Sammy Sosa,
Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero, San Francisco's Barry Bonds and Jeff
Kent, and Arizona pitcher Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   And he must overcome all the Dodgers players who have dragged
the team out of the pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if you're a member of the Chicago Cubs, you can be an MVP
on a losing team. Hank Sauer won the award in 1952 (when the Cubs
finished fifth), Ernie Banks in 1958 (fifth) and 1959 (fourth),
Andre Dawson in 1987 (sixth and last). The Cubs aren't supposed to
win.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are supposed to win. No Los Angeles Dodger has been
MVP in a disappointing season for the club; Maury Wills won it in
1962, when the team finished in a first-place tie before losing a
playoff to the San Francisco Giants, and Sandy Koufax, Steve Garvey
and Kirk Gibson won it in pennant years.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's 40th homer tied him for the major-league lead with
Sosa and equaled the Los Angeles Dodgers record set by Piazza in
1997. Sheffield and Helton are the only National Leaguers among the
leaders in batting, homers, RBI and runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter the numbers Sheffield puts up, his chances are
hurt by the fact he cannot be said to be leading his team to a
title. You have to go back only as far as 1997, when the Cubs'
wild-card playoff berth earned Sosa the MVP over the more
productive Mark McGwire, to know a tough decision will go to the
guy with the better team.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a presidential candidate, a would-be MVP cannot get up in
front of the national and declare he is ``my own man,'' separate
from the team of which he is a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe (that) the team's performance should reflect
on one individual,'' Sheffield said Saturday after raising his
average to .333 and his RBI total to 96. He thinks the voters'
weakness for winners cost him MVP Awards in the election years of
1992 (when he nearly won the Triple Crown as a San Diego Padre) and
1996 (when he was a Florida Marlin).
</P>
<P>
   And Sheffield is right. The award should honor the best
performer, period. It would be simpler and fairer if ``Most
Valuable Player'' were edited to ``Player of the Year.'' The
originators of the award in the 1930s obviously didn't intend to
restrict it to contenders - four of the first eight National League
MVPs played for fourth-place teams.
</P>
<P>
   But being right won't help him if his teammates don't help him.
If the season ended now, it would be a close MVP race among a
handful of men. It would boil down to the players from
playoff-bound teams. Bonds and Kent would split the Giants vote.
Piazza would win.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield would be out of luck after the greatest batting season
in Los Angeles Dodgers history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say he's carried us as far as we've come, in spite of
our shortcomings,'' catcher Chad Kreuter said. ``He's our MVP, and
hopefully he'll be the league's MVP. That will be determined by how
we play down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their
left fielder.

WOODS FORCES CHALLENGERS TO SHOOT LOW

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ There has to be a fall guy for Tiger Woods'
gargantuan game, lest some of the world's greatest golfers are left
looking amateurish. Human nature always plays through and so it's
no surprise a scapegoat has emerged this week during the PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Valhalla Golf Club. None of the pin placements Saturday
provided an easier target than the Jack Nicklaus-designed,
7,167-yard layout. The course is young and straightforward and
understated. It has a history shorter than a lot of the birdie
putts Jose Maria Olazabal was draining on his way to a third-round,
course-record, 9-under-par 63.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, when people flocked to the course Saturday to watch a
golf tournament and a spirited game of limbo broke out, the
14-year-old course came under attack. The greens were too soft, the
par-5s too approachable, the hazards too benign, blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   The truth? The golf course wasn't playing that easy; Woods, the
winner of six tournaments (including two majors) this year, simply
has become so tough to beat the golfers who advance to the weekend
have to wield their clubs like an LAPD baton.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else has to try to beat the course into submission or
risk being badly beaten by the most dominant player of this or
arguably any other year.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 24-year-old turned professional in 1996, Saturday was
known as moving day on the Tour. Not anymore. Woods reports to the
starting line with his pedal to the metal and never lets up. Moving
Day has been replaced by Speed Week.
</P>
<P>
   There's no easing into the fast lane anymore unless you're
prepared to get lapped. There's a new motto on the Tour: If you
can't stand the pace, get out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't play four good rounds, he's going to go out and
win by 10 shots,'' Dunlap said of Woods. ``He's not easing into
anything. He's trying to birdie every hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods carded three birdies on the front nine Saturday to flit to
15-under par before giving back three strokes with a double bogey
six at No.12 and a bogey 5 at No.15. Dunlap putted as if he was
afraid of waking up the Fates and settled for a score of 70 - same
as Woods, who retained a one-shot lead over Dunlap and Bob May.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mayday for the Lynwood native after he shot a 72 on
Thursday. Even-par used to be considered steady; in the Woods era
it's cause for concern. May found himself six shots behind the
front-running Woods before the first thunderstorm had softened the
greens.
</P>
<P>
   May, 31, managed to pull himself back into contention with
consecutive 66s. Olazabal needed more magic than that after an
opening 76 (10 shots worse than Woods). If he wanted to make any
kind of a mark here, the Spaniard knew a sizzling round Saturday -
hard on the heels of his second-round 68 - was compulsory.
</P>
<P>
   His performance would have earned him a bear hug from Bela
Karolyi. Olazabal's nine-birdie binge catapulted him from a tie for
30th into a tie for sixth and bumped into the background the
course-record tying 65s Tom Watson and Franklin Langham had posted
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   All told, there were 24 sub-70 rounds Saturday. A record 53
golfers broke par, surpassing by 15 the previous record set at
Riviera Country Club in 1995 (the year before Woods burst onto the
professional scene).
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Tiger is making us work harder and we have to
improve our games so we can have a slim chance of beating him,''
Olazabal said. ``That is the reason why the scores are low; we know
that we have to attack the golf course. We have to attack the
flags. We have to go for a low number to have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   They have to hope Woods stumbles on the par-5s, which he has
played in 11-under-par to this point. The back nine bit him
Saturday but it was only a surface wound; after all, look who's
leading with 18 holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Tiger,'' the 50-year-old Watson said, ``and you
have to have your A-game on every shot, seems like. That raises the
bar. He has raised the bar higher than anybody has ever raised it,
as far as between him and the rest of the field.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes Woods' dominance so great for golf. By
doggedly closing in on him, the field is elevating the game.
Whatever happens today, golf will never be the same.
</P>

IT WAS UGLY, BUT IT WAS JUST AN EXHIBITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Cowboys were pushing it last night. Pushing
extremely close to the bare-minimum limits of how NFL exhibitions
must be judged and defined.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of a major injury to a major player (and the Cowboys
escaped again in that area), nothing that happens in the preseason
can normally be classified as a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   This stuff just doesn't matter, be it good or bad. August brings
us such a weak imitation of the real thing, it almost makes a
mockery of where the NFL will be headed by Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   A skinny return man/receiver named Darran Hall has about as much
chance of making the Cowboys' final cut as Jerry Hall _ you know,
the tall lady from Mesquite. The former Mrs. Jagger, to be exact.
But that was Darran last night, fumbling the opening kickoff to set
up a Broncos' touchdown, and then proved the first one was no fluke
by also fumbling the next kickoff to set up a field goal. Jerry
couldn't have done any worse, yet Darran wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   Even by exhibition standards, this was a disorganized mess that
despite denials all around, is certain to cause a tad of self-doubt
at Valley Ranch, be it the coaching staff or the players.
</P>
<P>
   A disaster? Only the exhibition label prevents that kind of an
over-reaction. But the Cowboys came in here with every intention of
using the next-to-last preseason warmup as the traditional dress
rehearsal. Instead, they were undressed on offense, on defense and
on special teams. A total failure, you can correctly call it. But
keep repeating after Dave Campo and me, ``it's only preseason ...
it's only preseason ... it's only ...''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't allow the final score to fool you. This was much
worse than 36-23. With the first units playing the first half, the
Cowboys were behind 24-6 at intermission, and as bad as the defense
was, the offense was more disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Emmitt Smith didn't play, and hasn't in the exhibition
season. But the Cowboys have been end-zone shy the past few seasons
with Emmitt, and that's a nasty trend that has continued without
him now that the old offense became the new offense.
</P>
<P>
   Two sharp drives on their first two possessions left the Cowboys
with first-and-goal at the 7, and first-and-goal at the 3 . Rookie
kicker Tim Seder had to rescue both with his toe. On the second
possession, a guy in a striped shirt did raise both hands,
signaling touchdown when Joey Galloway grabbed a nice fade pass
from Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Denver coaching staff watched the replay on the
Jumbotron at Mile High Stadium, they saw the obvious. Galloway had
failed to ``drag'' with his right shoe, and he had stepped on the
sideline. The TD was overruled on the challenge. But the Cowboys
still had a first down at the 3, and didn't come close to a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, Aikman was right with this explanation: ``We held
back with some of our goal-line offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who says Denver wasn't ``holding back'' with some of
its goal-line defense?
</P>
<P>
   If Campo had any intention of giving third-quarter time to
Aikman (it was mentioned as a possibility), he quickly forgot that
after what was seen in the first half. Aikman was repeatedly
wearing Broncos defender around his neck, and took many more hits
than Campo could be comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   Denver came with the blitz, and the Cowboys didn't handle it.
Their last two offensive possessions went nowhere, due to the
blitz. Emmitt is missed in these situations. So is starting
fullback Robert Thomas, who sat out last night with a knee injury.
Both are blitz-stuffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more of a game plan in place, we'll do some things to
help our guys up front when they start sending everybody like
that,'' said Aikman, meaning in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite was the Cowboys' defense. Little if any
pressure was applied to Broncos quarterback Brian Griese. The blitz
didn't work, and the front four couldn't get there.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, rookie cornerback Kareem Larrimore, in particular,
took a pass-coverage beating. A couple of old pros, Rod Smith and
Ed McCaffrey, repeatedly went right at Larrimore, and schooled him
with no mercy. But with the lack of pressure on Griese, Larrimore
became a sitting duck back there. Next question, with answer still
pending: Was the kid's confidence shattered?
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the repeated breakdowns on special teams, and it was an
evening that had disaster written all over it. Except, of course,
that exhibition games don't count. Don't count for anything.
</P>
<P>
   It is the only consolation for the Cowboys.

STUDENT GETS PERFECT SCORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Dennis McCarthy is a columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News.) 
(Editors: Van Nuys is an area of Los Angeles.) 
By DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a lot of baloney, Kim Todd says, this notion
that kids from lower economic neighborhoods somehow won't receive
the primary education to compete academically with kids who go to
schools in more well-heeled areas.
</P>
<P>
   She'll put her kids from a United Nations mix of families living
in Van Nuys up against the kids from Beverly Hills 90210 any day,
especially that little girl from Trinidad in her second-grade
class.
</P>
<P>
   Her name's Kirsten Pierre and she's perfect _ the smartest
first-grader in the country in math and reading, according to the
Stanford 9 Achievement Test given to California's public school
kids last year.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't miss one question.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-nine questions in math, 69 right answers. One hundred and
six questions in reading, 106 right answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means 99.9 percent of the nation's first-graders are
below her,'' says Todd, her teacher at Valerio Primary Center _ a
new first- and second-grade school that opened last October because
the primary grades were getting too crowded at nearby Valerio
Elementary School and education leaders believed smaller schools
with only younger kids would produce smarter kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``From every school district in the country, Kirsten's at the
very top, the best,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a kid, now 7, who walks some pretty mean streets in
Van Nuys to get to school every day.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten's a quiet little girl, Todd says. Most of her kids are.
When you have eight different languages being spoken in your
classroom, kids tend to listen a little harder to learn the one
they know they'll need to learn most English.
</P>
<P>
   It bothers this 24-year veteran teacher when people shake their
heads and say what a shame it is. How will these kids ever compete?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's baloney,'' she says. ``I've taught in public and private
schools, and kids are kids. It's how they're taught, and what goes
on in that classroom when the doors are closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the kids are motivated to learn, they'll learn. And these
kids are very motivated. They're incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a little girl from Trinidad to score higher in math and
reading than all the other first-graders in this country, there has
to be a little something extra going on.
</P>
<P>
   That you find inside the home Margaret and Lucien Pierre worked
so hard to buy last year just off Sepulveda Boulevard and Vanowen
Avenue in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to instill in all our three children that
education is very important,'' said Margaret, who was a
schoolteacher in Trinidad for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised in a family with 10 children, six girls and four
boys. My mother told her daughters don't wait to be married, for a
man to take care of you. You take care of yourself. Get an
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we did, every one of us,'' she said. ``I want that same
thing for my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can't expect it by just saying the words, this mother
says. You have to back them up with action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go inside the classroom, and see what is going on,
even if it's only five minutes a week,'' Margaret says.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten's mom spends a heck of a lot more time than five minutes
a week inside her classroom, Kim says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She comes in at least once a week to read to the kids, and
she's at school volunteering all the time,'' the 42-year-old
teacher says. ``She is a wonderful mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret understands busy schedules and how tough it is for many
working moms to break away to visit their child's classroom, but
she can't understand the mothers who do have the time but don't use
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many mothers who spend so much time having their
hair or nails done every week, but they don't spend one minute
inside their child's classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no idea of what's going on behind those closed
doors. In your heart to be a good teacher you have to love it, and
I have seen in Ms. Todd's classroom that she loves it. And, in
turn, these kids love her.''
</P>
<P>
   The smartest first-grader in the country said Friday she wants
to become a veterinarian some day, but that might change,
considering she's only 7 and, well, things change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of surprised I got all the questions right on the
test, but my mom says she wasn't,'' Kirsten said. ``She just said
she was proud of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Todd's right. It is a lot of baloney this notion that kids
from the other side of the tracks somehow won't receive the
education to compete with kids from well-heeled areas.
</P>
<P>
   They will, with the help of good teachers and parents.

 &HT;    A burger like no other
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMISBURG, Ohio _ At high noon in Market Square on a sweltering
summer day, the faithful are lined up in front of the city's famed
Hamburger Wagon, waiting for their lunch-hour fix.
</P>
<P>
   No Coke. No Pepsi. No fries. Just plain burgers with salt,
pepper, onion and pickle _ made the way loyal wagon customers have
been craving them since 1913, when founder Sherman ``Cocky'' Porter
first wheeled in his iron skillet to help feed his hungry
townspeople after the devastation of the Great Flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's the flavor,'' said 34-year-old Miamisburg
resident Tracey Caudill, who says she's been hooked on Porter
burgers since the age of 4. ``It's the outside crunchiness (of the
meat) and the salt and pepper mixture, and having the pickle and
onion cut just right. It's the whole package you crave.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough so that customers will drive from miles around to buy as
many as a dozen or more of the petite burgers stuffed into plain
white paper bags. Nobody buys just one, not unless they want some
friendly abuse from the wagon chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Endicott, a 57-year-old day laborer, usually buys four
whenever he drives up from his home in Middletown. ``I've been
coming here the last 40 years. I never miss the wagon,'' Endicott
said. ``It's a different taste than any other hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hamburger Wagon is the city's ``No. 1 attraction'' and has
been a focal point on Market Square for decades, said Bobbye Sweny,
president of the Miamisburg Historical Society. The burgers are so
much a part of the town identity that former residents who return
to visit Miamisburg ``can't go home again until they've had a
Porter burger,'' she said. ``It's always one of the first things
they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Dick Church credits the Hamburger Wagon with helping him
win office in 1992. ``The owner agreed to put one of my stickers in
the (wagon) window, and I knew then I was going to be elected
mayor, because everybody in town goes to the Hamburger Wagon,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Current owner Gary Jestice, whose wife, Judy Ladd Jestice,
bought the Hamburger Wagon from Sherman Porter's grandson in 1970,
will talk at length about the wagon's history and its meaning to
the community. But don't ask the 58-year-old Miamisburg resident to
reveal the hamburger's secret recipe _ one that Cocky handed down
to his grandson and, in turn, to Jestice, who started working in
the wagon when he was just 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it the old-fashioned way. That's an overused word, I
know, but we're not just paying lip service, like that other guy
who's always advertising,'' he said. Jestice manages the wagon from
his home, where he cares full time for his wife, now bedridden with
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sherman Porter himself, who earned his nickname ``Cocky''
by carrying his 5-foot-2-inch frame with Napoleonic bearing, Porter
burgers are small but mighty. At 85 cents for a single and $1.70
for a double, they're still a bargain by the bag full, Jestice
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we raise the price, we hear from people. But, listen,
we'll keep the quality the same,'' Jestice said. ``If I have to go
out of business, I will. But I will never cheapen the product.''
</P>
<P>
   James Morton, a 71-year-old who has been coming to the wagon
since the 1940s, said he suspects the secret recipe is much like
the one used by his own mother. ``Back in the days when there
wasn't much food, you put bread in there to make it spread,'' he
said. ``She used to make her hamburger with onion and everything
mixed right in it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1913 Flood, when hundreds of Miamisburg residents were
homeless and hungry, ``Cocky'' Porter, then a painter and a
handyman, approached the local Red Cross with an idea. ``He
volunteered that he had a recipe of his own that could stretch the
hamburger back then and feed more people,'' Jestice said.
</P>
<P>
   When the flood waters subsided and life in Miamisburg returned
to normal, residents found they couldn't live without Porter's
burgers. They pressured him to start selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Porter had no intention of going into the hamburger business,
but ``when people kept asking and asking, he said, 'What the heck.'
He bought enough (ingredients) for 500 hamburgers, priced them at 5
cents apiece and darned if he wasn't sold out by noon,'' Jestice
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jestice won't reveal how many hamburgers are sold at the wagon,
which is open 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. seven days a week (it closes an
hour earlier in winter). ``I can sell as many as I make _
literally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamburger assembler Troy Brennan would say only that the wagon
slices through 350 pounds of large onions each week. Both pickle
and onion are freshly sliced and placed on an open bun just before
serving. The instant the cooked meat comes from the grease-filled
skillet, the finished burger is slapped together, stacked and
stuffed into paper bags.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rucker, 55, drove his Dodge Ram 1500 pickup from
Centerville to the wagon, where he buys anywhere from three to six
Porter burgers at a time. He says part of the attraction is the
teasing he gets from wagon employees. ``If I say I need three, they
look at me and say, 'Hey, you need six of them, not three,' ``
Rucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Hess, 18, recently discovered this banter on his first
visit to the wagon, after he was dispatched from Serra Chevrolet to
pick up an order for his fellow workers, including a burger without
onion and pickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No fixins'?'' the cook railed. ``What am I supposed to do with
them?''
</P>
<P>
   Jestice put new wheels on the wagon when his wife purchased it
in 1970. Then in 1980, he had the carriage frame and running gear
rebuilt by an Amish carriage works. ``These things were not
designed to last 85 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Porter burger was, and it will continue to flourish as
long as people crave something fresh and a little different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unique,'' said 23-year-old Miamisburg resident Craig
Suttman. ``It's not like McDonald's or Burger King. You can't get
this anyplace else.''

   The play's the thing _ for managerial lessons

<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Palm Beach Gardens author John Whitney has
some advice for anyone who wants to be a good leader: All you ever
need to know, you learned in English class.
</P>
<P>
   William Shakespeare, the greatest of all English playwrights _
whose 400-year-old tragedies, comedies and histories might still be
on the shelf with your old yearbooks _ can help solve any problem
you have.
</P>
<P>
   Want to boost morale? King Henry V shows how at the Battle of
Agincourt, when he convinces his troops, who are outnumbered by the
French 5-to-1, that their small number is to their advantage. The
troops rally for battle and win.
</P>
<P>
   Not sure how to approach a hostile board member or employee?
Consider Mark Antony's funeral speech for Caesar, in which he
redirects the crowd's loyalty to himself from their beloved Brutus,
the assassin. He assures them, ``I come to bury Caesar, not to
praise him,'' and defers to Brutus just enough so that his
listeners never know they're being persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, a popular business professor at Columbia University in
New York, believes The Bard is ideal for today's executives and
middle managers.
</P>
<P>
   He has co-written a new book, ``Power Plays: Shakespeare's
Lessons in Leadership and Management ``(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $26),
with Tina Packer, the founder, president and artistic director of
Shakespeare &AMP; Co. in Lenox, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He uses excerpts from Shakespeare, and his own experiences as a
so-called turnaround expert, to teach good management practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare wrote more forcefully about leadership and
management issues than any writer before or since,'' Whitney, 72,
said last week in a phone interview from New York. ``The
fundamentals of human nature haven't changed much. The struggle for
power and the requirements for leadership are much the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney says ``Henry V `` shows the monarch's willingness to
listen closely to his troops. ``Othello `` illustrates the danger
of passing someone over for promotion. ``Hamlet `` teaches us about
analysis-paralysis, the failure to create and maintain a strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney draws parallels between the shortcomings of
Shakespeare's protagonists and those of today's business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Macbeth and James Robinson, former chairman and
chief executive of American Express, have much in common. Like
Macbeth, Robinson became obsessed with power for power's sake and
lost his edge by indulging in the perks of corporate power, Whitney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Al Dunlap, former chief executive of Boca Raton-based Sunbeam,
is a lot like Coriolanus, a successful warrior who is banished from
Rome because he fails to realize that power shifts, and that
military prowess does not necessarily translate into political
power, Whitney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot build a company with a chain saw and ax,'' he said.
``All managers today face the problem of balancing between the
short term and long term. What Dunlap was looking at was just the
short term. He had no view of the long term at all.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Texas Instruments lost out to start-ups during the
personal computer boom of the 1980s and early '90s because they
became complacent, Whitney said. In other words, they stopped
listening to the Jack Falstaffs of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Falstaff, friend and adviser to Prince Hal, the future Henry V,
is innovative and unafraid to say what he thinks. Whitney believes
all leaders need Falstaffs to keep them honest and competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people who'll say 'The emperor has no clothes.' You
have to nurture that, and I think it's more important today than in
Elizabethan times because the information flow is better and the
opaway from the command-and-control thing, which is so
comfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, who commutes between New York and Palm Beach Gardens,
where he lives with his wife, Marcia, in PGA National, received a
bachelor's degree in literature from the University of Tulsa.
During his senior year there, an English professor turned him on to
Shakespeare, and he's been a devoted fan ever since.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Whitney owned a successful advertising
agency and consulting firm in Tulsa before enrolling in the
advanced management program at Harvard in 1966. Four years later,
he became associate dean of the Harvard Business School, and in
1972 was hired by Pathmark Supermarkets to turn around the New
York-based chain.
</P>
<P>
   Pathmark's stock was trading at $2 a share when Whitney signed
on. Five years later, when Whitney left, the chain was turning a
profit and the stock was on its way to commanding $100 and up a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney said he learned from ``Henry V'' to visit with employees
in the field at least three times a week and from Iago, the valiant
fighter in ``Othello'' who becomes vindictive, to beware of people
passed up for promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime an outsider comes in to run a company, he or she
should realize the sharp knives are going to be out,'' he said.
``It's just something that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, who still does consulting work for Fortune 500
companies, said he's encouraged by what he sees of today's leaders,
namely Jack Welch, GE's chief executive, who requires training
programs for everyone, including executives, and encourages
commitment to the company's mission through pay incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think leadership in corporate America is the best it's ever
been,'' Whitney said. ``Just look at how well we're doing compared
with the rest of the world.''

Wagon, waiting for their lunch-hour fix. No Coke. No Pepsi. No

   PET-INSURANCE _ Basel the sock-eating dog has taken her owners,
Erin and Sean McGould of Palm Beach Gardens, on an emotional roller

Basel's antics. The McGoulds pay $297 a year for a pet insurance

   RUSSIA-SUBMARINE (Moscow) _ Developments in efforts to salvage
the Kursk, the submarine that sank a week ago in the Barents Sea.
By Patrick E. Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-XENOPHOBIA (Dessau) _ Anti-immigrant incidents have
reached a critical point in Germany, particularly in the former
communist east, where a decade of unsettling change has spawned
youths who blame foreigners for taking their money, their jobs,
just about everything. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-MODERNIZE (Samsat) _ Up and down the Euphrates and Tigris
Rivers in southeastern Turkey, villages inhabited since the
beginning of civilization are being flooded into watery oblivion by
a vast dam system. The destruction is the price of progress. The
Turkish government is in the final years of its largest public
works project, an ambitious effort to quench an insatiable appetite
for electricity, irrigate arid land and bring jobs to this
impoverished region. By Douglas Frantz.
</P>
<P>
   POLAND-COMMUNIST-PAST (Warsaw) _ In an interview, the former
head of the Polish secret services talks about the continuing
security risks of hidden collaboration with the former communist
government. He testified against Lech Walesa, the anti-communist
hero and Nobel peace prize laureate, in a trial that charged and
eventually cleared Walesa of collaborating with the communist-era
secret services and reporting on the activities of his friends and
fellow shipyard workers. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY-YOUTH-DAY (Rome) _ Journal: About 2 million young

   ORE-LOGGING (Coos Bay, Oregon) _ Logging restrictions in the
Pacific Northwest have hit lumberjacks hard, especially in Oregon's
central coast. But in Coos Bay, they are fighting back. Out of work
loggers are being trained to answer phones for support-services
lines, creating 350 new jobs, and maybe 200 more to come. But that
kind of work is a far cry from the tough-guy work they are used to
and has brought many lifestyle changes. By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-SPY (Albuquerque) _ Of all the unusual aspects of what
is shaping up to be one of the most important espionage case of the
post-Cold War era _ the trial here of Wen Ho Lee, a former Los
Alamos National Laboratory nuclear scientist _ none is more
striking than the fact that it is not an espionage trial at all. By

   VIDEO-GAMES-SHAKEOUT (San Francisco) _ Despite falling revenue
and earnings at Electronic Arts, the world's largest independent
video game company, the mood at the company's Silicon Valley
corporate headquarters is one of great optimism. Part of the reason
is that executives believe they have emerged relatively unscathed
from a cyclical, and expected, downturn as the industry is moving
to a new generation of consoles. At the same time, executives
assert they have made key investments they say will take the
company to new levels of prominence. Whether they have succeeded

Kirkpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   WIRELESS-FUTURE (Undated) _ Disregarding skepticism that the
wireless Internet might never live up to its hype if consumers get
turned off by today's bland offering of applications on mobile
devices with tiny screens, more than two dozen New York wireless
Internet companies have been spawned within what has become a
Darwinian environment for firms solely focused on the Web. New York
is emerging as the nation's center for wireless Internet
applications, financing and advertising. Eager to expunge the
dot-com taint, much of Silicon Alley is reinventing itself,
wirelessly. There is even a new buzzword to describe the scene:
``unstrung.'' By Simon Romero.

   DOWNLOADER-FREELOADERS (Palo Alto, Calif.) _ Two scientists have

files and not giving back to their electronic community. By John
Markoff.

   AMBUSH-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ It's called ``ambush marketing,''
and it refers to advertisers' attempts to capitalize on a

official sponsorships for the Summer Olympic Games selling for

 &HT;    Efforts underway to broaden seminary curriculum for Hispanics
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The booming Latino population is creating new
challenges in ministry and highlighting a void in Hispanic
theological education that seminaries nationwide, including all
three in Austin, are trying to address.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching theology and addressing spiritual needs means
understanding the Hispanic culture, history and vision for the
future, which are not an integral part of the regular seminary
curriculum. As a result, seminaries are developing or housing
programs that can fill the gap, helping seminarians develop their
role as educators, counselors and community activists.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary will be home to the
new Center for Hispanic Ministry in a collaborative effort with the
Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest and the Lutheran
Seminary Program in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   With a $470,000 grant from the Teagle Foundation of New York,
programs are being assembled for the ecumenical center. Seminarians
from the three schools will use the program to learn how to
minister in Hispanic communities.
</P>
<P>
   While the center takes shape, the Asocacion para la Educacion
Teologica Hispana, will be in full swing at the Presbyterian
seminary beginning today, having moved from Columbia Presbyterian
Theological Seminary in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The association is supported by 37 seminaries in North America
and Puerto Rico and includes Roman Catholic, Pentecostal, Baptist
and all mainline denominations. Officials said the association
moved its administrative staff to Austin because of its central
location and to be closer to Southwest states with larger Hispanic
populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main purpose is to support Hispanic theological education
on a national level,'' said Ebenezer Negron, the association's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the association hosts the Hispanic Summer Program, an
intensive two-week theological and worship program. Besides
offering theological education, the program breaks down barriers
between people of different faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of encounter is one of the major contributions that
we make,'' said Ismael Garcia, the Hispanic program dean and
professor of Christian ethics at the Austin seminary. ``What we are
doing is finding common ground so that pastors can do their
ministry together rather than in competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, which brings together some of the nation's premiere
Hispanic theologians with seminarians, is held at sponsoring
seminaries around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The association also provides other educational opportunities
and makes Hispanic theological books available. Many of its members
also are in the process of writing theological textbooks and
reference books.
</P>
<P>
   Part of its work involves training faculty and staff at
non-accredited Bible institutes, helping the small schools to put
together a well-run, credible theological education. ``We are a
forum for Hispanic theological education,'' Negron said.
</P>
<P>
   The association, which was founded in 1991, is underwritten by a
$1.5 million grant from the Pew Charitable Trust.

 &HT;    Who wants to pick a president without getting off the couch?
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ By George, I've got it. The ultimate ``twofer''
_ the solution to low voter turnout and the burning need for
another red-hot reality show.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The political conventions are over, and the presidential
campaign has begun in earnest. But if we are to believe Gallup and
other national polls, the majority of Americans don't care. They
don't particularly give a fig who's running, and they aren't likely
to vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   People aren't watching politics, but they are watching reality
shows such as CBS's ``Survivor,'' which will leave fans desperate
after Wednesday night's sure-to-be blockbuster finale. We need a
replacement that will keep us glued to our sofas for a couple of
months, when real series such as ``ER'' and ``Friends'' return, and
we need it quick. Millions still find ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' satisfying, and ``Big Brother'' is out there, but
neither show is as hot as ``Survivor.'' Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the answer to America's political lethargy and couch
potato yearnings: ``Who Wants to Be the Big Survivor?'' This
fabulous new reality show will entertain and amuse and give us a
new president to boot. No revolting animals will be consumed in the
execution of this program. And it has the added benefit of making
me, its creator, a multimillionaire. For that swell feat, I welcome
your kudos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Survivor'' will pit teams of politicos and hangers-on led
by George W. Bush and Al Gore in weekly challenges that will help
determine the grand prize of four years in the White House and
$800,000. (That's how much the president earns during a term, in
case you've forgotten.) Each team will include first lady wannabes
Laura Bush and Tipper Gore and vice presidential candidates Dick
Cheney and Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   To make this work, we need a better host than the ridiculously
melodramatic Jeff Probst of ``Survivor.'' We don't want anyone
telling us in somber tones, ``The voters have spoken. Extinguish
your torch.'' Offered big bucks and a showcased spot in network
prime time, Bob Dole surely will agree to be our man. He's smart,
funny and politically savvy. He looks good in a suit and won't
embarrass the nation when the winner is sworn into office. And he
has TV experience as a star on cable's Comedy Central.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will be determined by the challenges, but if the
competition is close, viewers will vote on their favorite
participant. This election will be decided primarily by the
candidates themselves, but the goal is to make viewers interested
enough to pay some attention to their oft-ignored democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore and Bush teams _ or ``Bore and Gush,'' as some have
taken to calling them _ will compete on the campaign trail in a
variety of political and nonpolitical events. Special debates will
feature questions about taxes, education and which state capitals
are north of the Mason-Dixon Line and east of the Mississippi. (If
Dole asks anybody about ``final answers,'' he will be fired on the
spot.) A balance-the-budget-in-10-minutes segment will point out
just how easy ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' questions have
been.
</P>
<P>
   More fun-filled challenges will include a rubber chicken-eating
contest with actual rubber chicken on the menu. No rats or bugs.
That's been done. Speed of consumption and amount ingested will
determine the winner. An obstacle course could provide some
excitement _ a foot race from the Capitol to the White House in
rush-hour traffic, an up-and-down climb of the Washington Monument.
You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, viewers will thrill to hidden-camera
shots of the candidates as they travel the nation's highways and
byways.
</P>
<P>
   How long does it take Gore to cover his bald spot? Does Bush
practice nonsmirking facial expressions in his mirror? We'll find
out as we watch the candidates watching themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the campaign trail, candidates occasionally will be
blindfolded as they arrive at their political events and asked to
guess where they are.
</P>
<P>
   Fund raising will not be part of the contest. We've seen enough
of that already, and it might detract from the relatively paltry
grand prize at the end of the road. Viewers may be asked to vote on
personality, personal appearance and best sound bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Survivor'' just might be the next big thing in TV and
politics, an ``event program'' for the masses that will actually be
good for the country _ a bridge to the 21st century leaving no man,
woman or child behind, a thousand points of light illuminating
thousands of Nielsen homes.

DEAR OLD DAD IS A ROCK STAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Flea &LR;  of the Red Hot Chili Peppers writes in Jane magazine that
he wasn't interested at first when the band was asked to play the
Experience Music Project in Seattle. Then his 11-year-old daughter,
 &UR; Clara &LR; , said, ``` &UR; Eminem &LR; ! Eminem is playing that show? You've got
to do it, Papa! Eminem is the coolest, can I come, please?' ''
</P>
<P>
   When the band last toured, writes the rock star, his daughter
had said, ```You guys are old and boring, the Foo Fighters are fun
and great. You guys sit in your dressing room doing yoga and
lighting candles, the Foo Fighters jump around and have fun.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter was introduced to Eminem before the show. The Chili
Peppers did their thing, &LR;  and, says Flea, ``busted out the socks
for the first time in ages.'' (For persons even un-cooler than
Personals, this means they performed wearing nothing but socks,
which weren't on their feet.) ``It embarrassed the hell out of
Clara, but the crowd seemed to like it and we had a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   The high point, he writes, was running into Eminem after the
show. The rapper told Flea, in front of his daughter, that he was a
``crazy m_,'' ``for which I would like to thank him because that
scored me huge points with my daughter. She didn't think I was a
big dork for at least an hour after that.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPREADING LIKE STARBUCKS  &LR; The Guggenheim Museum at  &LR; in Bilbao,
Spain, has been such a success, reports the Times of London, that
six cities in Italy _ Bari, Genoa, Milan, Palermo, Turin and Venice
_ have applied to have Guggenheim branches, and a branch in South
America seems to be in the future.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are squabbling over a 40-story tall  &UR; Frank &LR; 
 &UR; Gehry &LR; -designed Guggenheim branch on the East River (in addition to
the mother ship on Fifth Avenue); and a Venice outpost will open in
2005 if fund raising goes according to schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The new museums are spurred, says the British newspaper, by the
quickly growing number of acquisitions. The Guggenheim now owns
8,000 paintings, sculptures and installations.

a ``World War II German leader without whose crimes against

   -  &LR;   &LR; Glamour magazine answers a pressing question, citing the
research of Dr. Jack Lenox of Rockford, Ill., who ``performed a
complete search of the world's literature'' on the subject and
``couldn't find a single instance of a doctor expressing a
preference.'' It is unclear whether the ``world's literature''
refers to the Journal of the American Gynecological Association or
Penthouse.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the videogame world, when players face bleak
prospects _ a hero loses ``health points,'' or a spaceship's shield
is depleted _ they have the ultimate recourse: Hit the Reset
button.
</P>
<P>
   It is an option rarely available in the business world, but
Electronic Arts, the world's leading independent game company, has
just such a fresh start in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which makes dozens of sports, action-adventure and
strategy games for PCs as well as for game consoles made by Sony,
Nintendo and others, is weathering a market in great flux. Sales
have been in a lull, awaiting the full emergence of a new
generation of faster, more powerful game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the bleak outlook on July 25, when Electronic Arts
announced a fiscal first-quarter loss of more than $42 million on
revenue of $154.8 million and warned of losses nearly as great in
the second quarter. The news was in stark contrast to the company's
modest profit in last year's first quarter. And because the report
came after the stock market's close that day, most investors had no
immediate way to vent their emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, though, investors were ready to pounce _ and
they did so by bidding up the company's stock nearly 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why such enthusiasm for a money-losing quarter? Evidently,
investors share the optimism of Electronic Arts' executives, who
during one of the game industry's cyclical downturns have been
spending heavily preparing for the future.
</P>
<P>
   EA has invested some $700 million on an ambitious two-prong
strategy that its president, 41-year-old John Riccitiello, asserts
will propel EA to new prominence in the video- and PC game
industry. And the intensely focused, hypercompetitive Riccitiello
says the strategy could help move games beyond their core audience
(adolescent males of all ages) to become an entertainment medium in
which people can interact with others across the globe and compete
with one another in a new generation of Internet-based games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being comatose on the couch, you'll be on the couch
role-playing, fantasizing, competing, shooting or driving,''
Riccitiello said, suggesting that the TV, connected to the Net,
will become the preferred medium for online game play.
</P>
<P>
   He even predicts that the popularity of Internet-based games
could surpass the appeal of TV programming because players will
become immersed in elaborate cyberworlds rather than merely
watching someone else's drama unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll interact with other people. You'll get to date, marry,
murder _ it's all there,'' Riccitiello said. ``By next summer,
these games will start to look like legitimate competition for
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The next two months should give some indication of whether EA's
big bets can pay off.
</P>
<P>
   About half of EA's investment, or roughly $350 million, has been
spent developing an online gaming site called EA.com (www.ea.com),
which begins its first public tests later this week or early next
before its official debut in September. EA.com will be going up
against a handful of already well-established game sites and will
soon face additional competition from heavyweights like Sega and
Sony, both of which have major gaming portals planned.
</P>
<P>
   The online investment includes $81 million in cash and equity in
EA.com that the company gave to America Online to make EA.com the
exclusive operator of AOL's game channel. EA plans to spin off
EA.com as a tracking stock in the first half of 2001, Riccitiello
said.
</P>
<P>
   But those millions of dollars do not include the cost of adding
a proposed fourth and fifth building to the company's Silicon
Valley campus _ a proposed increase of 315,000 square feet of space
_ in part to accommodate the expected growth of EA.com. The local
government in Redwood City, Calif., has yet to approve the
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the company has devoted three floors of an existing
building to the development of online games. In cubicles, engineers
and game writers are preparing games and setting specifications. In
a modest, early-version of the EA.com control room, two engineers
oversee large video monitors that relay traffic patterns from
several sports games EA already operates online, including the golf
games Tiger '99 and PGA Tour, of which tens of thousands of rounds
are played online each month via EA server computers.
</P>
<P>
   But online gaming is only around half the big bet. The other
half is about $350 million placed on producing games for Sony's
next console.
</P>
<P>
   In October, roughly a month after the launch of EA.com, Sony
plans to make the U.S. debut of the Playstation II videogame
console, which is already a best seller in Japan and eagerly
awaited by gamers in this country. EA has gambled heavily that the
Playstation II will be a success, surpassing the 72 million
Playstation I consoles already in use worldwide. It is, in fact,
among those predicting that sales of the new machine could
eventually exceed the 100 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   The $350 million spent developing games for the new Sony machine
is a major investment by game-industry standards. At the same time,
EA made a controversial decision not to make games for the Sega
Dreamcast introduced last year, deeming the system would not be
sufficiently popular to justify the $3 million to $4 million it
costs to develop individual games.
</P>
<P>
   The Playstation II will be a 128-bit machine, meaning its main
chip processes information 128 bits at a time _ or effectively
twice as fast as the 64-bit chip in the current market leader, the
Sony Playstation and the No. 2 machine, the Nintendo N64. The
128-bit speed is supposed to allow startling realism, as with car
racing games that appear to be TV footage.
</P>
<P>
   The losses that EA reported last month reflect the fact that,
for much of this year, the game industry in this country has been
in a lull _ awaiting not just a new version of the Playstation, but
also 128-bit machines expected next year from Microsoft and
Nintendo. While the lull is considered cyclical within the
industry, it has nonetheless slammed the revenues of videogame
companies, sent stock prices lower across the industry, and forced
considerable consolidation among smaller game developers.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Playstation II hits the market, the company plans
to have as many as five new games for it _ titles that include SSX
snowboard racing and Madden Football 2001. Four or five additional
new titles are in the pipeline for Christmas, which could mean that
EA may have more than half the available Playstation II titles on
the market by the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the company hopes to corner 30 percent of the game
market for the Playstation II, compared with EA's 20 percent share
for the current Sony players.
</P>
<P>
   But Riccitiello insists that EA has not put all its eggs in the
Playstation II basket. He says the company diversified beyond
videogames in the last several years by beefing up its game
business for personal computers. The PC game category now
represents 30 percent of EA's total revenue. The PC share is up
from 15 percent a year ago, an increase attributable in part to the
success of the Sims series, made by EA's Maxis subsidiary. Players
build cities, neighborhoods and control day-to-day municipal
activities in SimCity, or even control individual characters in the
most recent game, the Sims.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts, however, believe that the success of the
Playstation II titles will largely determine the success of
Electronic Arts in the next two or three years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Billy Pidgeon, an analyst with the research firm Jupiter
Communications, said that EA had emerged with a stronger market
position with each transition to a new console. ``The one thing
that could hurt them is if Playstation II doesn't do well,''
Pidgeon said, ``but that's hard to imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Internet gambit that presents an even riskier and
more complex challenge, industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of playing computer and videogames online is nothing
new. In fact, online gaming is brimming with competitors, including
uproar.com, iWin.com, Zone.com, a site operated by Microsoft, and
WON.net, which has an extensive following. These, like at least the
initial version of EA.com, are meant for use with PCs. And some
analysts say EA will need to demonstrate it can compete in this
league.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Kasavin, senior editor at Gamespot.com, an online
publication about electronic games, said that so far, EA's online
offerings, including a medieval, role-playing fantasy world called
Ultima Online, had been harder to use than many of its competitors'
services.
</P>
<P>
   But David Cole, an industry analyst and president of DFC
Intelligence, a San Diego market research firm, said the online
game market was still too new and unproven to predict winners and
losers. ``Right now, the online gaming market is fairly spread
out,'' he said. ``There is no dominant player.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said that Electronic Arts had put EA.com in a good position
by aligning it with with AOL. ``The key to online games is
distribution,'' he said, ``and with AOL they have the key
distribution point.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides operating as a separate Web site, EA.com will be the
``game channel'' on America Online, which will receive 4 percent of
the channel's revenue _ with the first $81 million in payments
already accounted for in the recent stock and cash transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Riccitiello sees an expanding opportunity in more
powerful videogame consoles and PCs, as well as faster Internet
connections. He notes that people are already playing basic parlor
games and others with simple graphics and action, like pong, on
current computer-based game sites that draw between 5 million and 6
million people. More sophisticated, realistic-looking online play
could double the size of the $13 billion videogame market in the
next five years, he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity ``is on a curve pointing to the sky, and the
content is miserable,'' Riccitiello said. ``EA is going to change
all that.''
</P>
<P>
   The EA.com site will begin with 50 games, which will include
basic parlor and card games, and sports titles like Running Back
Challenge, a relatively simple game in which players try to evade a
computer-operated tackler. The company concedes it will be several
months before EA.com includes more elaborate, graphics-intensive
games.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming all goes well with the initial free trial of EA.com,
Electronic Arts plans to begin charging money for some levels of
access. Some of the games will remain free. But for the more
elaborate ones, the company plans to use a subscription model,
possibly with two tiers costing $4.95 and $9.95 a month
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Besides vying with the existing online game operators,
Electronic Arts will also be wading into online competition with
both Sony and Sega, which are also leading producers of game
software. (Nintendo, the other big console maker, also intends for
its upcoming 128-bit console, known as Dolphin, to have online
access and is exploring plans to have a gaming site.)
</P>
<P>
   The Sony Online Entertainment division operates the Station
(www.station.sony.com), a PC-based game portal offering games like
Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy online. And the Playstation division
plans to introduce an online component for the Playstation II, once
high-speed, or broadband, connections are more widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Sega plans to open its own game site on Sept. 7. Sega's site
will be designed for use only with its Sega Dreamcast consoles. If
users commit to buying two years of Internet access from the
company's SegaNet service, for $21.95 a month, Sega will give them
Dreamcasts at no additional charge.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the intensity of the online play, the offline battle
promises to get nasty between EA and Sega.
</P>
<P>
   EA executives are predicting the Sega site will have limited
demand, since it restricts the potential audience to Dreamcast
owners. But Sega officials fire back that Electronic Arts will be
unable to offer consistently high-quality, realistic game play
because the company has no control over the type of hardware its
players will be using.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bellfield, a spokesman for Sega of America, said he had
played early versions of EA.com in a closed beta test _ a sort of
private dress rehearsal. The ``experience is awful,'' he said. ``EA
has not been able to rectify that, because it is always dependent
on the hardware'' owned by its users, Bellfield said.
</P>
<P>
   EA executives, meanwhile, say Sega had no business exploring
their company's private beta test. ``It's like breaking into
Lockheed in the '80s, seeing the B2 bomber sketched on the back of
a napkin and predicting it'll never fly,'' said Jeff Brown, an EA
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that Sega has handcuffed itself by dedicating its
online play to its own hardware. ``Building a site that is tied to
a poor-selling console starts with a tremendous handicap _ they are
building for a limited audience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sniping no doubt traces to EA's decision not to develop
games for the 128-bit Sega Dreamcast, which has had sales of 2
million consoles in the United States since its introduction a year
ago, and 5.5 million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 2001, Nintendo is expected to introduce Dolphin,
while Microsoft plans to jump into the fray with its 128-bit
console, the X-Box, around the same time. Riccitiello predicted
those companies could each sell 50 to 60 million consoles, and he
said EA was discussing with Microsoft and Nintendo whether to
produce games for their new machines. (Nintendo has sold about 28
million N64 consoles worldwide).
</P>
<P>
   People close to Electronic Arts expect the company to support
those platforms, and not only because they could generate
significant sales. If Nintendo and Microsoft do not thrive, Sony
could end up with no viable competition for the Playstation II,
which in turn could allow Sony to charge higher licensing rates to
videogame makers like EA that make software for its console.
</P>
<P>
   And over the long haul, healthy competition could stimulate
continued technological improvement in the machines _ which,
combined with high-speed Internet connections, could bring ever
more lifelike online play. Or so Riccitiello hopes.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to describe a day, not too far in the future, when
instead of tuning in to ABC or NBC, couch potatoes will turn to EA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe, based on a mountain of evidence, that if we can
create a sports game that also is a place for you to live 24 hours
a day, seven days a week, you might actually have a better life in
cyberspace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And if that happens, Riccitiello is betting that EA can have a
better life in cyberspace, too.

DICTIONARY PUBLISHERS SEE PROFITS ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface words in first sentence should be set in italics.) 
 By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A logomachy _  &UR; n. an argument about words &LR;  _ is brewing on the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin plans to publish the fourth edition of its
American Heritage dictionary next month, the volume's first major
overhaul in eight years. The new edition is full of changes sure to
arouse lexicographers _ color illustrations, notes on slang and a
new appendix describing Semitic as well as Indo-European roots.
</P>
<P>
   But what the publisher has most excited is happening outside the
covers, as Houghton Mifflin hustles to sell electronic versions of
its dictionary for inclusion in other companies' software, Web
sites and digital publications.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin is not alone. Its major rivals _ most notably
Merriam-Webster and Microsoft Corp.'s year-old Encarta dictionary _
are all stepping up their digital dictionary efforts to tap an
increasingly lucrative market, setting up a business contest that
philologists say will also have consequences for the way Americans
use English.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic novels may be making headlines these days, but
electronic dictionaries are actually making money. At Houghton
Mifflin, digital dictionary licensing is expected to account for
more than $1 million in profit this year, more than 10 percent of
the earnings from the company's trade and reference division,
according to Wendy Strothman, the division's publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Stifled for years by low margins and flat sales, dictionary
publishers are salivating over digital sales and licensing as a new
source of revenue growth, promoting flashy new features like
audible pronunciations. But word scholars worry that the new
pressures of the online market may end up favoring well-connected
or well-positioned dictionaries _ some sniffingly cite Microsoft's
Encarta _ over more authoritative lexicons.
</P>
<P>
   Many lexicographers initially saw the advent of the Internet as
a terrific new tool, especially because it made possible electronic
texts of nearly infinite length. That impulse inspired the Oxford
University Press, for example, to revise its 20-volume Oxford
English Dictionary for the first time since its completion in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   A new online version of the OED is available to subscribers for
fees starting at $550 a year. Researchers are posting the revisions
and additions online in stages. So far, they are up to ``mamzer,''
an originally Hebrew word meaning ``bastard,'' and they expect to
finish the alphabet in about 40 volumes around 2010. Oxford
University Press has not yet decided if it will publish a new
printed version, too, said Jesse Sheidlower, its American editor.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also enables rival dictionary compilers to share a
common digital ``corpus,'' or archive of usage samples. Inspired by
the British National Corpus that was established in 1993, a group
of publishers and linguists based in New York is raising funds and
gathering material to build an American National Corpus of 100
million words in texts of all kinds, including transcript,
newspapers and novels.
</P>
<P>
   But the American National Corpus has yet to win help from many
of the nation's big dictionary publishers, who would stand to lose
the advantage of their own proprietary archives. ``We think we have
our needs pretty well served,'' said John Morse, president and
publisher of the Merriam-Webster, the United States' oldest and
best-selling dictionary, with an archive of more than 15 million
citations.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Web is also a gold mine for linguistic research.
For the first time, scholars can trace the infancy of new words as
they bubble up from narrow subcultures through online discussion
groups and eventually into general use, said Michael Adams, a
professor at Albright College in Pennsylvania and editor of the
journal Dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Adams recently published a study of new coinages from the
television show ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' _ ``slayage'' and many
other -age formations, for example _ tracking their progress from
teen-age fans' Web sites to magazines like Mademoiselle. He argues
that Buffy has also spawned novel uses of ``much,'' as in
``pathetic much?'' ``morbid much?'' or ``Having issues much?''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's Encarta dictionary, billed as the first lexicon
for the Digital Age, has some lexicographers shaking their heads,
partly because they worry that it could indeed be the dictionary of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Encarta was born in the early 1990s, when Nigel
Newton, chief executive of the British publishing house Bloomsbury,
wrote Bill Gates a letter proposing to create a dictionary of
``world English.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Microsoft was paying Houghton-Mifflin to license
online versions of its American Heritage dictionary to use in
Microsoft's spell-checking software and to bundle with its Encarta
digital encyclopedia. Why pay Houghton-Mifflin, Newton suggested,
when the two companies could build a wordbook of their own?
Bloomsbury developed the dictionary, selling international digital
rights to Microsoft and the American rights to Holtzbrincks' St.
Martins Press.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture faced long odds in bookstores. Most American
consumers traditionally want a red dictionary with the name Webster
on the cover _ as in Merriam-Webster, Random House's Webster's, and
IDG Books' Webster's New World, says John Sargent, president of
Holtzbrinck's American operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the new dictionary's publishers are betting that Microsoft's
commanding position in the software market can make Encarta's name
and black cover even more ubiquitous. ``Our thinking was that,
given its use in Microsoft software, the Encarta brand would over
time become the leadng reference brand,'' Sargent said. The
electronic version is available for sale with some Microsoft
software or for free at www.encarta.com
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Encarta will in fact become the new Webster
is precisely what is eating many linguists. In a forthcoming review
in the journal Dictionaries, Sidney I. Landau, author of
``Dictionaries: The Art &AMP; Craft of Lexicography,'' roundly pans
Encarta's ``cumbersome, repetitious and inconsistent style'' and
especially what he sees as its excessive political correctness.

 UNDATED: political correctness. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word ``Indian,'' an example Landau notes, is described in
other dictionaries as potentially insensitive but also widely used
among Native Americans and inextricably woven into terms like
``Indian summer.'' The Encarta issues a blanket condemnation,
calling the term ``offensive'' several times. In a few cases, the
Encarta Web site even interrupts the viewer with a ``language
advisory'' before even displaying a potentially offensive word, as
if it were a lewd movie. Such labels, Landau says, reverse most
lexicographers' understanding of their job _ to report in neutral
terms the changing shape of the language.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, another Encarta critic, worries that Encarta will succeed
despite its flaws and at the expense of its rivals. ``The problem
is that if they don't put out the best possible dictionary, because
of the access they have through the Microsoft software, they could
very well depress the sales of the four major publishers,'' said
Adams, who has worked as a consultant to American Heritage. ``Good
dictionaries would disappear and we would be left with an inferior
dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and its partners dismiss the criticism as predictable
nitpicking. Every new or different dictionary has met a similar
response from professional lexicographers, said Holtzbrinck's
Sargent.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton-Mifflin, Microsoft's previous digital dictionary
supplier, was the publisher with the most to lose from the Encarta
dictionary, which Microsoft this year began using instead of the
American Heritage. Houghton-Mifflin's Wendy Strothman said that new
digital licensing deals had ``more than made up for the loss of
that revenue stream.''
</P>
<P>
   Strothman says Houghton-Mifflin prepares customized versions of
its digital database for a variety of clients, seeking to
capitalize on the recent interest in electronic publishing by
embedding its dictionary in electronic books or reading software.
Readers can look up any word with a click.
</P>
<P>
   When half a million fans downloaded copies of Stephen King's
electronic novella ``Riding the Bullet'' in March, for example,
some of the software programs for displaying it included a digital
version of the American Heritage dictionary, and Houghton-Mifflin
received a small royalty on each. This fall, the digital publisher
netLibrary will begin including American Heritage dictionaries with
its e-books, paying a sliding scale fee for its use. (Microsoft's
new Reader software, however, includes a version of Encarta.)
</P>
<P>
   A number of Web sites, including www.dictionary.com, have even
paid Houghton-Mifflin for use of its digital dictionary to provide
free spellings and definitions on the Web, hoping to attract
viewers and sell advertising. ``They are welcome to do that, but
our content costs us money and we want to get paid for it,''
Strothman said. ``What puzzles me is why our competitors put their
own dictionaries up on the Web for free.'' Houghton-Mifflin sells
its dictionary on CD-ROM, but does not put it on a Web site of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   That position has cost the company some business. Paul J.J.
Payack, chief executive of the newly formed company
yourDictionary.com, initially favored licensing American Heritage,
he says, because he liked its etymologies and simple definitions.
But he did not like Houghton-Mifflin's licensing-only strategy. He
wanted a dictionary that would boost his brand by building its own,
so he struck a deal with Merriam-Webster instead.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster has taken a radically different tack from
American Heritage, giving its dictionary away for free on its own
Web site (www.m-w.com) while at the same time trying to license it
to whomever it can, including America Online and the hand-held
computer maker Franklin Electronic Publishers, among others.
Recently, it also managed to strike a deal to display its Web site
on Palm devices.

   ``Unlike Houghton-Mifflin, we are just a dictionary publisher,''
said Morse, of Merriam-Webster. ``We aim mainly to promote the
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   The main Merriam-Webster Web site and a related site for
children offer word games and offers a free word-of-the-day e-mail
with usage and etymology tips. Morse said the site was now getting
about 20 million page views a month, at a rate of about 50,000
look-ups an hour during the middle of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster also tracks which words users look up for
guidance in making revisions. This month's hot word: ``chutzpah,''
spurred by press coverage of vice-presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   But not all lexicographers are happy about the proliferation of
Merriam-Webster's definitions online, either. ``The Merriam-Webster
is fantastic but least suited for most people who use it,'' said
Sheidlower, the American editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
``Its definitions are much more complicated and more difficult than
the other major dictionaries. The other dictionaries are accurate,
and you can use them without going nuts.''

WIRELESS INTERNET CASTS ITS SHADOW (AND SUBSTANCE) IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After the plates of spicy raw tuna and wasabi-crusted
tofu were cleared from the table of a Greenwich Village restaurant
one recent evening, discussion turned to probably the hottest topic
among New York entrepreneurs these days: the wireless Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the talent?'' asked Tyler Daines, a venture capitalist
who is backing a wireless Web start-up with offices in Manhattan
and Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the killer app?'' asked Gordon Gould, chief executive
of a mobile communications company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why isn't this discussion taking place in California?'' asked
Andrew Seybold, a Silicon Valley wireless consultant and
industry-newsletter publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to all these questions lies in New York, which is
emerging as the nation's center for wireless Internet applications,
financing and advertising. Eager to expunge the dot-com taint _ the
volatile stock valuations based on questionable, pure-play Internet
business models _ much of Silicon Alley is recasting itself in a
wireless role.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a new buzzword to describe the scene: unstrung.
</P>
<P>
   The unstrung are undaunted by some experts' gloomy forecasts
that the wireless Internet might never live up to its billing if
consumers are turned off by the current, bland offerings of e-mail
or sports scores _ served up as scanty lines of text on the tiny
screens of cellular phones and other mobile devices.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, more than two dozen New York wireless Internet
companies have been created in the last year or so. The rookie
lineup includes Savos, which delivers Internet music and other
Web-based audio to mobile phones; SmartRay, a portal seeking be the
wireless Yahoo; and Upoc, which focuses on Internet text-messaging
services intended for young wireless phone enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast remains the locus of wireless technology
development. And there are many more wireless Internet services and
applications already up and running in Europe _ eagerly embraced by
people weary of balky wired telephone networks. But it is New York
that has become the fertile breeding ground for new uses and
services through wireless hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the impetus is geographic. ``Manhattan has the potential
to be the center of deals between the U.S. and Europe, where the
wireless phenomenon is much stronger,'' said Mark Caron, chief
executive of MobileSpring, a so-called incubator company in New
York that is focused on wireless start-ups. What's more, he said,
``the level of creativity here is unequaled.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there is New York's standing as a major
money center. A host of financiers with operations in New York are
focusing on the wireless Internet, with big players including
Flatiron Partners, a venture capital firm that has had ties with
Chase Manhattan and Softbank of Japan. Others, like Nokia Venture
Partners, the investment arm of the Finnish mobile phone giant
Nokia, are preparing to set up New York offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is getting hot very quickly,'' said Tom Kenney, a
principal at Nokia Venture Partners, who plans to move the firm's
East Coast base to New York from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The field is so new and so much in flux that no one pretends to
have firm figures on investments, jobs created or even the number
of new wireless Internet companies in New York. But many with money
agree that the mobile Internet is one of the few Net-related areas
that continues to solicit strong interest among entrepreneurs and
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were among the first to carve out a space in the area,''
said Seth Goldstein of Flatiron Partners.
</P>
<P>
   The New York wireless scene is buzzing, so much so that an
online magazine has been created to cover it all: the magazine,
Unstrung, seeks to blend the sophistication of Wallpaper, an
architecture and design magazine, with the attention to detail of
trade publications like Wireless Week. Unstrung's motto is ``tied
to nothing but the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the cusp where the kids in sandals at the dot-coms
are turning their attention to wireless,'' said Josh Newman, a
former schoolteacher in the South Bronx, who help found Unstrung
and serves as its top editor. ``The opportunity to cover this
potentially huge niche was looking us right in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoking Newman's hope that Unstrung can hit it big was a panel
discussion about the wireless Internet last month held by the New
York New Media Association at NYU. The event's organizers had to
turn away about 200 people after the crowd reached the fire
marshal's limit of 1,100.
</P>
<P>
   Many were employees at Silicon Alley dot-coms who were hoping to
learn more about what was being touted as the next big thing. A
good many others were from other walks of life _ just curious about
a subject that true believers discuss with equal parts grandeur and
jargon. (``Talk spurt'' and ``location-based services'' are two
favorites in the unstrung lexicon.)
</P>
<P>
   Some people in New York's wireless Internet scene, think that
the buzz surrounding the young industry _ including the verbiage _
is risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that the hype level, combined with the lack of
knowledge about the limitations of the wireless Internet, could
turn people off in the same way pure Internet plays are falling out
of favor,'' said Brian Bodell, head of marketing strategies at
Mobile Metrics, a company providing advertising services for
wireless users. ``That's why you rarely see a wireless Internet
company with a dot-com in their name and why many companies want to
show they're not betting all their chips on wireless.''
</P>
<P>
   But certainly some established Silicon Alley Web development
companies see advantages in having a stake in wireless. For
instance, Razorfish and Agency.com, two players with international
reach that help companies develop and roll out their Web
operations, are expanding their New York wireless operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until six or eight weeks ago, we had no concrete wireless
plans for North America'' said David Eastman, Agency's head of
mobile business for Europe, during a recent trip to New York. ``But
now, we're ready to promote a knowledge bleed from London to New
York because this is where the action is.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the pure-play mobile Internet start-ups, New York's best
known so far may be Vindigo, which provides maps and information
from publications like the Zagat restaurant guides, for use on Palm
hand-helds and other portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   The service is not yet a true wireless Internet application,
because users must download the material through a standard,
land-line Internet connection. But the information is formatted for
relatively easy searching and reading on a hand-held device, and
the company plans to offer wireless updating as network technology
evolves.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100,000 people have downloaded the company's city guides
in six months in New York and four other urban regions, making
Vindigo one of the first applications of its kind to show potential
of spreading ``virally'' _ by word of mouth, or mouse _ and with
little formal advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating the technology which will allow content
providers to extend their brand to the wireless realm,'' said Jason
Devitt, 31, who left a job selling derivatives at D.E. Shaw, a
technology-focused investment bank, to become Vindigo's chief
executive last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around,'' Devitt said, pointing to the frenzied activity
in Vindigo's disheveled headquarters in a gutted building in the
garment district. ``We have no time to pause and think about
whether we're going to be a big part of the location-based services
segment because we're already there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Vindigo offers a glimpse of an industry poised for
takeoff, most wireless Internet companies in New York are in the
early stages of development _ ``stealth mode,'' as people familiar
with the start-ups put it. Few have advanced beyond the first
stages of financing provided by venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sense that new applications can evolve well beyond
stock quotes or short e-mail has some people believing that local
companies have a bright future.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Connolly, director of Ericsson CyberLab, a research and
development company set up in New York's financial district by the
Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson, said that ``with the
mobile Internet, it seems the transition from technology to
services is happening faster than it happened on the Web, and thus
the services focus that New York has plays a large role.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the advantage of being close to the television,
publishing, telecommunications and financial industries of New York
is a lure for anyone seeking to hop on the wireless Internet
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   But given the industry's current limitations, there is a chance
that companies focusing on applications for the wireless Internet
might be in for the rough road traveled by many a struggling
content provider for the hard-wired Web.
</P>
<P>
   After all, there are two definitions of ``unstrung'' in the
American Heritage Concise Dictionary. One is ``having the strings
loosened or removed.'' The other is ``emotionally upset.''

IS MODERN ROCK RADIO GETTING OLD?

<TEXT>
<P>
   From New York's K-Rock to Los Angeles' KROQ, FM radio stations
with a so-called modern format have flourished the last few years
by promoting the cutting-edge sounds of grunge, electronica and the
latest hip-hop and rock hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   These and stations like WBCN in Boston and WKQX (called Q101) in
Chicago say that they provide an alternative to traditional rock
outlets, or that they broadcast, as the Dallas station KDGE likes
to put it, on ``the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is it, between all the slogans stressing up-to-the-minute
hipness, that many of the songs are several years old from bands
like Pearl Jam or Nirvana, while others _ like the razor-guitar
blasts from Limp Bizkit or Korn _ can also be heard on hard-rock
stations?
</P>
<P>
   As it nears its 10th anniversary as a format that the radio
industry has assigned its own charts and demographic surveys,
so-called modern rock is at a crossroads. Modern, also called
alternative, is the style that established itself as first to play
new music. But it has begun to sound commonplace, leading listeners
to ask what exactly is modern rock radio an alternative to?
</P>
<P>
   ``The lines are more blurred than they've ever been,''
acknowledged Steve Kingston, program director for K-Rock _ WXRK in
New York, which has used the modern format since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is a problem programmers will have to face soon or risk
losing their claim to the specific ``hip'' _ 18- to 34-year-old
professionals _ audience favored by some advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the modern format has nearly blended into its nearest
competitor, hard or so-called active rock, which plays many of the
same current rap-rock stars, like Papa Roach, Limp Bizkit and Korn.
The overlap in active and modern playlists rose from 44 percent in
1998 to 54 percent last year, according to Airplay Monitor, a trade
journal published by Billboard. More striking, 62 percent of both
categories' top 10 lists were identical in an average of all of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   And Airplay Monitor's group editor, Sean Ross, notes that 15
songs from a recent week's modern top 20 were also on the active
rock charts, which means that any new tracks from acts that merge
hip-hop and metal, like Kid Rock and Rage Against the Machine, can
expect to jump into both formats' heavy rotation as soon as they
are released.
</P>
<P>
   The few self-described modern rock stations not leaning toward
the active format, notably WLIR on Long Island and WPLY in
Philadelphia, find themselves mixing established Top 40 stars, like
Sting and Madonna, with melodic newcomers like Nina Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to program against K-Rock,'' said Gary Cee, program
director of WLIR, which transmits from Garden City, N.Y., and has a
large geographic overlap with Manhattan-based K-Rock. ``And I want
to do a cutting-edge radio station that still appeals to the
mainstream.'' The result is a sound that borders closely on the
existing adult contemporary format.
</P>
<P>
   If modern rock seems to lack focus, industry experts say, the
blurring has a long history. ``Nothing is static in the music
industry,'' said Jim Kerr, an editor at the trade publication Radio
and Records. ``Over time, it's very difficult to put a very rigid
definition to such a thing as a format. The music changes. The
approach changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called underground radio of the early 1970s _ FM stations
playing bands like the Doors in stereo _ became the industry
standard later that decade. By the 1980s, smaller stations began
breaking away from this album-oriented rock format with New Wave
artists like Talking Heads and U2.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, this experimental mix was recognized as a separate
format, usually called alternative in those days, with new charts
to track such adventurous stations as WLIR, which switched formats
in 1982, and WFNX in Boston, which began broadcasting in 1983.
These were small stations, however, playing what Kingston calls a
boutique format and often more akin to free-form college radio than
to their markets' big-money rock establishments.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed in 1992. Early that year, the guitar-heavy
``Nevermind'' by Nirvana _ a band that only alternative stations
had played before _ knocked Michael Jackson out of the top slot on
the Billboard album chart. Other grunge and punk groups like Pearl
Jam followed Nirvana's success, and stations began switching en
masse to the suddenly popular _ and lucrative _ alternative, or
modern, format.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution from Aerosmith and the J. Geils Band to REM and
the Pixies was gradual for many stations. But between 1994 and 1996
several major outlets, notably K-Rock in New York and WBCN in
Boston, both owned by the giant Infinity Broadcasting, jumped from
the old-style rock to the new. ``Alternative didn't change,'' Kerr
said. ``The mainstream moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the music was flooding the charts, the business of radio
was going through a radical reorganization. The Telecommunications
Act of 1996 cleared the way for corporations to own and manage
multiple stations in a market. That change not only drove up the
prices of FM stations, but also created big companies like Viacom,
which now owns Infinity, and Clear Channel, which controls several
stations in cities like Boston, New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Such cluster ownership at first provided a spur for the new
format, as group owners sought ways to remove internal competition.
``Companies didn't need three Top 40 stations someplace like Omaha,
so they took one and tried the new alternative format,'' said
Daniel Behring, the program director of WFNX.
</P>
<P>
   Such experimentation was short-lived. Higher station prices
raised the ante for profitability. And compared with the smaller
pioneer stations, the 50,000-watt powerhouses new to the format
needed much higher ratings and advertising billings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you pay $75 million for a good-size FM, you're going to
program it in a way that brings you back the best return on your
investment,'' said Paul Heine, executive editor of the Friday
Morning Quarterback group of media trade publications.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston of K-Rock agrees. ``The landscape changed,'' he said.
``You need to be more of a specialist.''
</P>
<P>
   Because women are seen as more likely to switch to pop stations
_ particularly the increasingly trendy adult-contemporary stations,
which specialize in melodic pop artists like Sheryl Crow and Bonnie
Raitt _ men became the most readily accessible rock demographic.
And most of the formerly free-wheeling alternative stations pursued
them with a harder-sounding, more tightly formatted playlist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the alternative stations have gone decidedly male,''
Kingston said. ``They're playing Metallica and Limp Bizkit and Papa
Roach.''
</P>
<P>
   And what remains of the old alternative in today's modern format
is the focus on new material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stations are much more current-music focused than the old AOR
stations,'' said Behring, referring to album-oriented rock. He
worked at the old-style rock station WSAQ in San Antonio before
arriving in Boston in November 1997. ``We were less than 25 percent
current,'' he said, referring to the Texas station. Now, in Boston,
``a station like ours _ or K-Rock or 99X in Atlanta _ is 75 or 80
percent current.''
</P>
<P>
   That quest for the new may keep the modern format from losing
more of its identity, said Jim McGuinn of WPLY in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there's a preponderance of heavy music,'' McGuinn
said. ``But it's too early to tell if this is a paradigm shift,
like grunge was, or if this is a trend and there'll be a reaction
against it.''

 &HT;    Good news for kids: Changes in schools make it easier to be
popular
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The fashionable baggy red shorts that scrape his
shins. The skinny arms folded in defiance. The sullen scowl that
breaks only briefly when someone begs him just once to smile for
the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Jemario King's gangsta cool body language says it all: ``I don't
care if you like me.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Decatur, Ga. resident, who returned to classes
last week, isn't interested in becoming Mr. Popular. ``To me, being
popular doesn't really matter,'' he says. ``It's a state of mind .
. . I'm just going to do what I gotta do anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   As another wave of youngsters head back to class today, it might
be tempting to suggest, as Jemario does, that popularity doesn't
matter. After all, the rugged individualist is an American icon.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as most of us wish that popularity doesn't count, we
know otherwise. It does matter, even _ and perhaps especially _ as
an adult.
</P>
<P>
   As Sally Field once gushed when she accepted an Oscar as best
actress: ``You like me!''
</P>
<P>
   Popularity rules. People who play the popularity game
effectively often become leaders in government or business, movie
stars, advertising pitchmen, the president of the local garden
club, the person on everybody's guest list.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Two summer TV shows, ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother,'' revolve
in part around popularity. Each week, contestants vote to banish
one of their own, and in one case the public makes the final call.
The eventual winner on both shows is likely to be the person who is
most well-liked. Another show, ``Popular,'' follows a high school
clique whose members struggle to fit in.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Center for Creative Leadership, a business
consulting group based in Greensboro, N.C., discovered that the
biggest reason that executive careers derail is the inability of a
leader to be popular.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore said last week during
his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention that
the ``presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a
day-by-day fight for people.'' But any political pollster or
consultant can tell you that this year's presidential race will
focus only partly on issues. It will ultimately, as in past
elections, become a popularity contest. People vote for people they
like.
</P>
<P>
   LIKE IT OR NOT, IT MATTERS
</P>
<P>
   It's been 64 years since Dale Carnegie published his book ``How
to Win Friends and Influence People,'' which has sold at least 14
million copies. And the Dale Carnegie Center of Excellence, based
in Atlanta, helps 2,000 people here annually with their ``people
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who know how to make people like them have a tremendous
advantage in life,'' said Rogier van Bakel, an editor with the Ad
Age Group, a New York-based collection of advertising and marketing
publications. ``People want to work with them. People want to hire
them. . . . I think that rugged American individualism is a bunch
of crock.''
</P>
<P>
   Popular people don't even have to be particularly good at what
they do, van Bakel said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian tennis player Anna Kournikova has never won a singles
title on the professional tour. Yet Forbes Magazine lists her as
one of the richest athletes in the world, because her attractive
looks make her a sought-after commercial endorser. In fact,
Kournikova earns more each year than Martina Hingis, the top-ranked
woman's player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because she is incredibly hot, she makes more money than
Martina Hingis,'' van Bakel said. ``Likability is the name of the
game in advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Likability is such an important commodity that one company
actually has invented a formula designed to gauge a person's
popularity. New York-based Marketing Evaluations/TvQ uses random
surveys to measure the popularity and likability of not only public
figures but also brand-name products such as Fila sportswear and
cartoon figures like Bart Simpson. A measure of a subject's
popularity is called a ``Q score.'' The higher the score the more
appealing _ and marketable _ a person is to television and
advertising producers.
</P>
<P>
   THE EMPATHY FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   The business world has created its own informal ``Q score''
system. The more popular an executive, research suggests, the
greater the chance of success. A 1996 study by the Center for
Creative Leadership, seeking to learn why some business executives
succeed while others fail, determined that most executives who
failed to advance failed because they lacked ``people'' skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these managers were good,'' said Jean Leslie,
co-author of the study. ``They knew the ins and outs of their job,
but they were considered demanding, aloof. They isolated themselves
from others and didn't have empathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Successful business executives displayed ``interpersonal
savvy,'' she said. They were good listeners, made themselves
available to others and were supportive of other people's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the work of more senior executives is
relationship-oriented,'' Leslie said. ``The technical skills become
less important than the interpersonal relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the sharpest managers can fall when they lose favor with
those they manage or their bosses. Lee Iacocca, the former
president of Ford Motor Co. and by all measures an excellent
business executive, was fired after helping launch the fabulously
successful Mustang. When Iacocca asked his boss why, Henry Ford II
reportedly replied, ``I just don't like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cultivating popularity is crucial in politics as well. Perhaps
no other American president in recent years has been lauded as much
as Ronald Reagan. But Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University
political science professor, said Reagan was widely considered to
lack knowledge of policy and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have popular support, no matter how good your
ideas, no matter your knowledge, you're not going to be able to
lead Congress or lead the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Did you get that, Al and George W?
</P>
<P>
   MAKING CONNECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   But if a person is liked, he or she can often influence others,
change the way they think and how they live their lives. Such a
person can even make or break entire industries.
</P>
<P>
   Talk show host Oprah Winfrey has revolutionized the publishing
industry in recent years, making unknown authors hugely successful
by picking their books to be part of her book club. And John F.
Kennedy almost killed the hat industry when he refused to wear a
top hat at his inauguration as president four decades ago. The
dress hat industry has never fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   A popular person doesn't even have to be a celebrity to exert
tremendous influence, says Malcolm Gladwell, author of ``The
Tipping Point'' ($24.95, Little Brown), a book that explores the
power of ordinary people and events to spark social
transformations.
</P>
<P>
   Such people _ Gladwell calls them ``connectors'' _ wield
tremendous power, he thinks. That's the reason Paul Revere, not
William Dawes, is remembered today, he said. Both men took a
midnight ride on the same night in opposite directions to warn
people that the British were coming. But nobody listened to Dawes
because he was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``People listened to Paul Revere because they all knew him,''
Gladwell said. ``He had the biggest Rolodex in New England.''

ADVERTISERS TURN TO SPECIALISTS TO HANDLE E-MAIL MARKETING
CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  By SUSAN STELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among Internet companies struggling to retain customers they
have worked so hard to get, e-mail marketing is seen as the next
best thing to being on the home page each time a customer goes
online.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, e-mail is a relatively inexpensive marketing tool,
ranging from a penny to a quarter per message, compared to $1 to $2
per piece for direct-mail campaigns in the actual world. Moreover,
e-mail provides immediate results, no small factor in an industry
where speed is critical.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the results of an e-mail campaign can be measured,
right down to the number of people who opened the message, clicked
on each link, made a purchase or forwarded the e-mail to a friend _
that is, assuming the sender has the technology to track all of
this data.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the catch. Conducting an effective e-mail
campaign is a lot more complicated than opening a new message in an
e-mail program, copying a list of customer names, typing an offer
and clicking the ``send'' button. In fact, those who manage e-mail
marketing efforts say the challenges range from basic privacy
issues, like getting permission to send e-mail to customers, to
technical hurdles in composing, sending and tracking large volumes
of mail.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, an industry has emerged to help marketers
manage their e-mail strategy, from companies that function as
application service providers, housing the infrastructure to
deliver and track e-mail campaigns, to those that license or sell
software to run e-mail campaigns. According to Forrester Research,
the market for these types of services will reach $4.8 billion a
year by 2004, up from $156 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dozens of companies hoping to benefit from this
opportunity is FloNetwork, an application service provider in
Toronto offering e-mail campaign management. The company, which has
been in business since 1993, has been focusing on e-mail services
since 1998 and now has 185 clients, including J.Crew, Continental
Airlines and Buy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Brady, vice president of strategy and partnerships at
FloNetwork, said many clients had initially handled their e-mail
marketing efforts in-house, but turned to a vendor as their needs
outgrew their ability to handle them.
</P>
<P>
   As examples of the issues e-marketers face, Brady cited
formatting marketing messages so they can be read by a variety of
e-mail software, developing a system to track the response to each
campaign, and dealing with the volume of incoming mail that results
from a mass mailing, including messages that bounce back because of
invalid addresses and requests to be removed from a mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that is in-bound mail that most people don't think
about,'' she said. ``It's not sexy, but it's a real fact of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hurdle is establishing relationships with the major
Internet service providers, like America Online, Hotmail and Yahoo.
To stem the sheer volume of unsolicited commercial mail their
members receive, many services have systems that detect and even
block bulk mailings sent into their networks. As a result, Brady
said, mass mailers often have to demonstrate they are legitimate
enterprises to make sure their e-mails reach the intended
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we'd call AOL to say, `We're going to be sending out
a million messages to AOL customers on behalf of XYZ company,'''
she said. ``And they'd say, `Great, thanks for letting us know.'
After a while we ended up establishing more formalized
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   FloNetwork and its competitors also offer technology enabling
clients to customize e-mail messages for each recipient. For
example, Barnesandnoble.com, which works with FloNetwork and
another e-mail service provider, CheetahMail, originally handled
its e-mail efforts in-house, offering customers the option to sign
up for e-mail newsletters on topics such as ``fiction'' or
``bestsellers.'' When Barnesandnoble.com decided to tap into its
customer database and send e-mails targeted to customers based on
that information, it chose to work with a vendor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we really needed a partner because we wanted to
work with someone with strong technology,'' said Roe Johnson,
Barnesandnoble.com's director of online marketing. ``By using
dynamic content personalization, we're able to send someone who
lives near Union Square an announcement about a book signing in
that store.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the complexity of delivering customized messages is one
of the main reasons marketers choose to work with a technology
company specializing in e-mail services. For Wine.com, an Internet
wine retailer that merged last week with Wineshopper.com, the
ability to send highly targeted e-mail messages to customers has
sharply improved the effectiveness of the company's marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Jim LaBelle, vice president of marketing for Wine.com, said that
when the company started doing e-mail marketing, it sent an e-mail
newsletter showcasing the same selection of wines to its entire
customer base. Working with Digital Impact, an e-marketing services
provider based in San Mateo, Calif., LaBelle said the company was
able to use its database on customers' purchase history to create
customized e-mail messages based on the type of wine or price range
each shopper purchased.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've found one of our customers only buys Italian reds
above $20, why barrage him with other ideas?'' LaBelle said. The
more personalized approach, he noted, ``has resulted in a doubling
of the revenue yielded from each newsletter.''
</P>
<P>
   William Park, chairman and chief executive of Digital Impact,
said this type of return on investment is what his company
emphasizes when approaching prospective clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of ownership is huge for companies doing it
themselves because they don't have economies of scale,'' Park said.
Among those costs are sophisticated hardware and software systems
to handle both outbound and inbound e-mail, Internet service
charges, and marketing and research employees to analyze data and
fine-tune campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The company works with more than 140 clients, including
Fidelity, Travelocity and Tower Records, and sent more than 400
million messages last quarter on their behalf. Digital Impact
typically charges 2 cents to 5 cents per e-mail message sent,
depending on the degree of personalization required and the volume
of mail the client sends.
</P>
<P>
   Park acknowledged that many companies are hesitant to outsource
their e-mail marketing efforts to a vendor. ``When we are competing
to win business,'' he said, the in-house technology department is
``generally the biggest competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   One company that manages its own e-mail campaigns is
eHobbies.com, a privately held Web site for hobbyists based in
Santa Monica, Calif. The site, which features 11 hobby categories,
sends two mailings a month to members who have signed up to receive
e-mail newsletters in a particular category.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Greenberg, vice president of online marketing for eHobbies,
said the company decided to purchase e-mail software from
MessageMedia, rather than rely entirely on third parties for its
e-mail efforts. One of the main reasons for that decision, he said,
was a reluctance to share customer information with a third party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't that comfortable exposing our database to an outside
vendor,'' Greenberg said. Purchasing software to use in-house also
allowed eHobbies to have more control over the process of sending
mailings, he said, adding, ``With outsourcing, you're beholden to
another company.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledged that handling everything in-house has
required more staffing, and that there have been ``some growing
pains,'' Greenberg said he was happy with the results, citing high
click-through rates and purchases in response to the company's
e-mail campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   What works for a particular company, he said, depends in part on
internal resources. ``We're fortunate to have the talent to be able
to do this in-house,'' he said. ``Not everybody has that.''

WRITING FROM THE HEART BUT DRAWING ON THE MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amy Bloom is a psychotherapist. She is also a writer whose first
book of short stories, ``Come to Me,'' was a finalist for the
National Book Award in 1993 and whose most recent collection, ``A
Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You,'' was recently published by
Random House to critical praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the traits that led me to be a psychotherapist are the
ones I find in myself as a writer,'' Bloom said. ``I've spent a lot
of time listening to people, and I am endlessly intrigued by
relationships, particularly by the gap between what people say and
what they truly feel, and the gap between what they do and what
they really want.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Maslin, reviewing the new collection in The New York
Times, said that Bloom, in her ``sharply wrought stories,'' writes
``warmly and astutely, with arresting precision,'' about the
tangled webs of human connections.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom said her career as a writer essentially began about a
decade ago, when she was returning home from an appointment with
the man who was to train her as a psychoanalyst. A graduate of
Wesleyan University who also has a certificate in social work,
Bloom, then in her mid-30s, was a mother of two young children and
a psychotherapist in Durham, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was about to undertake the several years of
additional training to become a psychoanalyst, she was ``still not
entirely sure,'' Bloom, 47, said in a telephone interview from
Provincetown, Mass., where she was teaching a workshop on writing
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``After one session the plot of a mystery came to me, and I
started scribbling it on a McDonald's box from one of my kids. When
I got home, I wrote up my notes. I had 15 pages, and I thought,
`That's interesting.' I sent a note to the training analyst that I
wanted to hold off. And he said: `If you change your mind, let me
know. Otherwise, good luck with your writing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Good luck she has had: Her stories have appeared in The New
Yorker, Antaeus and Story, among other publications, and were
selected for the 1991 and 1992 ``Best American Short Stories''
collection and the 1994 O. Henry Prize anthology. Her first novel,
``Love Invents Us,'' was published in 1997 to excellent reviews.
And ``The Story,'' a tale from her new book, has been chosen for
this year's ``Best American Short Stories.''
</P>
<P>
   She also wrote that mystery novel. ``When HarperCollins bought
`Come to Me,' it also bought the mystery,'' Bloom said. ``But about
a year or two later, after `Come to Me' came out, I thought better
of it and bought the mystery back. I just didn't think it was good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Maslin, in her review of ``A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love
You,'' said Bloom's stories focus on ``exotic intimacies'': unusual
relationships, unconventional liaisons, connections that take place
on the edge. The title story, for example, concerns the closeness
between a woman and her daughter, who is soon to have surgery to
make her a man.
</P>
<P>
   In two stories, ``Night Vision'' and ``Light Into Dark,'' Lionel
and Julia, a black man and his much older white stepmother, deal
with the sexual encounter they had one night years earlier. And
``Rowing to Eden'' is about the relationships of a woman undergoing
chemotherapy for breast cancer, with her husband and with her best
friend, a lesbian who has had a mastectomy herself.
</P>
<P>
   But Bloom said, ``The aspect of a story that is unusual is often
not the thing that catches my eye.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Rowing to Eden' came out of my interest in a longstanding
friendship between two women,'' she added. ``And that was combined
with my having encountered, as everyone does, lots of breast cancer
in friends and friends of friends. So I didn't think that there
could be something unusual here. The story just grew out of what
the characters came to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The only story in the collection that strikes her as unusual,
she said, is the title one, ``because not that many people are
transsexual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what drew me to that story,'' Bloom said, ``was
thinking about the way a good mother is devoted to her daughter,
and the way in which mothers and daughters try to spare each other
certain kinds of pain, and inevitably cause each other certain
kinds of pain. I had encountered families with transsexuals, and I
knew I couldn't tell the story from the point of view of the
transsexual. That's not in my range. But I knew what it was like to
be a devoted mother, trying to take care and offering your best
self but grieving as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said that the characters in the stories casually
break various taboos. ``In the world people do break all sorts of
taboos,'' Bloom said, ``although they mostly don't like to talk
about it. All of us have lines we have crossed at least once in our
lives that we would just as soon not mention to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom grew up in Great Neck, N.Y., ``which,'' she said, ``was
probably not the town to which I was best suited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' she said, ``if you're going to be a weird
little kid like I was, I'm not sure if any town would be suited to
you. I was definitely one of nature's observers. I loved to read a
lot of 19th-century literature, which probably didn't do a lot for
my playground skills. From the time I was a little kid I was
waiting to grow up. At 9, for my birthday, I was asked what I
wanted, and I said, `My own apartment.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her life eventually got better. ``Like most bookish little kids
I was always very interested in what other people were doing,'' she
said. ``I didn't develop an adequate set of social skills until my
early teens. I was one of those rare people for whom adolescence
was an improvement over childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year at Boston University she transferred to Wesleyan,
in Middletown, Conn., and became a therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing has made me less available as a therapist,'' she said.
``I had to make a decision on whether to go on having a full-time
practice or to write more. I now have a very small practice. I
didn't end treatment with people who were in the middle. But when
people ended, I didn't fill those hours. I guess I've had two
careers I've really loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom's children are ``all more or less big people now,'' she
said. She has a 35-year-old stepson and two daughters, 21 and 18.
She is somewhat circumspect about her own relationships. ``I have
been divorced, and I am happily living with someone,'' is all she
will say.
</P>
<P>
   She still lives in Durham, ``a very small town,'' she said, not
far from Wesleyan. ``I originally wanted a nice town with a good
school system, and my former husband was teaching at Wesleyan,''
she explained. ``Now my children say, `Mommy, you can move where
you want.' But I find myself thinking, `I like the library, I like
the back yard, I like the garden.' I've become enamored of
small-town life.''
</P>
<P>
   And she remains enamored of writing. ``I'm working on new short
stories,'' she said, ``and a couple of them are linked to two in
the new collection. There will be two more stories in the Lionel
and Julia group. There are certain characters I'm just not done
with, or they're not done with me.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also working on a nonfiction book for Random House, about
female-to-male transsexuals. It is based on an article she did
several years ago for The New Yorker, itself an inspiration for the
title story in her new collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a larger look at people who occupy complicated
gender territory,'' she said, ``as well as other people in their
lives: surgeons, psychiatrists, makeup artists, people who run the
clothing stores that cater to cross-dressers.''
</P>
<P>
   After that book, she said, she will write another collection of
stories. Her love for therapy has, at least for now, been overtaken
by her love for words. ``I hope to be writing,'' she said, ``for
another 40 years.''

   WIRELESS-FUTURE (Undated) _ Disregarding skepticism that the
wireless Internet might never live up to its hype if consumers get
turned off by today's bland offering of applications on mobile
devices with tiny screens, more than two dozen New York wireless
Internet companies have been spawned within what has become a
Darwinian environment for firms solely focused on the Web. New York
is emerging as the nation's center for wireless Internet
applications, financing and advertising. Eager to expunge the
dot-com taint, much of Silicon Alley is reinventing itself,
wirelessly. There is even a new buzzword to describe the scene:
``unstrung.'' By Simon Romero.

   VIDEOGAMES-SHAKEOUT (San Francisco) _ Despite falling revenue
and earnings at Electronic Arts, the world's largest independent
videogame company, the mood at the company's Silicon Valley
corporate headquarters is one of great optimism. Part of the reason
is that executives believe they have emerged relatively unscathed
from a cyclical, and expected, downturn as the industry is moving
to a new generation of consoles. At the same time, executives
assert they have made key investments they say will take the
company to new levels of prominence. Whether they have succeeded
will become clearer in the next 60 days. By Matt Richtel.

A CONDUCTOR'S YEAR OF BACH INCLUDES 198 CANTATAS IN 60 CONCERTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By   WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEWKESBURY, England _ Large, ambitious projects often have their
origins in seemingly inconsequential small moments. For the British
conductor John Eliot Gardiner, it was a glance at a program of a
concert he was about to present in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read in my own CV that I was due to record all the cantatas
of Bach, and it struck me as very odd because I didn't know about
it,'' he recalled. Even by his own industrious scheduling standards
_ he already has more than 150 CD's to his name _ he computed that
he would have to live to 120 to complete the task.
</P>
<P>
   But Sir John, who is 57, found the challenge tantalizing, and
the solution turned out to be characteristically bold: perform and
record them all in one year, 2000, the 250th anniversary of Bach's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, a 12-month odyssey of
more than 60 concerts by Sir John's masterly early-music groups,
the Monteverdi Choir and the English Baroque Soloists. They are
playing all 198 surviving sacred cantatas in the most
architecturally rich churches, monasteries, priories and cathedrals
across 14 European countries and the United States, where the tour
ends on New Year's Eve at St. Bartholomew's Church.
</P>
<P>
   The places chosen were those Bach had some association with,
some he might have visited if he had had the chance and others,
like the 15th-century abbey with its towering Norman pillars here
in this medieval town in the west of England, that made the cut for
their sheer reverential beauty. The performance dates through the
year correspond to the Sundays and feast days for which each
cantata was created, based on its own piece of liturgy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leaders of the early-music movement that took root in
England in the 1970s and '80s, Sir John combines taskmaster
discipline and intellectual rigor with the energy to produce brisk,
toe-tapping Bach, full of thrusting attacks and swaying rhythms.
Now his expressive hands are tamping down the sound; now shaping
the full parabola of a serpentine line; now tripping the cadence
into dance time; and then sending bass notes plunging down to the
crypt and soprano tones soaring upward to the fan vaulting of the
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bach is best known now for his grand masterpieces like
the ``St. Matthew Passion'' and the B minor Mass, it was the 340
cantatas composed during his five years, starting in 1723, as
cantor at the Thomaskirche in Leipzig that drew the most notice
when he died on July 28, 1750. ``They were the only pieces of music
noted in the first paragraph of his obituary,'' Sir John said.
</P>
<P>
   For Bach it was a frantic period of exalted creativity and
commonplace drudgery that delights the musical historian in Sir
John.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``Bach would sit down on Monday morning at his desk and
think: `What's the gospel, the epistle of next Sunday? What can I
write about this? I have to do it to bolster the sermon. Who's
going to be preaching? What's he going to be saying? How am I going
to negotiate with him? And how am I going to do something that
makes his words redundant?'''
</P>
<P>
   He chuckled at this last notion. ``I'm sure that was a part of
it,'' he said. ``He believed his music was going to be more
effective than any amount of words.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir John wasn't finished with the busy week in the Leipzig life
of Johann Sebastian Bach: ``Not only does he have to compose the
piece, he has to have it copied. So he gets the family factory
going, with his wife, Anna Magdalena, and his various sons. And
then he has to start rehearsing with the kids of the Thomas school
and assign the obbligato and the soloists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sort of usual week, then you have the festivals
that come thick and fast, like Christmas, Easter, Whitsun and other
saints' days where he has to double, triple, quadruple his output
as composer and also to conduct. And the music doesn't stop when
the ink is dry. Because then you turn the page, and it's Monday
morning and time for a new piece.''
</P>
<P>
   This short and intense period of conveyer-belt cantatas produced
pieces that were performed only once in Bach's lifetime. But for
Sir John they are works for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a paradox,'' he said, ``but this music written for a
very parochial, even sectarian audience for a specific Sunday in
the church year carries with it an extraordinary message of
universality that seems to leap over frontiers and time barriers,
and we are finding people today responding to it in a very
refreshing and direct way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir John's musical sensibility was established early in life,
thanks to a &UR;  &LR; unique upbringing. He was reared on a farm in Dorset
that was the centerpiece of a postwar rural reinvigoration plan
initiated by his great-uncle, Balfour Gardiner, a composer who gave
up writing music in the 1920s, and his father, Rolf. They planted 4
million trees and revived guilds, old harvest rites and farm
holidays. His mother, Marabel, an art historian, was, he said
gleefully, ``even a bit more wacky and eccentric.''
</P>
<P>
   She taught young John Eliot to speak French, German and Latin by
the time he was 8, and she gave him art instruction by taking him
to Rome, Florence and Venice. ``She knew them stone by stone and
painting by painting,'' he said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays and holidays, she would round up family members,
visitors and villagers and stage mimed Nativity and Resurrection
plays or dramatized Nordic and Celtic sagas. They also sang masses
and motets, and by the time he went away to boarding school, he was
playing violin and viola, turning his tenor voice to the lieder
repertory, and dabbling in conducting.
</P>
<P>
   When Sir John went to King's College, Cambridge, on a history
scholarship, everyone assumed he would become a chorister. But he
said he found the treatment of English music ``precious, polite and
mannered'' in comparison with the robust approach he had learned at
home. His majors were medieval Spanish and classical Arabic, but he
showed such interest in music that his tutor recommended that he
take a year and explore his conducting ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to devote the time to studying the background of
Monteverdi's 1610 Vespers of the Blessed Virgin and preparing an
updated edition of them. To do so he created a choir, his
present-day Monteverdi Choir, and performed the work in the King's
College chapel. This March, 36 years later to the day, he performed
three Bach cantatas there in a triumphant return concert.
</P>
<P>
   After studying with Nadia Boulanger in Paris, he took conducting
posts in Lyon, Hamburg and Vancouver. But he always kept the
Monteverdi group intact back in England, and in 1978 he added the
English Baroque Soloists. He is said to be good at glowering at
laggard performers and flinging music stands across rehearsal
spaces, but his singers and players have remained loyal, with two
of the choir members reaching their 35th year with the group.
</P>
<P>
   His former wife, Elizabeth Wilcock, was first violinist with the
English Baroque Soloists, and though they are divorced, they remain
friends. For the last four years, he has shared his homes in London
and on the family farm in Dorset with Isabella de Sabata, 40, an
Italian from a musical family, who worked for years as a press
representative for Deutsche Grammophon in London and Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Grammophon was originally going to make discs of all
198 surviving cantatas, but when they cut back on the number, Sir
John and de Sabata decided to produce their own professional
recordings of every performance. A specially built mobile studio
van arrives the day before they do at each site to set up wiring
and equipment, and rehearsals and post-performance run-throughs are
often recorded to make sure that substitute material is on hand for
editing.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles is the patron and a contributor to the project,
which is also supported by other private donations and corporate
grants. He and Sir John are friends, sharing a passion for organic
farming as well as music, and the prince has organized fund-raising
dinners at Buckingham Palace and his Highgrove estate in
Gloucestershire. The project is still $1.5 million shy of the $8.25
million needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John said the pilgrimage fulfilled his original purpose in
becoming a full-time musician. ``I wanted to confront and come to
terms with the great heritage of European music, which in the 1960s
and 70s was very selectively performed. It was the precursors to
the great masterpieces that fascinated me. The historian in me
wanted to know what the function of that music was, what brought it
into being, for whom was it composed, in what sort of building
would it have been performed, to what kind of audience, in what
kind of acoustics with what sort of instruments,'' he said. ``It
wasn't nostalgia or antiquarianism. I saw it as musical
archaeology.''
</P>
<P>
   As his yearlong musical dig goes on, Sir John says he is finding
his time well spent. ``Bach,'' he said, ``is probably the only
composer whose musical output is so rich, so challenging to the
performers and so spiritually uplifting to both performer and
listener alike that one would gladly spend a year in his exclusive
company.''

REALITY TV STRIKES GRISLY NOTE ON NEW SHOW `CONFESSIONS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface word in first sentence should be set in italics.) 
 By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now  &UR; this &LR;  is reality TV.
</P>
<P>
   Court TV, the cable channel devoted to the criminal justice
system, will push television's popular reality genre to its limits
next month with a new series, ``Confessions,'' that features the
actual videotaped confessions of murderers, rapists and other
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The confessions, recorded by district attorneys and police
departments during criminal investigations and made part of the
public record after trials are over, will be edited mainly only for
brevity and clarity. And while some of the more graphic description
of the convicts' crimes will be excised, much will remain.
</P>
<P>
   In the first program in the series, a homeless man describes a
rape, and a male prostitute details his murder of a wheelchair
bound client. Another man admits to killing a woman in his
apartment, dismembering her and cooking her remains.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-minute weekly program will have neither a host nor a
narrator. Viewers craving analysis or interpretation of the various
cases will be directed to the Court TV Web site (www.courttv.com),
where experts in psychology or criminology, like William J.
Bratton, the former New York City police commissioner, will post
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   For Court TV, which rose in prominence during the trial of O.J.
Simpson in 1995, but whose ratings plummeted after those
proceedings concluded, the program represents an attempt to further
distinguish itself from its cable competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Though its ratings have surged in recent months, the network
still lacks a breakout hit that would draw top ratings and force
cable operators that have been hesitant to carry the channel to add
it to their systems. Comedy Central found such a franchise hit in
``South Park,'' and A&AMP;E did so with ``Biography.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Court TV, which is owned by Time Warner and the
Liberty Media Group, said last week that they thought they had
finally found their hit in ``Confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be a signature series for us,'' said Henry Schleiff,
Court TV's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   With the new show, the executives clearly hope to capitalize on
the nation's voracious appetite for televised voyeurism, most
evident in the popularity of CBS' ``Survivor,'' a program that
features a man widely considered to be a plotting conniver _
Richard Hatch _ as one of its most compelling stars. It is watched
by almost 30 million people each week.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Survivor,'' like its current and future reality-program
counterparts on CBS and other networks, is planned and controlled
by programmers. ``Confessions'' will showcase stark, brutal and
out-of-control reality. Whether that will be accepted by the
American public on a regular basis is already a matter of debate
among industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything changed one year ago, when `Who Wants to be a
Millionaire' aired for the first time,'' said Robert Thompson,
founder of the Center of Popular Television at Syracuse University,
where he is a professor of television and film. ``By February,
we've got `Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire.' By summer,
`Survivor' and `Big Brother.' And, as we enter the fall, we've got
`True life confessions of rapists and murderers: America's
creepiest home videos.'''
</P>
<P>
   Girding for criticism that his network is simply trying to
capitalize on the shock value of the confessions of very brutal
crimes, Schleiff said he believed the program was in keeping with
Court TV's stated mission: to cover all aspects of the criminal
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the only times the viewer is being taken to a
place where they've never been before _ the inner sanctum of
interrogation rooms,'' he said. ``And we're exposing them to people
who, in some cases, are literally evil incarnate.''
</P>
<P>
   Court TV has one of law enforcement's better-known figures to
thank for the program's genesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confessions'' was conceived during a meeting the program's
producers, Richard Kroehling and Eric Nadler, had with Robert M.
Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. (Morgenthau is the man
upon whom the fictional DA Adam Schiff is loosely based in the
popular NBC series ``Law &AMP; Order.'')
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was convened to discuss ideas for Court TV programs,
and Nadler said he recalled that Morgenthau had been among the
first district attorneys to videotape confessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob said, yes, in fact, he had an office filled with dozens,
if not hundreds, of these videotapes,'' Nadler said. ``Richard and
I looked at each other at the same moment and we said, `This could
be fascinating.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nadler said that Morgenthau determined that videotapes could be
used by the producers in cases where the trial was complete and the
confession had been entered into the court record, in which case
they were available for public viewing.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney's office later suggested 14
separate videotaped confessions for use on the program, he said.
Based on whether they had coherent story lines and compelling
testimony, 10 were edited into segments for the new program, which,
starting Sept. 10, will run Sundays at 10 p.m., when Court TV's
audience is its largest. The producers have made arrangements for
other taped confessions to be collected from district attorneys'
offices in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   After screening the tapes, the producers said, they decided that
the confessions would play best without narration or even a program
host.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire series was designed to focus the viewer and put the
viewer inside the story and inside the confessor's mind, period,''
Kroehling said. ``We want this to be experiential television.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first episode, the confessions _ all of which were
recorded in Manhattan _ are featured as they were recorded, on
low-quality video with poor, though audible, sound. In some
instances, the producers have used a split screen, with crime scene
photos shown along with the confession.
</P>
<P>
   The first confessor is Steven Smith, a homeless man convicted of
raping and killing a female doctor inside Bellevue Hospital in
Manhattan in 1989. During his confession _ in which Smith
frequently curses and yells at his interrogator _ Smith tries to
implicate a second man as an accomplice. This man, ``made love to
the lady,'' Smith says. (Later, at trial, Smith admitted there was
no second man.)
</P>
<P>
   In another confession, Daniel Rakowitz, who was charged with
killing and dismembering a woman in Manhattan's East Village in
1989, but was found mentally unfit to stand trial, describes ``the
horribleness in which what I did to her.'' He adds: ``I dissected
her body, totally. I just started chopping her up, cooking her
meat.''
</P>
<P>
   Shocking? Maybe. Surprising? Given the recent successes of
experimental programming throughout television, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this was inevitable,'' said Thompson, the Syracuse
television scholar.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thompson sees the program's development as the logical
progression in a television environment where programmers are
facing more competition from a growing number of entertainment and
information outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're flipping through the dial of 90 channels, everyone
is trying to get something to stop you in your channel-surfing
tracks,'' he said. ``It used to be that a graphic scene in an HBO
movie would do it. Now it takes something much more drastic.''
</P>
<P>
   That bothers people like Robert W. Peters, the president of
Morality in Media, a media watchdog group in New York. ``There's
absolutely no real educational purpose in this; this is just
exploitative programming,'' Peters said. ``The only possible
explanation for Court TV doing this is they must be desperate to
get some higher-rated programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Schleiff argued that by allowing the public to see ``what these
people are,'' the show ``serves the greater good.'' But while Court
TV programmers do not dispute that they want high ratings for the
program, they took issue with the word ``desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Court TV focused mainly on straight-ahead
trial coverage and nighttime legal analysis, the channel was
suffering badly, watched in an average of only 40,000 households a
night. Schleiff, who took over the network in January 1999, bought
reruns of crime-related programs _ first ``Homicide,'' the drama
recently canceled by NBC, and, later, ``Cops,'' the half-hour
reality show that originated on Fox _ and developed the network's
own series, like ``Crime Stories,'' a documentary crime program.
The change in direction vastly improved the channel's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Through August, in prime time, the network has been watched in
an average of 320,000 homes an evening, something of a feat for a
channel only available in 45 million homes, less than half of the
households that have TV sets. Advertising revenues, Schleiff said,
have risen 300 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   But whether ``Confessions'' will be embraced by the advertising
community, let alone the public, is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what client we would handle that would say, `Hey,
let me get on that show,''' said Tom DeCabia, executive vice
president of Schulman/Advanswers.ny, a media buying firm. He
predicted the show would be highly rated at its premier. But ``are
people going to watch it again?'' he said. ``Tough to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Schleiff said he had spoken with his sponsors, whose names he
would not divulge, and that none had expressed any deep concern _
although most predicted controversy.
</P>
<P>
   And that is just fine with Schleiff: ``What's that old saw? The
other side of controversy is attention,'' he said. ``I hope the
show stirs up attention. I hope it brings attention to Court TV.''

NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC BUYS STAKE IN IEXPLORE 
FINANCIAL TIMES OBJECTS TO PORTRAYAL OF REPORTER

<P>
   The National Geographic Society is venturing into new terrain;
it is buying a stake in an online adventure travel company.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit society, created in 1888 for the ``increase and
diffusion of geographic knowledge,'' plans to announce Monday that
it will buy 30 percent of iExplore Inc., a privately held Internet
company that sells adventure and ``experiential'' vacation tours in
152 countries. Experiential travel includes things like culinary
tours and Antarctic cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, National Geographic will incorporate
iExplore's travel information and database of trips into its own
four-year-old Web site, www.nationalgeographic.com. It will promote
iExplore in its magazines, which include National Geographic,
National Geographic Traveler and National Geographic Adventure. And
the society will give iExplore marketing access to its members.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, iExplore will add National Geographic Expeditions,
the society's own tour program, to iExplore's tour offerings.
National Geographic content will also appear on iExplore's Web
site, which will also carry a National Geographic logo, and allow
visitors to chat online with National Geographic experts.
</P>
<P>
   IExplore, which has had its site since February, is backed by
investors that include Soros Private Equity Partners. The company
has had sales of less than $5 million so far, according to its
founder and chief executive, George M. Deeb.
</P>
<P>
   John M. Fahey Jr., National Geographic's chief executive and
president, said the society had considered developing its own
online travel business and had been pursued by several companies
besides iExplore.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Harteveldt, a senior analyst with Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., said getting the nod from National Geographic was
``extremely impressive'' for iExplore and would give it an edge
over competitors like the Gorp.com Web site and tour operators like
Mountain Travel Sobek. ``You can't really buy National Geographic's
endorsement,'' he said. ``It's like the Good Housekeeping seal of
approval.''

   FINANCIAL TIMES OBJECTS TO PORTRAYAL OF REPORTER
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, The Financial Times gave the producers of ``Bull,''
TNT's new series about Wall Street, permission to use its image in
the program.
</P>
<P>
   John Lizars, the newspaper's vice president for marketing,
described it as ``the standard permission that we and all people
engage in product placement: that the product may be used in a
setting appropriate to the product and in no way denigrates the
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 99 times out of 100, that works out quite nicely,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This was one time it did not.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks before the program made its debut last Tuesday,
Lizars said, executives at the newspaper were startled to read in
news reports that one character in the premier episode was a
Financial Times reporter who behaves unethically.
</P>
<P>
   In return for a scoop, the reporter character, Johnny Walker,
agrees to disperse misleading investment information to one of his
source's business associates to trick the man into making a
high-stakes deal.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the sort of behavior the newspaper condones, Lizars
said. ``We had no idea that they were going to interject a
character in the program purported to be an FT reporter,'' he said.
``I can assure you, we took the attitude that this person
denigrated the image of our journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Lizars said the newspaper immediately made its displeasure known
to executives at Warner Bros., which produces the program. The
newspaper's lawyers followed up. In response, executives at Warner
Bros.'s ``were quite accommodating,'' Lizars said.
</P>
<P>
   So, at the end of the program, the studio added the following
disclaimer: ``The character portrayed as a Financial Times reporter
is fictitious and does not imply that Financial Times journalists
have ever engaged in improprieties. The Financial Times is a
world-renowned newspaper and is respected for its quality and
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The glowing disclaimer has gone over well at The Financial
Times, which is owned by Pearson PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agreement was very quick and very amicable,'' Lizars said.
``This was a misunderstanding that was very quickly resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. and TNT had no official comment. Executives
familiar with the story said they were under the impression that
the newspaper had received a copy of the script much earlier and
had raised no objections.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he expected the Financial Times character to show up
again in a later episode of the program, Lizars said, ``I don't
think that would be in their interest or ours.''

 ADVERTISING: AD REJECTED FOR COASTING ON MOMENTUM OF OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD STAMLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's called ``ambush marketing,'' and it refers to advertisers'
attempts to capitalize on a sponsorship event without actually
becoming sponsors. And with official sponsorships for the Summer
Olympic Games selling for stratospheric sums, it is hardly
surprising to officials at the U.S. Olympic Committee that the
Games frequently have been targets of ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Examples abound, involving advertisers large and small. American
Express, for example, told viewers in 1992 that they ``didn't need
a Visa'' to visit Barcelona, Spain, where the rival credit-card
company Visa was an official sponsor of the Summer Games. And
Wendy's used former Olympic athletes to push its burgers during the
1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, where the official fast-food
sponsor was McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Such shenanigans have consistently drawn the ire of the Olympic
committee. But they do not typically cause an ad to be pulled from
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   With the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, only weeks
away, however, that is exactly what happened to a small company
called PacificHealth Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   PacificHealth, a 5-year-old publicly traded health-food company
based in Woodbridge, N.J., tried to run an ad in a special
``Olympic Glory'' section in the Aug. 3 edition of USA Today,
promoting Endurox R4, a sports drink. The cost of the ad, prepared
by PacificHealth's agency, Alan Taylor Communications, would have
been ``a large chunk'' of the company's annual advertising budget,
according to Dr. Robert Portman, PacificHealth's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But the Olympic committee, which got wind of the ad from a
PacificHealth press release, objected. And on Aug. 1, USA Today
decided not to publish the ad. The decision touched off a debate
between PacificHealth and the committee about how far non-Olympic
sponsors can go in their efforts to harvest a bit of Olympic glory
without paying for the right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not very clear.
</P>
<P>
   By federal law, the committee owns the rights, including the
licensing rights, to all the various Olympic trademarks, including
the words ``Olympics,'' ``Olympiad'' and ``Paralympic,'' as well as
the five interlocking Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   To protect those rights, the so-called Ted Stevens Olympic and
Amateur Sports Act _ the law that charters the U.S. Olympic
Committee and which was last revised in 1998 _ allows the committee
to bring civil actions against nonlicensees for the use of ``any
combination or simulation of those words tending to cause confusion
or mistake, to deceive, or to falsely suggest a connection'' with
the committee or the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, of course, is a vigorous defender of its rights.
The reasons are obvious: According to Mike Moran, the committee's
spokesman, the money it receives for commercial sponsorships
provides some 70 percent of the committee's revenue, amounting to
roughly $70 million this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   No one pays that kind of money without an exclusive, and
presumably that is what Coca-Cola Co. thought it was getting when
it agreed to pay for its Powerade to become the official Summer
Olympics sports drink.
</P>
<P>
   So what of the ad for Endurox R4, another sports drink?
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it features a replica of the three-step
stand where winning athletes receive their medals. The stand is
emblazoned with the words ``Sydney 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   It also has an endorsement from the ``Olympic triathlete''
Jennifer Gutierrez and an offer of free product samples to ``the
600 U.S. Athletes going to Sydney.'' The ad makes claims about the
efficacy of the drink as a performance-enhancer, saying that its
use would allow athletes to ``go for the gold every day.'' Still,
the word ``Olympics'' is never used. Nor are the Olympic rings
depicted.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't matter, according to Moran. ``We absolutely believe
that the ad infringes on our rights,'' he said, adding that the
rights of the Sydney Organizing Committee to the words ``Sydney
2000'' may also have been violated. At the very least, he said, the
ad skirted Rule 45 of the International Olympic Committee charter,
which bans athletes like Gutierrez from endorsing nonofficial
products during the time that Olympic Games are being held.
</P>
<P>
   Portman of PacificHealth said this is nonsense. He contends that
the USOC is grasping at straws, having at first objected to the ad
on grounds that Endurox contained substances that were banned by
Olympic rules. (Moran, the USOC spokesman, acknowledges that the
drink contains no such substances, despite the committee's initial
concerns.)
</P>
<P>
   And though Portman acknowledged that the ad was ``very close to
the line,'' he insisted that PacificHealth and Endurox did not
cross it. ``The copy for the ad was consistent with copy guidelines
regarding product advertising and the Olympics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no such guidelines, said Moran, only the Ted
Stevens Act. And the ad was not acceptable, he said, in light of
that law's provisions.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be enough to satisfy Portman. But apparently it
was enough for USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never comment on what we do with any specific ad,'' said
Steve Anderson, a spokesman for the newspaper. ``But if we think an
ad is libelous, fraudulent or just in poor taste, then we are not
going to accept it.''

ON GNUTELLA SYSTEM, MANY TAKE FILES BUT FEW GIVE ANY BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Software programs like Napster and Gnutella
have achieved a reputation for fostering a communal spirit of
sharing among millions of music-loving computer users.
</P>
<P>
   The reality may be more selfish.
</P>
<P>
   Two scientists at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center have
surveyed the behavior of anonymous music downloaders on the
Internet and have found that, rather than demonstrating a ``from
each, to each'' ethos, most Internet users are only taking files
and not giving any back to their electronic community.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of use of the Gnutella system during a 24-hour period
this month was conducted by Eytan Adar and Bernardo A. Huberman.
They said their research demonstrates that ``free riding'' is the
most common behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The result, they said, is a ``tragedy of the digital commons.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, if only a few users are providing files, they
would require inordinate bandwidth to meet all the requests, so the
system would be more sluggish than one where all users contributed
equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since files on Gnutella are treated like a public good and the
users are not charged in proportion to their use, it appears
rational for people to download music files without contributing by
making their own files accessible to other users,'' they wrote.
``Because every individual can reason this way and free ride on the
efforts of others, the whole system's performance can degrade
considerably _ which makes everyone worse off.''
</P>
<P>
   The results also indicate that Gnutella may not be immune from
the legal challenges facing the Napster service. Unlike Napster,
Gnutella has no single database under centralized control. But the
researchers found that the core users providing music through
Gnutella are a concentrated group.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 25 percent of the Gnutella users serve about 98 percent
of the files,'' said Adar, a Xerox computer scientist who
specializes in profiling the Internet. Moreover, the researchers
found that one percent _ 314 computers _of the users in their
survey provided 40 percent of all files made available during the
survey period.
</P>
<P>
   Those providing music through Gnutella are identifiable to other
users by their Internet protocol addresses, so the biggest
providers of files could potentially be made targets of a legal
action that could cripple the network.
</P>
<P>
   The Xerox survey was based on the activity of 31,395 computer
users who shared 3,019,405 files during a 24-hour period over a
weekend earlier this month. The researchers said that there was no
way to determine the precise number of Gnutella users but that they
thought they had surveyed a substantial portion of the network.
</P>
<P>
   The research paper, posted on a Xerox World Wide Web site 
(http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/groups/iea/papers/gnutella/index.htm
l), &QL; 
comes during a bitter legal fight between Napster, the most
prominent music-sharing system, and the record industry, which says
the system is a mass copyright infringement. A federal judge's
ruling that Napster must shut down has been temporarily set aside
by an appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Recording industry representatives said they were studying how
to deal with the Gnutella network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically analyzing it now,'' said Cary Sherman, senior
executive vice president and general counsel for the Recording
Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   And the behavior of the Gnutella users, the Xerox researchers
said, could simply be an artifact of the way large groups function.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to secure voluntary cooperation in very large
groups,'' said Bernardo Huberman, a physicist who is a research
fellow at the Palo Alto center. ``I don't know of a single country
in the world where taxation is voluntary.''

VIRTUAL BAZAAR HAGGLES WITH ONLINE SHOPPERS; NEW, CATCHIER CD
PACKAGING 
</HEADLINE>
  By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the struggle to show a profit, Internet retailers seek any
advantage that might make them stand apart in the competition to
convert ordinary consumers into online shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to attract customers with a sales tool that will make
them more comfortable with e-commerce and boost the entertainment
value of shopping online, Robert Solomon, from Cos Cob, Conn., has
won a patent for a system that he calls ``haggling in a bazaar-like
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The central novelty of Solomon's design is a virtual merchant,
an on-screen character that a buyer can talk to and attempt to
manipulate in a subtle negotiation that mimics the rituals of a
souk. The cartoon merchant might be grouchy or generous, based on
how it ``feels'' about a return customer or how a new buyer manages
to manipulate its mood.
</P>
<P>
   If the Wizard of Oz turned out to be just a man behind a
curtain, the virtual merchant is only a graphical character backed
by an algorithm. Solomon has designed software that generates
responses to a customer's dialogue with the virtual merchant based
on a variety of factors stored in advance in its database.
</P>
<P>
   They include a customer profile, a history of the customer's
previous negotiations and purchases, basic rules of sales and
business practices, product inventory and brand information. A
customer at a retail site would enter personal information such as
an address and credit card number. He'd pick a product category,
like computers or sports equipment, and then click on a virtual
merchant character _ a computer geek or athlete, for example. This
virtual merchant's mood may already be set if the buyer is a return
customer _ it might not be ``happy'' to see someone who browses but
rarely buys, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Once the customer selects an item, the merchant would name a
price. That initiates the negotiation phase of the program. The
customer could then counteroffer and start a ``dialogue intended to
get the merchant into a favorable emotional state,'' Solomon writes
in his patent.
</P>
<P>
   The merchant might respond with promotional offers, or efforts
to ``up-sell'' by adding features to the product.
</P>
<P>
   During the haggling, the virtual merchant can also ask the
customer questions that help build a demographic profile for the
database, to be used the next time the customer shops. The answers
would also immediately be factored into the virtual merchant's mood
during the on-going sale.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the shopper would try to manipulate that mood by
gauging three behaviors: the merchant's facial expression, the
dialogue text, and the offer it makes. If the merchant is ``sad''
or ``angry,'' its face will convey that and its offer will be less
generous. Solomon says its up to the customer to interpret the
merchant's mood to cinch the best possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon sets this up in the database like a chart with the
merchant's mood in horizontal rows and the customer's potential
responses in vertical columns. Each intersects with the other at
some point on the chart, and that point tells the system what the
merchant's mood will be.
</P>
<P>
   That mood is then combined with factors like the price the
customer is offering to pay, the time the haggling has gone on, the
number of offers and counteroffers, and even the results of the
virtual merchant's last haggling session with a different customer.
</P>
<P>
   And each time the customer submits a new bid, the database
evaluates it based on how it compares to the expected value of the
product, the customer's response time, or even the amount of
traffic on the site at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon also suggested in his patent that his system would have
extra features like an ``eavesdropping'' function so potential
customers could listen to other shoppers during their negotiation
sessions, and a tutorial section where buyers could practice their
haggling. He received patent 6,035,288.
</P>
<P>
   Packaging can increase sales, and several years ago the music
industry lost a major promotional tool when environmental concern
led it to abandon the long, thin boxes in which compact discs were
sold. The wasteful boxes were twice the size of the CD's, but
manufacturers liked them because they provided lots of space for
art, graphics and information about the recordings.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, jewel boxes, the thin plastic containers that
protect CD's, have very limited surface area for such material. To
remedy that, three inventors have won a patent for an optical
technique that makes it possible to see different information
through the surface of a jewel box simply by looking at it from
different angles.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say studies have shown that sales are lost when
customers become frustrated at searching for titles on the thin
spine of jewel boxes and having to flip the boxes over for further
information.
</P>
<P>
   In their invention, Stephen Fantone, Anthony Gelardi and John
Gelardi use conventional paper inserts already included inside CD
jewel boxes. But their inserts are imprinted with graphics and text
in ``interlace'' fashion, meaning alternating lines of different
images or symbols. The interlace images can also be printed on the
interior surface of the jewel box, or directly on the CD itself.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic of the box is made with panels in a horizontal and
vertical arrangement. Thus, when someone looks at the box, the
alternating images come together to create separate impressions
when viewed from top to bottom or right to left, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The effect increases the amount of information available on the
same jewel box surface. Fantone, from Lynnfield, Mass., Anthony
Gelardi, from Cape Porpoise, Maine, and John Gelardi, from
Kennebunkport, Maine, won patent 6,010,292.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the often rarefied world of foreign policy
treatises, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace is making
a bet: that there are plenty of readers interested in a magazine
about globalization and how it affects them.
</P>
<P>
   No longer will Foreign Policy, the 30-year-old publication of
the endowment, concentrate on articles about relations between
governments, on military policy, or on the domestic politics of an
important American ally.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the magazine, remade from its elegant slim size into a
bigger, flashier format that resembles the celebrity magazine Talk,
will concentrate on ``global politics, economics and ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The first issue of the remade magazine, which is in the mail to
subscribers and will be on the newsstands early in September, poses
the question: Would a sudden collapse on Wall Street spark a global
21st century Great Depression?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily, is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The article, by Martin Wolf, associate editor of the Financial
Times, goes on to delineate some likely results: a weaker dollar, a
slump in international trade, particularly hurting Mexico and
Canada, and falling petroleum prices that would severely limit the
oil boom in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Policy was founded 30 years ago, partly as an antidote
to Foreign Affairs, the more staid, more establishment voice of the
Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's founders, Samuel Huntington and Warren Manshel,
thought that an alternative voice was needed to the hawkish views
of Foreign Affairs on the Vietnam War. Its initial creed, according
to its opening editorial, was to re-examine and redefine American
foreign policy as the United States disengaged from Vietnam.
Richard Holbrooke, currently the chief representative to the United
Nations, was its managing editor from 1972 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing Foreign Policy on globalization and the new economy,
the editor and publisher, Moises Naim, is making a fundamental
change from the founders' emphasis on the American role in world
affairs. Indeed, the choice of Naim three years ago was quite a
switch. A Venezuelan who was a trade minister of his country and
who had served two stints as a senior official at the World Bank,
Naim took charge of the magazine after the 17-year tenure of
Charles William Maynes.
</P>
<P>
   Naim _ whose interests span economics, and psychology as well as
classic foreign policy _ soon revamped the magazine to make it look
more like a literary publication. He livened it up with a Web site,
introduced reviews of books published abroad and ran lengthy
interviews with figures normally considered off-beat by a serious
foreign policy publication.
</P>
<P>
   The visage of Lori Wallach, a leader of the protests in Seattle
last year against the World Trade Organization, beamed out from the
cover of the magazine this spring, accompanied by an interview in
which she excoriated Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers and
the U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Naim's initial revamping did not go far enough in satisfying
the appetite of an audience he believes wants to know more about
how globalization is going to change their lives and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He is not so brash as to try to put out a news-you-can-use
publication, but in the world of foreign policy he is getting about
as close as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of confusion,'' he said. ``Globalization is
changing things faster than people, countries or companies can
digest or react to. A lot of the anxiety about globalization is
rooted in fast-paced changes, and it's not very clear how people
are going to come out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   So Naim is now directing Foreign Policy to readers who want an
understanding of globalization without reading specialist fare.
Next month, a lead article ``Sushi Goes Global'' describes how in
just a decade a Japanese speciality has become a worldwide
phenomenon involving the international regulation of the fish
trade. The lead interview will be with Ray Kendall, the head of
Interpol, the crime prevention agency, which has become more
important in the fight against people-trafficking and other crimes
that easily cross borders in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the rival Foreign Affairs has also gone through
something of a modernization, but it remains, according to Naim,
the journal of record.
</P>
<P>
   His magazine's circulation, subsidized by the Carnegie
Endowment, is a modest 30,000. With its new content and an extra $1
million investment by the endowment, Naim thinks he can push that
up to 130,000 over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Naim is not beyond attracting attention. At the World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this year, he gave a talk called the
``Occupational Hazards of Power'' in which he described how some
chiefs of Washington, Hollywood and Wall Street suffer from what he
called ``narcissistic personality disorder.'' If the size of the
crowd that came to hear that piercing criticism is a gauge, Naim
may reach his circulation target.

 &HT;    NORWEGIANS SAYS AIR REMAINS IN SUB, BUT FAIL TO OPEN HATCH
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Norwegian naval divers failed Sunday to find a way into
the shattered Russian nuclear submarine, but said that breathable
air could remain inside the vessel, contradicting official Russian
statements and adding a new layer of confusion to relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian citizens prolonged their vigil for the
118-member crew of the Kursk, lighting candles and saying prayers
in churches around the country for the men the Russian navy says
were probably killed immediately after the Aug 12 disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk nuclear submarine plunged 384 feet to the bottom of
the Barents Sea, probably after an explosion inside the vessel,
according to Russian naval officials. But more than one week of
unsuccessful rescue and salvage operations, the cause of the
accident _ and reliable information about the event _ are still
sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   A Norwegian crew, the first foreign divers to participate in the
rescue operation, failed Sunday after repeated attempts to open the
rear escape hatch on the Kursk, the only portion of the 500-foot
Oscar-class submarine Russian officials say might not be flooded.
</P>
<P>
   However, Norwegian officials told reporters that despite what
the Russian military has asserted, the hatch is not too damaged to
be opened and oxygen was still present within the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   They denied reports on Russian television that a body had been
found in the escape chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Divers have found that the outer hatch of the rear emergency
exit from the submarine is not damaged,'' armed forces spokesman
Kjell Grandhagen told Norway's NRK public radio. ``They have also
found that there is air inside it.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials had no immediate response to this news.
Earlier in the day, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, the
official in charge of the rescue operation, repeated his
government's pessimistic view of the situation, saying damage was
so severe that opening the hatch through conventional means would
be very difficult. He said that the decision had been made to pry
off the opening with a crane located on a Norwegian rescue ship.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian officials told Reuters news agency that the hatch
could be opened with foreign assistance, specifically with the
British mini-submarine, the LR-5
</P>
<P>
   ``The hatch is not destroyed and is in a fair condition,'' John
Espen Lien, spokesman for the Norwegian armed forces in Oslo, told
Reuters. ``We think it should be possible to open it with a British
or a Russian rescue capsule.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement outraged many Russians already frustrated and
angry with their government's handling of the rescue operation,
which many characterize as bungled and overly hostile to accepting
international aid due to the still-lingering Soviet mentality in
both the military and government.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they think this is, the 1970s?'' complained Andrei
Kazakov, a retired army colonel, who along with his family has
spent hours in front of his television watching the drama unfold.
``May God forgive them if they did not exhaust every possible
solution to save the crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin, slammed for inaction in a
crisis that has become a national tragedy, spoke to Russian
Orthodox Church leaders Sunday. In an emotional speech, Putin said
the rescue effort would continue to ``the last moment'' in the hope
someone might be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``With sorrow in our hearts and, I do not exaggerate, tears in
our eyes, we are following all that is happening in the Barents
Sea,'' he said. ``The sailors are doing everything they can to save
their comrades.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, late Sunday there was no definite word as to when the
next course of action would commence.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov said the Norwegians would attempt the crane operation
``soon,'' after their team rehearsed the maneuver on land. He did
not mention using the British LR-5 rescue sub at all, saying
instead that because of the damage to the sub's hull the vehicle
would be useless.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Britain's Ministry of Defense said the British
sub would remain on standby until the Russians had ``given up all
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was designed as a spy and attack vessel during the
Cold War. Like the Titanic, it was thought to be unsinkable, and
served as a symbol of national pride for a nation hit hard by
economic and political chaos during the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Only after days of failed attempts to dock with the sub, a
situation Russian officials blamed on the damaged hatch, did the
Kremlin grudgingly agree to foreign help.
</P>
<P>
   Former military officers and analysts both say that the rescue
attempt has been compromised by the fact that Russia's military
chain of command are veterans of the Soviet mentality that honored
silence as patriotic and the dispersal of information as
traitorous.
</P>
<P>
   This legacy, coupled with the fact that Putin, himself a former
KGB operative, has filled his government with other veterans of the
spy service, makes it a difficult call as to whether the situation
signifies a deliberate cover-up or extreme incompetence, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, Russian (and Soviet) officialdom traditionally
suppressed facts about nuclear disasters, and bad habits die
hard,'' analyst Pavel Felgenhauer wrote in the daily Moscow Times.
``But the total confusion in statements after the sinking of the
Kursk may also be explained by a fit of panic that hit the
military-industrial establishment'' about compromising submarine
and nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a lack of official information, speculation ran wild in
Russia's daily newspapers as to the cause of the crash, with
theories ranging from a collision with a WWII-era mine or an ice
breaker stationed near the Arctic Circle to a missile launched from
a nearby American submarine.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Norwegian authorities detected two explosions in the
area last Saturday at the time the Kursk went down. The United
States has said that two of its subs were in the area of the Kursk
at the time of the explosion, but has denied engaging the sub.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Admiral Yegor Tomko, a retired Russian Naval Command
officer, dismissed these theories and said it was more likely there
was an accident in the submarine's torpedo room, with one warhead
detonating the others, a course of events the Russian naval command
has offered as likely.
</P>
<P>
   But, Tomko conceded that the truth would only come slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't know for sure until she surfaces,'' he said of the
Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   For relatives of the Russian crewmembers feared dead, many of
whom traveled for days and at great expense from their homes across
Russia to the western seaport of Murmansk _ near the sub's base _
to await word, the lack of information was an additional hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can a mother do but cry,'' Irina Vasilievna told Russian
television at the end of a packed Sunday service at Murmansk's main
Orthodox church.

MURDOCH'S SPINOFF OF FOX SHARES HAS BEEN BETTER FOR SOME THAN
OTHERS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There's no business like show business.'' At least that is
what the News Corp.'s chairman, Rupert Murdoch, was trying to
convince investors of when the company spun off 20 percent of Fox
Entertainment Group, its entertainment unit, to the public in
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp.'s shares were depressed at the time. By spinning off
a chunk of entertainment operations, Murdoch wanted to demonstrate
to shareholders that the company's entertainment assets were more
valuable than investors were giving News Corp. credit for.
</P>
<P>
   Did it work? Maybe better for News Corp. shareholders than for
Fox shareholders. Since the spinoff on Nov. 11, 1998, stock in Fox
Entertainment has climbed 20 percent from its close on its first
day of trading, a far smaller increase than other media stocks,
including Viacom, The Walt Disney Co., Time Warner, Seagram _ and
News Corp. itself, which has risen 85 percent during that period
and closed last Friday at $52.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Though the spinoff of Fox has helped News Corp., analysts say
the company's share price has also benefited from other actions,
including the merger of its TV Guide unit with Gemstar Inc. The
stock also got a vote of confidence last year when the cable mogul
John Malone increased his investment in News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   So what's eating Fox Entertainment?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the school nurse who is always issuing excuses,''
said Jeffrey Logsdon, a media analyst at WR Hambrecht &AMP; Co. ``Every
quarter, it's something else. There's always a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Take the quarter that ended June 30. Though revenue rose 25
percent, to $2.47 billion, the company reported earnings before
income taxes, depreciation and amortization of $235 million _ down
4.4 percent from a year earlier. The company attributed the decline
to the box-office failure of the movie ``Titan A.E.'' For the full
year, net profit was down to $145 million, or 20 cents a share,
compared with $205 million, or 33 cents a share, in the period a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's key assets include 20th Century Fox, which produces both
films and TV programs, and Fox Television, which includes the Fox
Network and TV stations, and cable services.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have talked as if good results are around the corner,''
said Christopher Dixon, an analyst at PaineWebber. ``Maybe this
time they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Syndication sales from reruns of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
and other TV series should begin to swell corporate coffers a year
from now, Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. claims that its problems at the Fox film studio are
over, now that there is a new management team in place under the
co-chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos.
</P>
<P>
   Besides looking for Fox's performance to put a dollar value on
News Corp.'s entertainment assets, the company may have hoped to
use Fox's stock to make acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   There was precedent for such optimism. In 1998, CBS spun off
what was then 20 percent of its Infinity radio and outdoor
advertising business. The spinoff let CBS use Infinity stock to buy
additional radio stations and outdoor advertising companies,
notably Outdoor Systems, which it bought for $6.5 billion. At that
time shares in CBS, perceived as a slower growing network business,
traded at a lower multiple than stock in Infinity, whose high cash
flow and faster growth made it more attractive to radio station
operators and other target companies.
</P>
<P>
   But since then CBS has merged with Viacom, and that stock has
done exceptionally well. So there is no further need for the
Infinity currency _ which explains why Viacom said last week it
would buy back the Infinity shares it did not already hold.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. has not had such good fortune with the Fox spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, target companies apparently prefer News
Corp. stock to Fox stock. Last week when the TV station owner
Chris-Craft Industries sold out to News Corp. for stock and cash,
Chris-Craft got stock in News Corp. News Corp. plans to swap the
stations to Fox for newly issued Fox stock.
</P>
<P>
   An acquired company will want shares of the parent company
because ``they want the ownership at the level of the guy who runs
the company,'' said a News Corp. investor who contends Fox stock
has not achieved its goals. ``And they like the asset mix at News
Corp. much better.''
</P>
<P>
   If Fox's performance improves, the bulls will feel vindicated.
But if Murdoch were to decide to buy back stock, those who want to
bail out may not like the price.
</P>
<P>
   There are several cases of media companies spinning off assets
and then trying to buy back the shares at a price investors do not
find acceptable. Some analysts said last week that Viacom, which is
controlled by Chairman Sumner Redstone, might have to raise its bid
for Infinity's remaining shares slightly above the equivalent of
about $40 a share it offered last week.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone himself has been on the other side of such
transactions. When he owned a stake in MGM Home Entertainment, a
company controlled by the financier Kirk Kerkorian, he went to
court to sue for a higher price when Kerkorian tried to buy back
the shares at a price Redstone considered inadequate. Redstone won.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Murdoch has revealed no plans to buy Fox shares. But
should he decide to make such a move, investors presumably will be
comparing his offer not only to the market price at the time, but
to the bold predictions he made in November 1998.

`PURPLE CANE ROAD': BORN ON THE BAYOU, DYING THERE TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Near the beginning of this new police mystery by James Lee
Burke, a man with the exotic name Vachel Carmouche is hacked into
his constituent body parts _ all clearly identified by Burke _ by a
woman wielding a mattock.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end, the body of a state official named Jim Gable is
found, wrapped in a plastic wardrobe bag, in the trunk of a car.
This scene, too, is described with graphic succinctness by Burke:
``He had inhaled the bag into his mouth, so that he looked like a
guppy trying to breathe air at the top of an aquarium.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many other imaginative murders in ``Purple Cane
Road,'' and lots of bruising, bludgeoning, hacking and slicing in a
novel that tries hard to be atmospheric, hard-boiled, charged with
brutality. Set in the racially troubled, Creole-accented Louisiana
backwoods, Burke's novel comprises several intertwining stories of
sexual abuse, political corruption, murder and revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The characters range from a prostitute named Little Face
Dautrieve to an ambitious attorney general, Connie Deshotel, to a
drunken private eye, and they are an aromatic group, each giving
off a highly individual smell.
</P>
<P>
   But redolent of the bayou as it is, ``Purple Cane Road'' remains
a meandering contrivance, a set of apertures in which Burke makes
visible about as much seediness and mortality as is reasonably
possible to cram into a mere 341 pages.
</P>
<P>
   He provides a tingle here and there and a luscious sense of Deep
South iniquity, but his book's psychedelic straining for ever more
stylized killings perversely robs it of the plausibility and
unexpectedness that are necessary for genuine suspense.
</P>
<P>
   The main character and narrator will be familiar to readers of
Burke's previous books. He is Dave Robicheaux, a homicide detective
in the sheriff's office in Iberia Parish. Robicheaux is a
recovering alcoholic and a good guy, even if he is prone to
clubbing people from time to time with his heavy fists. He only
does this when he is angry and when people really deserve it, but
he is angry often and many people seem deserving.
</P>
<P>
   Robicheaux's first concern is that Letty Labiche, a former
prostitute and the murderer of Vachel Carmouche, was abused by her
victim for years while she was growing up with her twin sister in
the house next door. As the action gets under way in ``Purple Cane
Road,'' Letty has been on death row for eight years, and her
execution is approaching, unless Robicheaux can find some
extenuating circumstances to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   As Robicheaux interviews prostitutes and pimps, trying to get
something new on the Carmouche murder, someone tells him that his
own mother, who disappeared mysteriously years before, was murdered
by police officers because she had seen them do away with somebody
else.
</P>
<P>
   Robicheaux investigates, asking about his mother's disappearance
and learning of seedy connections between the police and the
Giacano organized-crime family. But soon, out of nowhere, the man
who told him about his mother's death, a wiry pimp named Zipper
Clum, is shot dead by a hired assassin.
</P>
<P>
   The same assassin then goes to kill Little Face Dautrieve,
though he seems to change his mind at the last minute, showing that
he is an assassin with, possibly, a conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Who wants these people dead? Who killed Mae Guillory,
Robicheaux's mother? And can Letty Labiche be saved from lethal
injection?
</P>
<P>
   Robicheaux assiduously works on all three questions at once,
helped by Clete Purcel, his alcoholic sidekick who has no interest
in overcoming his drinking problem, or, for that matter, his own
inclination to beat people up. Sometimes alone, sometimes in
Purcel's troubled company, Robicheaux tours the Louisiana
underbrush, winging about by car and by boat.
</P>
<P>
   As the deaths accumulate, everybody seems to be vaguely suspect,
including Deshotel; Gable, a police liaison officer; Gable's
wealthy, semi-invalid wife, Cora; and Cora's creepy chauffeur,
Micah.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems capable of knocking someone else off in this
book, and several of them do so, but most of the murders are
committed by the hired killer who blew away Zipper Clum (after
hacking off his arm with a machete). This is Johnny Remeta, a smart
maniac who torments Robicheaux by charming his impressionable
teen-age daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Burke's plot is as thick and tortuous as a
Louisiana swamp, and while there is certainly nothing wrong with
that, some matters _ like motivation and the trail of evidence _
seem at times to disappear in the murk.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Burke leaves large holes in the logic, but rather
that the degree of mayhem does not seem justified by the stakes
involved. Remeta, the murderer in chief, is a psychopath and maybe
doesn't need motivation, but his appearances out of nowhere have a
Wizard of Oz quality and seem out of place in a novel whose sense
of rootedness is likely to be important to its author.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robicheaux, with a terse sort of solidity, is a man of a few
well-chosen words. He speaks to his colleagues in something close
to code, with about as many metaphors for knocking somebody off as
there are people knocked off in this novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the chance to plant one in Johnny Remeta's cauliflower
and didn't do it,'' he tells his chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``You froze?'' the chief asks him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had him set up,'' Robicheaux says. ``I was going to cut all
his motors.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Robicheaux may be laconic, he discloses plenty about
his interior life, including his dreams, his moods, his despair,
his sometimes clumsy efforts to set things right. He is very human,
and he gives this novel, despite its nonstop violence, its strong
moral sense.
</P>
<P>
   Burke also entertains with his knack for the underside of the
human experience and with his characters' jaundiced disregard for
the corrupt human heart.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Purple Cane Road'' is so stylized, so devoted to its own
appearances, that it comes across as almost a commentary on itself
rather than as something real, a novel whose characters genuinely
cry out when they are hurt.

THE NEW ECONOMY :  MANUFACTURING HEADED FOR THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, it was obvious which prominent Irwin Jacobs was
the business executive exemplar of the new economy. That would be
Irwin M. Jacobs, the computer scientist and electrical engineer who
founded Qualcomm in San Diego in 1985. He built it into a thriving
Fortune 500 company through pioneering innovations in cellular
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The other Irwin Jacobs, Irwin L. Jacobs, is an irrepressible
deal-maker and bargain-hunter based in Minneapolis. He became
wealthy by taking big stakes in Fortune 500 conglomerates in the
1970s and 1980s, usually with the goal of unlocking value by
breaking them up.
</P>
<P>
   New technology was never high on Irwin L.'s list of
fascinations. His effort to sell goods directly to consumers over
the Web (wgdeal.com, for ``world's greatest deal'') was a bust. The
only major business he retains from his days as a corporate raider
_ Genmar Holdings, the nation's second-largest leisure boat
manufacturer _ is in a labor-intensive segment of the economy that
has been among the slowest to invest in new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin L.'s image may get a cybersheen at the end of this month,
though. That is when Genmar plans to hold an open house at its
Little Falls, Minn., factory to show off a compact, enclosed
computer-controlled manufacturing system that can be remotely
operated over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will see 18-foot hulls _ which used to take eight hours
to produce _ pop out every 35 minutes. Pollution, waste and labor
will be sharply reduced, while quality will be so much higher that
Genmar is offering a lifetime guarantee instead of the industry
standard of five years. Genmar says the total cost is comparable to
that for boats made by conventional techniques _ and should become
lower over time.
</P>
<P>
   Time Magazine, given a preview tour and a sales pitch on how the
system could be adapted to many other products, called it ``the
revolution in a box'' and suggested it could make large centralized
factories ``obsolete.'' Bruce Bobbins, Jacob's publicist, calls the
process, known as virtual engineered composite, or VEC, ``the most
important manufacturing revolution in the past half century.'
</P>
<P>
   The technology was invented by Gene Kirila II and Robert
McCollum, two Pennsylvanians who envision scattering leased VEC
manufacturing cells around the world that would produce products
close to where they would be used. The expertise to run the systems
could reside at a central control center thanks to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs was so impressed with how well the virtual engineered
composite process had fitted Genmar's needs that he bought Pyramid
Operating Systems, the company Kirila and McCollum created in 1993
to develop VEC. Genmar's control room is hundreds of miles from
Little Falls, in Greenville, Pa., where Kirila, McCollum and an
expanding team of engineers are searching for new VEC applications.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing experts say Jacobs would be justified in bragging
about the process at any high-technology gathering. Interest in VEC
could provide the fuel for taking Genmar public, a move Jacobs has
talked about for years.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobs and other backers of his technology face the
temptation to oversell VEC's future. In addition to underestimating
the costs and risks other manufacturers could encounter in moving
to their new technology, proponents of the process are probably
underestimating the strengths and potential of competing
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, as the history of robotics, machine vision and other
innovations shows, computer-based technology generally seeps,
rather than bursts, into manufacturing. The bigger the
manufacturing sector the more cautious are managers to replace
proven technologies and materials with new approaches. There is no
particular reason to believe that any of VEC's attributes,
including its ability to be controlled by remote experts via the
Internet, will change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make numbers every quarter,'' said Paul Dickard, a
spokesman for Ingersoll-Rand, which has been experimenting with VEC
for several years. ``There's always the question of which quarter
you are going to sacrifice on the altar of Internet-enabled
manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet capability is central to the vision of
virtual-engineered-composite manufacturing systems which would
serve as remote minifactories that could be set up and running
within days. But that innovation, already available in different
forms on other computerized manufacturing equipment, is only part
of what makes VEC a unique package. The other key element,
developed to keep costs down, is the use of laminated plastic skins
instead of metal as the molding frames.
</P>
<P>
   The skins are attached to supports inside the VEC cell and
composite resins are injected between them. To give the skins the
rigidity that metal would usually provide, Kirila and McCollum hit
upon the elegantly simple idea of water pressure. Before the
molding compounds are injected, the cell is sealed and the cavities
behind the skins are filled with water.
</P>
<P>
   VEC is clearly innovative enough to attract many window
shoppers, but the chances that it will lead to the wide dispersal
in manufacturing that its inventors envision are slim. Plastics
manufacturing experts say Jacobs is likely to have his hands full
simply establishing the process as a reliable system in a few
segments of industry best suited to it. Logical candidates include
other marine products like jet skis as well as bathtubs and
paneling for buildings, trucks, rail cars or specialty vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's suited for about half the volume of the plastics
composites industry,'' estimates Robert Locavara, director of
technical affairs for the Composite Fabricators Association, a
trade group for companies that make industrial components and
consumer products out of fiberglass and other plastic composites.
</P>
<P>
   That could add up to billions of dollars of production, but one
thing is for sure: even if it comes to pass, it will not happen at
Internet speed.

   FOX SPINOFF HAS BENEFITED SOME MORE THAN OTHERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corp., spun off 20
percent of Fox Entertainment Group to the public in November 1998,
he was trying to convince investors that the company's
entertainment assets were more valuable than investors were giving
News Corp. credit for.
</P>
<P>
   The move has been better for News Corp. shareholders than for
Fox shareholders. Since the spinoff, stock in Fox Entertainment has
climbed just 20 percent, a far smaller increase than other media
stocks, including Viacom, Walt Disney, Time Warner, Seagram _ and
News Corp. itself, which has risen 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN MODERN SOUNDS LIKE OLDIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it nears its 10th anniversary as a radio format, so-called
modern rock is at a crossroads. Modern, also called alternative, is
the style that established itself as the first to play new music,
like that of Limp Bizkit, led by Fred Durst. But the format has
begun to sound commonplace, leading listeners to ask: What exactly
is modern rock radio an alternative to?
</P>
<P>
   MORE TAKING THAN GIVING ON THE WEB &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Software programs like Napster and Gnutella have achieved a
reputation for fostering a communal spirit of sharing among
millions of music-loving computer users. The reality may be more
selfish. Two scientists at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center have
surveyed the behavior of anonymous music downloaders and have found
that, rather than demonstrating a ``from each, to each'' ethos,
most Internet users are only taking files and not giving back to
their electronic community.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC VIDEOS ARE GOING DIGITAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of music videos are being produced
specifically for the Internet. To suit its intended medium, the
video's creators use software that crams its saturated colors and
lively animation into a relatively compact file for fast
downloading. The cost is compressed, too, with a budget far below
that of a full-scale music video.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETING ENTERS THE E-MAIL ERA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among Internet companies struggling to retain customers, e-mail
marketing is seen as the next best thing to being on the home page
each time a customer goes online. E-mail is a relatively
inexpensive marketing tool, provides immediate results and can be
measured. But conducting an effective e-mail campaign is
complicated, with challenges ranging from basic privacy issues to
technical hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   DEAL MAKER TURNS TO TECHNOLOGY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Irwin L. Jacobs, who became wealthy by taking big stakes in
Fortune 500 conglomerates in the 1970s and 1980s, usually with the
goal of unlocking value by breaking them up, never seemed overly
fascinated by new technology. A company left over from his
corporate raider days, Genmar Holdings, is the nation's
second-largest leisure boat manufacturer, a labor-intensive segment
that has been slow to invest in new technology. But now Jacobs
plans to hold an open house at a factory to show off a compact,
enclosed computer-controlled manufacturing system that can be
remotely operated over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   SODA MAKER SEEN ON AUCTION BLOCK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Britvic, one of Britain's largest soft-drink manufacturers, is
for sale as part of a strategy by Bass to focus on its hotel
business, executives said. Analysts say the company could be sold
for more than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   A MAKEOVER FOR FOREIGN POLICY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No longer will Foreign Policy, the 30-year-old publication of
the the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, concentrate on
relations between governments, on military policy, or on the
domestic politics of an important American ally. Instead, the
magazine, remade from its elegant slim size into a bigger, flashier
format that resembles the celebrity magazine Talk, will concentrate
on ``global politics, economics and ideas.''

`THE FUGITIVE' FINDS A HOME IN SMALL TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Daly, who makes his home in Providence, R.I., knew nothing
about Everett, Wash., when told his new fall series, ``The
Fugitive,'' would be based there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will admit to you that when I first heard about Everett, I
thought it was a person,'' the former ``Wings'' star said Saturday
at a news conference in Everett's picturesque Harborview Park.
``When I found out it was a town, I was particularly thrilled to
know it was not in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably not as thrilled as Suzy Kellett, director of the
Washington State Film Office, who has seen dozens of film and TV
productions choose Vancouver, B.C., over Western Washington because
the U.S. dollar buys more key grips in Kokanee country. Everything
else being equal, particularly the geographical blessings that
allow the U.S. Northwest and Canadian Southwest to pass for
anyplace imaginable, Vancouver usually wins because of the dollar
thing.
</P>
<P>
   But not this time.
</P>
<P>
   CBS and Warner Bros. Television are putting a checkbookful of
expectations behind this remake of ``The Fugitive,'' which will air
Friday nights at 8, beginning in October. One of its competitors is
NBC's ``Providence,'' which has succeeded in attracting viewers to
a time slot not considered the most attractive on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The producers want viewers to believe Daly's character, Dr.
Richard Kimble, is constantly changing locations in his search for
the one-armed man who murdered his wife, while staying a step ahead
of the cop who believes Kimble is the killer. While 85 percent of
the series will be produced in and around Everett, parts of each
episode, for authenticity's sake, will be shot in You Name It,
U.S.A., requiring cast and crew to pack up every few weeks and
temporarily relocate.
</P>
<P>
   The producers couldn't legally crisscross the States with a
Canadian crew. ``So there was never any thought of going to
Canada,'' said executive producer R.L. Goodwin, who spent five
seasons producing ``The X-Files'' in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Just how ``The Fugitive'' settled on the greater Everett
metroplex isn't very mysterious, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We analyzed everywhere,'' Goodwin said, ``and there's no place
in the country with this variety of locations, plus a mild winter,
where you can pull off a show like this.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helps that the ``Fugitive'' soundstage, a converted
warehouse in Mukilteo, is about 45 minutes from Goodwin's home on
Chuckanut Drive near Bellingham.
</P>
<P>
   And so Everett becomes a Chicago suburb. The nearby town of
Snohomish fills in for a town in the South. Seattle's Pioneer
Square is Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Everett Mayor Ed Hansen wouldn't mind if Everett actually played
Everett one of these days. (Goodwin says it's a possibility.) But
he's just as happy for the economic boost. Kellett's office
estimates the trickle-down from production of a series like ``The
Fugitive'' is one heck of a trickle: somewhere between $700,000 and
$1 million each week.
</P>
<P>
   The series is committed to 12 episodes through December, with an
option for 11 more, but Hansen told Daly and Goodwin that he can
put up with with thestreet closures and the other minor disruptions
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that you upset our lives for many years to come,'' the
mayor said, ``... and we hope you never catch the one-armed man.''

 &HT;    NORWEGIANS SAYS AIR REMAINS IN SUB, BUT FAIL TO OPEN HATCH
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Norwegian naval divers failed Sunday to find a way into
the shattered Russian nuclear submarine, but said that breathable
air could remain inside the vessel, contradicting official Russian
statements and adding a new layer of confusion to relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian citizens prolonged their vigil for the
118-member crew of the Kursk, lighting candles and saying prayers
in churches around the country for the men the Russian navy says
were probably killed immediately after the Aug 12 disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk nuclear submarine plunged 384 feet to the bottom of
the Barents Sea, probably after an explosion inside the vessel,
according to Russian naval officials. But more than one week of
unsuccessful rescue and salvage operations, the cause of the
accident _ and reliable information about the event _ are still
sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   A Norwegian crew, the first foreign divers to participate in the
rescue operation, failed Sunday after repeated attempts to open the
rear escape hatch on the Kursk, the only portion of the 500-foot
Oscar-class submarine Russian officials say might not be flooded.
</P>
<P>
   However, Norwegian officials told reporters that despite what
the Russian military has asserted, the hatch is not too damaged to
be opened and oxygen was still present within the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   They denied reports on Russian television that a body had been
found in the escape chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Divers have found that the outer hatch of the rear emergency
exit from the submarine is not damaged,'' armed forces spokesman
Kjell Grandhagen told Norway's NRK public radio. ``They have also
found that there is air inside it.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials had no immediate response to this news.
Earlier in the day, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, the
official in charge of the rescue operation, repeated his
government's pessimistic view of the situation, saying damage was
so severe that opening the hatch through conventional means would
be very difficult. He said that the decision had been made to pry
off the opening with a crane located on a Norwegian rescue ship.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian officials told Reuters news agency that the hatch
could be opened with foreign assistance, specifically with the
British mini-submarine, the LR-5
</P>
<P>
   ``The hatch is not destroyed and is in a fair condition,'' John
Espen Lien, spokesman for the Norwegian armed forces in Oslo, told
Reuters. ``We think it should be possible to open it with a British
or a Russian rescue capsule.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement outraged many Russians already frustrated and
angry with their government's handling of the rescue operation,
which many characterize as bungled and overly hostile to accepting
international aid due to the still-lingering Soviet mentality in
both the military and government.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they think this is, the 1970s?'' complained Andrei
Kazakov, a retired army colonel, who along with his family has
spent hours in front of his television watching the drama unfold.
``May God forgive them if they did not exhaust every possible
solution to save the crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin, slammed for inaction in a
crisis that has become a national tragedy, spoke to Russian
Orthodox Church leaders Sunday. In an emotional speech, Putin said
the rescue effort would continue to ``the last moment'' in the hope
someone might be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``With sorrow in our hearts and, I do not exaggerate, tears in
our eyes, we are following all that is happening in the Barents
Sea,'' he said. ``The sailors are doing everything they can to save
their comrades.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, late Sunday there was no definite word as to when the
next course of action would commence.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov said the Norwegians would attempt the crane operation
``soon,'' after their team rehearsed the maneuver on land. He did
not mention using the British LR-5 rescue sub at all, saying
instead that because of the damage to the sub's hull the vehicle
would be useless.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Britain's Ministry of Defense said the British
sub would remain on standby until the Russians had ``given up all
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was designed as a spy and attack vessel during the
Cold War. Like the Titanic, it was thought to be unsinkable, and
served as a symbol of national pride for a nation hit hard by
economic and political chaos during the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Only after days of failed attempts to dock with the sub, a
situation Russian officials blamed on the damaged hatch, did the
Kremlin grudgingly agree to foreign help.
</P>
<P>
   Former military officers and analysts both say that the rescue
attempt has been compromised by the fact that Russia's military
chain of command are veterans of the Soviet mentality that honored
silence as patriotic and the dispersal of information as
traitorous.
</P>
<P>
   This legacy, coupled with the fact that Putin, himself a former
KGB operative, has filled his government with other veterans of the
spy service, makes it a difficult call as to whether the situation
signifies a deliberate cover-up or extreme incompetence, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, Russian (and Soviet) officialdom traditionally
suppressed facts about nuclear disasters, and bad habits die
hard,'' analyst Pavel Felgenhauer wrote in the daily Moscow Times.
``But the total confusion in statements after the sinking of the
Kursk may also be explained by a fit of panic that hit the
military-industrial establishment'' about compromising submarine
and nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a lack of official information, speculation ran wild in
Russia's daily newspapers as to the cause of the crash, with
theories ranging from a collision with a WWII-era mine or an ice
breaker stationed near the Arctic Circle to a missile launched from
a nearby American submarine.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Norwegian authorities detected two explosions in the
area last Saturday at the time the Kursk went down. The United
States has said that two of its subs were in the area of the Kursk
at the time of the explosion, but has denied engaging the sub.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Admiral Yegor Tomko, a retired Russian Naval Command
officer, dismissed these theories and said it was more likely there
was an accident in the submarine's torpedo room, with one warhead
detonating the others, a course of events the Russian naval command
has offered as likely.
</P>
<P>
   But, Tomko conceded that the truth would only come slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't know for sure until she surfaces,'' he said of the
Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   For relatives of the Russian crewmembers feared dead, many of
whom traveled for days and at great expense from their homes across
Russia to the western seaport of Murmansk _ near the sub's base _
to await word, the lack of information was an additional hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can a mother do but cry,'' Irina Vasilievna told Russian
television at the end of a packed Sunday service at Murmansk's main
Orthodox church.

MUSIC VIDEOS ENTER THE DIGITAL AGE
</HEADLINE>
 By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A go-go dancer wiggles as the music starts to play on the video
for the song ``Nicotine &AMP; Gravy.'' The song's performer, Beck,
appears briefly on-screen, and then is soon replaced by a throbbing
montage of photographs and glaring graphics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicotine &AMP; Gravy'' might look like just another hyperkinetic
MTV offering. But like an increasing number of music videos, this
one has a digital twist: It was produced specifically for the
Internet, not television. To suit its intended medium, the video's
creators used software that crams its saturated colors and lively
animation into a relatively compact file for fast downloading. The
cost is compressed, too, with a budget far below that of a
full-scale music video.
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence that this is a music digital, as the online
videos are sometimes called, is found in the final frame of
``Nicotine &AMP; Gravy,'' which is available on Shockwave.com. The
frame provides a link to Beck's Web site, www.beck.com, where an
e-commerce shop sells compact discs, T-shirts and mouse pads.
</P>
<P>
   So far, fewer than three dozen music digitals are available on
the Web, from a half-dozen companies that include Fullerene
Productions and Sudden Industries. And such files are greatly
outnumbered by MTV-style video clips available for viewing on many
sites via so-called streaming technology, in which the clips remain
on the host Web site, rather than being downloaded for playback on
the user's computer. The drawback to the more common streamed video
images, though, is that after being squeezed to pass through a
phone line, the streamed images are tiny, blurred and washed out by
the time they arrive on the computer screen. Even with high-speed
DSL or cable-modem Internet connections, streaming video can look
jerky.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents see a future in music digitals as a video counterpart
to MP3 files _ the compressed files that are now the most popular
format for sending digital music over the Internet. And in fact,
the music-digital video files can be even smaller packets of data
than MP3 files, though the audio portion of the music digital tends
to be of somewhat lesser quality than with MP3.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people will take the time to download an MP3, which is
about three and a half megabytes for a three-and-a-half-minute
song, they'll download a full-length music video that's a half or
third that size,'' said Jeff Ellermeyer, president of Fullerene
Productions, the Los Angeles company that made the Beck video.
</P>
<P>
   Beck's recording label, Seagram's Interscope, also benefits.
``The label gets another way to distribute the music, except that
this one has marketing components built in,'' Ellermeyer said. One
promise of future interactive, high-speed cable television systems
is that people will be able to ``watch a video, click on a link and
go buy the album,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Ellermeyer added, ``we're doing that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even MTV, the showcase for conventional videos, is experimenting
with what it calls Webeos _ online videos that can be downloaded
and that let viewers control some of the sounds and images. On
Sept. 1, the company plans to post its first five interactive
Webeos for songs by performers like Moby, Busta Rhymes and Bjork.
</P>
<P>
   For the ``I've Seen It All'' Webeo, Bjork is working with Floria
Sigismondi, the noted video director, and even rerecording a
shorter version of the tune. As the song plays, viewers will be
able to click on portions of the screen to see Bjork's handwritten
lyrics or alter the audio. For Busta Rhymes' ``Make Noise,'' Web
users can select images they want to see during the video.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a great platform for traditional music videos, which
is our television services,'' said Nicholas Butterworth, president
and chief executive of MTV's interactive group. ``For the Web,
we're trying to come up with something that really uses the
capabilities of the medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the debut of the MTV cable channel on Aug. 1, 1981, with a
screening of the video for the Buggles' song ``Video Killed the
Radio Star,'' music videos have become an integral part of the
recording industry's marketing campaigns for new and established
artists, while emerging as a staple of popular culture in their own
right.
</P>
<P>
   Developers of the new forms of online videos hope to keep that
tradition of marketing and art form alive. Although Beck's
``Nicotine &AMP; Gravy'' is one of only 15 music digitals on
Shockwave.com, Stefanie Henning, the site's vice president for
content acquisition, said she hoped to have 100 ``Shockwave
Singles'' online within a year _ as a lure to viewers and
advertisers alike.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the Internet to kill the conventional music
video. For one thing, Web videos do not yet deliver the millions of
eyeballs that television can bring. Fullerene's online video for
the Duran Duran song ``Someone Else Not Me'' was an Internet hit,
for example. But that meant it was downloaded a mere 15,000 times
in June.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the lower costs of the mostly animated music digitals
mean they do not necessarily need to attract as large an audience
as the television versions. Another company in the field, Sudden
Industries, has charged $15,000 to $100,000 for the Vmations _ as
the company calls them _ that it has created for Nine Inch Nails
and a dozen other acts. That compares with the cost of a
professionally made television music video, which starts at
$100,000, with the cost of a big-budget production reaching into
the millions.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden Industries' founder, Bob Holmes, who was nominated for a
music-video Grammy Award as a member of the group Rubber Rodeo in
1982, says that online videos have their special niches in the
music industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' he said, ``the artists who are best served by them
are the ones that either have a loyal following on the Web, or the
bands that can't afford to do full-scale music videos and want to
find an alternative form of marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   At MTV, a unit of Viacom, Webeos are seen as a complement to the
network's televised programming. The ones scheduled for September
release are being produced to promote this year's Video Music
Awards, and the company will introduce others in the coming months.
``Our audience is increasingly using two screens at once, crossing
back and forth from TV to the Web,'' Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mark Ghuneim, senior vice president for online
technologies at Sony's Columbia Records Group, who is credited with
coining the phrase music digitals a few years ago. He says he is
pleased to see that ``now, there finally are some.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of Sony's music acts are working on Vmations: P.J. Olsson,
performing ``Visine''; Getaway People, doing the song ``Six Pac'';
and PaloAlto, with ``Sonny.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghuneim said Vmations could be a good way for emerging artists
to produce low-cost music videos that could be shown on the
Internet as well as on television.
</P>
<P>
   Some made-for-PC videos are starting to pop up on television.
Ellermeyer said that his Duran Duran video had been on MTV and that
the Beck video had been on MTV2. And Cablevision's MuchMusic USA, a
channel devoted to music videos, is preparing a fall pilot for a
30-minute show devoted to Sudden Industries' Vmations. Nora Ryan,
MuchMusic's general manager, said the program is being developed
with an eye toward the day when interactive set-top boxes for
televisions are widely available.
</P>
<P>
   But as the MTV generation becomes increasingly a Web audience,
and as online technology improves, it may turn out that music
videos on television will become less important. That possibility
provides another motivation for MTV's Webeos. ``Over the next
couple of years, who's to say that music video might not migrate
more to the Internet?'' Butterworth said. ``We're just trying to
jump-start something we think is going to happen over the long
term, anyway.'' &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record chill will greet parts of the Great Lakes and Northeast
Monday morning as a large Canadian air mass settles over the
region. Temperatures at daybreak will be as low as the 30s from the
high plateau of West Virginia to the valleys of central New
England. Under bright sunshine, temperatures will rise 30 or more
degrees by noon. An exception will be Maine where patchy clouds and
sprinkles will form.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary with tropical air will be active with clouds and
showers from southern Georgia to the southern Appalachians.
Thunderstorms will erupt in the sultry air across Florida and the
Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A few storms will precede a series of fronts moving through the
upper Mississippi Valley. Slightly cooler air will reach the
northern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoon thunderstorms will form over the Rockies, but much of
the West will be sunny and warmer.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: MUD STORM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A barrage of bad weather replete with high winds, heavy rain,
hail and blowing dust occurred in Tucson, Ariz., on Saturday. Flash
flooding closed some of the downtown streets as traffic along
Interstate 10 came to a halt for a short time when the thunderstorm
rolled through around 6 p.m. The violent storm, spawned by
vestigial moisture from tropical storm Beryl, produced winds of 60
miles an hour. The gusty winds initially raised a huge cloud of
dust, which was overtaken by torrents of rain and small hail. &QL;

 NEW HIGHWAY SAFETY CZAR IS A NATURAL FOR THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sue Bailey, the government's new highway safety
czar, insists she is not obsessive when it comes to safety on the
roads. ``I'm not at all an anxious person,'' she says. ``I'm not
compulsive.''
</P>
<P>
   So who, then, was that young mother in Philadelphia in the early
1970s who hired a mechanic to install a seat belt for her son on
the bus that ferried neighborhood kids to preschool? And who, back
at a time before child-restraint seats, made one of her own by
cutting holes in a plastic child seat so that a seat belt could be
looped through it to keep her toddler daughter safe?
</P>
<P>
   Her son, now 31 and an emergency-room physician in suburban
Washington, ``will tell you that he still remembers that he was the
only one on that little schoolbus who had to buckle himself in,''
says Bailey, a psychiatrist, neurologist and public-health
specialist who begins work Monday as the administrator of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested way before anybody else seemed to be
interested in how to make yourself safe in a vehicle,'' she says,
recalling that three decades ago, Americans rarely used seat belts,
and that her neighbors ``thought I was crazy'' to be so concerned
about her children's safety in the car. ``I was probably ahead of
Ralph Nader.''
</P>
<P>
   When the White House announced her appointment to lead the
traffic safety administration, ``my family and friends were all
laughing,'' she explains. ``They said, `This is perfect. She's
driven us crazy for years about these safety issues in automobiles.
Now she can do something about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who has overseen health policy at the Defense Department
for the last two years, will have no time to ease herself in to her
new job at NHTSA, which is responsible for the safety of the
nation's highways, automobiles and tires.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is under scrutiny after the announcement that
millions of Firestone tires are being recalled because of evidence
that they are prone to shredding; 62 deaths have been linked so far
to separation of the treads on tires that were installed as
original equipment on some Ford vehicles. NHTSA has been criticized
by public-safety advocates for failing to properly track accidents
involving the tires, and for not forcing Firestone and Ford to do
more, faster.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey says it is too early for her to discuss the recall in
detail. But without making judgments about the agency's
performance, she says she will review the methods used to monitor
tire safety. ``I'm so hesitant to speak about this because this was
before my tenure,'' she says. ``But I do want to review our ability
to track in a timely fashion, which is part of how we serve the
American public.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not new to controversy. During her tenure at the Pentagon
_ she was assistant secretary of defense for health affairs from
1998 until this summer, the first woman to oversee the military
health system _ she directed a program to inoculate troops against
the deadly anthrax virus despite claims from some soldiers that the
vaccine was unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   She has no apologies for the program, which had to be
dramatically scaled back because of vaccine shortages and
mismanagement at the company licensed to produce it. ``I knew what
we were doing was right,'' she says. ``Anthrax is easily
weaponized, it's as deadly as the ebola virus, and you need
protection. We had a safe vaccine. It would have made me
uncomfortable to think that there were body bags coming back that I
could have prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, 57 years old, was born Patricia Sue Bailey in Rapid
City, S.D., the third of four children. Her father, a physician,
dabbled in engineering, and during World War II he worked at a B-17
base in Rapid City and invented a type of compass still common in
aircraft today. ``By all rights, my family should be very rich'' on
the basis of that invention, she says. ``But we're not, because he
did it for the public good. I respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was three, the family moved to Washington, so her
father could continue his engineering work at Andrews Air Force
base. Of his children, Sue was the one most likely to help her
father under the hood of the family car. ``I was the one who worked
on machinery with him, whether it was the car or the lawnmower or
the furnace,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She followed her father into osteopathic medicine, which
stresses holistic treatments. She graduated from the Philadelphia
College of Osteopathic Medicine and completed her residency in
psychiatry and neurology at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. She worked
in private practice in Washington, raising two children. She is
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong, politically active Democrat, she returned home
Friday from the party's convention in Los Angeles. She is an eager
supporter of Vice President Al Gore. Gore, she says, will continue
the economic expansion that is helping to make cars safer. ``It's a
luxury to make policy that provides for safety,'' she says. ``If
you have a sound economy, corporations are going to be more willing
and more able to embrace techniques to make cars safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into a car at the airport late Friday night for the
ride home, she first _ of course _ fastened her seat belt. And she
looked disapprovingly when she noticed that another passenger had
failed to buckle his.
</P>
<P>
   She announced _ only half in jest, it seemed _ that the car
would stop until he buckled up. ``You're being a danger not only to
yourself but to the other people in this car,'' she explained, all
but shaking her finger. ``You could be a flying object that would
endanger the driver. I'm not going to participate in this ride if
you don't put that seat belt on.'' The passenger hurriedly obeyed.

REVIEW OF PATTY LARKIN'S REGROOVING THE DREAM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
``Regrooving the Dream'' 
Patty Larkin 
Vanguard
<TEXT>
<P>
   Singer-songwriters ultimately give away more about themselves
than their subjects when trying to document other people's troubled
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Tori Amos' ``From the Choirgirl Hotel'' was a quirky collection
on women bearing scars. The album mimicked her own personal
afflictions. For years, Suzanne Vega has been writing coffeehouse
lyrics about passers-by who mirror herself.
</P>
<P>
   New England folkie Patty Larkin's new ``Regrooving the Dream''
can be added to this confessional line by female artists. The album
is a studied look at the independent highs and desolate lows of
change.
</P>
<P>
   Cut up into clear sections and partitioned by short instrumental
buffers, it's bound to strike a chord with anyone who has faced the
prospect of leaving a safe situation for the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin's autobiographical giveaway is her penchant for musical
change as a metaphor within the album's rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   From the Afro-Brazilian samba beat of ``Only One'' to the
Appalachian folk of ``Hotel Monte Vista,'' she appears in search of
something within each song's structure. It's almost as if exploring
different types of world music were her highly personalized form of
self-help.
</P>
<P>
   Following the staggered steel-blues beginning of ``Anyway the
Main Thing Is,'' Larkin casually states, ``I took the train just
for the view. I took my boyfriend's last name for something to
do.'' It's a strong line that offers discontent and unwise choices
as a continuing theme.
</P>
<P>
   Over the repetitious warped notes and soup-stirring drum brushes
of ``River,'' Larkin talks about the loyalty of a dog in a voice
unsatisfied because it has little else. ``Only One'' purposely
emphasizes the hollow echo of the recording studio to heighten an
ambience of solitude.
</P>
<P>
   The reward in ``Regrooving the Dream'' is when Larkin actually
finds serenity for both her fictional muses and herself. ``Mink
Coats'' is an endearing display of unconditional affection over a
lap steel and guitar roll stolen from the Velvet Underground's
``Sweet Jane.'' And ``Just a Few Words'' is a folk recollection so
rich in small-town detail it's hard to imagine she didn't
experience it herself.
</P>
<P>
   It really doesn't matter whom the stories are about. By the end,
listeners will be in on the catharsis and applying the change to
their own lives. &QL;

POPE SAYS MASS BEFORE 2 MILLION TO END WORLD YOUTH FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ In the largest youth gathering ever held in the West,
more than 2 million young people prayed, sang, swayed and got
sprayed with water hoses Sunday at a Mass celebrated by John Paul
II on a hot, dusty, trash-strewn field in a suburb of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The youth Mass closed a six-day World Youth festival timed to
coincide with a Roman Catholic Holy Year. The Italian press dubbed
the gathering ``The Catholic Woodstock'' _ a teeming love-in
without the sex, drugs or rock 'n' roll, but with much of the same
enthusiasm and abandon.
</P>
<P>
   At an overnight vigil held Saturday night before Sunday's Mass,
one overwrought young girl burst through security lines and hurled
herself into the frail pope's arms as if he were a pop star, and he
gently patted her head as she wept on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like a rock concert in some ways, huge masses of people
getting really excited, but really, it's about spirituality, not
entertainment,'' said Claire Heyne of Dallas, who graduated from
college in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But the festival, which drew hundreds of thousands to packed
prayer services at churches throughout the city, mass confessions
at Circus Maximus, and the Stations of the Cross at the Colosseum,
was as much a Special Olympics of the soul _ a huge, often grueling
effort by young Catholics to show the world that not all of today's
youths live in a secular, morality-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main principles of this whole thing is to prove to
people that the new generation still believes,'' Etienne Corpechot,
18, a high-school student from Paris, said as he squatted amid a
sea of rumpled sleeping bags and cardboard boxes in scorching
98-degree heat waiting for the pope to begin Mass. And his was a
point that John Paul, who turned 80 last May, welcomed with visible
relish and relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society desperately needs this sign, and young people need
it even more so,'' the pope said in his homily Sunday, ``tempted as
they often are by the illusion of an easy and comfortable life, by
drugs and pleasure seeking, only to find themselves in a spiral of
despair, meaninglessness and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnout for this World Youth Day, the 15th since John Paul
created the event in 1984, exceeded even Vatican expectations,
which hovered at 1.5 million. It was the largest papal event ever
held in Europe, drawing 2 million people, according to city
officials, and topping the previous World Youth Day, which gathered
more than 1 million in Paris in 1997. Only the World Youth Day in
Manila in 1995, which drew up to 4 million people, was larger.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims began streaming in on Tuesday, staying in convents,
priories, hostels and public school buildings, which the city began
planning to make available two years ago for the event. But on
Saturday night more than 1 million people slept on sleeping bags,
cardboard boxes and plastic bags in the open air of a vast, arid
field belonging the University of Rome in preparation for the
pope's Mass Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The huge numbers, and a lapse in organization, brought the day
to a chaotic end. Pilgrims, who were supposed to leave in scheduled
waves, instead left en masse, swarming into the one metro stop near
the field, flooding highways and bus stops and overwhelming the
transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, the event was a personal triumph for the pope,
who prides himself on his rapport with young people and has long
viewed the Holy Year of the new millennium as a cornerstone of his
papacy. Frail, and shaking from the symptoms of Parkinson's, the
pope nevertheless beamed throughout Saturday night's three-hour
candlelit ceremony, tapping his armchair to the music and at the
end swaying both arms above his head as if joining a human wave.
</P>

   ``I return, rejuvenated,'' he told Saturday's cheering crowd,
noting approvingly that ``Rome has never heard such a noise
before.''
</P>
<P>
   But there also were some tears of fatigue and frustration, as
young pilgrims, who invaded a deserted Rome, found themselves
walking for miles in tight packs, or crammed into trams and buses
in stifling heat. Many were lodged on the floors of empty school
rooms, modestly donning bathing suits to take outdoor showers.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, young people from Europe, Latin America, Africa
and Asia sang as they walked, cheerfully shrugging off discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am used to the heat, and I have no right to be sleepy if the
pope can make it,'' Sabin Sonhaye, 29, a student from Togo, said at
the Saturday night vigil. He saw the pope in his own country in
1984, when he was 14, but said he had wanted to experience a World
Youth Day ever since viewing a video cassette of the Paris event.
He, like others, expressed a desire to renew their faith with
like-minded young people. Others said they reveled in a city that
for a week seemed doused with religious feeling.

   ``There are as many churches here as there are gas stations in

<P>
   The huge masses left their mark. This week so many young
pilgrims wanted to pass through the Holy Door of St. Peter's, a
Holy Year ritual, that the Vatican opened a second one for the
first time in church history. After 500,000 people walked with
candles to recreate the Stations of the Cross along the Via dei
Fori Imperiali, next to the ancient Forum, the entire street was
closed off for four hours the next day so sanitation workers could
scrape up the melted wax on the pavement.

   To reach Sunday's Mass at Tor Vergata, a suburban campus of the
University of Rome, many pilgrims had to walk more than 6 miles
from the end of a subway line under a broiling sun, carrying boxed
meals and six-packs of bottled water. At least 2,000 people were
treated in first-aid tents Saturday and Sunday, and ambulances,
which ominously circled the area like buzzards, took more than 40
people to the hospital.

<P>

<P>
   Even the pope's opening greeting at St. Peter's on Tuesday,
which drew 300,000 into St. Peter's Square, was a trial for some.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on point, it was insane,'' said Jesse Randall, 16, of
Seattle, explaining how he had led his Catholic youth group into
the teeming square. ``It was fun,'' he said. ``I was born for it.
It was like a mosh pit, except nobody was wielding chains.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Roman merchants who stayed in town and witnessed the
youthful invasion were less than enthusiastic about pilgrim
spending habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in 10 at a time, and only one bought anything,''
Fabrizio Sagnotti, who runs an eye-wear store on Via del Corso,
groused to the Italian news agency Ansa. ``They created a big
confusion, and that is all.''

<P>
   RAI, Italy's largest network, covered the major events of the
festival live, and the Saturday night vigil won a 28 percent share
of the television audience. Some intellectuals expressed diffidence
about the lavish, doting attention the Italian media paid to the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are a million and a half or even 2 million young people
touring Rome in the Jubilee worth more than the more than 2 million
crowding Adriatic beaches without crosses and litanies?'' Eugenio
Scalfari, the retired editor in chief of La Repubblica, asked in a
front-page editorial of his paper on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims, however, expressed no regrets. ``Getting here was an
incredible hike, and at times I have asked myself why did I make
this trip,'' Linda Muraski, 46, of Knoxville, Tenn., said as she
and her 16-year-old daughter Allison kneeled by the cot of their
group leader, Patrick Donovan of Wilmington, Del., who had fainted
from heat stroke and lay inert and hooked up to an IV in a Red
Cross tent on Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then you get into the middle of the most beautiful Mass,''
she added, ``and there is the pope, with you, and it is so moving
you forget all you went through to get there.''

McCAIN SOUGHT TREATMENT QUICKLY AFTER LATEST CANCER DIAGNOSIS  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When Sen. John McCain had a routine checkup for skin
cancer on July 27, a few days before the Republican convention, Dr.
John F. Eisold, the attending physician of the U.S. Capitol,
spotted a mole on his patient's left temple and told him, ``You
ought to have that checked.''
</P>
<P>
   The checkup was one of many McCain has undergone since he had a
malignant melanoma removed from his left shoulder in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   After the checkup, McCain moved swiftly. On Aug. 1, after
speaking at the convention in Philadelphia, the senator took the
train to Washington. Two days later, he went to Bethesda Naval
Medical Center in Maryland where doctors detected an additional
suspicious mole on his left upper arm and performed a biopsy on
each mole.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, McCain returned to the convention and wore a
bandage over part of his left temple when he appeared on stage with
Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, on Aug. 10, McCain learned in a call from Bethesda
that the moles were new, malignant melanomas. McCain, who later
said he was surprised by the diagnosis, then arranged to have a
second opinion and additional tests performed through Dr. John
Eckstein, his personal physician at the Mayo Clinic here.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, McCain had a five-and-a-half-hour operation to
remove the two melanomas and lymph nodes in his head and neck.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain recovers at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Scottsdale, he
is awaiting a determination by pathologists on whether the temple
melanoma had spread. Preliminary tests before and during surgery
indicated the cancer was confined to the skin, his doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   The quickness with which McCain and his doctors reacted in the
last three weeks contrasts sharply with a similar situation in
1993. At that time it took more than six months before McCain
sought care after a Navy doctor recommended that he consult a
dermatologist for what turned out to be his first melanoma, the one
removed from his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's experience with the more than six-month delay in 1993
led him to move more quickly this time. And the episode in 1993
underlies the senator's repeated urging that other people get
checked for skin cancer. McCain stood in front of his home on
Friday after undergoing tests at the hospital to stress the
benefits of detecting melanomas and other cancers at an early stage
when they are most curable.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in 1993 is documented in the hundreds of pages of
medical records that McCain released during the recent presidential
primary campaign and was verified in interviews with his doctors.
</P>
<P>
   On May 7, 1993, military doctors in Pensacola, Fla., spotted a
dark, irregularly shaped area of skin on McCain's left shoulder
during a checkup. But the records show they did not suspect a
melanoma. A letter from a Navy doctor dated June 8, 1993,
recommended that McCain consult a dermatologist for what the
Pensacola doctors believed was a noncancerous condition known as
actinic keratosis that results from chronic sun exposure.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Nov. 24, 1993, that McCain sought care for the
skin condition. He went to Dr. Thomas M. Hudak, a plastic surgeon
in Phoenix, who had treated McCain's wife, Cindy. Hudak said in an
earlier interview that suspected it was a cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of seeing many lesions like this, it just sort of
caught my eye,'' Hudak said.
</P>
<P>
   The melanoma escaped the eye of John Eckstein, McCain's personal
physician at the Mayo Clinic who said in a separate, earlier
interview that he ``didn't recognize it if it was there'' when he
examined McCain in 1992. ``Undoubtedly, it was there,'' Eckstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the delay in 1993 are not clear now, said Nancy
Ives, McCain's press secretary. But Ives said that McCain might
have put off seeking medical care in part because of a heavy
speaking schedule on behalf of other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Because individuals with one melanoma can develop additional
ones, they are advised to have periodic checkups. Hudak said he had
removed several noncancerous moles from McCain's skin, including
one from his left temple on Oct. 4, 1998. It was a type known as a
pigmented junctional nevus. McCain recalled on Friday that the new
melanoma appeared near where the benign mole was.
</P>
<P>
   Melanomas can occasionally go undetected in a biopsy for many
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One is misdiagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   A second reason is disagreement among pathologists in
interpreting what they see through a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you send slides of a suspected melanoma to a dozen
dermatologists, some will call it normal and some will read it as a
melanoma,'' said Dr. Bernard S. Goffe, a dermatologist in Seattle.
``That's a well-known fact.''
</P>
<P>
   A third reason is that pathologists do not examine every
millimeter of the tissue removed in a biopsy. They take
representative sections from different areas. Thus, a melanoma that
is confined to a small area of a mole may escape examination due to
sampling errors.
</P>
<P>
   When a new melanoma is detected in an area where a mole was
removed and diagnosed as benign, doctors usually review the
microscopic slides to determine if the melanoma was present but
missed in the initial testing.
</P>
<P>
   Eckstein said on Saturday that no evidence of a melanoma was
detected in such a review of the mole that was removed from McCain
in 1998.

   CLINTON, Iowa _ If you think you know Al Gore, you should have
seen him just around midnight this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After an impassioned speech late Saturday night, the denim-clad
Gore suddenly grabbed his wife Tipper and boogied on stage as a
local rock band cranked up a hot blues number and confetti rained
down upon the dancing couple.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, which had gathered hours earlier, roared its delight.
Some in the crowd marveled: Who is this guy?
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in accepting the Democratic Party's presidential
nomination last week, assured voters that he is his ``own man'' and
that in the coming weeks they would see ``who I truly am.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fun-loving Al Gore that has rocked the Mark Twain
campaign riverboat down the Mississippi River the last three days
is somewhat of a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fun Al'' first appeared Friday morning as he and running mate
Joe Lieberman boarded the Mark Twain for a four-day, 400-mile trip
down the Mississippi River through five Midwestern swing states.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters asked him whether he was trying to send any kind of
signal to the voters with the lingering kiss he gave Tipper just
before his acceptance speech the night before in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to send Tipper a signal,'' he replied,
mischievously.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early Saturday afternoon, Gore burst unannounced into the
press section of the campaign riverboat to catch a group of
television producers and camera operators in a game of poker.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed mock horror and, tongue-in-cheek, demanded
``campaign journalism reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, during an evening birthday party for his wife on the open
top deck of the boat, Gore occasionally used a bullhorn to make
small talk with campers and other people in sparsely populated
areas along the banks of the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice shirt,'' he called to one person in the river darkness, a
scene reminiscent of Bill Clinton's microphone chit-chat _ ``I like
your dog!'' _ with people who lived along the tracks his
slow-moving campaign train took through the Midwest in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need your help,'' Gore shouted to another group in the
darkness of the river. Then, with the bullhorn off, he added,
almost in a whisper: ``The boat is sinking.''
</P>
<P>
   And even later Saturday, when his campaign boat pulled into the
dam and lock just north of this Iowa city, hundreds of well-wishers
looked a bit surprised when they heard the Rolling Stones's
sexually suggestive song ``Brown Sugar'' and its famous ``just
around midnight'' refrain blaring from the boat's sound system.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing prepared Gore's campaign entourage for the sight of
Al and Tipper boogie-ing on the stage in Clinton. No one, not even
longtime aides to the vice president, could recall him ever dancing
at a campaign event _ at the Clinton-Gore inaugurations, sure, but
not at a campaign rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is finding his own voice,'' campaign spokesman Chris
Lehane deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with his presidential campaign stumbling, Gore got
unsolicited advice from Clinton: ``Have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And ever since embarking on his Mississippi trip, Gore appears
to be having the time of his political life.
</P>
<P>
   A big contributor has been the unprecedented bounce he has
received in the polls since the convention, such as the CNN-USA
Today Gallup poll released Sunday. That poll had Gore at 47
percent, Republican nominee George W. Bush at 46 percent, Green
Party candidate Ralph Nader at 3 percent and Reform Party candidate
Pat Buchanan at 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 697 likely voters taken Friday and Saturday had an
error margin of (+/-) 4 percentage points. That same poll right
before the convention showed Bush 16 points ahead of Gore, 55
percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush communications director Karen Hughes, appearing on ``Fox
News Sunday,'' cautioned against putting ``too much stock in the
instant polls taken in the immediate aftermath of a convention.''
She noted that Walter Mondale surged ahead of Ronald Reagan in 1984
in some polls but eventually lost the race.
</P>
<P>
   History aside, Gore's newfound giddiness in the trail is
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   During his speeches, Gore works in the messages from homemade
signs he sees in the crowd into his remarks. Sometimes, he engages
members of the crowd in a brief conversation before going on to the
issue of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the speeches, he remains as long as his
schedule will allow to shake hands, reaching deep into the crowds
that have swelled with each day of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   He slaps hands with children and toddlers and tweaks the noses
of babies.
</P>
<P>
   He poses for pictures and signs autographs.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike previous campaigns, he hugs and hugs and hugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be fired up,'' said Julia Heinzelman, a
middle-aged high school teacher in Dubuque, Iowa, one of the
riverboat stops. ``So much politics happens on TV, and TV is
supposed to be a cool medium. But I'm tired of the coolness. It's
time to get hot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting warmed up,'' Gore remarked to one crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's closest friends have long insisted that the vice
president is fun-loving and funny, but the American public has
rarely gotten a glimpse of ``Fun Al.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though Gore insists that the presidential contest with
Texas Gov. George W. Bush is not a personality contest, you can
expect to see more of ``Fun Al'' after his life on the Mississippi
is over.

BRITISH SODA BOTTLER OFFERED FOR SALE BY BASS GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britvic, one of Britain's largest soft-drink
manufacturers, is for sale as part of Bass PLC's strategy to focus
on its hotel business, executives close to Britvic said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Britvic, which owns Tango and other popular British soft drinks,
is 90 percent controlled by a joint venture of Bass, Allied Dome
and Whitbread, in which Bass has a 50.1 percent majority stake.
PepsiCo owns the other 10 percent as part of deal that allows
Britvic to manufacturer and distribute Pepsi in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder Salomon Smith Barney has been hired to sell Britvic,
which analysts say will probably raise about 350 million pounds, or
$522 million, as part of Bass' strategy to sell its noncore assets
and focus on its hotel business, the executives said. Bass is one
of the largest hotel operators in the world, with nearly 3,000
hotels under the Holiday Inn, Inter-Continental and Crowne Plaza
names.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Sir Ian Prosser, Bass' chairman and chief executive,
sold the company's brewery operations to Interbrew, a Belgian
company, for 2.3 billion &UR;  &LR; pounds, although that deal has come under
scrutiny by British antitrust authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A Bass spokesman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Possible bidders include PepsiCo, although the company's
strategy of spinning off bottling assets runs counter to a purchase
of Britvic.
</P>
<P>
   Britvic has attractive operating cash flow, which surged 36
percent in 1999, to 41 million pounds. For the first six months of
this year, the company had an operating profit of 9 million pounds
on sales of 270 million pounds. That compares with operating profit
of 8 million pounds on sales of 254 million pounds in the period a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The auction would not be the first attempt at a change of
ownership for Britvic. Last autumn, Allied Dome tried to sell its
Britvic stake to Punch Taverns, which was also buying Allied's pub
business. Whitbread, which lost out to Punch in the bidding for
Allied's pubs, used its pre-emptive rights to eliminate the Britvic
stake from the deal. &QL;

 &HT;    Insurance that's gone to the dogs
 &HT;    By Jeff Ostrowski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Basel's unusual eating habits have gotten her
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, Basel, an 80-pound Bernese mountain dog, has swallowed
socks, which veterinarians surgically removed. Once, she gulped
down a corn cob, which meant another trip to the surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Basel's antics have taken her owners, Erin and Sean McGould, on
an emotional roller coaster ride. It would have been an expensive
ride, too, except that the couple had taken out a medical insurance
policy on the dog that has softened the financial blow.
</P>
<P>
   Medical treatment for pets has grown sophisticated _ and more
expensive _ so perhaps it's logical that Fluffy and Fido now have
their own insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Medical insurance for pets is gaining popularity, and
veterinarians and financial planners say that's good news for pet
owners who consider their dogs and cats full-fledged family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Pet insurance has been around since the 1980s, but only about 1
percent of American pet owners buy policies. Insurers see an
untapped market; in Sweden, for instance, nearly half of pet owners
have policies.
</P>
<P>
   Family Security Insurance Services, an independent agency, this
month began selling pet insurance issued by Aegon, a large Dutch
insurer. St. Petersburg-based Home Shopping Network this year began
offeri00 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for pet insurance has increased as veterinary medicine
has advanced, said Robin Itzer, spokeswoman for Veterinary Pet
Insurance of Anaheim, Calif. Now dogs and cats get kidney
transplants, pacemakers, chemotherapy and MRIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten or 15 years ago, people would have just said, `Fluffy had
a good life,' '' Itzer said. ``In the last 10 years, veterinary
medicine has drastically changed. Everything is state of the art.''
</P>
<P>
   Policies sold by Family Security Insurance cost $234 a year for
puppies and kittens, said Vice President Bob De Benedetto. For dogs
and cats 5 to 8 years old, the annual premium is $286.
</P>
<P>
   Only canines and felines are eligible; no birds or iguanas need
apply.
</P>
<P>
   Pet owners pay vets for services, then ask the insurance company
for reimbursement. The Aegon policies cover 80 percent of drugs,
shots or surgery. There's a $50 deductible and maximum
reimbursement of $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County vets say only a tiny percentage of pet owners
have insurance.
</P>
<P>
   There have been setbacks for pet insurers. Some have gone out of
business, and some pet owners have become discouraged by the
requirement that they pay and then wait for reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the cases I've seen, I thought it was kind of a waste of
money,'' said Dr. Jack Liggett, a vet at Clearlake Animal Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But other vets are more encouraging. Pet owners should consider
insurance if they don't have enough cash to cover a major illness,
said Dr. Robert Bonitzer of Town and Country Animal Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   John Potter, a certified public accountant and president of the
Gold Coast chapter of the Financial Planning Association, agreed.
Pet owners, especially those who have strong bonds to their pets,
can be blind-sided by big bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will go out and mortgage their house,'' Potter
said. ``If you're that type of person, pet insurance is good to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The McGoulds pay $297 a year for a pet insurance policy from
Veterinary Pet Insurance. They bought the coverage when Basel, now
3, was a puppy.
</P>
<P>
   The policy has paid off, Erin McGould said. Aside from the socks
and corn cob incidents, Basel also broke a bone in her paw while
running in the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the McGoulds said, insurance has covered more than
$3,000 in medical treatment for Basel.
</P>
<P>
   The McGoulds paid $1,200 for their purebred dog when she was a
puppy, and they would have paid for Basel's surgeries without
insurance, Erin McGould said. But, she added, the policy turned out
to be a wise financial move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has been one of the best investments we've made.''

 &HT;    Internet company brings family business to ruin
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sherrill Shaw returned to his hometown of
Randleman, N.C., in 1956 after serving in the Air Force and took
over his father's business, Shaw Furniture Galleries. He ran it for
more than four decades, built a national reputation, then sold it
last year to an upstart from Austin so he could retire.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Shaw Furniture Galleries shut its doors, as did the
fledgling company that bought it, Austin's living.com Inc. As early
as this week, both will file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   A North Carolina newspaper wrote that it took living.com just 13
months to destroy what the Shaw family had spent nearly 60 years
building up.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``new economy'' town like Austin, dot-com disasters have
become as common as the dog days of August. Last week alone,
Mall.com and CarOrder.com also laid off big chunks of their staffs
and acknowledged that they were running out of money.
</P>
<P>
   But in Randleman, population 3,100, Shaw Furniture Galleries was
the most prominent business in town _ and a profitable one at that
_and in its place, there is only bitterness about how the new
economy has failed one of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost feel like something's been taken away from us,''
said David Caughron, executive director of the Randleman Chamber of
Commerce. ``I even hate it for the Shaw family, since their name is
still attached to the company. They had a very sound reputation and
business for 60 years.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Shaw's 63 employees were laid off and perhaps hundreds of
orders that had not been delivered to customers have been stranded.
Living.com's bankruptcy attorneys estimate that there are between
2,500 and 3,500 claims on the company's assets, about two-thirds of
which are from customers of it and Shaw Furniture Galleries. They
don't yet know if any will get their money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's traumatic and it's frustrating,'' said Sherrill Shaw, who
is contemplating suing living.com over money he says he is still
owed from the sale. ``All of the problems that are being addressed
today are the result of the management of the company. They have
not sought our advice one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   People who know Randleman know it for two things: being the home
of stock car legend Richard Petty and the home of Shaw Furniture
Galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The store occupied one of the town's most historic buildings,
the Randleman School, built in 1904. Billboards drew shoppers from
Interstates 40 and 85, which run near town, and a catalog spread
the company's name and generous discounts around the country. It
didn't hurt that Randleman, in the Piedmont region of central North
Carolina, sits just 15 minutes from the self-described furniture
capital of the world, High Point.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill Shaw, who lives on a street named for his family,
estimates that the company had 300,000 to 400,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   That success attracted living.com, which as it was preparing to
launch its online furniture store last year was looking for an
experienced partner that could lend it credibility in the
close-knit furniture industry and help it ship orders around the
country. The sale took many people in Randleman by surprise. And it
did not take long before it started to rub some of them the wrong
way.
</P>
<P>
   Some Shaw workers were transferred to living.com's operations in
nearby Greensboro, one former employee said. Others complained that
they had to run every decision through living.com, jeopardizing
relationships with manufacturers. And many in town believed that
unprofitable living.com was draining money from a profitable
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought living.com was more important than Shaw
Furniture,'' said Heather Siler, who worked at Shaw for five years
before losing her job Tuesday. ``I think if living.com had never
purchased us, everything would have been fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, claims about botched orders and shipping delays started
arriving at the Chamber of Commerce and the local Better Business
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably within this past year I've had more phone calls from
customers (of Shaw) and I think that had a lot to do with
living.com,'' said Caughron. ``They were questioning the way some
of their shipments had been handled.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Shaw announced that it would go back to managing its
own operations. And although they had heard rumors of living.com's
coming demise, employees believed it when Shaw's management said
that the store would be bought and stay open.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday afternoon, they were told that the store was
closing. Caughron fielded 52 calls about living.com that day and
the city manager talked of trying to estimate the sales tax revenue
that Randleman would lose without Shaw, not to mention the business
its customers gave restaurants, gas stations and shops in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (people) are disheartened and disgusted because not
only was Shaw Furniture a major furniture company, it was a part of
the community,'' said Jeff Freeman, owner of Freeman Florist and
Gift on Main Street, down the block from the Shaw store. ``You take
(that) many billboards off the interstate promoting your town _
wouldn't you think that would hurt?''
</P>
<P>
   And people in Randleman haven't forgotten the swagger with which
living.com carried itself in its early days, a bluster typical
among Internet startups. Executives were quoted saying that the
furniture industry was broken and that the Internet would fix it,
making living.com a multi-billion company in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming statements that living.com kept coming out
with about what a terrific company they were . . . I'm sorry, when
it comes down to it, that doesn't amount to a hill of beans,''
Caughron said. ``I think they had a great promotional and marketing
strategy to be able to promote themselves so well. They actually
had people believing that this was the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, many people in this part of North Carolina
don't think there's anything wrong with the way furniture is sold
now and don't think the Internet is the way to go. One of the most
important characteristics of a piece of furniture is ``hand,''
industry jargon for the way it feels, and no technology can yet
convey that on a computer screen. Many people in Randleman say that
the demise of living.com proves that. They just wish that Shaw
Furniture Galleries hadn't gone down with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that in the beginning,'' said Sherrill Shaw. ``But
they didn't believe me. They thought they could get it done.''

number and confetti rained down upon the dancing couple. The crowd,
which had been waiting for hours for the arrival of the Gores,

   POPULARITY _ ATLANTA _ The fashionable baggy red shorts that
scrape his shins. The skinny arms folded in defiance. The sullen
scowl that breaks only briefly when someone begs him just once to
smile for the camera. Jemario King's gangsta cool body language
says it all: ``I don't care if you like me.'' The 16-year-old
Decatur, Ga. resident, who returned to classes last week, isn't
interested in becoming Mr. Popular. ``To me, being popular doesn't
really matter,'' he says. ``It's a state of mind . . . I'm just
going to do what I gotta do anyway.'' As another wave of youngsters
head back to class today, it might be tempting to suggest, as
Jemario does, that popularity doesn't matter. After all, the rugged
individualist is an American icon. But as much as most of us wish
that popularity doesn't count, we know otherwise. It does matter,
even _ and perhaps especially _ as an adult. (Blake, Atlanta

`JULIUS CAESAR': NEW YORK FESTIVAL'S POLITICAL PLAY BOLD, IF NOT
OVERBEARING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a busy percussionist pounding out portents,
thunderclaps and sounds of war; a massive set of defaced, slightly
skewed cement walls and an enormous disembodied hand to suggest a
city shaken by cataclysm; a cast that plays the entire evening in a
state of high dudgeon; and the whole production watched over by a
mammoth, gold-painted bust of David McCallum (who plays the title
role) dangling from a crane, the New York Shakespeare Festival's
``Julius Caesar'' has the garish bravado of a political convention.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's a coyly chosen comparison, but the play is, after
all, a timely choice for the festival this summer. And though the
fire-and-brimstone production that opened Aug. 13 at the Delacorte
Theater in Central Park is apt enough for Shakespeare's virulent
treatise on the combustible chemistry of power and eloquence, this
``Caesar'' leaves you feeling shouted at and implored, but not
terribly shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Barry Edelstein, it employs the briskly
orchestrated, applause-moment-to-applause-moment strategy that
makes political theater moving only to those already on the
bandwagon. The murder of Caesar is handled with apt horror; it
takes a long time for him to bleed and fall, and when he does he
collapses on top of Brutus. But when Cinna the Poet is killed by
the Marc Antony-roused mob merely for having the same name as a
conspirator against Caesar, Edelstein strings him up by his ankles
and hangs him from the very spot that Caesar's golden bust had
occupied.
</P>
<P>
   This is the moment that brings the lights down for intermission,
and it is meant to provide a thrumming emotional zing. But it's
heavy-handed and too much: the audience is already gasping from the
bloodletting. And when the unnecessary, ominous-sounding musical
cue is laid on, it has a similar effect to the convention-hall band
striking up ``Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein strives for a timeless, borderless embrace, sometimes
evocatively. His first-century-before-Christ Rome gives Brutus
(Jamey Sheridan), still waffling over his decision to kill Caesar,
the use of a telescope, a clever echo of Cassius' cagy nudge: ``The
fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars/But in ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The soothsayer (Ching Valdes-Aran), who begins the show
portentously with a witchy dance and a shriek _ ``Caaaeeeeesaaar!''
_ is dressed and made up in vaguely Oriental fashion. The plebeians
wear long blue robes and knitted skullcaps suggestive of Muslim
garb (the costumes are by Angela Wendt) and at one point perform a
celebratory dance, tapping out fierce African rhythms with sticks.
The aspirants to power are clothed more formally, with military or
affluent suggestion, but without the ethnic influence. The point is
clear, if not exactly revelatory: the hold by a concentrated
privileged few over a marginalized, variegated many is universal.
</P>
<P>
   The most disappointing aspect of this ``Caesar'' is its
underscoring of the obvious at the expense of the subtle. This is,
perhaps, Shakespeare's most morally ambiguous play; it ends with
one of his most ironic lines, the callow Octavius, Caesar's heir,
declaring the end of the civil war that leaves Rome in tatters a
``happy day.'' It's all the result of Caesar's declining prowess as
a leader and Brutus' foolish susceptibility to the influence of
Cassius (Dennis Boutsikaris), who is a coward, and the opportunism
of power-hungry Mark Antony (Jeffrey Wright), dreadful foibles that
seriously compromise their otherwise heroic stature. The men
understand this, and their inner battles are what give the play its
human _ as opposed to political _ profundity.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, the performances here follow the
tone of the production as a whole, emphasizing each man's overt
qualities, rather than his struggles to cope with self-doubt. As a
result, the psychological battles are overly transparent.
McCallum's Caesar seems overcome by his physical infirmity, with
almost no remnant of his potency; as Cassius, Boutsikaris initially
has the well-greased verbal facility of the confident class sneak,
and he does have a lean and hungry look, but he's always jittery _
he does a lot of finger-pointing _ and when the time comes, he is
an awfully cowardly coward, the struggle for dignity washed away in
sheer panic.
</P>
<P>
   As Brutus, Sheridan has the tense, macho mien of a Tom
Landry-like football coach, someone who relishes the burden of
setting a martyr's example for underlings. He seems to relish being
put upon, even at home. (Portia, his wife, is played by Colette
Kilroy as embittered by her husband's preoccupied frame of mind,
and she uses the wounding of her thigh as a shrewish manipulation
of his attention.) But Sheridan is a stiff performer, passing from
reaction to reaction with a visible yank. His funeral speech feels
practiced _ think Al Gore _ inadvertently masking the complications
in Brutus' heart, making Antony's countervailing oration a finger
snap.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Wright delivers it that way. He milks it, looming above
the mob like a demagogue and then stalking among the crowd,
flourishing Caesar's will and unmercifully teasing the assemblage
with its contents, voice rising to a crazed bellow.
</P>
<P>
   In films and onstage, Wright has been proving himself a
performer of the can't-take-your-eyes-off-him ilk, and he is far
and away the most commanding presence here. He has the grace and
carriage of a casual athlete; he's the kind of actor who doesn't
need to stay busy onstage. Even standing still, with hips and
shoulders cocked in natural arrogance, he has a star's bearing, and
he lends Antony a full measure of his charisma.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly apparent in his quieter moments. Scolding
Octavius, dismissing Lepidus as no more serviceable a soldier than
his horse, acknowledging an order from Caesar, greeting the
conspirators with the grave affection that masks a poisonous
vitriol, he conveys a casual potency.
</P>
<P>
   And that may be why his performance, in the end, feels
overplayed. In Wright's hands, Antony's joy in power becomes so
overwhelming that his conscience is never in evidence. It is Marc
Antony, after all, who delivers the impromptu eulogy for Brutus,
``the noblest Roman of them all,'' and he has to mean it. It feels
cold and expeditious here, a performance in itself, the kind of
falsely modest apportioning of credit that is worthy only of a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The play runs through Sept. 13.

<P>
   COOS BAY, Ore. _ Zeldon Linn has worked on the railroads and in
a sawmill. He has been a sergeant in the Army and a mechanic in a
garage. At times for the last 15 years he has found work as a
fisherman, crabbing and catching salmon in the Pacific Ocean off
this struggling blue-collar town along the Oregon coast. At other
times, he has found no work at all.
</P>
<P>
   All of which, he conceded with a laugh the other day, seems like
odd preparation for his new job, where he sits in a cubicle each
day, fires up a computer, dons a headset and swings into action on
the first ring of the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning,'' Linn says. ``Thank you for calling MSN
Technical Support. My name is Zeldon. May I have your e-mail
address, please?''
</P>
<P>
   For Linn and 345 other people here in remote Coos County, where
the historical economic pillars of logging and fishing have been
severely battered and where the unemployment rate was in the double
digits as recently as last year, an improbable savior has emerged,
mushrooming in a matter of months into the second-largest private
employer in the county.
</P>
<P>
   As high-tech companies face an acute shortage of workers in many
urban areas, they have begun to branch out to areas of the country
that had been passed over by the boom, bringing jobs and training
and making inroads on the ``digital divide'' between America's
urban and rural regions.
</P>
<P>
   Here in southern Oregon, the company is CyberRep.com, a Virginia
concern that has contracts to provide phone and Internet services
for well-known corporate clients. CyberRep workers like Linn answer
the toll-free help lines for the Microsoft Corp.'s MSN online
service and for Barnes &AMP; Noble.com, the online division of the
bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   For places like Coos Bay, once the largest wood-products
shipping port in the world, there are some painful twists. These
are the back-office jobs of the ``new economy,'' paying $8 to $9 an
hour and offering no stock-option bonuses. There is a graveyard
shift, because the help lines need to be staffed 24 hours a day, 7
days a week. Even with CyberRep set to surpass the Mill Casino,
owned by the Coquille Indian tribe, as the area's largest source of
private jobs, it will still represent just a fraction of the 3,200
jobs in the wood-products industry that local officials say have
been lost in the last 20 years. In many cases those jobs paid, in
constant-dollar terms, twice as well as the new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these are jobs, offering health benefits and computer
skills that many workers say they believe are the perfect entry to
more lucrative employment. And most of the workers, like Linn, seem
grateful for the work, though they often express ambivalence about
the nature of the work and the sweeping economic forces that have
taken them out of the woods or off the seas and placed them in
small workstations in a boxy warehouse building up the street from
the local airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the ocean,'' said Linn, 43, a burly, bearded man who
still wears work boots to his job. ``There's a feeling of freedom
you get there like no place else. Now here I am, confined to this
little cubicle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' he said, his face brightening, ``this is
the first job I've ever had where I go to work clean and I come
home clean. I've never had a job where I didn't come home smelling
like fish or oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Linn and other workers at CyberRep described the kick they get
from helping frustrated or even irate callers from around the
nation facing trouble with their dial-up adapters, modem
connections, configuration schemes and all manner of other software
and Internet problems. Some callers simply need old-fashioned help,
like directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm driving through Kansas right now,'' said a woman named
Peggy, speaking on her cell phone, after she called Barnes &AMP;
Noble's 1-800-THE-BOOK help line and reached Stella Smith, 62, the
wife of a retired logger, at her workstation here. ``I'm driving
across the country. Do you have a bookstore anywhere near Topeka,
Kan.? I'd really like to go to a bookstore.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith instantly used her computer mouse to navigate the ``find a
store'' function of the Barnes &AMP; Noble site to locate the store in
Topeka and give Peggy the directions.
</P>
<P>
   These jobs are not for everybody. Some who have worked around
trees or at the port all their lives said they could not imagine
being cooped up all day, staring at a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put me indoors and I'm lost,'' said George Sjostrom, 59, a
wiry man with a chain saw and a hard hat, who shook his head when
asked if he might want to trade his job as a log-yard worker for
that of a computer-support specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out of my world,'' continued Sjostrom, who tags and sorts
giant logs all day with the help of enormous claw-equipped machines
that move the logs around the yard as if they were toothpicks,
readying them for placement aboard ships at the nearby port or in
machines that turn them into wood chips bound for pulp mills. ``I
wouldn't have any idea what to do with a computer. If I could
figure out the `on' button, that'd be a big accomplishment for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At CyberRep, though, many of the workers said they enjoyed
computers and several, including Linn and Mike Armijo, 38, who lost
two jobs in recent years when local mills closed, said they had
initially taught themselves how to use the machines.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs have their stressful aspects, perhaps chief among them
the constant pressure to satisfy customers while sticking to an
average time of roughly nine minutes a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk a fine line,'' Armijo said. ``You've got to be as
caring as you can, but you've also got to get them off the phone as
quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers here trade horror stories about their longest service
calls _ 82 minutes here, 74 minutes there _ often involving
customers who have completely fouled up their software settings in
a bid to solve what began as a much simpler problem. Men are
generally more difficult than women, workers of both sexes agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are much more likely to think they know something about
computers when they don't,'' Linn observed. ``But women, I've
found, are more willing to say something like, `I really don't
know, I need help.' They'll really listen to you more. So they take
less time.''
</P>
<P>
   Several elements came together to culminate in the deal that
brought CyberRep to the call-center building, which is part of the
airport office park in North Bend, the neighboring town to Coos
Bay. The idea started last year in the mind of John Stadter, then
the chief financial officer of 800 Support, a company based in the
Portland suburbs that was recently acquired by CyberRep. Stadter
grew up on the Oregon coast and had a vacation home near here, in
Bandon. So, he explained, he knew something about the area and
convinced his initially skeptical colleagues that there was a
large, willing and able work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the smartest people in my high school class went to
work in the woods, because that's where the big money was,'' said
Stadter, now the general manager of Coos Bay operations for
CyberRep. ``And they're still around here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon International Port of Coos Bay, which helps broker
economic development deals, put together a package of tax
incentives and agreed to lease the building. The local Southwestern
Oregon Community College provided computer training classes.
</P>
<P>
   Coos Bay's wood-shipping industry, as well as its fishing, has
declined in the face of foreign competition and heightened
environmental regulations. While 300 million board feet of lumber
were shipped out of Coos Bay annually a decade ago, the number last
year was 13.5 million, said Ingvar Doessing, the manager of a local
stevedoring company and a member of the port commission.
</P>
<P>
   The region, 80 miles away from the nearest interstate highway,
is remote by many measures. Local officials have sought
unsuccessfully to attract a steel mill, a pulp mill and a
fish-processing plant. They say they are thrilled to have landed a
high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area has never really participated in the economic boom
of the 1990's,'' said Allan E. Rumbaugh, the port's general
manager. ``It certainly participated very strongly in the recession
of the early 1980's. So this deal has given us a real sense of
optimism that we're not the pariah we sometimes worry we are. We
can attract a company to come here from out of town. That feels
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Armijo, the CyberRep support technician, expressed more caution:
``It's been my sad observation that nothing lasts forever around
here as a source of jobs. I've never seen anything that permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for now,'' he said, using an analogy that looks back to
what was once an economic mainstay, ``I think it's a godsend that
this company has come in here. It's kind of like a guy going
fishing and reeling in a 1,300-pound tuna. It's unbelievable.''

SPORTS COLUMN: GYMNASTS BRAVED AUDITION RATHER THAN TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is never fun to be cut. In high school basketball,
the process can be as simple as scanning a list posted on the
gymnasium wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait. Maybe Coach misspelled my name.'' Right.
</P>
<P>
   In the arcane world of men's gymnastics, they do it in public.
With the cameras turned on. On Saturday night, officials marched
all the athletes back into the arena for one last round of
applause, and then the fun began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who is going to Sydney, take one step forward. Not
so fast, Abernathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night it would happen to the women, but at least the
leaders planned to do it in private, a few seconds before escorting
everybody back into the center ring.
</P>
<P>
   People were paying big bucks for something billed as the
``Olympic Team Trials,'' but the real trial was being held by Chief
Justice Karolyi and his colleagues in chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The operative word is ``team.'' There is now more emphasis on
specialists in gymnastics, which means the committee had more
mandate to pick and choose.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday night, the top six were Elise Ray, Kristen
Maloney, Amy Chow, Jamie Dantzscher, Morgan White and Vanessa
Atler, with the golden oldies Dominique Dawes and Shannon Miller
very much on the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   In all sports, bad news sometimes arrives at the last moment.
Some hapless relief pitcher gets cut on the last day of spring
training, and has to retrieve his stuff from the team truck.
Playpen. Suitcases. Golf clubs. Then he tries to reach his wife on
her car phone. Honey, when you get to Jacksonville, turn left.
</P>
<P>
   It happened this way for the men on Saturday evening. Paul Hamm
figured he was safely ensconced in second place but his fraternal
twin, Morgan, was in a quite precarious sixth, right ahead of good
old reconstructed John Roethlisberger, a very ancient 30 and
everybody's big brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so nervous,'' Morgan said. ``If I didn't make the team,
we'd be separated for really the first time in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   What was the rationale for making the athletes get the word in
public? It came from Peter Kormann, the team coach, who thought
that the fans in the upper reaches of the sprawling Fleet Center
deserved to find out at the same time as the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Kormann, it should be noted, is a true son of New England, where
they used to put people in the stocks and burn alleged witches.
When he means ``karma,'' it comes out ``comma.'' He is also a very
interesting guy with a flair for the dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're men,'' Kormann repeated Sunday. ``They're warriors.
They walk out here and raise their hand and get on the pommel
horse. They can handle this, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe yes, maybe no. In front of a packed arena, Paul Hamm heard
the announcement that Jamie Natalie had been consigned to
alternate. This could only mean that Morgan had made the top six.
Paul patted Morgan on the back. They were going to Sydney together.
Natalie is still playing good soldier about his very public
demotion.
</P>
<P>
   It's rough getting cut. In professional football, the team
functionary known as The Turk sidles up and demands the playbook,
but at least The Turk operates behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes don't get to this level without learning to deal with
direct competition. There is something very finite about the way
track and field does it. Dan O'Brien aced nine events in the
decathlon trials in 1992 but he could not get over the bar in the
pole vault and was thereby denied a trip to Barcelona, where he
very well could have won a gold medal. No note from his doctor
would alter the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   But in gymnastics there is a growing emphasis on teamwork. Under
the new rules, the men will send six competitors, but only five
will be entered in each of the six events, and only the top four
scores will count.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, there was already lineup strategy. Kormann claims he
was pressured by two public officials from one state to enter their
favorite son in every event so he could qualify for the all-around
gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got pretty ugly,'' Kormann said with a grin, relishing the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than ever, Kormann and Karolyi are both looking for
specialists. Gymnastics is getting to be like the real team sports
_ nickel backs on passing defense, setup relievers in baseball,
short-handed specialists in hockey, expendable lummoxes who hack
Shaquille O'Neal six times and foul out.
</P>
<P>
   The action here was in the back room. For all the money it paid
for the television rights, NBC undoubtedly wanted its cameras
rolling during the selection meeting. Bela waving right index
finger. Bela pacing room. Bela shouting, ``Is how we did it in old
country.''
</P>
<P>
   If they can capture the men hearing their fate, they can film
the women getting the news in the locker. The Turk goes live. Next
time.  &QL;

BEHIND BRUTAL GERMAN CRIME ARE HATE AND IGNORANCE

 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DESSAU, Germany _ The German word for hatred is ``Hass'' and
Angelika Adriano spits it out with hissing venom. Hatred, she says,
is what she feels for her husband's killers. ``Only hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of them were youngsters really, just 16 years old. They
attacked her husband, Alberto Adriano, because he was black. Threw
him down, kicked him in the head with force enough to dislodge his
left eyeball, dragged his body into the city park, trampled on him.
Finally, they removed his pants and hung them from a bush.
</P>
<P>
   From the window of her shabby high-rise, Angelika Adriano, 43,
has a view of that park. Two months have gone by, and the trial of
the three rightist skinheads accused of the murder begins Tuesday.
But her lips still tremble as she addresses Gabriel, the baby in
her arms: ``You have no father, no father any more.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes in Dessau, once the center of a great flowering of
German culture _ home to the Bauhaus, to Klee, to Kandinsky, to
Walter Gropius. But that was before two dictatorships intervened _
the Third Reich and East German communism _ and bequeathed to it
the muddled minds and fallen factories where irrational rancor
began to stir.
</P>
<P>
   It has continued stirring through the former East Germany, a
slow poison in the area where German pain is most manifest. A
decade has gone by since unification; billions of dollars have been
spent to usher the area from a troubled past. Yet anti-immigrant
incidents ranging from verbal abuse to killings have become part of
the fabric of life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, a critical mass has been reached. It is not that
anything fundamental has changed, but the fact that nothing has
changed is becoming unacceptable. Last month, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said he had had enough of ``beating orgies by rightist
mobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the slaying of an Angolan, Amadeu Antonio, in 1990, in
the eastern town of Eberswalde, and that of Adriano of Mozambique
on June 11 this year, the racist murder rate has been running at
two a year by the most cautious government estimates. Human rights
groups put the figure at more than 10 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bernd Ledermueller, the Dresden police chief, ventured this
explanation: ``We come from a communist society where everything
was laid out for you. Youth groups, work groups, no decisions to
make. And now you have young people coming into a void with often
embittered parents behind them, and their disorientation turns to
neo-Nazi violence.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one theory, and it is no doubt part of the story. For
some, SS insignia are simply chic. Behind the violence lies some
measure of fantasy about immigrants, since they are far more rare
in eastern Germany than in the west. The government recently spoke
for the first time of possible ``terrorist cells'' among rightist
groups.
</P>
<P>
   So now it seems that every day brings a new government measure:
an announcement that $35 million is to be spent on an educational
effort to combat racism, a push to ban the rightist National
Democratic Party, a plan to send the chancellor on a late-summer
tour of the east, a call for ``civil courage.''
</P>
<P>
   But a close look at what happened in Dessau suggests that all
this bustle may do little to address the fundamental problems.
These seem rooted in the western takeover of East Germany (``a
second Anschluss,'' said Guenter Grass, the writer), the
dismantling of its society and industry, and the odd effect on this
ravaged landscape of an immigrant asylum policy whose logic has
become impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Richter, one of those accused of battering Adriano to
death, turned 16 on April 21. In the year he was born, 1984, a vast
complex of five-story, prefabricated housing, adorned with
monuments to socialist heroism, was completed just north of Wolfen,
near Dessau.
</P>
<P>
   The apartments were built largely to house workers for the
nearby film factory that began life as Agfa in 1910 and for the
sprawling chemical industry at Bitterfeld, which left some of the
most intractable pollution in central Europe. Here lay the
heartland of East German industry, grubby as the brown coal dragged
from its soil.
</P>
<P>
   After German unification, the industries were largely
dismantled, with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. Some west
German companies arrived _ such as Bayer, the aspirin maker _ but
the unemployment rate in the Dessau-Bitterfeld region climbed to
its present 21.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Here, surrounded by disused factories, in a maze of apartment
blocks of advancing decrepitude, among adults often exasperated by
idleness, Richter grew up, attending school until last year. His
school performance was modest and his family struggled to get by as
his father labored in the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a normal, not very intelligent young man,
a follower of others,'' said Manfred Schlaefert, the lawyer who
will defend Richter and has talked with him several times in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows nothing about German politics, the democratic
principles of the republic, nothing. But nor, it seems, was he into
the neo-Nazi scene himself. If his friends had been of the left, he
might have gone in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But his friends included Frank Miethbauer, 16, another of the
alleged assailants, who lived in the apartment block opposite.
Miethbauer's father is dead and his mother is in a hospital with
mental illness. Searching for direction, Miethbauer was drawn to
the neo-Nazi movement.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Wolfgang Wibbing, 61, said he often saw the young
man with Nazi flags and memorabilia; the police found such evidence
when they raided his apartment after the Dessau killing.
</P>
<P>
   Schlaefert said he asked Richter why he had attacked Adriano.
The reply suggested the influence of Miethbauer. Foreigners take
our jobs away, the lawyer quoted Richter as saying. Foreigners take
advantage of us.
</P>
<P>
   To the lawyer, this was intriguing, for Richter has never looked
for a job. Having left school last year, he entered a college that
offered a sort of general apprenticeship for the workplace.
Whatever xenophobic convictions he had came from hearsay, the
background noise of a bitter place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Youths sit around and hear the grumbling of ruined fathers,''
Schlaefert said. ``How there was no crime before. How there were
jobs before. How foreigners take our money. It's dumb table talk,
but it can be potent in a teen-ager's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Wibbing, the neighbor of the Richter and Miethbauer families,
manifests some of the resentments prevalent in the Dessau area.
Born into the Third Reich, then turned into a citizen of a
communist state, he now lives off the pension of the Western
country that supposedly liberated him.
</P>
<P>
   But his monthly pension is under $400, less than he would
receive in the West; his 44-year-old wife, Ilona, has been jobless
since 1993; and he finds freedom an ironic concept in the absence
of money. His bitterness grew when he saw Turks successfully
opening take-home food outlets after his own failed.
</P>
<P>
   His ideas, he said, are widely shared. A government should think
first about its own people. There are no opportunities for German
youth, he said, so why should the arrival of foreigners be
accepted?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But foreigners continue to arrive. Near a small, pink stone
memorial erected to Adriano in the Dessau city park, African youths
gather. They say they congregate here because they are less
vulnerable in a group.
</P>
<P>
   All of them are ``asylum seekers'' _ not necessarily because
they came to Germany to seek asylum. Many simply came in search of
a job, but that is how Germany categorizes them in the absence of
any other legal avenue into the country for unskilled foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were allowed to work, do a small job, we'd stop lounging
around thinking about our problems,'' said Youssouf Coulibaly, 20,
from the Ivory Coast. ``It is as if Germany is inviting us to
steal.'' Producing a knife from his bag, he added, ``Around here,
this is essential protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these young Africans are housed in an asylum seekers'
home in nearby Mohlau. A crumbling former Soviet barracks, it has
no functioning telephones for the hundreds of immigrants _ it had
two, but they broke three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fields surrounding the foreigners' ``home'' are
still littered with mines from Cold War days. Africans who have
fled war find it bizarre to be encircled by mines in the midst of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the only thing that puzzles them. Under German law,
while their requests for asylum are reviewed _ a process that often
takes over a year _ they have no right to work.
</P>
<P>
   They are not allowed to move around the country but must remain
in the district of their asylum home. Those in Mohlau cannot go to
Berlin, a 90-minute train ride away. Most of the foreigners here
receive about $190 a month from the state, as well as their housing
and health care.
</P>
<P>
   So on one side stand embittered German youths drawn to
xenophobic movements because they are convinced foreigners are
taking their jobs. On the other side stand foreigners living on
handouts with no possibility of working. Between them, in a hall of
mirrors, hatred stirs.
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Camara, 27, from Sierra Leone, is one of the more than
1.5 million asylum seekers who have arrived in Germany since 1993.
His father, Modo, was killed by rebels last year and Camara fled _
first to Guinea; then, hidden in a cargo vessel, to Rotterdam, the
Netherlands, where he arrived in January; and from Rotterdam to
Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   After the German police picked him up, he applied for asylum and
was deposited in Mohlau. He said he would work at anything _
cleaning toilets, doing garden work, helping on a farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Germans just park us here like animals in a zoo and
give us money,'' he mused. ``It is more than crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many German officials agree that the country's immigration
policy is skewed. Barbara John, the Berlin city official charged
with policy toward foreigners, said ``a corridor'' was needed to
give work permits to asylum seekers. But wages would then decline
and, she contended, German society was not ready for a less
regimented labor market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in this mental prison,'' she suggested. ``We think, if
there are more of us, we all get less. People cannot see that
immigration may be a yeast that makes the cake bigger.'' Surveys
suggest that most Germans feel that, with 7 million foreigners
here, the country has enough of them already.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Dessau seems to abound in mental prisons. Suppose, it
was suggested to Schlaefert, the lawyer, that a young African like
Camara ran into a youth like Richter after nightfall. Could it
happen again?
</P>
<P>
   Could a 16-year-old white German who has never looked for
employment attack a black asylum seeker who has never had the
opportunity to work, because the German believes the African ``is
taking our jobs''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Schlaefert said. ``This is waiting to happen
again at any moment.''
</P>
<P>
   John Greene, an American psychologist in Dessau, said, ``There's
confusion, low self-esteem, and some people here get an urge to
declare they are not weak, not insecure, by kicking a black man in
the head.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 11, that man happened to be Alberto Adriano. He had been
in Germany for 12 years, having come under an exchange among
then-socialist states and worked as a meat packer. He had married a
German woman and had three children, the most recent, Gabriel, just
7 months old.
</P>
<P>
   But that night in Dessau he was just a symbol, a specter, for
Richter, Miethbauer and Enrico Hilprecht, 24. The three youths had
met by chance in the station, had a drink and gone for a walk while
they awaited their train. It was then that they stumbled on Adriano
returning from a party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they get the heaviest sentences, life imprisonment,''
said Angelika Adriano as she rocked her child. In fact, only
Hilprecht risks that. Both Richter and Miethbauer will be judged
under Germany's juvenile laws, which allow a maximum sentence of 10
years, even for murder.
</P>
<P>
   Schlaefert believes his client may get less, perhaps seven
years. ``Mr. Richter told me he was not aware that he was killing
Mr. Adriano,'' Schlaefert said. ``He went along with the others, as
I think he always has.''

PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE IS A LITTLE TOO EXCITING FOR ONE WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ A young woman who joined hundreds of excited
onlookers on Main Street on Saturday night to catch a glimpse of
President Clinton stripped off her T-shirt in glee after the
president signed it.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, wearing a bra was immediately surrounded by law
enforcement officials, who handcuffed her and questioned her until
Clinton left the scene. She was later released.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a big deal,'' said an officer with the Lake Placid
Police Department. ``She was questioned but that's it.'' The
authorities did not release the woman's name.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred at about 11:30 p.m. as Clinton, Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Chelsea Clinton stopped for ice cream on Main
Street of this small resort town in northern New York after a
birthday dinner for the president, who turned 54 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, Clinton had signed numerous T-shirts of both men
and women before he reached the young woman, who pulled out the
bottom of her T-shirt for him to sign and enthusiastically hoisted
the shirt over her head after he signed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He signed the bottom of her shirt and he turned away, and then
she did a Brandi Chastain and ripped off the shirt,'' said a White
House spokesman, Jake Siewert, referring to the U.S. soccer star
who took off her shirt and ran around in her sports bra after her
team won the World Cup last year.
</P>
<P>
   After the commotion Saturday, Clinton briefly turned back toward
the woman before heading for his motorcade. Mrs. Clinton and
Chelsea were nearby. Siewert called the incident ``less risque than
a Sunday Times Magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, as he emerged from dinner, the president revealed his
birthday wish: that both his wife and Vice President Al Gore win
their electoral bids.
</P>
<P>
   On his lapel was a ``Hillary for Senate'' pin.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were spending the weekend at the private home of a
local real estate developer, Arthur Lussi, whose grandfather was an
Olympic gold medalist. Lake Placid was the host of the 1932 and
1980 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, after Clinton finished a round of golf and Mrs. Clinton
made a campaign appearance in Buffalo, the family went to their
house in Chappaqua, where they established residency last year.

GIANTS HAVE A QUICK-STRIKE COMBINATION IN COLLINS AND TOOMER
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last step of a backpedal, his weight on his back _ or
right _ foot, as Kerry Collins releases the football it seems more
prayer than pass.
</P>
<P>
   How can something heaved with such disregard for proper
technique be calculated, or for that matter, aimed?
</P>
<P>
   But across several weeks now, it has become apparent that
Collins has a process to this kind of pass, even if it lacks
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable quality of the Giants' preseason so far has
been the almost cosmic union developing between Collins and wide
receiver Amani Toomer _ a kinship that defenses have found
difficult to stop because the two improvise so well.
</P>
<P>
   Collins will be on the run, leaning the wrong way and suddenly
hoist a pass in Toomer's direction. Toomer, sensing Collins'
intent, will spin in the right direction even before Collins has
lofted the ball, then run under the pass _ often behind the last
defender and into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   This combination of perfect throw and perfect catch was on
display again in Friday night's Giants loss to the Jets, when
Collins, pressured in the pocket, sailed a pass 50 yards down the
middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   As the ball tailed to the right, Toomer drifted in that
direction, smoothly settling under the pass in stride as it fell
into his arms. He ran untouched into the end zone, a 73-yard
touchdown. It was the second Collins-to-Toomer touchdown pass of
the preseason, a continuation of late last season when Collins
became the starter and threw four touchdown passes to Toomer.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not merely touchdowns, there are also long, quick
strikes, exactly the kind of backbreaking plays the Giants have
lacked for several seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It is the work of a receiver who never gives up on his pass
patterns, certain that Collins might yet find a way to get him the
ball. It is the work of a quarterback who does not fret about
gambling with a risky throw, confident someone tall and fleet like
Toomer will find a way to get to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Kerry you just keep running, because you never know what
will happen,'' Toomer said, a smile on his face as he described
their relationship last week. ``He's a gunslinger back there. If
you're open deep, he's got the arm to get it there. He makes you
look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said it was Toomer who was making him look good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great ability to change his body position and
adjust to the ball in the air,'' Collins said. ``It's a talent to
do that while running at top speed and avoiding the defensive back
running with you.''
</P>
<P>
   What Collins and Toomer are describing is the kind of affinity
created in months of practice, skills honed not only this summer
but last winter. In February and in March, Collins, Toomer and the
Giants' other prime receivers, Ike Hilliard and Joe Jurevicius,
would bundle up in the locker room then make the 150-yard walk
across a Giants Stadium parking lot to the indoor practice
facility. Inside, they would shed the extra clothing and get to
work on pass routes and the kinds of throws that work best for
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is confidence,'' Collins said. ``With Amani and I,
over time I can convince him, `Hey, just go, I'll get it there.'''
</P>
<P>
   In another way, usually on underneath passes, Collins turns to
Hilliard even more frequently. And the maturation of Jurevicius,
now in his third year, is also plainly evident. On Friday,
Jurevicius _ Collins' former teammate at Penn State and probably
his closest friend on the team _ made two receptions in traffic, a
30-yard pass from Collins and a leaping 15-yard touchdown grab on a
pass from the backup quarterback, Jason Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   As for Collins' occasionally unusual passing methodology _
throwing off his back foot _ he said it was not planned and not
recommended when trying to fire a crisp, sharp pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it seems to help me get some touch on the ball,'' said
Collins, apparently not quite aware that 40- or 50-yard passes are
not commonly thrown with touch.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a handy technique on the run, something Collins needed
Friday, which was the first preseason game this season that Collins
was sacked and knocked around in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   How Collins will behave and throw the ball under pressure is one
of the major question marks of the Giants' season. On Friday,
Collins completed 16 of 28 passes for 275 yards. He had an
interception, but it was on a desperation, end-of-the-half,
jump-ball-type pass into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   In three preseason games, Collins has completed 41 of 65 passes,
or 63 percent, for 502 yards, 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more comfortable than I ever have,'' Collins said.
``It's just the preseason but I feel like I'm getting things off on
the right foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Or back foot. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAMSAT, Turkey _ The minaret on the mosque was the last trace of
the ancient village to disappear. Years after the homes and shops
vanished, God's house stood as a mute witness before it, too,
slipped beneath the waters of the Euphrates rising above the
Ataturk Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers in southeastern
Turkey, villages inhabited since the beginning of civilization are
being flooded into watery oblivion by a vast dam system. For tens
of thousands of people, those who live in places of great
archaeological value and those in historically insignificant
hamlets like Samsat, a way of life is being erased.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction is the price of progress. The Turkish government
is in the final years of its largest public works project, an
ambitious effort to quench an insatiable appetite for electricity,
irrigate arid land and bring jobs to this impoverished region.
</P>
<P>
   The question being asked in Turkey, and with rising urgency by
archaeologists and human rights groups worldwide, is whether the
price is too high. And, as is so often the case when modernization
clashes with cultural heritage, the answer depends on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   For the planners, engineers and government officials involved in
the $32 billion Southeastern Anatolia Project, the answer is a
steadfast no. They describe the network of 22 dams and 19
hydroelectric plants as the key to the economic revitalization of
Upper Mesopotamia and a vital component in satisfying the whole
country's pressing need for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the least developed region of Turkey,'' said Olcay
Unver, chairman of the project. ``Over the last 10 years its
development rate has caught up with and surpassed the rest of
Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   When completed in a decade, the project will irrigate 2,500
square miles of land and affect the lives of 6.2 million people.
Government planners hope to build an export-based economy to ship
agricultural products and finished goods worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The plans also have political ramifications in this Kurdish
region. After 15 years of conflict and at least 30,000 casualties,
the army defeated the guerrilla group known as the Kurdistan
Workers Party last year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts inside and outside government see the project as an
opportunity to win the peace, though Kurdish grievances extend
beyond poverty to issues of ethnic identity and equality, and those
cannot be solved by providing electricity and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The politics, like the rivers, do not end at the border. Syria
and Iraq have depended on the Euphrates and Tigris for millenniums,
and both have complained in recent years that Turkey was
withholding their share of the water. Negotiations are stalled, and
now the dams threaten to reduce the supply downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics and politics mean little to Fatma Seker, 18. Her
evaluation of the project is made at the personal level, by the
money she earns in a clean, well-lighted factory, sewing T-shirts
for export to Wal-Mart and Bugle Boy. She makes the minimum wage,
about $138 a month, but the money goes a long way and she is proud
of her first job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like our work, and life goes smoothly,'' she said shyly
from beneath a traditional Muslim scarf during her lunch break at
the Harrani Textile Co. in Sanliurfa.
</P>
<P>
   Sanliurfa is a bustling, dusty city of 500,000 about 40 miles
from Syria. Its best claim to fame is as the place where, according
to Muslim tradition, Abraham was born and Job waited for divine
mercy. It is also the laboratory for the way the government hopes
to develop the region.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita income doubled in the last five years as water from
the gigantic Ataturk Dam irrigated 500,000 acres on the nearby
Harran Plain, boosting the production of cotton, wheat and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by a five-year tax exemption and other incentives, cotton
mills, garment factories and other businesses are operating in the
city's industrial zone and officials are trying desperately to
attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   The start is small but promising. For instance, at the Polteks
Co., 110 workers use the latest Swiss and German machinery to spin
cotton from the Harran Plain into yarn for export to Italy. At
Harrani Textile, 460 people, mostly conservative Muslim women in
headscarves, turn out 180,000 T-shirts a month for the American
market. Neither factory existed before the project.
</P>
<P>
   In Samsat, a two-hour drive northeast, upriver of the Ataturk
Dam, the 4,600 villagers have seen nothing of the prosperity
blooming on the plain.
</P>
<P>
   Samsat was an important stronghold in the Byzantine era,
controlling a strategic point on the Euphrates. Arabs conquered the
region in A.D. 640, and the Turks came later.
</P>
<P>
   From medieval times on, Samsat was of little significance except
to the people who lived there. The occasional tourist wandered in
for a quick look at the ruins of a small fortress, but life
remained quiet and slow.
</P>
<P>
   For years there were rumors about a dam. In April 1988, the
authorities arrived from Ankara and told the residents they would
be moved out. They would be paid the value of their modest houses
and given new homes in a new Samsat, about a mile away, beyond the
reach of the 500-square-mile lake that would rise behind the dam.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came, the villagers exchanged houses of mud, with
thatch roofs and no electricity, for solid new places with
electricity and plenty of water. They traded muddy ruts for paved
streets. Everyone should have been happy, but no one seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``In old Samsat we were growing many different things: corn,
melons, lentils, fruits,'' Fevzi Kural, 59, said as he sat in the
yard of his government-issue house with his family, threading
tobacco leaves onto string for drying. ``We could work in many
fields and we were supporting each other. There was a vitality to
life. We are missing very much the old Samsat.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally residents walk to the lake and strain for a glimpse
of their past. More enterprising, or desperate, souls borrow a
small boat and row toward the memories. Until last year the minaret
was still visible to guide them. Now there is nothing.

</P>
<P>
   As the muezzin called worshipers to afternoon prayer at one of
two handsome mosques built by the government in new Samsat, a knot
of men removed their shoes and paused in the shade of the portico.
They, too, spoke fondly of the lost village and complained bitterly
about the new one. The only jobs are in the tobacco fields, they
said. The government has brought no industry. They have been
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether anything was better now, they answered in unison:
``Yok. Yok.'' (``Nothing. Nothing.'')
</P>
<P>
   The scene evoked a Kurdish fable about the bulbul, or
nightingale. The bird was caught and put in a gilded cage. Despite
the grandeur, the nightingale cried every night to return to its
nest.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of Samsat, one of the first villages evacuated when
the Ataturk Dam went into service in 1990, caused no ripple outside
the region.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months the imminent drowning of sites with
archaeological appeal has sparked an outcry across the world that
Turkey is cannibalizing its history. Some have even protested that
the project is a plot to wipe out Kurdish culture.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials shake their heads at the criticism. In the
past they were criticized for failing to bring economic development
to the southeast. Now they are criticized for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that excavating and rescuing significant sites
had been a component of the project for more than two decades and
that there had been dozens of digs. And in this crossroads of
civilization, where two great rivers have nourished life for
thousands of years, there are those who say some losses are
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make choices,'' said Toni M. Cross, director of
the Ankara branch of the America Research Institute in Turkey, a
consortium of American and Canadian universities. ``If you are a
politician in a democracy, you'd better consider the living as well
as the dead. I'm a classical archaeologist, and I'd rather not lose
anything. But I like having electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some losses must be mourned, and few sites in the region
match the breathtaking beauty and drama of Hasankeyf. The old town
sits below towering limestone cliffs on a sweeping curve in the
Tigris, east of Diyarbakir.
</P>
<P>
   The cliffs and surrounding hills are riddled with 5,000 cave
dwellings more than 2,000 years old. Some are still occupied, with
numbers on the outside; one near the top sports a satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   At the summit are the ruins of two small castles and an
Assyrian-era church later transformed into a mosque. Far below, in
the rushing river, are the remains of a 12th-century bridge, once
regarded as the grandest in Anatolia.
</P>
<P>
   Six miles downriver is the site of the planned Ilisu Dam, which
will create a 200-square-mile reservoir and flood about 80 villages
in seven or eight years. With about 5,000 residents, Hasankeyf is
the largest of the doomed settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say they improved the resettlement process
after learning from mistakes in places like Samsat. Residents of
Hasankeyf are being consulted about where to build the new village
and what type of businesses and crops might thrive.
</P>
<P>
   But the consultations cannot erase the fear. Some foreign
companies involved in the Ilisu Dam have expressed concerns about
the controversy that may jeopardize the dam's construction, though
it is unlikely that Turkey would cancel the dam, because of its
importance to the overall project.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Apalday, 25, grew up in Hasankeyf, swimming in the
Tigris and hiding in the caves, just as children were doing one
morning as he sipped tea in town. He now works in the family
butcher shop. Single and articulate, he could make a fresh start in
Diyarbakir or Istanbul when the flood comes, but he does not think
about a new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we lose Hasankeyf,'' he said with a shrug of
resignation, ``it doesn't make any difference where we live.''

McCAIN SOUGHT TREATMENT QUICKLY AFTER LATEST CANCER DIAGNOSIS  
 (SUBS to correct location of hospital in 7th graph)  
(Also moving in `a' category) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

<P>
   PHOENIX _ When Sen. John McCain had a routine checkup for skin
cancer on July 27, a few days before the Republican convention, Dr.
John F. Eisold, the attending physician of the U.S. Capitol,
spotted a mole on his patient's left temple and told him, ``You
ought to have that checked.''
</P>
<P>
   The checkup was one of many McCain has undergone since he had a
malignant melanoma removed from his left shoulder in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   After the checkup, McCain moved swiftly. On Aug. 1, after
speaking at the convention in Philadelphia, the senator took the
train to Washington. Two days later, he went to Bethesda Naval
Medical Center in Maryland where doctors detected an additional
suspicious mole on his left upper arm and performed a biopsy on
each mole.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, McCain returned to the convention and wore a
bandage over part of his left temple when he appeared on stage with
Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, on Aug. 10, McCain learned in a call from Bethesda
that the moles were new, malignant melanomas. McCain, who later
said he was surprised by the diagnosis, then arranged to have a
second opinion and additional tests performed through Dr. John
Eckstein, his personal physician at the Mayo Clinic here.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, McCain had a five-and-a-half-hour operation to
remove the two melanomas and lymph nodes in his head and neck.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain recovers at the Mayo Clinic Hospital here, he is
awaiting a determination by pathologists on whether the temple
melanoma had spread. Preliminary tests before and during surgery
indicated the cancer was confined to the skin, his doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   The quickness with which McCain and his doctors reacted in the
last three weeks contrasts sharply with a similar situation in
1993. At that time it took more than six months before McCain
sought care after a Navy doctor recommended that he consult a
dermatologist for what turned out to be his first melanoma, the one
removed from his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's experience with the more than six-month delay in 1993
led him to move more quickly this time. And the episode in 1993
underlies the senator's repeated urging that other people get
checked for skin cancer. McCain stood in front of his home on
Friday after undergoing tests at the hospital to stress the
benefits of detecting melanomas and other cancers at an early stage
when they are most curable.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in 1993 is documented in the hundreds of pages of
medical records that McCain released during the recent presidential
primary campaign and was verified in interviews with his doctors.
</P>
<P>
   On May 7, 1993, military doctors in Pensacola, Fla., spotted a
dark, irregularly shaped area of skin on McCain's left shoulder
during a checkup. But the records show they did not suspect a
melanoma. A letter from a Navy doctor dated June 8, 1993,
recommended that McCain consult a dermatologist for what the
Pensacola doctors believed was a noncancerous condition known as
actinic keratosis that results from chronic sun exposure.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Nov. 24, 1993, that McCain sought care for the
skin condition. He went to Dr. Thomas M. Hudak, a plastic surgeon
in Phoenix, who had treated McCain's wife, Cindy. Hudak said in an
earlier interview that suspected it was a cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of seeing many lesions like this, it just sort of
caught my eye,'' Hudak said.
</P>
<P>
   The melanoma escaped the eye of John Eckstein, McCain's personal
physician at the Mayo Clinic who said in a separate, earlier
interview that he ``didn't recognize it if it was there'' when he
examined McCain in 1992. ``Undoubtedly, it was there,'' Eckstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the delay in 1993 are not clear now, said Nancy
Ives, McCain's press secretary. But Ives said that McCain might
have put off seeking medical care in part because of a heavy
speaking schedule on behalf of other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Because individuals with one melanoma can develop additional
ones, they are advised to have periodic checkups. Hudak said he had
removed several noncancerous moles from McCain's skin, including
one from his left temple on Oct. 4, 1998. It was a type known as a
pigmented junctional nevus. McCain recalled on Friday that the new
melanoma appeared near where the benign mole was.
</P>
<P>
   Melanomas can occasionally go undetected in a biopsy for many
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One is misdiagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   A second reason is disagreement among pathologists in
interpreting what they see through a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you send slides of a suspected melanoma to a dozen
dermatologists, some will call it normal and some will read it as a
melanoma,'' said Dr. Bernard S. Goffe, a dermatologist in Seattle.
``That's a well-known fact.''
</P>
<P>
   A third reason is that pathologists do not examine every
millimeter of the tissue removed in a biopsy. They take
representative sections from different areas. Thus, a melanoma that
is confined to a small area of a mole may escape examination due to
sampling errors.
</P>
<P>
   When a new melanoma is detected in an area where a mole was
removed and diagnosed as benign, doctors usually review the
microscopic slides to determine if the melanoma was present but
missed in the initial testing.
</P>
<P>
   Eckstein said on Saturday that no evidence of a melanoma was
detected in such a review of the mole that was removed from McCain
in 1998.

IN TRUMAN-LIKE STYLE, GORE AND LIEBERMAN PROMISE BROADER HEALTH
CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOLINE, Ill. _ Comparing his increasingly populist pitch to that
of Harry S. Truman, but leaving his running mate to
``give-them-hell,'' Vice President Al Gore vowed Sunday to fight
drug companies and health maintenance organizations in bringing
broader and fairer health coverage to all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   At the first of four appearances Sunday in Illinois and Iowa,
all of them in towns along the Mississippi River, Gore said he
would push for a patients' bill of rights to protect HMO consumers
and for adding a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you entrust me with the presidency, we will flat make it
happen,'' Gore promised a crowd of about 3,000 in downtown Moline.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of
Connecticut, used their speeches here to draw on the Trumanesque
imagery that has enthralled Democrats for more than half a century.
But Gore left it to Lieberman to assail the health care record of
his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore made only passing references to the Republicans,
Lieberman charged that 1.4 million children in Texas do not have
health insurance, that Texas leads the nation in the percentage of
residents who are uninsured and that it ranks next to last in
health care for women.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said Bush often responds to criticisms of his state by
saying ``don't mess with Texas.'' But, he asserted, ``when it comes
to health care, it's a mess in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-day riverboat tour down the Mississippi, Gore left
the slow-moving ship and traveled by bus Sunday so he could make
all four cities on his schedule. Gore and his wife, Tipper, were
rejoined by Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, who had left the trip
in Wisconsin on Friday to observe the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates clearly have been buoyed by polls showing they
received a significant boost from last week's Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles, and they have been received
enthusiastically by sizable crowds. ``I'm no expert as to what to
make of it,'' Gore told reporters, ``but it feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   As in his convention speech on Thursday night, Gore accepted
credit Sunday for the economic health of the Clinton years but said
there was more work to be done. He noted, for instance, that 15
percent of all Americans are still without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some serious problems in our health care system,''
he said, his voice still hoarse from his convention speech, ``and
we've got to fix them without undermining the good things about our
health care system.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would move incrementally toward a system of
universal health care, starting with guaranteed coverage for every
child by 2004. And he said the country owes its older citizens a
prescription drug benefit, a proposal estimated to cost $253
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people have bills for pills that are more than their
Social Security check,'' Gore said, ``it is wrong for our country
to put seniors, the generation that won World War II, in a
situation where they have to choose between food and medicine when
the drug companies have the biggest profits of any industry in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug companies, Gore said, do not support such plans because
they fear that drug prices will come down. ``Well, they need to
come down,'' he said. ``They need more competition.'' He added:
``I'll be like Harry Truman. I'll tell them the truth and they'll
just think it's hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then switched targets from the drug companies to HMOs that
he charges with making financial decisions that usurp medical
recommendations. ``Some bean counter behind a computer terminal who
doesn't have a license to practice medicine and surely does not
have a right to play god overrules the doctor because the HMO or
the insurance company doesn't want to shell out the money, even
though you've been paying the monthly premium,'' Gore said. ``What
is that all about?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal for a patients' bill of rights, campaign aides
say, would assure access to specialists, would guarantee emergency
room care regardless of when and where the need arises, and would
provide either a right to sue or an alternative appeals process if
insurers deny coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign criticizes Bush's proposed bill of rights
because it would cover only those Americans in federally governed
health care plans, a restriction that Gore aides say would exclude
135 million people with private insurance.

`MYSTERIOUS WAYS': A FLUKE, ANGELS, ALIENS, OR NONE OF THE ABOVE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)

<P>
   What's halfway between ``Touched by an Angel'' and ``The
X-Files''? It's ``Mysterious Ways,'' a new series that NBC has been
previewing on Mondays this summer, ahead of the show's run starting
Tuesday night on the Pax network, NBC's family-friendly corporate
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The X-Files'' this drama features an appealingly
mismatched man and woman trying to explain the unexplainable. But
in these tales the unknown forces are unimpeachably good, not evil;
they come not from Mars, but from another celestial address.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Mysterious Ways'' does not explicitly invoke God, as
``Angel'' does, the new show is built upon the same conviction that
earthly problems yield to divine solutions. Like ``Angel,'' and a
thousand pop pieties from Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley, ``Mysterious
Ways'' is a one-size-fits-all exercise in faith without any of the
responsibilities or requirements of actual religion.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the show isn't pleasant entertainment. It
won't stir your soul, but it might warm your heart.
</P>
<P>
   The series' central characters are Declan Dunn, an anthropology
professor, and Peggy Fowler, a psychiatrist. Declan (played with a
bit of goofy charm by Adrian Pasdar) has made a sideline of
investigating what he calls ``miraculous phenomena'' since he was
unaccountably rescued from an avalanche by a boy on a snowmobile
who appeared out of nowhere and quickly vanished.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot episode, which Pax is showing Tuesday, he meets
Peggy (Rae Dawn Chong) at the hospital where she works. Declan has
come there to check on a boy who fell into an icy lake and was
saved from sure drowning by an unseen hand. Declan and Peggy, the
hunter after miracles and the levelheaded scientist, are opposites
that attract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm perplexed by you,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   He replies, ``Get in line.''
</P>
<P>
   The pattern for the series, which was created by Peter O'Fallon
and Carl Binder, is established as Peggy joins Declan and his
quirky graduate assistant, Miranda (Alisen Down), looking for every
reasonable explanation for the boy's survival. Was it a miracle?
What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night on NBC, which will broadcast new episodes weekly
through Labor Day, the investigators go to a town where a bus load
of schoolchildren were killed 10 years earlier in a collision with
a train at a rail crossing. The locals, who have never gotten over
the tragedy, believe that the children's ghosts now protect the
crossing; any car that stops there is somehow pushed off the tracks
to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The story takes a clever turn or two, although the dialogue and
much of the acting, especially among the townspeople, is wooden.
More problematic is the relationship between Declan and Peggy. They
seem to kind of like each other, but there's no electricity there.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting character remains Miranda, the unsmiling
but brilliant graduate student. She dresses in black, rides a
motorcycle and locates elusive data when she should be grading
Declan's anthropology exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get her,'' Peggy says of Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   Declan replies: ``What's not to get? Take your IQ, double it,
add black velvet, and you're halfway there.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there an implied conflict here: the shadowy Miranda versus
the good Dr. Peggy? And what happens back on campus, when Declan is
alone with his sultry assistant? Must he endure some devilish trial
by temptation?
</P>
<P>
   Nah. This modest little show couldn't support that kind of
weight. Besides, in this realm of convenient, plot-resolving
miracles, heaven can triumph with no competition from hell.

AGAINST WALESA

<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ Piotr Naimski, the former head of the Polish
secret services, has some moral qualms about what he is doing, but
he believes that Lech Walesa, anti-communist hero and Nobel Peace
Prize laureate, has a moral problem.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa, who is running a quixotic campaign to be elected once
more as Poland's president, was cleared on Aug. 12 of charges that
he collaborated with the communist-era secret services and reported
on the activities of his friends and fellow shipyard workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Naimski, one of the first members of KOR, the Worker's
Defense Committee that led to the Solidarity trade union, believes
that Walesa did collaborate, and testified against him in the
closed vetting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Naimski said he did so reluctantly, and with a heavy heart. In a
long interview, he said first that what bothered him most was the
continuing security risk of hidden collaboration. But it became
clear that what really seemed to bother him was hypocrisy. He said
he believes Walesa could have easily confessed to youthful
collaboration without harming his political standing or his
historical reputation _ and, in fact, could have enhanced both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walesa has failed a moral hurdle,'' Naimski said. ``He has
made a mistake by not going openly to the public, and he has missed
an important chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It all ``seems bizarre,'' Naimski said, staring into space.
``Walesa will go down as a positive historical figure and as a
Polish president _ what else is there? But still ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Is Walesa lucky in the verdict of the court? Naimski smiled
thinly. ``He's lucky, yes.'' He laughed. ``And the rest is left for
God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Poles have come late to the vetting game, now 11 years after
Communism collapsed, and the process has been clumsy. Perhaps like
the French after World War II, there is a popular desire to assume
that everyone was really part of the resistance and that the same
pressures put on East Germans, Czechs and Hungarians to collaborate
with Moscow and the communist secret police were better resisted
here.
</P>
<P>
   This process has not been smooth or particularly successful
anywhere in the former Soviet bloc, in part because of the ease of
faking or manipulating files built on the products of spies and
informers. Still, the issue of who cooperated with the secret
services and who did not is a moral touchstone. The problem is
deciding _ for certain _ who is innocent and who is guilty, and
proving that someone is lying when they say they did not do what
certain documents indicate they did.
</P>
<P>
   Naimski, a biochemist and anti-communist, ran the Polish secret
services, now known as the State Protection Office, in 1992, when
the process to screen people suspected of being communist
collaborators began. He helped prepare a list of 64 people that
year who were listed as spies in the police records, including
Walesa, then the Polish president. Walesa's name was included on
the list, Naimski now says, after a wrenching internal debate about
the virtues of honesty versus political discretion. But a
parliamentary committee later concluded that Walesa had signed no
agreement with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the world, Naimski has seen Walesa's file, where
the former Gdansk shipyard electrician is alleged to have been an
agent, code-named Bolek, who spied for the secret police in the
early 1970s _ before Walesa rocketed to fame in 1980 as the feisty,
salty leader of Solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   No one contends that Walesa collaborated during the Solidarity
period or afterward, and during the closed trial the secret
services revealed a 1985 Interior Ministry report that documents
had been faked in 1982 to try to prevent Walesa from winning the
Nobel Peace Prize, which he was awarded in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   While these fakes were said to have been important in the
clearing of Walesa, Naimski says that he was aware of them in 1992
and that what troubles him are other, earlier files.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa, now 57, has regularly denied charges of collaboration at
any time. After he was cleared, he called the whole affair ``an
incredibly repulsive game.'' At the same time, he bemoaned the fact
that the vetting trial _ in a process known as lustration, after
the Czech term _ did not seem to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little sick at heart because I had trusted in the
lustration,'' Walesa said. ``Now I see it has no point because the
whole operation did not convince anyone.'' And Walesa is
particularly angry at Naimski and former Interior Minister Antoni
Macierewicz, who both testified against him in the secret hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trusted that at least one of them would shift one way or
another,'' Walesa told Polish Radio. ``But it turns out that it was
all too hard. Their money, their books, and their entire philosophy
and existence is based on this conviction. Now they can't go back
on this. Would they give the money back to those whom they tried to
deceive?''
</P>
<P>
   These charges pain Naimski, a thin, ascetic-looking man of 49,
who is now teaching foreign and security policy at a private
business school in the southern town of Nowy Sacz. Naimski is also
an adviser on the staff of Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, a member of
the Solidarity coalition who heads a minority government. But
Naimski denies that the government or the Solidarity leader Marian
Krzaklewski, also running for president, manipulated the legal
process in any way.
</P>
<P>
   Naimski said he favors lustration, and would like the entire
process to be ``transparent, open and public,'' unlike its current
secrecy, and yet understands that any vetting system that relies on
informants and secret service files must be ambiguous and subject
to manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, these are moral questions, not legal ones,'' he
said. ``The courts are not the best way to answer moral
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 law requires the vetting of those seeking high public
office. It is not a crime to have collaborated. But anyone who
denies it and is found to have lied is banned from political life
for 10 years. This presidential election is the first time the law
has been used.
</P>
<P>
   Naimski said he believes the special court that cleared Walesa
did so on special, technical grounds. He says that the court did
not find certain original documents sufficient proof that Walesa
was lying, and he said that many other documents have been
destroyed since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Naimski said he has other concerns, which are about state
security. ``This is not a problem of collaboration, but of
counterintelligence,'' he said. Secret collaborators may still be
blackmailed, he said, especially by former Communist Party
apparatchiks and secret service officers who have moved, almost
seamlessly, into the new economy. Many, Naimski said, still have
strong connections to their former colleagues in Russia, many of
whom have also moved into the market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Poles like to talk of a ``Russian party'' of influence, which
lately has been trying to win Polish approval of Russian plans to
build a second natural-gas pipeline to Western Europe that will go
through Poland and Slovakia, cutting out Ukraine, a Polish ally
that Moscow is trying to bring back under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you surprised that Russia treats Central Europe as a lost
jewel?'' Naimski said. And he pointed out that it was not until
days before Poland formally joined NATO that the former communist
opposition in the Parliament was persuaded to pass a strong law
vetting the past of senior officials, as NATO membership requires.
</P>
<P>
   The former Communists, led by the current Polish president,
Aleksander Kwasniewski, who was also cleared by the court, are
expected to win control of the government in parliamentary
elections likely in the spring. The former Communists said they
intend to re-examine the current government's decision not to allow
the Russian gas giant, Gazprom, to build a second pipeline through
Poland, avoiding Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Naimski's position as a government adviser has also led to
complaints that he should simply shut up and accept the verdict of
the court. To those complaints, he simply shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he considers himself Walesa's enemy _ as Walesa has
charged _ Naimski again looks pained. ``I am not an enemy of
Walesa,'' he said. ``I'm disappointed in him.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As if Vice President Al Gore did not have enough
trouble in his native region, several prominent Southern
politicians of his own party have been keeping their distance from
him as they begin their own general election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates for governor in North Carolina and for
senator in Georgia have avoided appearing with Gore, and skipped
last week's Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. The
governor of South Carolina left the convention early, and has
dismissed Gore's chances in his state. Each has his own
explanation, and no one will confess to a deliberate snub of the
national ticket. But taken as a whole, their decisions seem to
illustrate the South's general indifference to Gore's appeal, and
demonstrate how hard he will have to work to capture even a few
states in the region.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, held a rally in downtown Atlanta on Aug. 10, there was
no sign of Georgia's newest statewide Democratic candidate, Sen.
Zell Miller, the state's former governor. Miller was recently
appointed to replace the late Paul Coverdell, and has only a few
weeks to campaign to keep the job in a special election in
November. But rather than attend the convention, or spend the time
campaigning, he chose to spend this week on a private, unannounced
tour of Georgia's military bases, unaccompanied by any reporters or
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate for governor of North Carolina, state
Attorney General Mike Easley, chose not to appear with Gore during
a June visit to meet with flood victims, although the two men met
privately. Easley has made it clear in various interviews that
campaigning with Gore is not a priority for him. Easley, in a
conference call, spoke to the North Carolina delegation at last
week's convention, but was criticized by some delegates for not
appearing in person and for distancing himself from the ticket.
Campaign officials said he was too busy campaigning to go to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hodges, the Democratic governor of South Carolina, left the
convention rather conspicuously on Tuesday, before the acceptance
speeches of Gore and Lieberman. Hodges, who has had a rocky
political relationship with Gore, was quoted in The State, the
Columbia newspaper, as saying that Gov. George W. Bush has a ``99
percent'' chance of winning South Carolina, adding that he was not
planning to work hard for the ticket. Hodges is not up for
re-election this year, but is commanding a major campaign for a
November referendum to create a lottery in the state that would
provide more money for education.
</P>
<P>
   According to a series of recent polls taken before the
convention, Gore was behind in every Southern state except his
native Tennessee. Gore may be doing better after his convention
appearance, but the earlier polls showed that he had been hurt by
President Clinton's unpopularity in the region, and his own
positions on issues like gun control and the environment are seen
as less congenial in the South than those of Bush. By contrast,
Democrats like Easley and Miller are the heavy favorites in their
races, and Hodges is a popular figure in his state. All three seem
painfully aware that voters in the region continue to distinguish
between national Democrats and Southern Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always happens, and you can bet it's going to happen in
this year's races _ the Republicans are going to try to tie the
state Democrats to the unpopular head of the national party,'' said
Bill Moore, a professor of political science at the College of
Charleston. ``From their point of view, it's just pragmatic
politics to appear as independent from Gore as they can be.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hodges said he was not trying to be aloof by
leaving the convention early; he said he had made a commitment to
attend a fund-raiser for a state Senate candidate. But he obliquely
suggested that Southern voters have different priorities than those
voiced at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moderate Democratic candidates can win in the South, if they
focus on a core set of issues that voters care about,'' Hodges
said. ``Too often Democrats at the national level are identified
with more liberal causes that send voters to the Republicans.'' He
backed off his earlier assessment that Gore had no chance in South
Carolina, saying that Gore's selection of Lieberman and his
positions on education and Medicare might help him if he chooses to
campaign in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But many Southern Democrats are grumbling more openly that the
Gore campaign has spent little time and money in the South,
essentially freeing up candidates to go off on their own. Richard
A. Harpootlian, the chairman of the South Carolina Democratic
Party, said the Bush campaign is still reaping the benefits of
having spent at least $4 million in the state during the hotly
contested Republican primary in February, while the Democrats have
spent about $5,000 in the state so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The successful Democrats in the South have fought hard and
swam against the current to win their elections,'' Harpootlian
said. ``If the national Democrats want to come here and spend some
money and work hard, they can do it, too. But so far, they're
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley, the candidate for North Carolina governor, said much the
same in a recent interview with The Charlotte Observer. ``I want
them to commit the resources, commit the effort,'' he said of the
Gore campaign. ``If they do that, I think they can win the state.''
But in the absence of a strong national presence, Easley said, he
has to run his own race, because ``there's not any room on the
ticket for a weak campaign, top or bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign insists it can be competitive in the South _
particularly in Tennessee, Florida and Georgia, and possibly North
Carolina and Arkansas _ and plans to devote resources to the
region, although Douglas Hattaway, a campaign spokesman, said he
did not know precisely where Gore would appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a Southern New Democrat who has long favored a
strong defense, welfare reform, fiscal responsibility, and values
like that,'' Hattaway said. ``Those are the kind of issues that are
important to Southern voters and New Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rick Dent, a spokesman for Miller, said it might be the
Southern Democrats who wound up helping Gore, a reversal of the
conventional coattails theory. Miller, as a new senator, has been
too busy learning the job and gearing up for his campaign to appear
with the national ticket, Dent said, and has never been terribly
interested in partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to Washington to play partisan games,'' Dent
said. ``But he is a strong vote-getter, and it may just be that
some of his supporters will decide to vote for Mr. Gore.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ After reaching a Russian nuclear submarine that sank in
the Barents Sea with 118 men on board, Norwegian divers struggled
Sunday to open an escape hatch but found no signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Angry Russians, meanwhile, chided their leaders for waiting
three days before accepting international assistance after a team
of Norwegian deep-sea divers made it to the Kursk, which sank in
354 feet of water on August 12, in their first day of rescue
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian operation appeared to have been the first time
divers had descended to the Kursk since rescue efforts began a week
ago. Russian escape capsules have tried to reach the Kursk
repeatedly, but even though the Russian navy lacked skilled divers
and undersea rescue equipment, the government did not accept offers
of help from Britain and Norway until Wednesday, four days after
the submarine went down.
</P>
<P>
   New details about the accident, reported Sunday, indicated that
the delay may have cost the lives of anyone who had survived the
explosion or collision _ no one knows for sure what happened _ that
caused the massive Oscar 2-class attack submarine to sink.
</P>
<P>
   For days, the Russian navy had insisted that the submarine was
in good condition, but Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov
said that ``water almost instantly flooded'' half of the
submarine's hull and that ``the crew in those sections died almost
instantaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that some of the crew might have survived for a while
in the Kursk's three aft compartments, and suggested that the
Norwegian divers had seen evidence that some crew members had tried
to remove the escape hatch from within in a desperate effort to
evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Norwegian divers banged on the Kursk's hull Sunday
to see if there were any sign of air pockets, officials said, they
heard no response. Late Sunday, Russian navy spokesman Igor Dygalo
told Russian television the Norwegian team had been taken to the
naval town of Vidyayevo, on the coast of the Barents Sea, to study
a submarine similar to the Kursk to see how they could open the
hatch and enter the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians also added to the growing list of contradictions
among the reports Russian officials have given about the state of
the sub and the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   The divers said the escape hatch on the Kursk could be removed,
contradicting statements by Russian officials after a Russian
mini-sub had failed to latch onto the submarine's hatch in several
efforts last week, that the hatch had sustained extensive damage.
</P>
<P>
   With hopes of finding any survivors all but extinguished, it was
still unclear Sunday night whether the Russian navy would dispatch
a British rescue sub to try to latch onto the Kursk. The Norwegians
said the British sub might help; Klebanov said it would not.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence that the boast had been rapidly torn up by the
accident cast doubt on the assurances issued by Russian officials
about the two nuclear reactors that powered the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   The officials have insisted that the Kursk's nuclear reactors
switched off in the accident, but the violence of the collision or
explosion that sunk the boat raised concerns that the reactors
could have been damaged in the explosion. Neither Russian nor
Norwegian authorities have found any evidence of radioactive leaks.
</P>
<P>
   As often happens in Russia during a crisis, conspiracy theories
emerged as some people suggested the government had an interest in
seeing that none of the crew members survived. Many people agreed
with a Moscow-based musician, Alexander Nikolayev, who said ``they
hid the truth from us for days, and that was enough to have tried
to save the crew.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is always the way it is in Russia, where the state has
its interests and people don't matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians expressed little trust in the statements by
officials, who kept quiet about the Kursk accident until two days
after the navy found the boat on the seabed. Then, officials termed
the incident a ``malfunction'' and implied that they were in
contact with the crew, although they refused to issue a list of
those on board.
</P>
<P>
   At first officials said divers could not go down because of the
weather. Then, when it became clear Russia lacked its own expert
deep-sea divers, the Russian government did not immediately accept
Norway's and Britain's offer to help (and never accepted a US
offer), instead insisting until Wednesday that the Russian navy had
all the equipment it needed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, four days after the Kursk sank, Putin gave the go-ahead to
ask for Wesern help. After that, the Russian navy had to wait until
Sunday for the divers to get in position. By then, a Russian
admiral had already stated that most of the crew were probably
dead, in what he termed ``the gravest disaster'' he had seen in the
history of Russian submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian deep-sea divers discharged by the navy for
lack of funds say their own offers to help were rebuffed, according
to the Moscow newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kursk incident has seen Russian admirals behaving as if
they were back in Soviet times,'' a Russian defense analyst,
Alexander Golts, wrote in The Russia Journal, an English-language
weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The timing for such a comment could not be more poignant. Monday
marks the anniversary of the collapse of the 1991 coup by Soviet
hardliners.
</P>
<P>
   At that euphoric time, the failure of the putsch was widely
celebrated in Moscow and other cities as the beginning of a new,
democratic era in Russia. Sunday, only a handful of people stood
vigil at a monument for three young men who died during the
three-day coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see, everything has changed, but nothing has
changed,'' one man said of the Kursk incident.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been criticized in the
Russian media for not cancelling his working vacation on the Black
Sea during the Kursk crisis, made a public effort to share in his
country's pain Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts are aching, all of us,'' Putin said, looking weary
and grim. ``Sometimes events rather than us dictate what happens.''

SUNKEN KURSK A SYMBOL OF RUSTING RUSSIAN SUBMARINE FLEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Just before Gennady Lyakhin captained the Kursk to sea
on its maiden voyage, he turned to a television camera and said his
vessel, one of Russia's most modern and fearsome submarines, was
proof, and a potent symbol, that Russia still had the military
might to defend its interests around the world.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Now, barring a miracle, Lyakhin lies dead in the wreckage of his
sub at the bottom of the icy waters of the Barents Seas, along with
the rest of his 118-member crew.
</P>
<P>
   And the Kursk has become a symbol of something entirely
different: of Russia's inability to keep its nuclear Navy
maintained and its crews trained, and of the dangers this implies
for the rest of the rusting fleet of ``floating Chernobyls'' that
make up the bulk of the country's submarine force.
</P>
<P>
   The sinking of the Kursk is not the first submarine disaster for
the former Soviet Union; it is the fifth in the past 20 years. But
it is the first to unfold in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the sub, and the futile week of efforts to save the
crew, have given the world, as well as ordinary Russians, an
unflattering glimpse at the cancers eating away at Russia's once
proud military: lack of funding and resources, confusion and
discord among commanders, general disregard for the safety and
well-being of service personnel, and evidence everywhere of
long-term decay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kursk tragedy and the rescue operation show the true
current state of the Russian Navy,'' said Admiral Georgy Kostev,
one of Russia's leading authorities on submarines, last week.
</P>
<P>
   The unexplained loss of a submarine called ``unsinkable'' by its
designers has dealt a serious blow to President Vladimir V. Putin's
plans to make the Navy the mainstay of Moscow's bid to reclaim
great power status.
</P>
<P>
   It's a goal embodied in a huge billboard that has popped up on
Moscow's streets, featuring a picture of a Russian missile cruiser,
with the huge slogan ``Naval Might for Russia's Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   If the rescue work, as is all but certain, ends up confirming
the deaths of 118 crew members, the Kursk disaster would be the
largest peacetime loss for the Russian Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk tragedy could have been even worse if the sub had been
carrying nuclear weapons, or if its reactor had begun leaking
radiation. What worries some analysts most is the possibility that
the Kursk disaster could repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Kola Peninsula, home of the Northern Fleet where the Kursk
was based, has 270 military and civilian nuclear reactors on its
soil, the largest concentration in the world. It is home to about
50 active nuclear submarines and 90 that have been decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
   Of these decommissioned vessels, 35 still contain nuclear
reactors or fuel, and therefore cannot simply be scrapped, said
Alexei Yablokov, a former adviser on ecological issues to former
president Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has no money and inadequate facilities to transfer or
store the radioactive fuel. The result is a growing backlog of
poorly stored nuclear waste, much of it afloat on docked submarines
that need constant maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These vessels are a catastrophe waiting to happen, they are
floating Chernobyls,'' Yablokov said. ``They require constant
cooling, or else there is the possibility of an explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, when the local utility turned off the electricity serving
one of the decommissioned boats, the diesel-fueled backup pumps
were out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``An admiral told me later we were an hour or so away from a
meltdown,'' Yablokov said. ``Depending on the wind, that could send
fallout as far as Denmark.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as near as Murmansk, a city of 500,000 next to the main naval
base. Murmansk has had its share of close calls in recent years: In
May, 1998, radio stations warned people to take iodine tablets
after a fire on a Delta-class ballistic missile submarine set off
fears of nuclear fallout.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief period of openness in the early 1990s, the
military has clamped the lid of secrecy over the nuclear peril on
the Kola Penninsula. Anyone who tries to raise the nuclear waste
problem is persecuted, like Alexander Nikitin, a former Navy
captain who spent two years in prison on treason charges before a
court acquitted him this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership still prefers secrecy to safety, unfortunately
for the sailors, and probably unfortunately for society,'' said
Joshua Handler, a doctoral student at Princeton University, who is
a specialist on the Russian nuclear fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Have the near catastrophes caused the Navy to take more safety
precautions to prevent accidents? The Kursk disaster indicates that
the answer is no. Several reports said last week that the submarine
left shore without vital batteries that would power backup
air-purifying and light systems in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   One former commander of Russia's Navy, Eduard Baltin, said last
week that he had asked why the Navy had not sent deep-sea divers,
who can operate at 350 feet, to investigate the damage, try to set
up communications with the submarine, and possibly pass supplies
and oxygen to any survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Baltin said he had found out that the Navy still had a deep-sea
diving unit, but all training and funding had stopped, and all the
qualified divers had left for better-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Kostev said Russia once had two rescue submarines similar to the
one the British have, but the minisubs were decommissioned in 1995.
In their absence, less capable bathyscapes with short-lived
batteries and antiquated diving bells, none of which could fight
the strong undersea currents, wasted three days trying to latch
onto the Kursk's escape hatch. Only on Wednesday did Russia decide
to call in a British minisub and a Norwegian team of deep-sea
divers for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the rescue operation, it is being conducted as if they
don't want to save the crew, but instead get rid of any loose ends
in the ocean,'' Kostev said last week.
</P>
<P>
   All of Russia's armed services have been in crisis since the
1991 Soviet breakup, especially after two costly campaigns in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya. But the Navy has been hit worst of
all. Russia's total annual defense budget is less than $5 billion,
a fraction of what it was 10 years ago, and the Navy's share has
shrunk to less than 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy can barely pay for food for sailors and officers'
wages, to say nothing of investing in new vessels, weapons,
training, and maintenance. The number of active nuclear-powered
submarines, considered the elite force of the Russian Navy, has
shrunk from more than 250 during the Cold War to 60 today. Patrols
have been cut by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason we have probably not seen more of these
horrendous accidents since the situation has deteriorated is
because they have less subs and they are operating less,'' said
Handler at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   The massive 500-foot vessels of the Kursk class, known as
Oscar-2 by NATO and Antei by the Russians, were considered Russia's
best attack submarines, with enough armor to survive a direct
torpedo hit and the firepower to destroy an entire US
aircraft-carrier group in one attack.
</P>
<P>
   But in the post-Cold War world, taking on the US Navy is not a
top priority for Russia, and even the Oscar-2 boats have been
neglected. Of the seven remaining Oscar-2 submarines, three are
laid-up, waiting to be scrapped. Defense analysts say one more
Oscar-2 is in construction, though it is unclear whether it will
ever be finished.
</P>
<P>
   Some reports last week suggested the Kursk had been at sea only
twice in five years. Since the vessel had three rotating crews,
that likely meant that some crew members on board last weekend had
no prior experience at sea. Alexander Pikayev, a specialist on
nuclear forces at the Carnegie Center in Moscow, said repairs to
the boat had been delayed because of funding problems; instead, a
vital repair was taken on by sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inactivity of the fleet and the loss of technical and
human resources of the past few years undeniably helped the
accident happen,'' Pikayev said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also may bear some responsibility. Just a day before the
Kursk sank, on Aug. 11, He told his Security Council that it was
time to reform a military in which ``pilots don't fly, and sailors
barely go to sea.''
</P>
<P>
   To change this, Putin had ordered massive exercises of the kind
the Northern Fleet had not seen since the Cold War. The idea was to
ready the fleet for a voyage to the Mediterranean this fall, which
would show the world that Russia still had a presence on the high
seas.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, defense analysts like Pikayev said, is that
officers and crews who had spent most of the decade on shore no
longer had the training or discipline to operate their complex
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Americans say, people get rusty more quickly than
boats,'' Pikayev said. ``This sharp change in the routine, taking
these ships with poor repairs, undisciplined crews, who have lost
many of their skills; this is a recipe for something to go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, the Security Council decided to make deep cuts in
Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal in order to fund other branches
of the military, and to shift the focus of Russia's nuclear
deterrent to the Navy, a move the Kursk disaster could force the
Kremlin to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long can we get by on the enthusiasm of our men,'' Putin
asked rhetorically during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he got his answer.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Having found no signs of life more than a week after
the Russian submarine Kursk plunged to the bottom of the Barents
Sea, rescue teams were preparing a plan Sunday to use a ship's
crane to rip a hatch off the giant vessel and begin the grim task
of recovering bodies and a lengthy and dangerous mission to salvage
the submarine's twin nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   In their first full day of work, a team of Norwegian divers
working with the Russians found the rear escape hatch on the
490-foot vessel badly damaged, a Russian official said, and the
divers failed in repeated attempts to muscle it open by hand and
with powerful, special tools.
</P>
<P>
   The divers reported that hatchway valves had been opened from
the inside. It is likely that the body of one of the submarine's
118 crew members lies in the air lock chamber and that the chamber
is filled with water, said Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who
is heading the investigation into the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   His description of the grim discovery was broadcast by Russian
television from the deck of the cruiser Peter the Great and was
consistent with remarks Saturday by Vice Adm. Mikhail Mostak, chief
of staff of Russia's Northern Fleet, indicating that one or more
members of the Kursk crew may have tried to make a desperate escape
from the submarine, only to perish when seawater under great
pressure rushed in.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of frenetic work at a depth of more than 300 feet, the
Norwegian navy team sent back vivid pictures of the escape hatch
that has defied nearly a week of efforts to open it. The divers
pounded with hammers on the hull hoping that their soundings would
locate any remaining air pockets inside.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked in teams of three in six-hour shifts, the divers
sent up requests for special tools to turn the hatch valves, and
some tools were fabricated on board the Norwegian vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, two Norwegian divers flew by helicopter to the
Russian submarine base at Vidyaevo, the Kursk's home port, to
practice opening and entering hatches on one of the Kursk's sister
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Planning was under way to rip the Kursk's hatch cover off by
force, according to Klebanov.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joint commission made a decision to open the top hatch of
the rescue lock chamber,'' he said, referring to the escape chamber
that passes through the hull, with inner and outer hatches that
allow emergency exit from the submarine. ``Unfortunately, they
failed to open it for several hours though very powerful tools have
been used.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision was made to try to rip it off with the help of a
crane on the Norwegian rescue ship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials reported that air pockets might still exist in
the compartment below the inner hatch, but they expressed no
expectations that any survivors could be found, though a Norwegian
military spokesman in Oslo, Kjell Grandhagen, said, ``We are still
working on the theory that we are looking for possible survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway's Rear Adm. Einar Skorgen, who is directing the Norwegian
rescue contingent, said the timing of the hatch removal was not
set. ``We have to clarify the consequences of opening it,'' he told
Norwegian television.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent cooperative spirit among Russian, British and
Norwegian rescue crews was somewhat undermined Sunday night when
the spokesman for the Norwegian armed forces, speaking in Oslo,
contradicted Klebanov's statements that the escape hatch was too
severely damaged to be opened manually, or with the British LR5
rescue submarine that arrived on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not drawn the conclusion that the hatch is so damaged
that it cannot be opened,'' the spokesman, John Epsen Lien, told
Reuters. ``We think it should be possible to open it with a British
or Russian rescue capsule.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Klebanov had said that video images of the hatch showed
a serious crack in the donut-shaped ring around it that is used to
create an airtight seal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we think the British sub will not be able to
dock,'' Klebanov said, adding that he believed that the Norwegian
divers would agree to enter the Kursk after studying the entryway
on one of the Kursk's sister ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their commander is now asking them who will go and it is
already clear that someone will go,'' Klebanov said.
``Psychologically, it is very difficult but there is assuredness
that several people will agree and the operation will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian officials have yet to confirm that their divers will
enter the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   What lies ahead after the hatch is opened is a complex and
dangerous investigation of the Kursk's nine compartments. Dangerous
battery acids, unexploded weapons and highly radioactive fuel
elements in the Kursk's twin reactors could pose a serious danger
to the recovery operation.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have speculated about plans to lift the rear
section of the submarine with surface ships and drag the vessel to
shallower water for easier access by salvage divers. With winter
already approaching in the Arctic region, it seemed possible that
the salvage operation could carry over to next spring, but Russian
officials have as yet given no definite accounting of their plans.
</P>
<P>
   As the Norwegian divers worked Sunday, Russian President
Vladimir Putin met in Moscow with senior clergymen of the Russian
Orthodox Church and expressed the powerlessness he felt over the
loss of the 118-member crew.
</P>
<P>
   The attack submarine went down Aug. 12 during military
maneuvers. Two explosions apparently ripped through the hull of the
submarine as it was running at periscope depth, and sent it
crashing to the seabed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With sorrow in our hearts and, I do not exaggerate, tears in
our eyes, we are following all that is happening in the Barents
Sea,'' he said. ``The sailors are doing everything they can to save
their comrades, but, alas, sometimes events _ and not us _ dictate
the logic of how a situation develops.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``until the last minute we will do all that can
be done to save whomever can be saved. We will struggle for the
lives of each of our sailors, and hope for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Putin remained at the Kremlin Sunday, despite calls for
him to travel to Severomorsk, the naval headquarters near the scene
of the disaster, the Russian president held a long conversation
with Igor Spassky, Russia's leading submarine designer.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's public remarks, delivered in an unusually somber and
deliberate tone as he stood in front of the golden brocade walls of
one of the churches inside the Kremlin walls, appeared in part to
be in response to a swell of criticism that the Russian military,
and Putin personally, were too slow to seek foreign assistance in
the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   An investigating commission, headed by Klebanov, announced on
Saturday that preliminary findings showed that the Kursk was
involved in a collision with an object near the surface weighing
8,000 tons or more. He said it was possible that the object was a
ship or a World War II mine.
</P>
<P>
   Or, Klebanov said, some unknown chain of events could have
triggered a massive internal explosion aboard the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Russian officials say most of the crew died in the
first two minutes after the explosion, including all officers on
the bridge. They say that the pressure of seawater rushing in
compressed the air in the hull and reduced the chances for survival
beyond a few days.

   MOLINE, Ill. _ Comparing his increasingly populist pitch to that
of Harry S. Truman, but leaving his running mate to
``give-them-hell,'' Vice President Al Gore vowed Sunday to fight
drug companies and health maintenance organizations in bringing
broader and fairer health coverage to all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   At the first of four appearances Sunday in Illinois and Iowa,
all of them in towns along the Mississippi River, Gore said he
would push for a patients' bill of rights to protect HMO consumers
and for adding a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you entrust me with the presidency, we will flat make it
happen,'' Gore promised a crowd of about 3,000 in downtown Moline.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of
Connecticut, used their speeches here to draw on the Trumanesque
imagery that has enthralled Democrats for more than half a century.
But Gore left it to Lieberman to assail the health care record of
his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore made only passing references to the Republicans,
Lieberman charged that 1.4 million children in Texas do not have
health insurance, that Texas leads the nation in the percentage of
residents who are uninsured and that it ranks next to last in
health care for women.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said Bush often responds to criticisms of his state by
saying ``don't mess with Texas.'' But, he asserted, ``when it comes
to health care, it's a mess in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-day riverboat tour down the Mississippi, Gore left
the slow-moving ship and traveled by bus Sunday so he could make
all four cities on his schedule. Gore and his wife, Tipper, were
rejoined by Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, who had left the trip
in Wisconsin on Friday to observe the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates clearly have been buoyed by polls showing they
received a significant boost from last week's Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles, and they have been received
enthusiastically by sizable crowds. ``I'm no expert as to what to
make of it,'' Gore told reporters, ``but it feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   As in his convention speech on Thursday night, Gore accepted
credit Sunday for the economic health of the Clinton years but said
there was more work to be done. He noted, for instance, that 15
percent of all Americans are still without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some serious problems in our health care system,''
he said, his voice still hoarse from his convention speech, ``and
we've got to fix them without undermining the good things about our
health care system.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would move incrementally toward a system of
universal health care, starting with guaranteed coverage for every
child by 2004. And he said the country owes its older citizens a
prescription drug benefit, a proposal estimated to cost $253
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people have bills for pills that are more than their
Social Security check,'' Gore said, ``it is wrong for our country
to put seniors, the generation that won World War II, in a
situation where they have to choose between food and medicine when
the drug companies have the biggest profits of any industry in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug companies, Gore said, do not support such plans because
they fear that drug prices will come down. ``Well, they need to
come down,'' he said. ``They need more competition.'' He added:
``I'll be like Harry Truman. I'll tell them the truth and they'll
just think it's hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then switched targets from the drug companies to HMOs that
he charges with making financial decisions that usurp medical
recommendations. ``Some bean counter behind a computer terminal who
doesn't have a license to practice medicine and surely does not
have a right to play god overrules the doctor because the HMO or
the insurance company doesn't want to shell out the money, even
though you've been paying the monthly premium,'' Gore said. ``What
is that all about?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal for a patients' bill of rights, campaign aides
say, would assure access to specialists, would guarantee emergency
room care regardless of when and where the need arises, and would
provide either a right to sue or an alternative appeals process if
insurers deny coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign criticizes Bush's proposed bill of rights
because it would cover only those Americans in federally governed
health care plans, a restriction that Gore aides say would exclude
135 million people with private insurance.

THIS WEEK'S TV HIGHLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
TODAY 
Asked last week to rate his performance after two ``Monday Night
Football'' exhibition telecasts, Dennis Miller said: ``I'm getting
wood on the ball, I'm keeping the bat alive.'' So maybe that's the
problem. Someone oughtta clue him in during his last practice game
that there's !ital!football!off! going on out there. NFL: Green Bay
at Miami, Channel 7, 5 p.m. 
TUESDAY 
Some of the Angels' most-memorable moments in Fenway Park: 1)
Losing Game 6 of the 1986 American League Championship Series to
the Red Sox; 2) Losing Game 7 of the 1986 American League
Championship Series to the Red Sox. So, yeah, as far as the Angels
are concerned, go ahead and rip the landmark down before they
return next season. MLB: Angels at Boston, 4:05 p.m., Channel 9. 
WEDNESDAY 
Better than the two-hour finale of ``Survivor'' hosted by Bryant
Gumbel - will someone get too aggressive in the Aggressive In-Line
Skating men's vert competition? The X Games, ESPN2, 7 p.m.
(coverage each weekday on ESPN and ESPN2, ends Saturday on ABC at
noon). 
THURSDAY 
With 12 wins and about eight starts left, Chan Ho Park, who makes
his next scheduled appearance here, has the only real mathematical
shot on the Dodgers' staff to win 20 games. If he doesn't, it'll
mark the 10th straight year the team didn't produce a 20-game
winner - the longest drought in the franchise's 111-year history.
The last Dodger to win 20: Ramon Martinez (20-6) in 1990. MLB:
Montreal at Dodgers, 1:05 p.m., Fox Sports Net. 
FRIDAY 
That catchy phrase that Ernie Banks made famous. Let's see ...
somethin' to do with doubleheaders ... ``Let's all ...'' ... naw
... give us a few minutes here ... MLB: Dodgers at Chicago Cubs
doubleheader, 11:05 a.m., Fox Sports Net 2. 
SATURDAY 
On Aug. 26, college football draws its first breath. If the season
started any earlier, the kids from last year's class could attend.
To mark the occasion, the local department stores in Jacksonville,
Fla., offer the ``Chris Weinke Senior Citizen Discount.'' Pigskin
Classic: Brigham Young at Florida State, Channel 7, 5 p.m. 
SUNDAY 
Penn State's Joe Paterno needs seven wins this season to break the
all-time NCAA record for coaching victories. USC's Paul Hackett
could use 13 wins this season - starting with this one - to keep
the alumni off his back. Kickoff Classic: USC vs. Penn State,
Channel 7, 11:30 a.m.

TOWN THAT LIVES OFF THE SEA MOURNS SUBMARINE DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (With RUSSIA-SUBMARINE)  
 By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia _ In this city that lives off the sea, people
know about disaster. But even here, the tragedy of the sunken
submarine Kursk, which entombed 118 sailors, has rattled residents
and brought a hush to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner of the city where most of the navy staff members
live, residents said they noticed an unusual stillness after
officials said on Saturday _ for the first time since the accident
on Aug. 12 _ that most of the crew on the nuclear-powered submarine
probably had died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood, called Rosta, borders the bay. It is not only
home to many navy people, but also to a navy museum and a submarine
repair factory. Tall grass and bright dots of purple flowers fringe
crumbling cement apartment buildings here. Only a few people were
strolling Sunday afternoon, though the air in this northern city
had warmed since morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so quiet today,'' said Sveta, a 29-year-old mother of
two, wheeling her youngest in a baby carriage. ``We keep thinking
about them, the sailors. The military _ that is the worst
profession. It is bad money and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   She has lived all her life in Murmansk. Her husband works on a
fishing boat that sails mostly in foreign seas, giving the family
access to much sought after foreign currency. She said that her
husband managed to avoid military service, compulsory in Russia,
after he graduated from college six years ago. Their 10-month-old
son, Dmitri, will follow his father's example when he grows up, if
she has anything to say about it, Sveta said.
</P>
<P>
   The navy has had its share of disasters for vessels from this
fleet. Another nuclear-powered submarine, the Komsomolets, sank off
the coast of Norway in 1989, killing 42 members of the crew after a
fire on board raged out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, federal agents stormed a nuclear-powered
submarine and shot a 19-year-old sailor who had killed eight crew
members.
</P>
<P>
   Many have left this region since the Soviet Union collapsed in
1991, mostly to chase higher wages and better job opportunities
farther south. The Murmansk region, which encompasses all of the
Kola peninsula, and is home to 983,000 people, has lost about 15
percent of its population since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the region had one of the highest unemployment rates in
the country according to the state statistics committee. An average
sailor brings home about $85 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the day after the Kursk sailors were declared dead,
residents continued to click on radios and televisions every hour
for the news as the rescue effort dragged on. But Sunday, as they
watched and listened, they seemed numbly resigned to the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Two women behind the counter at the Youth Cafe in central
Murmansk took a break from placing chickens on a roaster to turn on
a radio for news. People in line behind the counter leaned closer
to listen. Few took solace in the fact that foreign rescue crews
began work Sunday. The hospital boat meant for ailing crew members
left for the small town of Vidyavo, where the sailors' families are
staying. It will instead treat anguished relatives.
</P>
<P>
   There were special prayers in the main church in town Sunday.
The Rev. Andrei Amelin, one of the three priests on duty, spoke of
his past service as a navy officer. The 29-year-old priest served
in the navy for 10 years before joining the church three years ago.
The church began holding special services on Monday as soon as news
of the accident spread.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents said that the mysterious submarine disaster
clearly shows that lives mean little here and that the government
in the Kremlin has lost touch with people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shame, a shame before the whole world,'' said Andrei
Lebedev, a 37-year-old engineer who works on a fishing trawler.
``Everyone knows how much they were being paid. Their lives mean
nothing.''

SEARCHING FOR THE PIONEER SPIRIT IN AMERICAN CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  By   MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just a few days ago I came across these lines from a letter
Nietzsche wrote in 1884 about an essay by Ralph Waldo Emerson. He
was having it translated into German, he said, adding this lament:
``I do not know how much I would give if only I could bring it
about,  &UR; ex post facto &LR; , that such a glorious, great nature, rich in
soul and spirit, might have gone through some  &UR; strict &LR;  discipline,
a really  &UR; scientific education &LR; . As it is, in Emerson we have  &UR; lost
a philosopher &LR;  ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Why did this stay with me? Because of Nietzsche's near pity for
the man American scholars and critics deem a founding father of our
literature and thought. Nietzsche is telling his philosopher friend
that Emerson is wonderfully gifted but untrained, even culturally
deprived. And, oh dreary irony, this is just what many academic
champions of Emerson today say when they hold him up to face down
lesser-known works by American writers they consider faddishly
multicultural.
</P>
<P>
   These words also struck me because I had been reading some
Emerson a few months before, and without pretending I could judge
him as a philosopher, I had decided that his prose moved
frustratingly between the glorious, the earnest and the mushy. It's
my belief that pioneers of American literature like Emerson,
Thoreau, Whitman and Hawthorne matter not because of the perfection
of their method (Poe's stories come closest to formal perfection)
but because of their need, given the content of their lives and
imaginations, to invent or alter language and form. To an American
scholar, Emerson is making his way through answers and toward
questions in a form he invents as he goes along. To Nietzsche he
was meandering across ideas, a bit like the White Queen in
``Through the Looking Glass.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of criticism can be depressing or infuriating if you
happen to worship its object. But it's also useful. It shows how
even a radical genius like Nietzsche abided by some of the
standards of his day, standards that will eventually be challenged
or thrown out. We all know how the laudable artistic and
intellectual standards of one age become the limiting conventions
of the next.
</P>
<P>
   Readers and writers of the past _ not just the geniuses, either,
the intelligent, alert ones who kept current as we all like to
think we do _ remind us how culture and taste change. And why. What
aesthetic, social and intellectual needs do beliefs serve in their
time? Which ones serve us now and why?
</P>
<P>
   The United States was just an upstart culture in the Europe of
1884; today it is a world power. Americans have long since produced
their own definitions of the strict discipline and formal
perfection Nietzsche invoked. But I believe (and I'm hardly alone)
that what distinguishes American art in all its variety is
idiosyncrasy, improvisation and a willingness, even at the cost of
imperfection, to break old forms and try new ones.
</P>
<P>
   And I think American critics need to live by the same criteria.
For instance, just what do we mean when we use the phrase ``serious
art'' or ``high art''? Does a minor work by a major composer
(Mozart, say) _ played no more than adequately, in a respected hall
under an unremarkable conductor _ qualify as truly high or serious?
No, I'd say: it's ho-hum entertainment and middlebrow art passing
as high art. The difference between it and a respectable but
unexceptional television show? The Mozart exudes cultural virtue;
you are meant to feel worthier because you paid attention to it. It
might send you back (or forward) to better works and performances
of Mozart. And if you're alert enough to be dissatisfied, the
television show might send you on to to better television, film or
theater.
</P>
<P>
   What are we to make of works that flaunt their highbrow
credentials in a style clearly meant to capture a mass audience?
Consider Harold Bloom's best-selling book ``Shakespeare: The
Invention of the Human.'' (Riverhead). It gives us many, many pages
of educated, entertaining and highly particular observations on the
plays. And then Bloom lards them over with a polemic against all
critics who dare to read Shakespeare with the politics and
ideologies of his age _ and ours _ in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Idiosyncrasy belongs as much to criticism as to art. And on
those grounds I can accept sentences like ``Whether we are male or
female, old or young, Falstaff and Hamlet speak most urgently for
us and to us ... When we are wholly human, and know ourselves, we
become most like either Hamlet or Falstaff.'' But Bloom doesn't
appear to think he is just showing off for us; he calls this
universality. It seems that when an academic wants to become a
star, he must become a vaudevillian, performing so outrageously
that to enjoy his skills we must be able to laugh at his
absurdities.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting how often we critics believe ourselves above
and beyond the fallibilities of artists and audiences. In last
week's New York Observer there was a stern denunciation of the
artist Barbara Kruger and her retrospective show at the Whitney
Museum of American Art. The critic, Hilton Kramer, insisted that
Kruger's satire on cultural greed and pretension, embodied in her
photograph of a Howdy-Doodyish face with the slogan ``When I hear
the word culture I reach for my checkbook'' written on it, was
hypocritical. Why? Because her work is commercially successful.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote: ``We all disapprove of other people's greed, but most
of us don't get paid for saying so.'' The ``most'' is all right,
but the ``us'' is a big problem. Critics get paid regularly for
disapproving of other people's greed, taste, judgment and skill.
And some make more money than many of the artists they (excuse me,
we) judge. What will future readers make of us? It's foolish to
hope they will find us infallible. Let's hope they find us
ferociously curious and eager to be educated again and again.

DREAM SUPREME WINS AND LUKAS CRIES FOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ D.Wayne Lukas was furious after Sunday
afternoon's Grade I Ballerina Handicap. But after watching replays
of the race, the winning trainer, Bill Mott, was not sure why.
</P>
<P>
   With one furlong left in the seven-furlong sprint for fillies
and mares, Mott's Dream Supreme, under the jockey Pat Day, barged
through a tiny hole between Lukas' Cash Run and the race's second
favorite, Bourbon Belle. Cash Run, who appeared to be tiring,
banged off Dream Supreme, then pinballed back toward the rail,
impeding the late run of Honest Lady, the even-money favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Dream Supreme never looked back. The 3-year-old dark bay
daughter of Seeking the Gold and the Dixieland Band mare Spinning
Round powered to a two-and-one-quarter-length victory over Country
Hideaway, who in turn had three-quarters of a length on the
third-place finisher, Bourbon Belle. Honest Lady was another length
and a quarter back in fourth. Cassidy, Cash Run, Tropical Punch,
Debby d'Or and Joana Alegre completed the order of finish.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Lukas claimed foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to let them bang off each other in the stretch,
150 yards from the wire, we've got to know that, so we can turn
them loose and tell them to get a little tougher and run over each
other,'' Lukas said following a long phone conversation with the
stewards after they decided to leave the order of finish unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, whose last 22 starters here have failed to reach the
winner's circle, seemed most upset that the stewards waited until
his claim of foul to launch an inquiry. But the jockeys and other
trainers did not see it the way Lukas did, and felt the problem was
caused by Cash Run, who won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies race
last fall, and not by Dream Supreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cash Run was the filly that caused the traffic trouble, not
us,'' Day said.
</P>
<P>
   After viewing a head-on replay of the race, Mott said: ``It
looked more like Cash Run was looking for a spot to get out of the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey, Honest Lady's jockey, said his horse ``got stopped
pretty cold.'' He said he wasn't sure Honest Lady would have won if
her progress had not been impeded, but he absolved Dream Supreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't think the winner did it,'' Bailey said. ``I
thought the 1 horse'' _ referring to Cash Run _ ``did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, normally poker-faced in defeat, could be seen having a
spirited discussion with Bailey about the race long after it was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's a competitive guy,'' Mott said of Lukas. ``Maybe two
weeks from now, if he looks at it again, maybe he wouldn't make the
same call.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas is having a tough meet. Although the Lukas barn does have
eight seconds and nine thirds, Lukas has saddled only one winner in
34 starts here this summer. Meanwhile, Mott's nine victories for
the meet, in 45 starts, tie him with Mark Hennig for second in the
Saratoga trainer standing, one victory behind Todd Pletcher.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory was the fifth in seven career starts for Dream
Supreme, who is owned by George Steinbrenner's Kinsman Stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The filly ran a huge race today,'' Mott said. ``When Pat
pushed the button, there was plenty of horse there and she had
everyone else at her mercy. I don't really think she cost Cash Run
anything. And Jerry was going up in a tight spot to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Dream Supreme's second in 22 days here. She also
won the Grade I Test for 3-year-olds on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have some reservations about running her in here,
because she is a 3-year-old filly coming back in three weeks,''
Mott said. ``But we started looking at the options and I really
wasn't satisfied with any of the others.''
</P>
<P>
   After Dream Supreme covered the seven furlongs in a lively 1
minute 22.97 seconds, all of Mott's reservations disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Shug McGaughey, the trainer of second-place Country Hideaway,
had a few reservations of his own about the way the race unfolded.
``It would have been nice if they would have changed the numbers,''
said McGaughey, referring to both the stewards and the traffic jam
in the lane. ``But we were not affected by it, so I can't yell and
scream about it.'' &QL;

GORE FINDS HIS OWN GROOVE IN A PLACE CALLED CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOLINE, Ill. _ In the Gore camp, there has been much talk about
the need to gain separation from President Clinton, to set Al Gore
apart as his own man with his own style, message and persona.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, in a most surprising way, Gore took a step toward
doing just that. He did it by becoming more like Clinton, and he
did it best of all in a place called Clinton, a small Iowa town set
back from the banks of the Mississippi River. There, on the lawn of
the county courthouse, Gore put in a performance more reminiscent
of Clinton's two presidential campaigns than of Gore circa 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived hours late, filled his speech with twangy
Southernisms, spoke with a populist passion that had the crowd
roaring, danced with his wife, and then stayed late into the cool
summer night to shake every hand he could reach. Normally not known
to linger at the rope line, Gore plunged again and again toward
knots of onlookers, posing for group photographs, kissing babies,
tweaking a little boy's nose, signing autographs, slapping high
fives _ reveling in the crowd in much the same way Clinton is
famous for doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you with me?'' Gore shouted from the stage. ``Yeah!'' the
crowd yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign sometimes notable for staging events with the
pizazz of a tax seminar, Gore's appearance in Clinton was one of
his most energetic and effective in more than a year of
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goodness, gracious,'' said Mary Ruth Michelson, 70, who
waited four hours for a glimpse of Gore, but never expected
anything quite so lively. ``What on earth has gotten into him?''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his speech, Gore and his wife, Tipper, danced
under a spray of confetti, and they looked so loose and natural
that one grizzled union organizer in the audience wondered whether
the notoriously wooden Gore had undergone a body transplant. By
contrast, Iowa's governor, Tom Vilsack, looked stiff and
uncomfortable _ think of the old Gore _ trying to boogie up on a
stage in front of several thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   Then again Gore had a slight advantage. Before his arrival in
Clinton aboard the Mark Twain riverboat, Gore had been dancing with
gusto during a birthday celebration for his wife on the boat's top
deck. In another echo of Clinton, who was known to cultivate
relationships with journalists during his presidential campaigns,
the Gores invited reporters to join the festivities in a rare
extended off-the-record session.
</P>
<P>
   A Day for Faith and Family
</P>
<P>
   In purely political terms, it may not have been the ideal time
to take a day off from the campaign trail. Just as Gore and his
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, were trying to build momentum
from the Democratic National Convention, just as they were trying
to give their political partnership a memorable national identity,
and right as the campaign held the attention of a large traveling
press corps, Lieberman and his family all but disappeared to
observe the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman dropped off the campaign trail Friday afternoon and
spent much of the next day in seclusion with his family at the
Radisson Hotel in La Crosse, Wis. On Saturday morning, the
Lieberman family attended services at Congregation Son's of
Abraham, the only synagogue in town. In accordance with their
Orthodox faith, which prohibits driving on the Sabbath, the
Liebermans walked the mile and a half from their hotel to the
synagogue. Accompanied by Secret Service agents and a few aides and
reporters, the Liebermans paused along the way to greet residents
who came out of their homes to say hello.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were allowed inside the synagogue, but cameras,
notepads and tape recorders were not welcomed. Lieberman was
invited to read from the Torah, but he avoided making any remarks
that could be construed as overtly political, again in accordance
with his religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, Gore was winding his way down the Mississippi,
delivering forceful, populist stump speeches to thousands of people
in small towns and cities where Lieberman is largely an unknown.
Gore regularly paused to praise Lieberman, but he never felt the
need to explain the reason for Lieberman's absence, a reflection of
his stated desire to incorporate Lieberman's Orthodox practices
into the rhythm of campaigning with as little fanfare as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sabbath is his private time for his faith and his family,
and that's all I'm going to say,'' said Lieberman's campaign press
secretary, Kiki McClean.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides reasoned that regardless the cost of Lieberman
being off the national stage one day every week, many voters will
admire a clear display of commitment to religion above political
ambition. And there was another benefit: On Friday, Lieberman's
voice was raw and hoarse. Sunday morning, when he rejoined Gore in
Moline, his voice was back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for Falling Signs
</P>
<P>
   For those charged with shaping Gore's image, his four-day trip
down the Mississippi has been a feast of useful symbolism. What
better way to convey a politician of mainstream, heartland values
than to put him aboard the Mark Twain riverboat decorated with red,
white and blue bunting?
</P>
<P>
   But even on this tightly scripted journey, events have sometimes
intervened in ways that turned the symbolism upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Take Saturday morning in Dubuque, Iowa, where Gore gave a speech
on a low bluff overlooking the Mississippi. At stage right,
organizers had erected a huge sign that read, ``Gore Iowa 2000.''
Unfortunately, minutes before Gore was to take the stage, the
``Iowa 2000'' part of the sign collapsed to the ground with a thud.

NECE TAKES THE WRITE PATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ryan Nece could return to practice today for the
first time since the middle of last week because of a sore left
shoulder. The linebacker insists the injury isn't writer's cramp.
</P>
<P>
   Nece, beginning in June, has written a bi-monthly column -
Nece's Notes - for UCLA's internet site, uclabruins.fansonly.com,
detailing his summer on and off the field, Q&AMP;A sessions with
teammates and concluding with a biblical quotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a good opportunity to show people what
it's like to be a football player and take people inside the locker
room,'' said Nece, whose writing is earnest if not as saucy as the
seminal ``Ball Four.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans Only, the company that manages all but one of the
Pacific-10 schools' sites, suggested the columns to schools as a
hook to pull in readers during the slow summer months. UCLA sports
information director Marc Dellins thought immediately of Nece.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's well spoken, he's intelligent, he's a starter,'' Dellins
said. ``He's got all the tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Nece writes his column on his own computer, then e-mails it to
Dellins who edits it and forwards it to be posted. Dellins says the
only editing he does is for grammar, though in one column he had to
remove the name of a restaurant Nece praised for its low prices and
good food; NCAA rules prohibit athletes from endorsing products.
</P>
<P>
   Among the subjects Nece has written about are the off-season
conditioning program and his trip to Canton, Ohio, for the
induction of his father, Ronnie Lott, into the NFL Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to be creative,'' Nece said. ``But it's hard to come
up with something new. Sometimes I think, did I write about this
last week? Let me know if you've got any ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   It looks like Paus: Cory Paus did nothing in Saturday's
scrimmage to dispel the notion that he'll start against Alabama.
Paus completed 7 of 10 passes for 184 yards and a touchdown, and
Ryan McCann was 6 of 9 for 155 yards, two touchdowns and one
interception during the nearly two-hour scrimmage before 2,000
donors at Drake Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Toledo could name a starter as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   While the first-team defense looked good against the second-team
offense - it went three series without allowing a first down - the
reserve defenders looked shoddy, giving up a number of big plays.
``I was disappointed in the second group,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Just rewards: A pair of seldom-used, fifth-year seniors, running
back Mike Vanis and defensive tackle Kory Lombard, have been
awarded scholarships. They became available, as did one for
starting safety candidate John Hall, when Julius Williams
(academics), Lovell Houston (transfer) and Santi Hall (quit) left
school last week.
</P>
<P>
   Since all three scholarship recipients are seniors and Houston,
Williams and Santi Hall were underclassmen, the Bruins will have
three more to give next year, bumping their current total to 18.
They've received eight oral commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule: The time for the Oregon State game Oct. 21 has been
set for 3:30 p.m., meaning the Bruins will have just one night game
this year, Sept. 30 against Arizona State.

HAMED A LIGHTNING PUNCHER, NOT JUST A CLOWN PRINCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. _ The punches from the featherweight
champion Naseem Hamed came so fast that even if you were staring at
Hamed's hands, you missed them. One man blindsided by their speed
was Hamed's opponent, Augie Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth round of Hamed's World Boxing Organization
title defense late Saturday night, and Hamed threw a three-punch
connection. Or was it four? With a Hamed fight, replay is a
necessity because the eyes play tricks.
</P>
<P>
   The punches were actually a left, then a right, then a left.
They were enough to end the fight with 2 minutes 34 seconds left in
the round and send Sanchez toward the canvas. Then Hamed threw a
final right for good measure _ a bone-crunching blow that, as it
connected with Sanchez's head, could be heard throughout the arena
at Foxwoods Resort Casino.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez was knocked almost unconscious and, as a precaution,
spent the night at a hospital. A hospital spokeswoman said Sanchez
was released early Sunday morning and was in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   So what is worse? Getting hit by a 250-pound National Football
League linebacker or by a punch from the 126-pound Hamed? Neither
is pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanchez fight showed the two sides of Hamed. He displays
scary punching power, which ranks among the best of the lighter
boxers. That power, along with his speed, is the main reason Hamed
is 35-0 with 31 knockouts and 15 title defenses in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is the meatball Hamed, the showboat who sometimes
sacrifices his boxing skills for showmanship. His entrance to the
fight consisted of chants in Arabic, rap music and dancing. The
only thing missing from Hamed's introduction was Elvis
impersonators. But they were at the fight as well, brought by
Sanchez, who was born in Las Vegas. So Hamed was not the only
showoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez (26-2) got serious once the fight began, while Hamed was
still playing the ham. In the second round, Hamed was knocked down,
though it was ruled a slip by the referee, Michael Ortega. And by
the fourth round, Hamed was bleeding from the mouth and nose and
had a swollen left eye.
</P>
<P>
   Yet each time Hamed was knocked down or hit hard, he would smile
at Sanchez, indicating he was not seriously hurt and displaying a
toughness that complements his boxing skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what other fighters do,'' Hamed said after the
fight, ``but when I get hit and go down, I smile and I say, `I'm
going to hit you harder than you hit me, and I'm going to knock you
out.' The times I go down and get back up _ that's when I'm the
most dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamed is at a critical stage in his career. First, he faces a
mandatory title defense on Nov. 4 against Koko Kovacs, possibly in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Then there could be two big opportunities to increase his
presence in the United States. So far, boxing fans here have not
flocked to watch Hamed.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, Hamed could make his American pay-per-view
debut against the 122-pound Marco Antonio Barrera, a top junior
featherweight. Then in May, Hamed might fight the undefeated Erik
Morales, who would be one of his tougher opponents.
</P>
<P>
   What Hamed is trying to do now is gain more respect from his
critics, many of whom do not rank him among the top 10
featherweights in boxing history despite his record and number of
title defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed also wants to gain more fans in America, but to do so, he
knows he needs to fight better opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed has not demonstrated much maturity in the ring. He often
fools around with his opponents, like a puppy playing with a new
toy, before he finally gets serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will prove myself in America,'' he said. ``I agree that some
of my performances in America, apart from having drama and
excitement, have been a little under my estimation for
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hamed continues to be one of the most exciting
boxers in the sport. With those speedy hands, he can't help but
be. &QL;

 CAMPAIGN AIDES SET STAGE FOR NEXT BIG TEST IN RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A senior adviser to Vice President Al Gore
accused Gov. George W. Bush on Sunday of trying to dodge _ or at
least minimize the impact of _ presidential debates, while one of
Bush's top aides said the governor was ready and willing but was
still mulling over the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George Bush wants to engineer these debates so the
fewest number of people see them,'' said Bob Shrum, the Gore
adviser, on the ABC News program ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrum was referring to the fact that while Bush has pledged to
participate in three debates, he has not agreed specifically to the
three proposed by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential
Debates, which has sponsored all the presidential debates since
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Karen P. Hughes, director of communications for the Bush
campaign, said on the same program that the governor was simply
giving himself time to consider more than 40 debate invitations
from an array of potential sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is committed to debating,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   This inevitable debate over debates, conducted in slightly
raised and sometimes overlapping voices on the Sunday morning talk
shows, was the opening of a new chapter in the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The certain high point of this phase will be the televised,
face-to-face encounters between Gore and Bush. And the weeks
leading to those events are already giving rise to aggressive
public posturing, febrile private negotiations and all-out efforts
from each campaign to make sure its candidate ultimately enters the
arena with just the right build-up.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has been portraying Bush as a neophyte
frightened of any format that requires him to give lengthy answers
and to stray beyond sound bites. Gore's advisers repeatedly note
that Gore has, either formally or informally, agreed to dozens of
debates _ even though such a number is almost logistically
unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign moved to blunt that line of attack late last
week by announcing that Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney,
would agree to a total of five debates _ a ``modern-day record,''
as Hughes put it.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes and other officials with the Bush campaign have also been
talking loudly about what a fierce debater Gore is, a clear attempt
to lower the expectations for Bush to the point where he is
guaranteed to exceed them.
</P>
<P>
   And campaign officials have been busily analyzing and
deconstructing videotapes and transcripts of Gore's debates back to
1988, when he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, a
senior adviser to Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the Republican National Committee, the adviser
said, the Bush campaign has assembled a thick book of research into
Gore's debate performances and has even diagrammed Gore's typical
debate response: an expression of empathy about the issue at hand,
followed by an explanation of the remedy he is offering, followed
by a pointed attack on his opponent's record or proposal.
</P>
<P>
   And the Bush campaign months ago recruited Sen. Judd Gregg,
R-N.H., to prepare for and play the part of Gore in debate
rehearsals. Gregg did the same for Jack Kemp, the Republican vice
presidential nominee in 1996, in advance of his debate with Gore
that year.
</P>
<P>
   The debates have begun to loom larger with the emergence of
signs that the race between Bush and Gore is tightening. A USA
Today-CNN-Gallup poll released Sunday showed Gore moving from a
16-point disadvantage against Bush before the Democratic National
Convention to a one-point advantage after the convention.
</P>
<P>
   That poll, which had a sampling error of plus or minus four
percentage points, reflected interviews on Friday and Saturday with
697 likely voters. It put Gore, who had the support of 47 percent
of respondents, and Bush, with 46 percent, in a four-way contest
with Ralph Nader, with 3 percent, and Pat Buchanan, with 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said Sunday that they had always expected that
Gore would get an enormous bounce immediately after his convention
and that the race would be close to even by about now. They said
that the more meaningful poll results would come around Labor Day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The competing pitches and warring putdowns as aides to Gore and
Bush stormed the television airwaves Sunday morning gave a tidy
preview of the campaign to come.
</P>
<P>
   On the topic of fiscal responsibility, Gore's advisers moved to
defend the amount of spending that the vice president had outlined
in his convention speech, while Bush's advisers defended the size
of the Texas governor's proposed tax cut of $1.3 trillion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign, said on
the NBC program ``Meet the Press'' that Bush, who has yet to offer
a detailed plan for overhauling Medicare or creating a
prescription-drug benefit for the elderly, would be tackling health
care shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said the campaign's budget projections for the next decade
showed that Bush still had ``$900 billion for additional spending
and for deficit reduction'' after his tax cut. ``More than
enough,'' he said, for a program to expand prescription-drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our proposals total up to about $400-and-some-odd
billion thus far,'' said Rove, referring to plans that did not yet
include health care. ``We have close to $500 billion unspent.''
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns also tangled over which party and which
politicians deserved the blame for the unfinished business of the
Clinton administration on issues like Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Daley, the chairman of the Gore campaign, who also
appeared on ``Meet the Press,'' told Rove: ``I would just say that
Newt Gingrich and the Republican leadership in the House and Senate
over the last eight years haven't been exactly willing to work with
President Clinton or Vice President Gore, and that's one of the
reasons why we've had a stalemate on important issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Rove said: ``To some degree, Mr. Daley's right. But
the buck stops on the president's desk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Rove added, ``the vice president claims that he's been
part of every important decision over the last eight years. I can
think of very few more important decisions than what is the tone
with which we're going to approach our relationships with
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ABC program ``This Week,'' Shrum, the Gore aide, said the
Bush campaign was not eager for debates, because Bush did not want
to have a substantive discussion of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes shot back, ``That's just outrageous.''

<P>
   In the continuing battle between Internet companies that want to
use customers' personal information to deliver tailored
advertisements and services and privacy advocates who want stricter
controls over how this information is used, consumers themselves
appear to be of two minds.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the finding of a survey whose results were
released Sunday night by the Pew Research Center for People and the
Press, a nonprofit group. While many consumers surveyed expressed
concern about their privacy, many also said they were willing to
share personal information with the Web sites they used. And many
Internet users in the survey sample indicated that they did not
understand how their online activities were observed and did not
take advantage of tools to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which surveyed 2,117 Americans, 1,017 of whom were
Internet users, found that 86 percent of the Internet users favored
``opt in'' privacy policies, which require Internet companies to
obtain people's permission before using their personal data. This
preference is in contrast to the policy recently negotiated by the
Clinton administration, the Federal Trade Commission and a group of
Internet advertisers, which gives Web sites the right to track
visitors unless those users ``opt out'' of being monitored.
</P>
<P>
   On a similar note, 54 percent of Internet users in the survey
said that the tracking of users by a Web site was harmful because
it invaded their privacy, compared with 27 percent who described it
as helpful because it allowed sites to tailor information to
specific consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And 94 percent of the Internet users agreed that any company
that violated its privacy policy should be disciplined _ with 11
percent of the disciplinarians saying the company's owners should
be sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this hard line, the Pew survey revealed a deep pocket of
trust among Internet users. Slightly more than half said they had
provided personal information to a Web site and an additional 10
percent said they would provide it under the right circumstances.
Only 27 percent said they would never provide a Web site with
personal information. Just less than half _ 48 percent _ said they
had bought something online with a credit card and 22 percent said
they had posted personal information on online calendars or online
address books.
</P>
<P>
   As for efforts to protect their privacy, the survey indicated
that many Internet users were either unaware of how they were being
monitored online or unlikely to take steps to prevent being
tracked. The report noted that 56 percent of Internet users could
not identify the primary online tracking tool _ a ``cookie'' file
placed on a user's computer by a Web site _ and only 10 percent of
the Internet users had set their browser software to reject
cookies.

ARROGANCE OR ESPIONAGE? U.S. CLAIMS AT LOS ALAMOS TRIAL IN
QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Of all the unusual aspects of what is
shaping up to be one of the most important espionage cases of the
post-Cold War era _ the trial here of Wen Ho Lee _ none is more
striking than the fact that it is not an espionage trial at all.
</P>
<P>
   In a 59-count indictment, Lee, a former nuclear scientist at Los
Alamos National Laboratory, is charged with having illegally
downloaded a virtual library of nuclear weapons design and test
data with the intent of harming the United States. It is a crime
that carries a possible life sentence. But the government has
specifically said it will not raise espionage at the trial and has
acknowledged repeatedly that it has no evidence that Lee ever
handed over nuclear secrets to anyone. In their bill of particulars
the prosecutors said that Lee had taken the data to enhance his job
prospects at scientific institutes in countries like France,
Australia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Lee struggled, for the third time since his
arrest in December, to be released on bail from the kind of harsh
prison regimen usually reserved for the most nefarious agents. The
government reported that Lee, held in near-solitary confinement in
Sante Fe, is now unshackled during his recreation time, has greater
access to publications and is given more fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing dragged on for three days in the federal district
court here and was characterized by the government's claims that
Lee's crimes were unprecedented in the history of nuclear weapons
spying; that he was the subject of ``classic PRC tradecraft,'' or
Chinese spying techniques, in a mysterious encounter in Beijing 12
years ago; that he might have altered the global balance of
military power; and that he had compromised the United States'
efforts to build a ballistic missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   George Stamboulidis, an assistant United States attorney drafted
from Long Island to prosecute in the trial, said of Lee's actions,
``It's of a caliber where hundreds of millions of people could be
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The most significant result of the government tactic of
characterizing this as an egregious case of espionage may have been
to make the holes the defense punched in the prosecution's case
appear that much more glaring.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most damaging disclosures, an FBI agent conceded
that the government had no evidence that the letters Lee wrote to
the foreign institutes seeking employment in the early 1990s, found
during a search of his home, were ever mailed.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, Robert Messemer, acknowledged that he had incorrectly
described Lee as having resorted to rank deception when he borrowed
a colleague's computer to download the vast trove of weapons
secrets to portable computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer had said in December, in an exchange with the judge,
James A. Parker, specifically cited in his decision to deny Lee
bail at that time, that Lee had told his colleague that he only
wanted to download a resume, when in fact the colleague had made no
such claim.
</P>
<P>
   But this damaging about-face on claims delivered with confidence
at the last bail hearing provided more evidence that two almost
separate exercises are under way in Lee's case _ one highly
personal, the other a policy debate on the nature of nuclear
proliferation and nuclear security in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   This split was seemingly buttressed by the judge's surprising
public plea to have the lawyers from each side help him sort out
the long and odd list of issues he must resolve before deciding
whether he will agree to release Lee this time. Some of the issues
relate specifically to Lee's credibility, and others relate to the
hypothetical question of whether Lee might still be able to
transfer some of the secret data to a hostile country, and, if so,
whether it would threaten the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question whether Lee did anything wrong _ his
lawyers all but conceded that he had violated at least some rules
on the handling of classified information. But it is not yet clear
whether what he is accused of doing is a crime worthy of a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have been arrogant and he just may have made a stupid
mistake,'' Mark Holscher, one of Lee's lawyers, said in his
summation on Friday, indicating that Lee may have no real defense
for the way in which he downloaded and then handled the data, given
that 7 of the 10 tapes he made are unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that Lee dedicated a great deal of time _
more than 40 hours _ to assembling the secret files, moving them to
an unsecure computer, and then downloading them, but in doing so he
left a lengthy, clumsy paper trail, which he took almost no steps
to cover up. He was even detected during the process, but the
security officer who had monitored the transfer by computer dropped
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue on trial seems to be whether the nuclear test and
bomb feature data that Lee downloaded, is as important as simple
blueprints for constructing bombs, the sort of information
typically prized in traditional spycraft.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, Parker went through some 20 points of concern cited
in his earlier decision, and questioned how many of them should be
re-evaluated light of the new evidence introduced this week, but
gave no indication of when he would make his ruling. And while he
hinted that, at least to some degree, he saw Lee as less devious
now, he also expressed concern about the prospect of the missing
tapes ending up in hostile hands, and how the arcane data might
affect global nuclear policy, a weighty issue for a trial that
supposedly does not concern espionage.

TOWN THAT LIVES OFF THE SEA MOURNS SUBMARINE DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (MAKES ``Peninsula'' upper case in 8th graf; SUBS 9th graf to
correct attribution;   CORRECTS spelling of town name in 11th

 (With RUSSIA-SUBMARINE)

<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia _ In this city that lives off the sea, people
know about disaster. But even here, the tragedy of the sunken
submarine Kursk, which entombed 118 sailors, has rattled residents
and brought a hush to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner of the city where most of the navy staff members
live, residents said they noticed an unusual stillness after
officials said on Saturday _ for the first time since the accident
on Aug. 12 _ that most of the crew on the nuclear-powered submarine
probably had died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood, called Rosta, borders the bay. It is not only
home to many navy people, but also to a navy museum and a submarine
repair factory. Tall grass and bright dots of purple flowers fringe
crumbling cement apartment buildings here. Only a few people were
strolling Sunday afternoon, though the air in this northern city
had warmed since morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so quiet today,'' said Sveta, a 29-year-old mother of
two, wheeling her youngest in a baby carriage. ``We keep thinking
about them, the sailors. The military _ that is the worst
profession. It is bad money and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   She has lived all her life in Murmansk. Her husband works on a
fishing boat that sails mostly in foreign seas, giving the family
access to much sought after foreign currency. She said that her
husband managed to avoid military service, compulsory in Russia,
after he graduated from college six years ago. Their 10-month-old
son, Dmitri, will follow his father's example when he grows up, if
she has anything to say about it, Sveta said.
</P>
<P>
   The navy has had its share of disasters for vessels from this
fleet. Another nuclear-powered submarine, the Komsomolets, sank off
the coast of Norway in 1989, killing 42 members of the crew after a
fire on board raged out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, federal agents stormed a nuclear-powered
submarine and shot a 19-year-old sailor who had killed eight crew
members.
</P>
<P>
   Many have left this region since the Soviet Union collapsed in
1991, mostly to chase higher wages and better job opportunities
farther south. The Murmansk region, which encompasses all of the
Kola Peninsula, and is home to 983,000 people, has lost about 15
percent of its population since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the region had one of the highest unemployment rates in
the country .According to the state statistics committee, an
average sailor brings home about $85 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the day after the Kursk sailors were declared dead,
residents continued to click on radios and televisions every hour
for the news as the rescue effort dragged on. But Sunday, as they
watched and listened, they seemed numbly resigned to the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Two women behind the counter at the Youth Cafe in central
Murmansk took a break from placing chickens on a roaster to turn on
a radio for news. People in line behind the counter leaned closer
to listen. Few took solace in the fact that foreign rescue crews
began work Sunday. The hospital boat meant for ailing crew members
left for the small town of Vedyaevo, where the sailors' families
are staying. It will instead treat anguished relatives.
</P>
<P>
   There were special prayers in the main church in town Sunday.
The Rev. Andrei Amelin, one of the three priests on duty, spoke of
his past service as a navy officer. The 29-year-old priest served
in the navy for 10 years before joining the church three years ago.
The church began holding special services on Monday as soon as news
of the accident spread.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents said that the mysterious submarine disaster
clearly shows that lives mean little here and that the government
in the Kremlin has lost touch with people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shame, a shame before the whole world,'' said Andrei
Lebedev, a 37-year-old engineer who works on a fishing trawler.
``Everyone knows how much they were being paid. Their lives mean
nothing.''

THOMPSON WANTS VARGAS AT HIS BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ross Thompson doesn't get the whole Fernando
Vargas thing. From his perspective, Vargas is exactly average,
``average speed, average power, basically an average fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an easy fight for me, the way I look at it,'' said
Thompson, a 27-year-old from Buffalo, N.Y., who will try to take
Vargas' IBF junior middleweight title on Saturday in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't impress me. He's a decent fighter. I just don't see
nothin' special. I can't understand why people are hyping him up so
big.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he nuts? Nah. He's calculating.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Thompson, once one of the top amateur fighters in the nation
and now the IBF's No. 1 contender, believes what he's saying. He's
convinced Vargas is overrated. However, he also has been eager to
get under the Oxnard resident's skin for practical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to make Vargas angry enough to take him seriously, to
motivate him so when he does the improbable - win the fight - he
will have beaten Vargas at his best.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's how Thompson (24-3-1, with 16 knockouts) has it
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear excuses afterward,'' he said. ``Things
like, 'I wasn't ready when I fought him.' I want him to be up for
this fight. And the only way to do that is get personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make him hate me. I think he fell asleep when he
(barely defeated) Winky Wright. I don't want that to happen. I want
it to be his skill against my skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Thompson, a good boxer, with decent power and an excellent
chin, have enough skill?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the fine Class of `92 among amateurs, which
included Oscar De La Hoya, Shane Mosley, Vernon Forrest and Stevie
Johnston. He failed to qualify for the Barcelona Games and then won
his first 11 bouts, eight by knockout.
</P>
<P>
   However, he lost the only two big fights of his career, 10-round
decisions to James Page and Oba Carr as a welterweight and hasn't
become a significant figure in the sport as a result.
</P>
<P>
   He had a good excuse in the Carr fight, which took place in June
of 1997. He took the fight weeks after the sudden death of his
father, the third member of his immediate family he's had to bury.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Lamar, a promising pro fighter, died in an
accidental drowning in 1987 and his brother Curtis was stabbed to
death a year later. His father died of heart failure at 52.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he doesn't feel he was prepared psychologically or
physically - he hadn't trained consistently after his father died -
to face a fighter of Carr's ability. Still, he lost a split
decision.
</P>
<P>
   He has won his four bouts since then, three by decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard at the time,'' he said of the deaths in his
family. ``It brought the family very close together. And it made me
want to work harder. God left it to me to carry on with boxing in
the family. My brothers and my father were all boxers and they
weren't able to achieve what they wanted to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe someone in the family was meant to do something
special. I think it's my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' response: Apparently, Thompson's strategy is working:
Vargas has taken notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what kind of crack he's been smoking,'' Vargas
said. ``His big mouth has definitely motivated me. I'm always
ready, I always have incentive. I have extra incentive when someone
runs their mouth off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should feel lucky he got a shot at the title. I'm ready to
take this guy out. I want a knockout.''
</P>
<P>
   Think again: For those who are so certain that Evander
Holyfield's victory over John Ruiz was grand larceny, consider
this: 16 of 22 boxing writers who were at ringside had Holyfield
winning (one called it a draw).
</P>
<P>
   These are credible, seasoned boxing writers from all over the
world who are not beholden to promoter Don King, the WBA, Holyfield
or anyone else. They're objective.
</P>
<P>
   So how do we explain the discrepancy among those who were at the
fight and those who watched on TV, who seemed to favor Ruiz?
</P>
<P>
   Simple: Fights often have a different look depending on one's
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Those in ringside seats - sometimes just feet from the action -
have a better perspective. Certainly, they have a better feel for
who is in control of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Those at home are seeing the fight through the lens of a camera
and could miss many nuances that are key to scoring. They also hear
the commentary of television analysts, who could cloud their
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   And at least some of Ruiz's own people seemed to think the
decision was within reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny has the heart of a lion and it overcame him,'' Gabe
Mari, his trainer, told the Detroit Free Press. ``Our plan was to
punch and move. He didn't do it. He did it some, but in a lot of
rounds he wanted to fight the guy. Holyfield made it a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Daily News scored it 115-113 for Ruiz
</P>
<P>
   off television.
</P>
<P>
   Action fight: Kevin Kelley will replace Guty Espadas as Erik
Morales' opponent on Sept. 2 in El Paso, Texas, on HBO. Espadas,
the WBC featherweight champion, somehow broke his collarbone in
training and cannot fight.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley probably won't give Morales the fight Espadas would have.
However, it could be immensely entertaining as long as it lasts:
Both fighters like to bang.
</P>
<P>
   The winner likely will face Espadas.
</P>
<P>
   At 33, Kelley probably won't take part in many more fights with
championship implications.
</P>
<P>
   Diego Corrales defends his junior lightweight title against
Angel Manfredy in another compelling bout on the card.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: The World Boxing Hall of Fame, the West Coast
equivalent of the East's International Boxing Hall of Fame, is
expected to open a museum at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall is collecting memorabilia from its inductees and former
and current world champions. ...
</P>
<P>
   Acelino Freitas of Brazil, one of the more intriguing prospects
in the world, will defend his marginal WBO junior lightweight title
on Showtime's Sept. 23 card in Ontario, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Freitas, whose opponent is yet to be determined, has won all 26
of his bouts by knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the card, Harry Simon will defend his WBO junior
middleweight belt against Rodney Jones.

 &HT;    Stewart, Gordon collide; Wallace wins
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Jeff Gordon threatened last week to put Tony
Stewart ``in the wall'' the next time the two were driving close
together in race. But it was the other way around in Sunday's Pepsi
400, and by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace was the winner at Michigan Speedway. By winning
two of the last four events, Wallace has moved up one position to
fifth in the point standings. He is well within striking distance
of his second Winston Cup championship, 352 points behind leader
Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``The points are definitely on my mind,'' Wallace said. ``I see
myself in the points race until the very end. I just need some of
those other drivers in front of me to have some bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The showdown between Wallace and runner-up Ricky Rudd over the
final 33 laps was exciting, but the fans seemed more enamored by
the incident involving Stewart and Gordon on lap 37. It was the
second race in a row in which the two drivers collided on the
track. After the one last week at Watkins Glen, Stewart and Gordon
engaged in a heated argument in the garage area.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the only public display of emotions was by the crowd.
Both drivers were booed during driver introductions, with Stewart
recieving the louder feedback from the Michigan fans.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty laps into the event, Stewart and Gordon were actually
working together in the draft to move up among the leaders. The
trouble began when Stewart was racing Dale Earnhardt Jr. for second
place.
</P>
<P>
   The two cars appeared to brush against each other approaching
the second turn. Stewart said his car then ``got loose.'' His No.
20 Pontiac turned sideways as it headed toward the outside wall,
clipping Gordon before it reached the barrier.
</P>
<P>
   As Stewart slowly drove his mangled car down pit road to exit
the track, fans applauded his early departure. Similar to Watkins
Glen, Stewart took the blame for the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I crashed a bunch of people that I didn't mean to crash _ it
was my fault, I just flat-out lost it,'' Stewart said calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's No. 24 Chevy was never the same after the wreck. It was
taken to the garage area for extensive repairs. Gordon returned to
the race but dropped out with seven laps remaining to finish 36th.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gordon was disappointed with the outcome, he expressed
no frustration toward Stewart. He made it clear that Sunday's wreck
had nothing to do with the confrontation at Watkins Glen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had been praying a lot lately, but I'm going to
start praying a lot more,'' Gordon said, managing a smile. ``As far
as I'm concerned, we've just got to come back.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ International arms sales surged last year to nearly
$30.3 billion, the highest level since 1996, and the United States
solidified its position as the world's biggest arms dealer,
according to an authoritative government report.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Congressional Research Service, an arm of the
Library of Congress, showed that U.S. contractors sold nearly $11.8
billion in weapons in 1999 _ over a third of the world's total and
more than all European countries combined.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. arms sales, like those worldwide, were still far below the
peaks reached in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War in 1991, but
the United States has steadily increased its sales in the last few
years, from $7.7 billion in 1997 and $10.3 billion in 1998, the
report found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the United States' position has been consolidated as
the leading weapons supplier _ both for the world as a whole and
for the developing countries,'' said Richard F. Grimmett, an
analyst who wrote the report, which is delivered every year to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States remained the largest supplier, Russia
vastly expanded its weapons sales in 1999 _ to $4.8 billion, nearly
double the $2.6 billion in deals it made the year before. With the
impoverished Russian military proving a meager customer, Russia's
military-industrial complex has begun a major effort to market its
wares to Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of Russian sales last year came from an agreement to
sell China 40 to 60 Su-30 fighter jets, while Russia also provided
a number of advanced weapons to India. With many Western nations
more willing to buy weapons from the United States or other NATO
nations, China and India are likely to remain Russia's most
lucrative customers in the years to come, Grimmett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indians are building up their military and the Chinese are
trying to modernize their force structure,'' he said. ``And the
Russians are their major supplier. As long as those two countries
continue to build up, the Russians are likely to increase their
sales in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   China also emerged in 1999 as a major weapons supplier, reaching
agreements to sell $1.9 billion worth of weapons. That was more
than double the $925 million it sold the year before, and the most
since the Congressional Research Service began compiling its report
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The report attributed most of China's increase to relatively
small weapons deals in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, with
Pakistan ``a key Chinese client.''
</P>
<P>
   The report did not give details of China's sales to Pakistan,
but a separate report sent to Congress by the CIA earlier this
month said that China had increased its efforts to provide Pakistan
with ``missile-related technical assistance'' last year. It also
said China had provided similar assistance to Iran, North Korea and
Libya.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, roughly two-thirds of all arms were sold to
developing nations _ and again the United States, with $8.1 billion
in sales, led the way, followed by Russia, with $4.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the hungriest buyers have been countries in the
Middle East, led by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, however, South Africa emerged as the leading buyer in
the developing world, reaching agreement for $3.3 billion in weapon
purchases, according to the report. Much of that was driven by the
government's agreement with Germany to buy four patrol corvettes
and three diesel-electric submarines, the report said, a purchase
that was criticized by some South Africans as too costly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report predicted intensifying competition among arms
supplies in the years ahead. Many countries, eager to protect their
own defense industries, are less likely to turn to the
international market, while the lingering impact of the Asian
financial crisis of 1997 could mean still fewer buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The report said, however, that those trends enhanced the United
States' advantage over other international sellers, since previous
U.S. sales resulted in new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few big sales out there,'' Grimmett said, ``but
for the last 25 years we've developed relationships with so many
countries that now, even though it's a very difficult market, we
have a competitive advantage in selling spare parts and support
services.''

NEW YORK CITY IS BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO CANCER-DIAGNOSIS STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City is about to become the largest
contributor to a broad medical study to determine the effectiveness
of an experimental X-ray screening test for diagnosing and treating
the early stages of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The city's contribution of $4 million will come from its share
of the settlement cigarette manufacturers reached with New York
state and other states as compensation for the treatment of
smoking-related illnesses among Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   The study will be the first large-scale look at how effectively
a new generation of X-ray machines, known as spiral CT scanners,
can spot lung tumors that are too small to be seen with a
conventional chest X-ray, said Dr. Maria Mitchell, president of
Academic Medicine Development Co., a nonprofit consortium of 35
academic health centers, research institutions and medical schools
coordinating the statewide project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to determine whether or not this is an effective
screening device in finding early-stage cancers, and whether or not
there are effective interventions at an early stage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year project is to involve as many as 10,000 men and
women 55 or older, most of them from New York City, who smoked on
average a pack of cigarettes a day for 10 years or longer, Mitchell
said. Each participant will receive at least two CT scans, which
normally cost $300 to $700 and are not covered by most health
insurance plans. Participation is free.
</P>
<P>
   In search of the $9.7 million needed to finance the study,
Mitchell and the deans of several of the city's medical school
wrote to Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles, a senior adviser to Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, and in January the doctors met with the mayor to
outline their project, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor was supportive,'' Coles said. ``The object of the
program is to help as many people as we can to survive lung cancer.
I think it's going to save many, many lives in New York City.''

SPANISH-LANGUAGE TV IS ATTRACTING MORE VIEWERS, AND DRAWING MORE
CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On any given Saturday night, a television host known as Don
Francisco holds sway in hundreds of thousands of American homes for
four straight hours with a throwback to American variety shows of
the 1950s, and more. The Miami-based television show ``Sabado
Gigante'' (Giant Saturday) grabs viewers with a mix of musical
performances, contests, comedy, interviews and audience
sing-alongs.
</P>
<P>
   On weeknights, millions of viewers tune in to ``telenovelas,''
the short soap operas with rags-to-riches plots. The genre has been
spiced up considerably this year with the addition of ``Xica'' from
Brazil, which features nudity and a love story between a willful
slave and her former master.
</P>
<P>
   And on weekdays, there is ``Laura en America,'' a Peruvian talk
show where Jerry Springer meets Mother Teresa. The hostess, Laura
Bozzo, is a legal scholar and women's rights advocate who is also
known as the Eva Peron of Peru for creating a foundation to help
the poor and unfortunate, many of whom appear on her show to slap
and shove each other.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the fastest-growing television audience in the
nation watches on Univision Television Network and Telemundo
Network Group, the two Spanish-language networks. In major markets
like New York, the Univision affiliates now outperform some
English-language broadcast stations in the Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The high ratings reflect the steady growth of Latinos in this
country, now estimated to be about 32 million, but as they draw
more viewers, Univision and Telemundo are drawing more criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic organizations boycotted the four big English-language
networks last year for the scarcity of Latinos in television and
got a few commitments to increased diversity. Now, some of the same
groups are pressuring the two Spanish-language networks to address
concerns like the invisibility of dark-skinned Latinos on and off
the air and the preponderance of imported programming that all but
ignores Latinos in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The viewership is fighting many different barriers to equality
in this country and I think one is entitled to expect a little
better from these folks given that reality,'' said Juan Figueroa,
president and general counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and
Education Fund in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Univision, which dwarfs Telemundo by capturing about 80 percent
of the Spanish-language television audience in the United States,
is the fifth-most-watched television network in the nation, after
NBC, Fox, ABC and CBS. But while the Big Four have been bleeding
viewers, Univision has been gaining hundreds of thousands of them.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the Spanish-language programs are essentially
versions of the popular English language formats: the talk show
``Cristina,'' the tabloid show ``Primer Impacto'' (``First
Impact'') and the early morning show ``Despierta America'' (``Wake
Up America''). But newscasts on Spanish-language television, for
which Univision has won two Emmy Awards, offer more coverage of
Latin America and Latinos in this country than anything available
in English.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike the major networks, Univision and Telemundo anchor
their prime time on ``telenovelas,'' offering a block of three,
four and even five in a row on weeknights.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers, it seems, cannot get enough of them. Of the 20 top
rated shows in Spanish nationally, 15 are telenovelas, Nielsen
figures in early August showed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the English-language soaps, which can last generations,
telenovelas typically wrap up their tortuous plot lines in less
than a year and thus offer a beginning, middle and end.
</P>
<P>
   Hernan Velez, 40, a truck driver from Queens, N.Y., who is a fan
of ``Xica,'' said he watches it as an escape. ``It's a way to
forget about work,'' he said. ``I just relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Many young Latinas who list shows like ``The West Wing'' and
``Sex and the City'' as favorites somehow find themselves
hopelessly addicted to telenovelas, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say I won't watch the one that's getting started but
I do and I get hooked,'' said Yesenia De Avila, 28, an
entertainment editor at the magazine Latina, who was born in the
United States to Colombian and Honduran parents.
</P>
<P>
   She even admits to clicking on ``Sabado Gigante'' on a slow
Saturday; she said most of her Hispanic friends who were born in
the States find the show ``cheesy,'' but she cannot resist it.
</P>
<P>
   But not all viewers are happy with their choices. Many are
rankled by the dominance of programming from Mexico, Venezuela and
elsewhere in Latin America that has little to do with the lives of
people in this country. Critics say that Spanish television should
play a larger role in familiarizing immigrants with the American
way of life and to link Latinos of different nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   But the only original sitcom or drama currently dealing with the
Latino experience in the United States on Spanish television is
Telemundo's ``Los Beltran,'' which is set in Burbank, Calif., and
features a first-generation Cuban-American family with a daughter
married to a Mexican-American and with a gay couple as neighbors.
(Both Univision and Telemundo have announced two new original
sitcoms for the fall season based on Hispanics living in the United
States.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet Alex Nogales, president of the National Hispanic Media
Coalition, a watchdog group, points out that this country is full
of story lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about a Mexican-American man who meets an immigrant woman
and the clashes of culture?'' he said, naming one. ``They're not
doing enough programs that take into consideration the culture, the
education and legal institutions that are here.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say the networks buy foreign shows because they
are cheaper than creating new ones and because people watch them.
Telemundo officials, who said they import 60 percent of their
programming, said that not only do many Latin American countries
have television industries that produce quality programming, but
that the foreign product is also widely accepted in the United
States because of the multinational makeup of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Accents, for instance, are not the big issue for Hispanic
viewers that they are for most English-speaking Americans, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NBC could produce novelas in Ireland that would work in the
United States for a third of the cost, they would do it,'' said
Joaquin F. Blaya, a former president and director of both Univision
and Telemundo who is now chairman and chief executive of Radio
Unica Communications, a national Spanish-language radio network.
</P>
<P>
   But Univision and Telemundo viewers often get a dose of
old-fashioned sexism, racism and stereotypes. The telenovelas, for
instance, have had the tendency to stick women to the traditional
role of mothers or ``Cinderella,'' as in poor young girls whose
only goal in life is to bag the upper-class leading man. Gay men
are often depicted as caricatures. And servile roles are usually
reserved for black, indigenous and dark-skinned actors.
</P>
<P>
   And the stars are so white and blond, critics like Figueroa
said, that they seem to hail from Eastern Europe rather than
Hispanic countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the Mexican novelas and you compare them to the
Mexican people you see in New York, you'd think they were from two
different Mexicos,'' agreed Charlotte Castillo, 28, a colleague of
De Avila at Latina magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike De Avila, Castillo said she seldom watches Spanish
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like `E.R.,' `The Practice,' `Once and Again,''' she said.
``You don't find these types of programs on Spanish-language
television. I don't think it's very smart. Spanish-language
television is like a decade behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Telemundo's ``Xica,'' a telenovela from Brazil that broke
with tradition by having a black woman as its star, is too
unpalatable for some viewers. Loosely based on the true story of
the Brazilian slave Xica da Silva, who won her freedom and rose to
a position of power thanks to her wit and wiles, the drama, which
is dubbed in Spanish, stands out for the nude scenes (albeit in
blurred, censored images) involving Xica and the other slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, as a black woman you're seen as an object of
oversexuality,'' said Evelyne Laurent-Perrault, a founder of
Encounters, Inc., an East Coast group of black Latinos that
advocates racial inclusion. ``To me it isn't any improvement of
television.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also complaints that some Hispanic groups are
underrepresented on Univision and Telemundo. Marco Camacho is
president and chief executive of Hispanic Television Media Network,
a network begun from Texas this year to focus on Mexican-American
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho noted that Mexican-Americans account for more than 60
percent of the nation's Hispanic population but are a minority
among the hosts and actors in productions made in the United
States, which come mostly from Miami, where Univision and Telemundo
have their studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican market doesn't have the same likes and dislikes as
the Cuban or Puerto Rican markets,'' he said. ``They want to hear
jokes that they can understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the National Hispanic Media Coalition in New York and
Los Angeles said that over the last year they had met several times
with Henry G. Cisneros, Univision's president until he resigned
this month to form a housing company, to voice their concerns. With
revenues approaching $1 billion a year, critics said, it is time
for Univision to produce more of its own programs, or at least have
more say in what is produced abroad, and deal with the issue of
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Univision's chairman and chief executive, A. Jerrold Perenchio,
does not give interviews and forbids network officials to do so, a
policy cited by the network's publicists for declining requests for
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   James McNamara, Telemundo's president and chief executive, said
his network would have more original productions as its target
audience _ Latinos from 18 to 49 who speak only or mostly Spanish
or who are bilingual _ grew. But McNamara said Telemundo needed to
compete ``head on'' with Univision by offering telenovelas and
other imported programming.
</P>
<P>
   Nely Galan, producer of ``Los Beltran,'' said that the time had
also come to put the onus on the viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Galan said she had counted herself among the networks' critics
until she became Telemundo's president of entertainment in 1998 and
got ``a reality check.'' At that time Telemundo took the
telenovelas off the prime-time lineup to experiment with new
programming like documentaries and original productions.
</P>
<P>
   By August 1999, the telenovelas were back and most of the new
shows were out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the demand is not as high as you'd think for
original productions,'' said Galan, who noted that ``Los Beltran''
survived but that its audience was slow to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos are used to watching the same things,'' she said.
``It's time to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Galan said Spanish-language programming was bound to improve as
English-language television started mining the bilingual market
with shows like Showtime's ``Resurrection Boulevard.'' But she said
competition can only do so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have to make people understand the power they have
as viewers,'' she said.

NUMBERS DO NOT ADD UP FOR SMITH AND THE JETS SUBTRACT HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The ominous signs had been piling up during
training camp for cornerback Otis Smith. He was coming back from an
injured clavicle that was broken twice last season _ the first time
during training camp and the second time in the first game after he
returned from the original injury.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, the secondary had solidified and Smith, who
entered camp last season as a starter, dropped during this camp to
the fifth cornerback on the depth chart, behind even the rookie
Tony Scott. Most critically, his salary cap number, $1.2 million,
was enormous for a backup who would turn 35 during the season. And
the Jets got his number wrong in the media guide.
</P>
<P>
   The ax finally fell for Smith Sunday, when the Jets waived eight
players, cutting their roster to 62 before Tuesday's deadline for
the 65-man roster. The Jets must slim down to 53 players by Aug.
27.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, an 11-year veteran who was in his sixth straight training
camp with the Jets, was the most notable player cut loose, although
his departure was not unexpected. Still, the departure of Smith,
who was on Bill Parcells' New England team that went to the Super
Bowl, had the deepest reverberations. Coach Al Groh said that
Smith's large salary cap number was a factor in the decision.
Scott, a sixth-round pick, will make just $193,000 this season, and
he counts just $217,000 against the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otis has been a very important part of what we've done both
here and in New England,'' Groh said. ``I respect a great deal what
he's done for us. He's a consummate professional playing on the
corner. We just felt at this point, we were going to go in a
different direction. The same cycle that brings players into the
league eventually carries them out. Almost every player on the
team, when he came into the league, somebody had the job he took.
Eventually, it comes back around at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has played in 109 regular season games, joined the
Jets as a free agent in 1995. Smith was waived by the Jets early in
the 1996 season and signed by New England. In the Patriots' playoff
victory over Jacksonville, Smith scooped up a fumble and returned
the ball 47 yards for the game-deciding touchdown. He re-signed
with the Jets before the 1997 season and started all 33 regular
season games he was in uniform for. Smith also was a well-liked
leader in the locker room and grew particularly close to Marcus
Coleman, whom he helped tutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been through everything,'' Coleman said. ``The highest of
the highs and the lowest of the lows. He was like my big brother,
to be honest. It's like losing a brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is likely to surface elsewhere, perhaps back in New
England with Bill Belichick, who was Smith's coach for the Patriots
and Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll probably be picked up tomorrow,'' Coleman said. ``You
only last that long if you've been doing something. I don't care
where he goes. I just want him to be somewhere, to be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The others waived were the third year linebacker Casey Dailey, a
fifth round pick in the 1998 draft; the second year tackle Ian
Rafferty, who was rendered expendable by Jumbo Elliott's return
from retirement; wide receiver Fred Coleman, a 1999 practice squad
member who had little opportunity to compete in the crowded wide
receiver field; defensive tackle Richard Seals, the Jets' seventh
round draft choice who missed much of camp with an arm injury, and
linebacker Brent Naccara, fullback Mike Stack and linebacker Kelvin
Moses, all rookie free agents. Groh said none of them are likely to
be brought back for the five-man practice squad.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Recently I awoke early with butterflies in my stomach. I put on
a sport jacket and tie and got on the subway. I looked around at
the clothing of the men and women making their way to work,
wondering where they were headed and what awaited them at their
destination.
</P>
<P>
   As I scanned the crowd, I became fixated with my own reflection
in the window of the car. I began to scrutinize myself in my
makeshift mirror. Did I get a good shave today? Is the part in my
hair straight? What is that red dot emerging on my forehead?
</P>
<P>
   After the fifth or sixth time I adjusted my tie, the woman next
to me gave me a warm smile and said, ``You look fine.'' Somewhat
shocked, but mostly embarrassed, I managed to get out the words
``It's my first day.'' Her face broke out in a grin indicating that
she had been in the same situation once herself and that she
understood my case of nerves. She didn't say another word, but it
was comforting to know I was not alone in my anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   As I arrived at the door to my new job, I paused, took a few
deep breaths, thought about what she had said, and only checked
myself briefly before embarking on my newest adventure.

   Arline Julius, who is in her 70s, was at the ticket window of a
Long Island Rail Road station asking for a ticket to New York. The
clerk looked blank. She amended the request to ``one way to Penn
Station.'' Still no response.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming increasingly perplexed, she next tried ``to
Manhattan.'' This time she added that she would like the
senior-citizen rate. The clerk smiled and handed over a ticket, and
she realized what he had been waiting for. ``Why didn't you remind
me?'' she asked. ``I keep out of trouble this way,'' he replied.

   During OpSail 2000, I visited the tall ships docked near the
Intrepid museum on my lunch break. Perhaps the most memorable
moment, and one that demonstrates the good will of New Yorkers,
came during my walk back along 43rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   An older gentleman, looking somewhat anxious, appeared next to
me and asked for directions to a subway station. Clutched in a
grimy hand, he had a number of belts like those one would see under
a car's hood. I provided directions, was thanked profusely and then
received a hurried explanation that brightened the rest of my day.
</P>
<P>
   The man had been visiting the Romanian tall ship and overheard
sailors expressing concern about some damaged and badly needed
engine part. He had taken it upon himself not only to investigate
the problem but to locate the part, a rather specialized engine
belt, in Queens. He was heading for the subway to take him there.
</P>
<P>
   My look of surprise prompted him to remind me, in no uncertain
terms, that the Romanians were our guests and that New York City
knows how to treat guests.

   Richard Harbert spotted an apparently homeless man sitting atop
a shopping cart that was loaded with an array of bulging plastic

sidewalk. The man wasn't the usual panhandler. There was no cup in
sight; he simply held up a brown corrugated cardboard sign that
read ``TELL ME OFF FOR $2.''
</P>

   Harbert said he was tempted for a moment, but he was in too good
a mood to take advantage of the offer.

TORRE ACCENTUATES THE POSITIVE AFTER LATEST YANKEE DEBACLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Torre can share his unedited emotions with the
world every day to condemn, confront or blame, as manager of the
Yankees. But he seems to sift carefully through his thoughts, to
identify the most presentable, and he might have required a giant
mental colander after the Yankees gave away another game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led Anaheim, 3-0, when Torre replaced David Cone
after six innings Sunday. The bullpen allowed four runs in the
seventh and another in the eighth and was responsible for a 5-4
loss at Yankee Stadium, the second time in three days the Yankees'
bullpen blew a sizable lead.
</P>
<P>
   Torre plaintively answered questions afterward. He reiterated
how excited he is about how Cone is pitching now; what Torre did
not say, as his decisions indicated, is that his confidence in Cone
is not restored fully. Torre mentioned again how important reliever
Jeff Nelson is to the bullpen, and how he expects Nelson will work
through his recent inconsistency; he did not elaborate on Nelson's
unhappy response to being taken out Sunday, or how he intends to
address Nelson's mounting frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Torre has credited the bullpen time and again for much of the
Yankees' success this season. He did not offer the reality that
right now, his middle relief is something of a mess, and somewhat
responsible for the Yankees' inability to pad their slender lead in
the American League East. They are 5-5 in their past 10 games,
playing mediocre teams in the Rangers and the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate,'' Torre said of Sunday's loss, ``but it's
not that we're going to do anything different. We'll still send
those guys out there.''
</P>
<P>
   They probably should have walked away from this four-game series
with Anaheim with four victories. They could have beaten the Angels
Friday, if they had not blown a five-run lead in the ninth inning _
only the second time the Yankees had done that in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   They could have added a fitting finish Sunday, Whitey Ford Day.
The Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who takes these sorts of
events seriously, was in the clubhouse for the first time in weeks
and greeted most of his team's most recent acquisitions by
extending a handshake and a slap on the shoulder _ David Justice
and Jose Canseco and Glenallen Hill _ and spoke glowingly of what
they had added to the team. ``How could anyone debate that?''
Steinbrenner said rhetorically. ``What they've done is
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was touched by his ceremony, shook hands with Cone before
throwing out the first ball, and Cone pitched well, changing
speeds, striking out the side in the first inning. He fell behind
in the count at times, but did not allow a hit until the fourth.
Clay Bellinger, filling in for the injured center fielder, twice
drew walks and scored on run-scoring hits by Luis Sojo. The Yankees
led, 3-0, after five, although they could have had at least one
more; Sojo had run through the stop sign raised by the third base
coach Willie Randolph and was thrown out at the plate in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Cone threw 79 pitches in the first five innings, and after
Orlando Palmeiro singled with one out in the sixth, the interim
pitching coach Billy Connors visited the mound. Cone appeared
annoyed by this, turning his head with exasperation when he saw
Connors and relievers warming up in the bullpen. He had allowed two
hits and a walk to that point and knew he was on the verge of being
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Cone had 96 pitches after six innings and with the left-handed
slugger Mo Vaughn scheduled to lead off the seventh, Torre _
intending generally to replace him at about 110 pitches _ decided
to replace him. Cone lobbied to stay in the game, ``for the first
time in a long time,'' without success.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's ``response to me was, `You're starting to crawl now and
you're breaking into a jog and you're on your way. Let's take the
positive and I'm going to get you out of there,''' Cone said.
``Sure, maybe there is a little bit of a mixed message there. But
Joe has his reasons and I'm not going to second-guess him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton took over in the seventh, walked Vaughn and allowed
a two-run homer to Tim Salmon. Two batters, two runs. After Garret
Anderson grounded out, Nelson relieved Stanton and walked Troy
Glaus on four pitches _ the eighth time in Nelson's past 13
appearances he has allowed a walk or a hit to the first batter he
faced.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus stole second easily, taking advantage of Nelson's big leg
kick. Nelson whiffed Bengie Molina, but Adam Kennedy poked a
grounder inside the third base line, Glaus scored the tying run,
and the booing was loud and pointed.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitter Kevin Stocker was scheduled to bat next, and
Torre preferred to force Stocker to bat from his weaker side, as a
right-handed batter; he also was wary of Kennedy swiping second. So
Torre called on the left-handed rookie Randy Choate. Nelson said
something to Torre before he left the mound, an expression of
unhappiness. Nelson explained afterward that he feels he should be
used more, that this would give him a better chance of sorting
through his recent wildness.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was asked if he feels Torre has lost confidence in him.
``I don't know _ it doesn't bother me if he does or not,'' Nelson
said. ``I mean, who else is he going to go to? I think I've been
one of the most consistent guys down there, so if that's the case,
then we're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Choate threw to first once, driving Kennedy back to the base,
but word is out that Choate has trouble holding runners. Kennedy
stole second uncontested, and when Stocker fought off a good pitch
and flipped a blooper over Sojo's head, Kennedy scored.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden allowed a run in the eighth, and Anaheim led, 5-3,
negating the solo homer hit by Hill in the bottom of the inning,
Hill's 10th in only 51 at-bats for the Yankees. The Yankees had a
couple of runners on base with two out in the bottom of the ninth,
but Paul O'Neill lined to left to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have benefited from the most significant midseason
makeover in the history of baseball, and almost every player they
have added has made major contributions. But check Monday's
standing: The patchwork Boston Red Sox are only a few good days
away from overtaking the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Torre may or may not be concerned about the Red Sox, about
Nelson, about his middle relief. He sees the big picture and says
good things. &QL;

 &HT;    Tiger pulls it off
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The world of Tiger Woods didn't come tumbling
down Sunday, but the foundation got a good shaking.
</P>
<P>
   It came from a most unlikely source, a journeyman player who had
to leave for another continent to find his game. Bob May himself
was a teen-age prodigy, like Woods, youngest player to qualify for
a PGA Tour event _ the Los Angeles Open when he was 16.
</P>
<P>
   All is known of Tiger, who was last seen with a smile a yard
wide, cuddling the Wanamaker Trophy, a bauble that usually gets
lost in the foderol of the PGA Championship, for which it stands.
But who is this Bob May, who came within a stroke of the upset of
the year, who rattled Woods' cage, and who put pressure on him
where the Big Guns had failed, Els, Love, Duval, Montgomerie,
Mickelson and that high-powered lot?
</P>
<P>
   Peculiar as it May seem, Bob May grew up on a similar hotshot
level as Woods in Southern California. He was the hottest amateur
in that part of the land, but his career never took off like
Woods'. He played on the NCAA championship team at Oklahoma State.
He played on the Walker Cup team in 1991_ with Phil Mickelson,
David Duval and Franklin Langham. But after he turned pro, he never
built on it.
</P>
<P>
   He held a PGA Tour card for a year, but lost it and took off for
the European Tour, and there played for four years. When his
earnings hit a peak over there and he won the British Masters last
year, he decided it was time to bring his game home. He made it
back to the tour, finishing 13th in qualifying school and has made
himself at home. He barely missed winning the Open at Memphis and
his earnings were just short of half-million coming in to Valhalla.
And he came here directly from England, where he'd returned to
defend his British Masters title. He finished fifth. He is still
listed in the PGA Tour Guide under ``Other Prominent Players.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, to come face to face with the child prodigy who wiped out
all his amateur records in California. ``I was 16, playing 18 holes
when Tiger was nine, playing nine holes. As he grew up I kept
reading that he was shooting for Bob May's records, and he shot for
them and he got them.
</P>
<P>
   So here they were. On the surface, it was a heavily titled
mismatch. ``Last night I played all the holes in my sleep. I really
slept well, but when I woke up I'd played 18 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then when Tiger teed off and he hit his first drove over those
trees on the first hole, I knew I was in for a long day.''
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth hole, lo and behold, May had a two-stroke lead.
Going into the 17th hole he still led by a stroke, but this was
about to change. May reached the green in two out of the thick
stuff, but had a cross-country putt to save par, and did, but Woods
rolled a birdie in on top of him and they were tied.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open, the British Open, they were cake-walks for Woods.
He was never pressed. It was in this 82nd PGA Championship that the
24-year-old felt real heat. May was carving out his third round of
66 in a row, ``and when you shoot three 66s, you ought to win a
major championship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But all this did was bring out the tiger in Woods. In the
three-hole playoff, a new PGA of America gimmick _ and one much
worthier than sudden death _ Woods birdied the 16th hole, but it
still wasn't over. It was a dogfight to the last two-foot putt he
sank for a half, and victory on the oddly-shaped 18th green. He
came out of woods, out of tall grass, out of sand. He was called on
to use every shot in his bag to win by a hairy stroke. May's last
desperate putt barely missed the cup by two inches.
</P>
<P>
   Now Woods has mounted the pedestal. He has his three majors this
year. He has won two PGA Championships in a row, first since the
long-gone Dinny Shute of the `30s. He has created his own
particular kind of universe, and there reigns supreme. He is open
to all challengers, and only Bob May, the least of the suspects,
has been gutty enough to bring the fight to him.

CAN THE TROJANS HACK IT?

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Preseason college football polls are like bad
haircuts. Not only are they embarrassing, but you gotta wait at
least a month to see if they shape up.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, they're just a tease.
</P>
<P>
   Which seems to be why, faced year after year with high falootin'
expectations, USC ends up looking like it's been attacked by a
Flo-be.
</P>
<P>
   It's no different in 2000. The Sporting News' pigskin preview
edition, for example, has the Trojans rumblin' through a 12-0
season and stumblin' to a No. 4 ranking, heading to the Rose Bowl
and ...
</P>
<P>
   Awwwwright, where do they get off with !ital!that kinda
prediction? Can't they wait until after the Penn State game?
</P>
<P>
   --On the field, the Trojans do have the horses.
</P>
<P>
   But on the sidelines, a reason for realistic optimism this time
might be in who coach Paul Hackett has assigned to saddle 'em up.
</P>
<P>
   It started with canning high-profile QB coach Ken O'Brien and
shifting offensive coordinator/running backs coach Hue Jackson
over. Finally, Hackett and Jackson are on the same page with Carson
Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   To finish that move, in came Kennedy Pola, a no-nonsense former
Trojans fullback, to toughen up the running game - keying on Sultan
McCullough.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Morton, with 25 years coaching experience, was shifted
from tight ends coach to the offensive line, the position he
handled at the University of Washington for seven seasons. The
tight end spot was filled by 26-year-old Brian Schottenheimer, son
of Marty.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's A.J. Christoff, hired last February to work with
the linebackers, bringing in 27 years experience from places like
Colorado, Notre Dame, Alabama, Georgia Tech, Stanford, Oregon and -
egads, even five years with UCLA's secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, another 25-year coaching vet, Dan Farrigno, is on for
special teams and wide receivers. He's already got kicker David
Newbury comfortable going back to his old style.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for those who've seen the staff work with the players the
past few weeks in Irvine, it's been pretty impressive. Enough to
make some more lofty predictions?
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way, if you're worried about another terrible
Trojans trim to start the season, just think of it as a favorable
bowl cut. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Forget Tiger Woods' made-for-TV event a week from today
against Sergio Garcia. Just replay the last five holes from
Sunday's PGA Championship. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Actor Joe Pesci and radio personality Rick Dees, who once were
financial backers for Tiger chaser Bob May, will be releasing their
stock tips this morning. ...
</P>
<P>
   --By Wednesday, we'll know how serious Tom Lasorda is about
adding Orel Hershiser to the U.S. Olympic team. That's the day when
the team is supposed to be officially announced. ...
</P>
<P>
   --The IMAX flick ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' has already
generated more than $10 million in box office revenue since its
release in May.
</P>
<P>
   With today's ticket prices, that translates to about 400 paying
customers. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Did ya notice a horse named Sickly finished last in Saturday's
Arlington Million? ...
</P>
<P>
   --And there's an Arizona State psychology professor who
professes that, while many of us assume die-hard sports fans are
lonely, pathetic sorts in search of some self-esteem, just the
opposite is the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes possible to attain some sort of respect and regard
not by one's own achievements but by one's connection to
individuals of attainment,'' said Robert Cialdini in a recent New
York Times story.
</P>
<P>
   So, in other words, a true sports fan will always see the
bandwagon as half full.

 &HT;    And the winner is - Woods!
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ After proving at both the U.S. Open and
British Open that he could blow away his opponents in laughable
fashion, Tiger Woods won one the hard way Sunday at Valhalla Golf
Club.
</P>
<P>
   The Ernie Els's, the Davis Love's and the Phil Mickelson's of
the golf world couldn't get Woods to notice them all summer, but
little known Bob May, the world's 48th-ranked player, pushed the
world's No. 1 as far as possible.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond that, if May could have found a fairway or two late
in the day, indeed it might it have been him kissing the Wanamaker
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was Woods. Again. But this time with drama totally
missing at Pebble Beach and St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   After 72 holes of sweating, pressure-packed regulation play and
three playoff holes, the 24-year-old Woods secured a second
straight PGA Championship title Sunday, capturing three majors in a
season for the first time since Ben Hogan in 1953. He also became
the first player to win back-to-back PGA title since Denny Shute in
1936-37.
</P>
<P>
   Woods will be trying for a three-peat next August at the Atlanta
Athletic Club in the 2001 PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   After both Woods and May tied at 18-under 270 for 72 holes,
establishing a new PGA Championship scoring record, Woods
eventually wrestled away a win, 13-12, for the three playoff holes,
just implemented into the tournament's format this week. Woods'
25-foot birdie putt at the 16th hole to start the playoff emerged
as the difference. Just before, May had miraculously placed a
50-yard shot from the rough to six inches to clinch a par.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who now holds the scoring record in all four majors,
clinched the championship at the 18th green, blasting to a foot
from the right greenside bunker after May's 35-footer up the ridge
on the treacherous, tired green just missed by inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one memorable battle today,'' Woods said. ``I think
it's got to go down as one of the best duels in a major
championship. I enjoyed it and I'm sure Bob did, too. It was a very
special day. . . Both of us shot 31 on the back nine. I played the
last 12 holes in 12-under. Not too bad. . . It was
birdie-for-birdie, shot for shot _ going right at each other.
That's as much fun as it gets right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Denmark's Thomas Bjorn finished third with a 68 at 13-under 275.
Stuart Appleby (69) and Greg Chalmers of Australia (69) tied for
fourth at 276, along with Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal (69).
</P>
<P>
   Woods earned $900,000 for the win _ his fifth pro major
championship and fourth of the last five _ and pushed his 2000
earnings to $6,692,821, raising the possibility of a $10 million
season with three first prizes in the $1 million range remaining,
including Nov. 2-5 in the Tour Championship at Atlanta's East Lake
Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   The win merely added to a growing domination that is unmatched
in the sport. It was Woods' 15th win in his last 28 official
events. For his career, he's 20-2 when he's held at least a share
of the 54-hole lead.
</P>
<P>
   May, whose $540,000 paycheck was the largest of his career, shot
a 66 to catch Woods at the end of regulation, knocking in a
12-footer at the 18th that first looked short and right, then
curved back left and into the cup. Woods answered with a 5-footer,
bringing a a vigorous fist-pump and setting the tone for the
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he's No. 1 in the world,'' said May. ``I never
counted him out all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his horrible driving _ five fairways missed in the last three
holes of regulation and in the playoff _ May said, ``I never
completed my backswing. I felt like I was chopping wood there for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   May had his chance to prevent the playoff at all. He yanked a
5-footer at the 15th hole for birdie, missing an opportunity to
lead by two shots with three holes to play. Moments before, Woods
rammed in a 10-footer for par after missing the green.

<P>
   MOLINE, Ill. _ Comparing his increasingly populist pitch to that
of Harry S. Truman, but leaving his running mate to
``give-them-hell,'' Vice President Al Gore vowed Sunday to fight
drug companies and health maintenance organizations in bringing
broader and fairer health coverage to all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   At the first of four appearances Sunday in Illinois and Iowa,
all of them in towns along the Mississippi River, Gore said he
would push for a patients' bill of rights to protect HMO consumers
and for adding a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you entrust me with the presidency, we will flat make it
happen,'' Gore promised a crowd of about 3,000 in downtown Moline.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of
Connecticut, used their speeches here to draw on the Trumanesque
imagery that has enthralled Democrats for more than half a century.
But Gore left it to Lieberman to assail the health care record of
his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore made only passing references to the Republicans,
Lieberman charged that 1.4 million children in Texas do not have
health insurance, that Texas leads the nation in the percentage of
residents who are uninsured and that it ranks next to last in
health care for women.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said Bush often responds to criticisms of his state by
saying ``don't mess with Texas.'' But, he asserted, ``when it comes
to health care, it's a mess in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-day riverboat tour down the Mississippi, Gore left
the slow-moving ship and traveled by bus Sunday so he could make
all four cities on his schedule. Gore and his wife, Tipper, were
rejoined by Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, who had left the trip
in Wisconsin on Friday to observe the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates clearly have been buoyed by polls showing they
received a significant boost from last week's Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles, and they have been received
enthusiastically by sizable crowds. ``I'm no expert as to what to
make of it,'' Gore told reporters, ``but it feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   As in his convention speech on Thursday night, Gore accepted
credit Sunday for the economic health of the Clinton years but said
there was more work to be done. He noted, for instance, that 15
percent of all Americans are still without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some serious problems in our health care system,''
he said, his voice still hoarse from his convention speech, ``and
we've got to fix them without undermining the good things about our
health care system.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would move incrementally toward a system of
universal health care, starting with guaranteed coverage for every
child by 2004. And he said the country owes its older citizens a
prescription drug benefit, a proposal estimated to cost $253
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people have bills for pills that are more than their
Social Security check,'' Gore said, ``it is wrong for our country
to put seniors, the generation that won World War II, in a
situation where they have to choose between food and medicine when
the drug companies have the biggest profits of any industry in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug companies, Gore said, do not support such plans because
they fear that drug prices will come down. ``Well, they need to
come down,'' he said. ``They need more competition.'' He added:
``I'll be like Harry Truman. I'll tell them the truth and they'll
just think it's hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then switched targets from the drug companies to HMOs that
he charges with making financial decisions that usurp medical
recommendations. ``Some bean counter behind a computer terminal who
doesn't have a license to practice medicine and surely does not
have a right to play god overrules the doctor because the HMO or
the insurance company doesn't want to shell out the money, even
though you've been paying the monthly premium,'' Gore said. ``What
is that all about?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal for a patients' bill of rights, campaign aides
say, would assure access to specialists, would guarantee emergency
room care regardless of when and where the need arises, and would
provide either a right to sue or an alternative appeals process if
insurers deny coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign criticizes Bush's proposed bill of rights
because it would cover only those Americans in federally governed
health care plans, a restriction that Gore aides say would exclude
135 million people with private insurance.

HARRY OPPENHEIMER, 91, SOUTH AFRICAN INDUSTRIALIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARILYN BERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry F. Oppenheimer, the South African gold and diamond magnate
who used his great wealth and considerable influence in the fight
against apartheid, diedon Saturday in Johannesburg. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer was admitted to Kenridge Hospital in Johannesburg on
Friday after complaining of abdominal pains and a headache, said
Glen Finnegan, a spokeswoman for the family.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer for decades headed one of the world's largest
multinational industrial and mining conglomerates, with resources
stretching from Cape Town, South Africa, to London to the Yukon.
Called the ``king of diamonds,'' he was also the king of gold,
platinum, uranium, vanadium and copper, wielding extraordinary
power over some of the world's strategic metals and minerals.
</P>
<P>
   The Oppenheimer empire has been called a ``Chinese puzzle'' of
majority and minority holdings. The bewildering complex, in
addition to effectively controlling the world's supply of diamonds
through the linked De Beers mineral companies, has vast holdings in
banking, real estate, pulp and paper, bricks and pipe, coal and
potash, locomotives and beer.
</P>
<P>
   As head of Anglo American Corp. of South Africa, Oppenheimer for
a quarter of a century was the most powerful figure in his
country's economy as well as one of the richest men in the world.
</P>
<P>
   He became an important force in South African politics, elected
to Parliament in 1948 in the minority white liberal opposition. In
that capacity, he spoke out frequently and consistently against
apartheid, the country's policy of institutionalized racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, he became head of Anglo American, a mining and metals
company formed by his father during World War I, and chairman of De
Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. During the years he was in charge, he
presided over an enormous expansion of the business. Anglo American
grew to a net value of 24 billion South African rand in 1987 _
$3.47 billion at today's sharply reduced exchange rate _ from a
value of 65 million rand in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer stepped down as chairman of Anglo American in 1982
and as chairman of De Beers in 1984. But he remained active in the
businesses in which his family maintained controlling interests.
His son, Nicholas, became chairman of De Beers in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In his political life, Oppenheimer grounded his opposition to
apartheid on humanitarian impulses, often bringing economic
principles and an elegant understatement to the argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never thought that the policy of racial discrimination
had been a great benefit to business,'' he said, ``because while it
may have had the effect of keeping wages low, it also had the
effect of keeping labor exceptionally inefficient. I believe that
apartheid is something that works against the interest of economic
development, not for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer, who was of Jewish origin, championed the creation
of black trade unions, and he lived to see those unions challenge
the power of his mining companies. He was influential in ending an
employment system that set aside certain jobs for whites only.
</P>
<P>
   His industrial group took the lead in creating housing near the
mines for blacks, although the new housing accommodated only a
small percentage of the three-quarters of a million blacks who were
employed, many as migrant laborers, by his companies. He developed
programs to educate blacks to bring them into positions of
responsibility in his companies.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin A. Thomas, former chief executive of the Ford
Foundation, called Oppenheimer ``a tireless fighter who tried to
change the apartheid system from within.'' While he said he wished
Oppenheimer had done more from his special position, he praised
Oppenheimer's efforts ``to increase democracy in the workplace and
to spread it beyond the workplace to communities in which people
live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Leon H. Sullivan of Philadelphia, the framer of the
Sullivan Principles, a code of corporate conduct in South Africa,
said that Oppenheimer ``has been a force for good, a progressive
influence in South Africa, far beyond the vast majority of business
leaders in that country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, who, like Thomas, came to urge international investors
to withdraw from South Africa, and disagreed with Oppenheimer in
later years, said he continued to have ``the highest respect and
regard for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer maintained that an expanding economy was a better
environment for political change than a contracting economy was,
and he therefore remained a steadfast opponent of economic
sanctions as a means of pressing the South African government to
relax racial strictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of the people who think that sanctions have no
effect,'' he said in an interview in 1987. ``I think they have a
very serious effect in South Africa, but I think the effect is bad
in that it brings pressure to bear on people who are on your side
anyhow. And it certainly doesn't force the government to change
their policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``You know these highly nationalistic people in
South Africa are extremely allergic to pressure from outside.'' He
added, ``In fact they become very bloody-minded about this sort of
thing. They're a tiresome, obstinate lot, our masters.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``masters,'' the Afrikaner nationalists who controlled the
government from 1948, tried to have as little to do with Harry
Oppenheimer as possible. Despite the enormous power conferred on
him as the head of a group of companies that were a leading force
in the South African economy, Oppenheimer was never asked to dine
with the prime minister in the first 34 years of rule by the
National Party, which represented Afrikaner nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 he was finally invited, along with his house guest,
former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, to dine with Prime
Minister P.W. Botha. By 1987 he said that he had seen Botha three
or four times in the last year. But in the past, he recalled: ``He
objected to sitting down to the same lunch table with me. You see,
I was not a very popular figure with him.''
</P>
<P>
   And Oppenheimer said, ``I feel that in the direct political way
I was able to achieve virtually nothing except to keep what I
considered a voice of common sense and humanity alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer said in the 1987 interview that he believed that the
growth of the economy had ``made the apartheid policy more and more
implausible,'' and that the government was moving away from it.
``What they've not done is to make really significant movement on
sharing political power.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more than two years later, Botha's successor, F.W. de
Klerk, legalized anti-apartheid groups and began moving toward
negotiations with them for a democratic constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Majority rule, Oppenheimer said, would have to come in stages,
with guarantees for the rights of various groups in the country.
``I think if you try to insist on having no guarantees for group
rights, the effect would be that you won't get any movement at
all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer was not someone to loudly take credit for his
accomplishments and even less for his charities, which included the
``usual thing'' as he put it _ hospitals, the Boy Scouts, the Girl
Guides, and seed money for education, especially for blacks. A
particular interest was the Urban Foundation, which he helped
establish, dedicated to improving the environment in which black
South Africans live in the cities.
</P>
<P>
   He was known for his refined sensibilities and exquisite taste.
In Little Brenthurst, the palatial home in Johannesburg that he
inherited from his father, and in the seaside ``bungalow'' that he
built near Durban, he had a collection of Picassos, Sisleys, Goyas,
Dufys, Degas and Chagalls. He was particularly fond of a Renoir he
bought in London for 40 pounds while a student at Oxford, where he
developed a reputation as a generous host when he took friends on
champagne picnics.
</P>
<P>
   He collected manuscripts of English poets and had a special
regard for Lord Byron, whom he admired for a ``curious combination
of the romantic and the practical.''
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer also had a major collection of Africana, and took
special delight in a private press that he established to publish
manuscripts. ``I started about 10 or 15 years ago,'' he said in
1987. ``I've been having a great deal of fun out of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He maintained a private game preserve and kept a stable of
racehorses. His wife, the former Bridget McCall, was an avid
bettor. Oppenheimer, who was not exactly a wagerer himself, used to
be seen going down to the equivalent of the $2 betting window in
Durban to place her bets.
</P>
<P>
   A modest man of medium height, with a slight stammer, he spoke
four languages _ English, Afrikaans, German and French. In
conversation he was direct, engaging his guests with genial but
penetrating brown eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Frederick Oppenheimer was born on Oct. 28, 1908, in
Kimberley, South Africa, six years after his father, Sir Ernest
Oppenheimer, emigrated from Germany by way of England.
</P>
<P>
   Young Harry became the heir apparent of the family's business
empire when a brother died. From his childhood he was prepared for
the position he was to occupy. He studied politics and philosophy
at Christ Church College at Oxford, where he was tutored by Sir Roy
Harrod, a British economist.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer volunteered for military service early in World War
II and became an intelligence officer with an armored-car regiment
of the South African army. While still in the army he married
McCall. She and their two children, Nicholas and Mary, as well as
five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren survive him.
</P>
<P>
   His father, the son of a Jewish cigar maker from Friedberg,
Germany, converted to Anglicanism in the 1930s. Harry followed in
his path, as he did again when, at 40, he was selected to represent
the Kimberley constituency in Parliament. There, like his father,
he was a voice for liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   But Oppenheimer's first term, which started in 1948, coincided
with the victory of the National Party led by Prime Minister Daniel
Malan, which under successive leaders would rule South Africa for
over 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   When Oppenheimer left Parliament in 1957 to take over the family
business empire after his father died, he threw his moral and
financial support to the relatively liberal Progressive Party.

   Once, when a state television interviewer asked him whether it
had ever occurred to him to follow another career, he responded
with customarily dry wit: ``I chose my father with discretion and I
found myself in a certain position. And, I mean, like the prayer
book says, I have sought to do my duty in the station in which it
pleases the Lord to call me.''

WOODS OUTDUELS MAY IN A PGA PLAYOFF AND TIES HOGAN IN RECORD BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Facing a courageous challenger who refused to
give in, the world's best golfer showed the world just how good he
is.
</P>
<P>
   Winning his third consecutive major championship, and winning
his second consecutive PGA Championship, Tiger Woods prevailed
Sunday by one stroke in a three-hole playoff over Bob May. For
drama, it ranked among history's most exciting major championships,
with one memorable shot after another, as Woods and May engaged in
a brilliant shotmaking duel.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Woods became only the second player to win
three majors in one year, joining Ben Hogan, who won the Masters,
the U.S. Open and the British Open in 1953. Woods also became the
first back-to-back winner at the PGA Championship since Denny Shute
won the PGA in both 1936 and '37.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods' historic year has been even more dominant than
Hogan's year in '53. Woods won this year's U.S. Open by a
record-setting 15 strokes, he won the British Open by eight
strokes, and Sunday, Woods and May set the PGA Championship scoring
record (18-under-par 270), breaking the previous mark of 17 under
set by Steve Elkington and Colin Montgomerie in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Woods holds the scoring record at all four major
championships _ the Masters (18 under), the U.S. Open (15 under),
the British Open (19 under) and the PGA Championship (18 under).
And at age 24, he has won five career majors faster than anyone,
and he is the first player in history to win four of the previous
five majors, dating back to last year's PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone expected what happened to day _ Woods being pushed
to the brink of defeat by a player who had never won a PGA Tour
event, let alone a major championship. But when May forced Woods to
play his best, Woods was brilliant. Woods forced the playoff by
making a pressure-packed five-foot birdie putt at No. 18. He then
closed the playoff by making a wonderful up and down from the
green-side bunker at No. 18 to protect his one-shot lead.
</P>
<P>
   An extraordinary effort by May was not enough to defeat the
game's most extraordinary player. Woods could not remember being
tested more severely, which made the victory even more satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was probably one of the greatest duels I've ever had in
my life,'' said Woods. ``To see two guys playing at a level that
you're probably only going to attain when you're concentrating that
much was really special. Birdie for birdie, shot for shot, we were
going at each other. That's as good as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods (66-67-70-67) and May (72-66-66-66) both finished at 270,
five strokes ahead of Thomas Bjorn, who finished third. But on the
back nine, the other contenders dropped away, unable to keep up
with the torrid pace set by Woods and May at Valhalla Golf Club, a
course that has been maligned for lacking history, but a course
that will now be linked to one of golf's most electrifying
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Both players shot sizzling five-under 31 on the back nine, the
kind of display rarely seen anywhere, particularly at a major. And
there were many key moments, although several stood out. May almost
won at No. 18 in regulation, when he made a sensational 15-foot
birdie putt from the back fringe to take a momentary one-stroke
lead, forcing Woods to make a five-foot birdie putt to keep the
tournament alive.
</P>
<P>
   Woods never flinched, making the putt, pumping his fist, shaking
May's hand and marching onward to the three-hole playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things were going, I had to figure he was going to
make his putt,'' said Woods of May's putt. ``So I had to step up
there and bury mine.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first hole of the playoff, Woods took a one-stroke lead
for good at the par 4, No. 16, making a 15-foot putt for birdie,
after May hit a great chip to save par. Then on the final hole, the
par-5 No. 18, after Woods and May both pulled their drives left and
failed to reach the green in two shots, Woods hit a tremendous
bunker shot to within a foot, leaving May with a tough 30-foot putt
uphill for birdie that he needed to keep the match going. May's
putt for birdie just missed, and Woods tapped in for victory,
taking the first-place check of $900,000, and setting a
single-season earning record of over $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, May was proud of his effort, knowing he did
everything in his power to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I proved to a lot of people that I could play under
the heat,'' said May, who heard plenty of support from the noisy
gallery following the final group. ``I think people started rooting
for me about the second hole, when I made birdie, and Tiger made
bogey. I think they figured, `Okay, this is going to be a little
bit interesting.' They probably thought Tiger was going to do what
he usually does, run away,''
</P>
<P>
   But May would not go away. Starting the day one stroke behind
Woods, May actually built a two-stroke lead through six holes, but
Woods birdied No. 7 and No. 8 to tie. However, a key turning point
came at No. 15 in regualtion, when Woods made a 15-foot putt to
save par, then May missed a four-foot putt that would have given
him a birdie. If Woods had missed his putt, and May had sunk his,
May would have held a three-stroke lead with three holes to play.
Instead, Woods remained just one stroke back, and he pulled even at
No. 17, hitting a huge drive, then hitting a beautiful sand wedge
shot from 96 yards to within two feet for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the things that happened today, the putt I made at No.
15 may have been the biggest,'' said Woods. ``If I made that putt,
I figured his putt would get a little longer. But if I had missed,
and he makes, he's up three with three to go, and I'm not looking
too good.''
</P>
<P>
   But after winning another major, Woods' career accomplishments
looked spectacular. He has a chance to become the first player to
win four consecutive professional majors at next year's Masters,
but that could wait Sunday night. Woods wanted to savor a victory
that he will not forget because of how he won and because of how
severely he was pushed.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wanted to see drama return to the major championships
got their wish. Instead of a runaway, this was a thriller. However,
the phenomenal player who keeps adding to his legacy simply refused
to lose. &QL;

DAVID EDELSTEIN, JUDGE IN IBM AND TEAMSTERS CASES, DIES AT 90 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein, who in his 48
years on the bench presided over two of the Justice Department's
most historic undertakings _ the antitrust action against IBM and
the ongoing effort to rid the Teamsters union of corruption _ died
on Saturday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed by President Truman on Nov. 1, 1951, Edelstein served
as chief judge of the Southern District of New York from 1971 to
1980 and for years was the longest-sitting active judge in the
country. He became eligible for senior status, a sort of
semiretirement, in 1975 but did not take it until 1994, and he
continued to hear cases until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Still among his caseload was U.S. v. the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, the landmark lawsuit first brought by the
Justice Department in 1988, and he continued to play an active role
in the efforts to monitor the union. In June, he rejected the rules
proposed by the union and the Justice Department for next year's
Teamsters elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The submissions are a farrago of ill advice and misguided,
inept, controversial and confused argots,'' he wrote in language
that reflected his reputation for being one of the most thoughtful
and irascible personalities on the bench. ``Their program has the
potential of bringing grief, strife, controversy and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was one of countless decisions by Edelstein aimed at
keeping the powerful truckers' union free of criminal influence. It
was Edelstein who approved a review board decision in 1998 to expel
Ron Carey, the union's former president. And it was a decision by
Edelstein in March 1999 that cleared the way for James P. Hoffa to
take the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District, said
Sunday: ``Judge Edelstein was a dedicated jurist who was dogged in
his pursuit of justice. His work, in particular on the Teamsters
litigation, will stand as an impressive legacy to his judicial
courage and intellect.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein's reputation for doggedness stemmed from his long role
in the government's antitrust action against International Business
Machines, which was first brought in 1952 when the company's main
business was punch-card technology. In 1956, he signed a consent
order under which IBM agreed to modify some of its business
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Justice Department's current action against Microsoft,
the IBM case had been considered the most important antitrust
action in modern judicial history. But in the end Edelstein was
apparently too dogged, and in 1995 a federal appeals court granted
IBM's request and ordered him off the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it manifestly clear that a reasonable observer would
question the judge's impartiality on the pending issue,'' Chief
Judge Jon O. Newman of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote
in a rare rebuke of a fellow judge. The appellate decision ordered
the case re-assigned.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Edelstein had been overseeing the IBM case for
about 43 years. Before his removal, he had opened an inquiry into
why the Justice Department wanted to drop its case against IBM and
had refused to approve several orders jointly proposed by the
company and the Justice Department to throw out billions of pages
of documents that had accumulated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   David Norton Edelstein was born on Feb. 16, 1910, into a
middle-class family in New York City. He attended public schools
and then Fordham University, earning a bachelor's, a master's and a
law degree.
</P>
<P>
   He paid his way through college and law school by working as a
page boy at the New York Stock Exchange from 1929 to 1932 and was a
firsthand witness to the devastating effects of the great crash.
</P>
<P>
   He worked in private law practice in New York and in the claims
division of the Justice Department before becoming an assistant
U.S. attorney in 1945. He became a special assistant to the U.S.
Attorney General in the lands division in 1947 and was assistant
U.S. attorney general in the customs division from 1948 until 1951
when he was appointed to the bench after Truman's first choice
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   His nomination was opposed by the American Bar Association, the
Association of the Bar of the City of New York and the New York
State Bar Association, which said that he lacked trial experience.
Nevertheless, he was confirmed by the Senate in April 1952 and went
on to one of the longest careers on the bench in what is arguably
the highest profile District Court in the country.
</P>
<P>
   He became chief judge in 1971 on the basis of seniority, and
remained in the post until 1980 when, at the age of 70, tradition
dictated that he step aside. But he remained an active judge,
overseeing the IBM saga and numerous other cases, including the
1984 trial of state Sen. Joseph R. Pisani of New Rochelle on
charges of tax evasion and embezzling campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   The jury convicted Pisani on 18 of 39 counts and acquitted him
of 11 counts, but it was unable to reach a verdict on 10 counts
that made up a large chunk of the government's case, including
allegations that Pisani used $20,000 in state funds to buy a summer
house. Edelstein declared a mistrial on those 10 counts. Pisani's
convictions were reversed on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Edelstein showed particular disdain for
perpetrators of crimes of greed. In 1983, he ordered six wholesale
bakers that had been charged with price-fixing in supplying
doughnuts and pastries to coffee shops and restaurants to provide
the needy with up to $1,200 worth of free baked goods each week for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, at the sentencing of David P. Bloom, a financial
adviser once called a Wall Street ``whiz kid'' who had been
convicted of defrauding investors of nearly $15 million, Edelstein
called the 24-year-old defendant a predator and imposed an
eight-year prison term. ``I find that Bloom is remorseless,
completely lacking in conscience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein, who lived in Manhattan, is survived by his wife of 60
years, the former Florence Koch, and two sons, Jonathan and
Jeffrey.

GORE CAMPAIGN PICKS UP STEAM ALONG MISSISSIPPI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOLINE, Ill. _ The crowds are thicker and rowdier, the poll
numbers are up, and Al Gore, his determined voice raspy from
frenetic campaigning, is displaying a confidence and fieriness he
hasn't shown since the hard-fought Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, at long last, appears to be gaining momentum,
heading into what campaign aides say will be a consistently tight
race until Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Rallies of up to 5,000 people _ far more than the vice president
was drawing before the Democratic National Convention _ have
greeted Al and Tipper Gore as the couple have stopped at small
towns along the Mississippi River on a riverboat campaign cruise.
Some Illinois and Iowa residents lined up along the riverbank late
Saturday night to watch the Mark Twain float by, prompting the
Gores, who had been celebrating Mrs. Gore's 52d birthday, to stop
the boat, pull out a bullhorn, and address them.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has been unusually relaxed with reporters and
visibly energized by screaming crowds _ some of whom donned party
hats and waited four hours Saturday evening to wish Mrs. Gore a
happy birthday. The Clinton, Iowa, ralliers were still partying
after midnight, as the beaming Gores delighted the crowd by dancing
onstage, confetti falling around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go, Al. Go!'' the ralliers screamed, crammed against one
another as they strained to get a handshake from the ebullient vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling good about the enthusiasm of the crowds,'' Gore
said Sunday as he exited The Boathouse restaurant in Davenport,
Iowa. ``I'm not a expert as to what to make of it, but I'm feeling
good.''
</P>
<P>
   A CNN poll Sunday had Gore leading his opponent, Republican
George W. Bush, 47 percent to 46 percent in a four-way race
including consumer advocate Ralph Nader and Reform Party candidate
Patrick J. Buchanan. The poll's margin of error was 4 percentage
points. The survey is in line with other recent polls that show the
race neck and neck, with Gore often slightly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been lagging by as many as 19 points behind the
governor of Texas earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   But the past two weeks have marked a turning point for the
Democratic ticket, starting with the announcement of centrist
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as Gore's running mate
and continuing with the vice president's convention address and
riverboat campaign trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking all the polls numbers the same way we did a few
weeks ago, with a studied nonchalance,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane. But ``clearly, there is something going on in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of it, said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of
Illinois, is the symbolic departure of President Clinton from the
campaign stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest job in American politics is getting out of the
shadow of the president,'' Durbin said in an interview. But
``Democrats are now thinking beyond the Clinton presidency,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore is sounding more and more like Clinton on the
campaign trail, hammering away on the voter-pleasing issues of
health care and coverage of prescription drugs for senior citizens.
He engages his listeners like a talk-show host, telling sad tales
of children who aren't getting an adequate education and elderly
people who aren't receiving medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Gore allows that his Republican opponents are ``decent,'' and
makes a villain of the pharmaceutical, oil, tobacco, and insurance
companies he says are making huge profits at people's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of political power, but you've got the
votes,'' Gore told an enthusaistic crowd in Muscatine, Iowa,
Sunday. It is a populist message that plays well in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Al Gore,'' said Dawn Greer, 32, who said her mother
died in Texas after failing to find a doctor who would treat her
for cash. Greer blames Bush, in part, for her mother's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the way George Bush runs his own state, I don't want
him running the country. It will be somebody elese's mother next,''
Greer said.
</P>
<P>
   No longer standing stiff, Gore now paces the stage when he woos
a crowd, waving his arms for emphasis and stopping to look into the
eyes of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore's voice is starting to sound like the president's,
hoarse from long, event-filled days on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people say I'm too specific,'' Gore told a crowd of
about 2,000 in the small town of Bellevue, Iowa, on Saturday. But,
he added, ``do you want the facts?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah!'' the crowd yelled back. ``All right, then,'' Gore
continued, now holding the attention of the crowd as he launched
into a detailed description of his plan for Social Security, the
Patient's Bill of Rights, and cleaning up the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone just said, `Give 'em hell, Al,' and I'm going to give
the same response Harry Truman did,'' Gore told the Bellevue crowd.
``I'm going to tell the truth and they're going to think it's
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has turned his stiff image into a kind of
geek chic, making self-deprecating comments about his lack of
charisma and subtly suggesting in the process that his opponent
lacks substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I might not always be the most exciting
politician,'' Gore told a boisterous gathering of about 5,000
people in Moline Sunday. ``But I will work hard for you and I will
never let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach makes sense, said Stephen Hess, an analyst with the
Washington, D.C.-based Brookings Institution. ``You're not going to
make him into Bill Clinton. He might as well do what he does best.
To say, I am what I am: I'm not a matinee idol, but I'm a good
issues guy,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about him not being a good speaker,'' said Pat
Yancick, a 62-year-old realtor, as she eagerly awaited Gore's
arrival in Moline Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want someone who talks a good story,'' Yancick said.
``I want someone like Al Gore who will do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their apparent momentum, Gore and Lieberman have a hard
task ahead of them. They lag in the polls in the South, and the
contest appears to be close in the industrial Midwest, a region
critical to the Democrats if they are to win.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has been choosing his words carefully in the
region, and targeting his message to appeal to the conservative,
middle-America crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Gore glosses over what was once a central part of his stump
speech _ the success of the current economy _ instead telling
residents of this less-economically booming region that he is ``not
satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't believe that the economy is so strong that people aren't
working harder,'' Gore told supporters in Clinton on Saturday
night. ``Don't tell me there aren't families out there having
challenges, having trouble meeting house payments.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, however, does not mention such goals as gay
and abortion rights, both touchy issues in this part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president's commitment to choice is well
documented,'' Lehane said. ``I'm sure it will be mentioned on the
campaign trail,'' he said, but he would not say whether Gore would
discuss abortion before Midwestern voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush isn't going to talk about those issues either,''
Durbin said. ``What you need to do (in the Midwest) is to talk
about mainstream, family room issues.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A logomachy _  &UR; n. an argument about words &LR;  _ is brewing on the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin plans to publish the fourth edition of its
American Heritage dictionary next month, the volume's first major
overhaul in eight years. The new edition is full of changes sure to
arouse lexicographers _ color illustrations, notes on slang and a
new appendix describing Semitic as well as Indo-European roots.
</P>
<P>
   But what the publisher has most excited is happening outside the
covers, as Houghton Mifflin hustles to sell electronic versions of
its dictionary for inclusion in other companies' software, Web
sites and digital publications.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin is not alone. Its major rivals _ most notably
Merriam-Webster and Microsoft Corp.'s year-old Encarta dictionary _
are all stepping up their digital dictionary efforts to tap an
increasingly lucrative market, setting up a business contest that
philologists say will also have consequences for the way Americans
use English.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic novels may be making headlines these days, but
electronic dictionaries are actually making money. At Houghton
Mifflin, digital dictionary licensing is expected to account for
more than $1 million in profit this year, more than 10 percent of
the earnings from the company's trade and reference division,
according to Wendy Strothman, the division's publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Stifled for years by low margins and flat sales, dictionary
publishers are salivating over digital sales and licensing as a new
source of revenue growth, promoting flashy new features like
audible pronunciations. But word scholars worry that the new
pressures of the online market may end up favoring well-connected
or well-positioned dictionaries _ some sniffingly cite Microsoft's
Encarta _ over more authoritative lexicons.
</P>
<P>
   Many lexicographers initially saw the advent of the Internet as
a terrific new tool, especially because it made possible electronic
texts of nearly infinite length. That impulse inspired the Oxford
University Press, for example, to revise its 20-volume Oxford
English Dictionary for the first time since its completion in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   A new online version of the OED is available to subscribers for
fees starting at $550 a year. Researchers are posting the revisions
and additions online in stages, and they expect to finish the
alphabet in about 40 volumes around 2010. Oxford University Press
has not yet decided if it will publish a new printed version, too,
said Jesse Sheidlower, its American editor.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also enables rival dictionary compilers to share a
common digital ``corpus,'' or archive of usage samples. Inspired by
the British National Corpus that was established in 1993, a group
of publishers and linguists based in New York is raising funds and
gathering material to build an American National Corpus of 100
million words in texts of all kinds, including transcript,
newspapers and novels.
</P>
<P>
   But the American National Corpus has yet to win help from many
of the nation's big dictionary publishers, who would stand to lose
the advantage of their own proprietary archives. ``We think we have
our needs pretty well served,'' said John Morse, president and
publisher of the Merriam-Webster, the United States' oldest and
best-selling dictionary, with an archive of more than 15 million
citations.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Web is also a gold mine for linguistic research.
For the first time, scholars can trace the infancy of new words as
they bubble up from narrow subcultures through online discussion
groups and eventually into general use, said Michael Adams, a
professor at Albright College in Pennsylvania and editor of the
journal Dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Adams recently published a study of new coinages from the
television show ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' _ ``slayage'' and many
other -age formations, for example _ tracking their progress from
teen-age fans' Web sites to magazines like Mademoiselle. He argues
that Buffy has also spawned novel uses of ``much,'' as in
``pathetic much?'' ``morbid much?'' or ``Having issues much?''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's Encarta dictionary, billed as the first lexicon
for the Digital Age, has some lexicographers shaking their heads,
partly because they worry that it could indeed be the dictionary of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Encarta was born in the early 1990s, when Nigel
Newton, chief executive of the British publishing house Bloomsbury,
wrote Bill Gates a letter proposing to create a dictionary of
``world English.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Microsoft was paying Houghton-Mifflin to license
online versions of its American Heritage dictionary to use in
Microsoft's spell-checking software and to bundle with its Encarta
digital encyclopedia. Why pay Houghton-Mifflin, Newton suggested,
when the two companies could build a wordbook of their own?
Bloomsbury developed the dictionary, selling international digital
rights to Microsoft and the American rights to Holtzbrincks' St.
Martins Press.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture faced long odds in bookstores. Most American
consumers traditionally want a red dictionary with the name Webster
on the cover _ as in Merriam-Webster, Random House's Webster's, and
IDG Books' Webster's New World, says John Sargent, president of
Holtzbrinck's American operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the new dictionary's publishers are betting that Microsoft's
commanding position in the software market can make Encarta's name
and black cover even more ubiquitous. ``Our thinking was that,
given its use in Microsoft software, the Encarta brand would over
time become the leading reference brand,'' Sargent said. The
electronic version is available for sale with some Microsoft
software or for free at www.encarta.com
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Encarta will in fact become the new Webster
is precisely what is eating many linguists. In a forthcoming review
in the journal Dictionaries, Sidney I. Landau, author of
``Dictionaries: The Art &AMP; Craft of Lexicography,'' roundly pans
Encarta's ``cumbersome, repetitious and inconsistent style'' and
especially what he sees as its excessive political correctness.

 UNDATED: political correctness. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word ``Indian,'' an example Landau notes, is described in
other dictionaries as potentially insensitive but also widely used
among Native Americans and inextricably woven into terms like
``Indian summer.'' The Encarta issues a blanket condemnation,
calling the term ``offensive'' several times. In a few cases, the
Encarta Web site even interrupts the viewer with a ``language
advisory'' before even displaying a potentially offensive word, as
if it were a lewd movie. Such labels, Landau says, reverse most
lexicographers' understanding of their job _ to report in neutral
terms the changing shape of the language.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, another Encarta critic, worries that Encarta will succeed
despite its flaws and at the expense of its rivals. ``The problem
is that if they don't put out the best possible dictionary, because
of the access they have through the Microsoft software, they could
very well depress the sales of the four major publishers,'' said
Adams, who has worked as a consultant to American Heritage. ``Good
dictionaries would disappear and we would be left with an inferior
dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and its partners dismiss the criticism as predictable
nitpicking. Every new or different dictionary has met a similar
response from professional lexicographers, said Holtzbrinck's
Sargent.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton-Mifflin, Microsoft's previous digital dictionary
supplier, was the publisher with the most to lose from the Encarta
dictionary, which Microsoft this year began using instead of the
American Heritage. Houghton-Mifflin's Wendy Strothman said that new
digital licensing deals had ``more than made up for the loss of
that revenue stream.''
</P>
<P>
   Strothman says Houghton-Mifflin prepares customized versions of
its digital database for a variety of clients, seeking to
capitalize on the recent interest in electronic publishing by
embedding its dictionary in electronic books or reading software.
Readers can look up any word with a click.
</P>
<P>
   When half a million fans downloaded copies of Stephen King's
electronic novella ``Riding the Bullet'' in March, for example,
some of the software programs for displaying it included a digital
version of the American Heritage dictionary, and Houghton-Mifflin
received a small royalty on each. This fall, the digital publisher
netLibrary will begin including American Heritage dictionaries with
its e-books, paying a sliding scale fee for its use. (Microsoft's
new Reader software, however, includes a version of Encarta.)
</P>
<P>
   A number of Web sites, including www.dictionary.com, have even
paid Houghton-Mifflin for use of its digital dictionary to provide
free spellings and definitions on the Web, hoping to attract
viewers and sell advertising. ``They are welcome to do that, but
our content costs us money and we want to get paid for it,''
Strothman said. ``What puzzles me is why our competitors put their
own dictionaries up on the Web for free.'' Houghton-Mifflin sells
its dictionary on CD-ROM, but does not put it on a Web site of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   That position has cost the company some business. Paul J.J.
Payack, chief executive of the newly formed company
yourDictionary.com, initially favored licensing American Heritage,
he says, because he liked its etymologies and simple definitions.
But he did not like Houghton-Mifflin's licensing-only strategy. He
wanted a dictionary that would boost his brand by building its own,
so he struck a deal with Merriam-Webster instead.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster has taken a radically different tack from
American Heritage, giving its dictionary away for free on its own
Web site (www.m-w.com) while at the same time trying to license it
to whomever it can, including America Online and the hand-held
computer maker Franklin Electronic Publishers, among others.
Recently, it also managed to strike a deal to display its Web site
on Palm devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike Houghton-Mifflin, we are just a dictionary publisher,''
said Morse, of Merriam-Webster. ``We aim mainly to promote the
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   The main Merriam-Webster Web site and a related site for
children offer word games and offers a free word-of-the-day e-mail
with usage and etymology tips. Morse said the site was now getting
about 20 million page views a month, at a rate of about 50,000
look-ups an hour during the middle of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster also tracks which words users look up for
guidance in making revisions. This month's hot word: ``chutzpah,''
spurred by press coverage of vice-presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   But not all lexicographers are happy about the proliferation of
Merriam-Webster's definitions online, either. ``The Merriam-Webster
is fantastic but least suited for most people who use it,'' said
Sheidlower, the American editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
``Its definitions are much more complicated and more difficult than
the other major dictionaries. The other dictionaries are accurate,
and you can use them without going nuts.''

KNOBLAUCH MAY TEST ELBOW IN MINORS; CELEBRATING NO. 16; WILLIAMS
RESTS; CONE FEELING BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' leadoff batter, may be
within a week of returning to the team. He threw from 90 feet
Sunday, taking ground balls and making throws from second base to
first, and took batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch is recovering from tendinitis in his right elbow, and
if he does not have any setbacks in the next few days, he could
begin a minor league rehabilitation toward the end of the week.
Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said there was a
``real possibility'' that Knoblauch could rejoin the Yankees before
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch has not played since Aug. 2, and the Yankees have
missed his presence at the top of their lineup, his ability to
elevate pitch counts and create offense. Knoblauch's elbow trouble
did not prevent him from hitting before he was placed on the
disabled list for the first time in his career; it did cause deep
pain when he threw.
</P>
<P>
   By waiting until Sept. 1 to activate Knoblauch, the Yankees
could avoid making a roster decision to make room for him, because
all major league rosters expand on that date. But the Yankees have
failed to increase their lead over the Boston Red Sox recently, and
each of their remaining 42 games is taking on increased importance;
they will need Knoblauch as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The most vulnerable player on the 25-man roster would appear to
be outfielder Luis Polonia, who has not performed well since
joining the Yankees and does not have a clear-cut role now that the
roster is stocked with David Justice, Glenallen Hill and Jose
Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza, the right-hander who is on the disabled list
because of weakness in the back of his right shoulder, will begin a
throwing program Monday, as he works his way back to the active
roster. Mendoza's status is crucial to the makeup of the Yankees'
bullpen, because he has proven to be so useful in the postseason in
recent years. The Yankees hope Mendoza will be back in early to
mid-September, to give him enough appearances to establish his
command before October.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating No. 16 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whitey Ford joked that he had never been so nervous since he
faced Ted Williams for the first time. The occasion was Whitey Ford
Day at Yankee Stadium and the numeral 16 was painted near the
first- and third-base foul lines _ Ford's number, the only Yankees
number retired in honor of a pitcher. Ford, a left-hander who won
236 regular-season games and 10 more in the World Series, was
inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen former teammates were on hand, including Yogi
Berra, Phil Rizzuto and Luis Arroyo. Ford mentioned his late son
Tom in thanking his family, his voice clutched by emotion. ``I've
had some wonderful days here,'' he said. ``But this tops them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a Yankee for 53 years,'' Ford continued, ``and I'll
be a Yankee forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 71, finished radiation treatments he had been undergoing
after the removal of a cancerous brain tumor last November. Ford,
who went through a similar procedure five years ago, has said he is
feeling a lot better. Sunday, he smiled on the field and laughed
and appeared to wipe away a few tears. ``I'm so overwhelmed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams Rests
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, the Yankees' center fielder, was out of the
lineup for the second consecutive game because of a twinge in his
right side. He initially felt the pain while taking batting
practice before Saturday's game. ``I feel better today,'' Williams
said before Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has had a rib-cage injury before and said that his pain
in this instance is nowhere close to what it was the last time he
was hurt. ``I'm not really worried about it,'' he said. ``But I'd
rather be out there playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fact that the Yankees need him as they prepare for
the final 42 games of the season, Williams has reasons of his own
to return as soon as possible. He is considered one of the American
League's top candidates for the most valuable player award, and
with 107 runs batted in he is 23 short of the single-season record
for switch-hitters, established by Mickey Mantle in 1956 and later
tied by Ken Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher, also was out of the starting
lineup and did not participate in batting practice, taking a full
day off from his regular pregame work to rest. During his last
at-bat Saturday, Posada tore a fingernail while batting, stepping
out of the batter's box to flex and test his hand at one point.
Posada pinch-hit in the ninth inning Sunday, grounding out, and he
expects to be back in the lineup Monday afternoon when the Yankees
play the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Cone Feeling Better
</P>
<P>
   David Cone struck out the first two batters in the first inning
Sunday, Orlando Palmeiro and Scott Speizio, and when the count
reached full on the first baseman Mo Vaughn, the Yankee Stadium
crowd began clapping and cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the mound, Cone looked around for an instant, as if
to feed off their emotion, and he finished off Vaughn with a
split-fingered fastball, the third of his six strikeouts on the
afternoon. Cone's confidence, hurt by his long winless streak,
seems to be returning.
</P>
<P>
   There were times when Cone made vague references to the end of
his career during his slump, but he is beyond that now. His record
is 3-10. But he said that anyone who really believed he had pitched
like a 3-10 pitcher this season had not been paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been better than 3-10,'' he said, a reference to the
games when he has pitched well enough to win but has not done so.
``I just feel good about what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Over his last four starts, Cone has compiled a 2.74 earned run
average, allowing seven earned runs in 23 innings in winning both
of his decisions. &QL;

VERIZON, WORKERS REACH TENTATIVE CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of striking telephone employees in New England and New
York began returning to their schedulued shifts at midnight
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, several hours after Verizon Communications and two
labor groups reached a tentative contract guaranteeing three years
of labor peace and union access to New Economy jobs.
</P>
<P>
   News that Verizon had hammered out a settlement with the
13,000-member International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and
the northern unit of the Communications Workers of America came
while talks continued between the company and CWA's southern
division, which includes New Jersey and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The southern unit, which represents 36,000 workers, remained on
strike Sunday &UR;  &LR; night as 50,000 union members from New England and
New York prepared to return to work Monday and, in some cases, no
later than Wednesday after a two-week strike that disrupted repairs
and telephone installations in a dozen eastern states and the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Anouncement of many of the agreement's provisions was delayed
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night until management and labor agreed on language
concerning the strikers return to work. The unions also demanded
amnesty for strikers accused of disruptive behavior while on the
picket line.
</P>
<P>
   However, under the agreement, IBEW and CWA's northern district
workers will receive wage increases of 4 percent the first year of
the contract, 3 percent the second year, and 5 percent the third
and final year of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began at 12:01 a.m. Aug. 6, following the expiration
of a two-year contract. Although basic service for most customers
continued with few disruptions, analysts maintained that the
growing backlog of consumer repair and installation orders, which
had risen to 100,000 from about 50,000, provided a strong incentive
for Verizon to end the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon Communications, the company created by the merger of
Bell Atlantic and GTE, serves approximately 25 million customers
from Maine to Virginia and is the biggest provider of local
telephone service in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came several days after both sides hammered out
language giving the unions permission to use a card check
neutrality agreement to organize workers at Verizon Wireless, a
subsidiary. Sources close to bargaining said approximately 7,000
wireless workers on the East Coast, including 1,500 retail sales
workers, would be covered.
</P>
<P>
   That provision, regarded by labor experts as the most suprising
aspect of the pact, will allow the unions to organize wireless
workers after collecting signed cards from a majority of workers.
Such agreements have become more popular among unions than standard
elections, which are often challenged by employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever was decided about the other outstanding issues, the
fact that Verizon agreed to a neutrality card check agreement is a
major, major accomplishment for the unions and a major concession
by the company,'' said Robert Ross, a labor expert at Clark
University in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst in
Atlanta, said the contract will expand labor's advancement into the
industry from a toehold to ``a strong foothold on the work of the
future, the work of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kagan questioned whether this contract will
also prove to be a bit of a burdentt around Verizon's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the unions got everything they wanted, then Verizon is
going to have a real challenge,'' he said. ``Sure, it will have
great workers. But will Verizon be as flexible as its
entrepreneural competitors? Will the company be nimble enough to
compete against companies that are not shackled by these future
union demands? Ultimately, if it is not, those union members will
not have jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions in the agreement announced Sunday &UR;  &LR; night
include:
</P>
<P>
   --Language granting 100 Verizon Communications stock options to
fulltime members and 50 shares to part-time members.
</P>
<P>
   --Language granting a corporate profit sharing plan that will
offer awards during each year of the life of the agreement, with
minimum awards of $500 in 2001, $600 in 2002, and $700 in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   --Language granting an increase in the company's matching
contribution to a 401-K plan from 80 percent to 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Language amending the pension, as of Aug. 1, 2002, to a lump
sum cashout option. Retiring members may receive their benefits
either in a lump sum or in the form of an annuity. It was not clear
Sunday how this change would affect workers who are not yet
eligible for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   --Language authorizing that new benefits be added to the health
care network, including a maximum lifetime benefit of $20,000 for
fertility and reproductive treatments.
</P>
<P>
   --Language eliminating the retiree lifetime maximum benefit for
health care.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also resolves a labor management dispute over the
transfer of customer jobs from the Eastern region to other states,
though details of this change were not available Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.

FOR VERIZON WORKERS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS, RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (With VERIZON-RDP)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leo Hernandez had not been planning to wake up at
5:30 Monday morning to go to work. Old-timers at the phone company
had told him that if a strike lasted more than two weeks, it would
be a long one. Hernandez had been preparing to wait it out.
</P>
<P>
   But an agreement reached Sunday, as the walkout entered its
third week, meant the end of picket lines and paycheck worries for
about two-thirds of the more than 86,000 Verizon Communications
workers on strike in 12 states and Washington. And it meant hope
for thousands of customers stranded without service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy,'' said Hernandez, a switchman at the Manhattan
headquarters who has worked for the company for five years. Though
he did not know the details of the agreement between Verizon and
two unions, the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, he said he was
certain any settlement would address his main concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were the company's ability to organize workers in the
wireless sectors and management's ability to transfer workers at
will, which are both addressed in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that at least the people from my local that I
know personally did a good job representing us,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, at the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, leaders of the
unions said they had accomplished much of what they had sought to
achieve when they went on strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reached a fair agreement and everybody's happy,'' Angel
Feliciano, a leader of Local 1101 of the CWA, said in the lobby of
the hotel, where the talks took place.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the union had won in the contracts, James P. O'Hare,
president of Local 1118 in Albany, N.Y., replied: ``Stock options
are nice, but the major goals are transferring our work,
protections against contracts, no layoffs, no downgrades. You can't
beat that.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Verizon workers said they were prepared to face the
backlog of repairs and other jobs that had piled up in their
absence. ``We're not afraid of hard work,'' said Annie B. Bowie, a
30-year veteran, as she volunteered at CWA Local 1101 in Manhattan
Sunday night, preparing checks for union members who had done
picket-line duty. ``For a good day's wage, we will give a good
day's work.''
</P>
<P>
   Though forced overtime was one of the complaints the unions
brought to the bargaining table, a local union president in Boston
said overtime restrictions would be rolled back this week to allow
technicians to chip away at the accumulated work requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of them, especially the younger ones with children,
it's good money for them,'' said the official, Edward T.
Fitzpatrick of IBEW Local 2222.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon customers said they were relieved the strike was over,
but somewhat skeptical that an end to their wait for service would
soon follow. Rachel Karr, the office manager for Digital Club
Network in Manhattan, said that because of a delay in installing
digital phone lines, she had been able to provide only eight phone
lines for more than 60 employees.
</P>
<P>
   When told that the strike had ended, she said, ``They were late
before they went on strike, so I'm not happy until everything's
done. Maybe they'll answer the phones now, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Bullinga, an architect, said she had been without phone,
fax or e-mail service since she moved into a new office in SoHo
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually a very lonely, disconnected feeling, when you
can't do business or get in touch with anyone,'' Bullinga said.

SPORTS COLUMN: IN THE END, TIGER WON THE HOGAN WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE , Ky. _ As a youngster, Tiger Woods taped a list of
Jack Nicklaus' accomplishments on the wall of his room. And after
having played with Nicklaus in the first two rounds of the 82nd PGA
Championship, he was asked if he could play with two other golfers
of history in a mythical foursome, who would they be?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hogan and Jones,'' he said quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Jones died before Tiger Woods was born but when Woods,
after winning the 1997 Masters as a PGA Tour rookie, arrived to
play in the Colonial Invitation in Fort Worth he hoped to meet Ben
Hogan, who was ill at home there. Valerie Hogan didn't want Tiger
to see her husband in his condition, but she arranged for him to
take Tiger's phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they talked about,'' she would say before
her death in 1998, ``but I heard Ben say, `I feel the same way
about you, Tiger.' And when Ben died two months later, I received
the nicest note from Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Tiger Woods has finally met Ben Hogan in golf's history
books. With his PGA victory in a theatrical three-hole playoff with
Bob May Sunday, the reigning U.S. Open and British Open champion is
the first golfer to win three major titles in one season since
Hogan won the Masters and the two Opens in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   For all his dazzling shots Sunday, Woods really won the Hogan
way, the hard-work way.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever other golfers asked Hogan for his ``secret,'' the
little Texan would say, ``The secret is in the dirt,'' meaning the
dirt below the grass of the practice range and the practice green.
Nobody in his era worked any harder to hone his talent than Hogan
did. And for all of Woods' gifts, nobody works any harder now than
he does.
</P>
<P>
   In the dirt is where Woods won this PGA _ in the dirt of the
Valhalla practice range and practice green long after sunset
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't leave there until 8:56,'' Woods said, alluding to
tuning his game with his swing guru, Butch Harmon. ``I worked on my
swing and my putting. I got so I felt more steady over the ball.
And before the round, I warmed up well. I got off to a slow start,
but I figured it was only a matter of time before it all came
together.''
</P>
<P>
   After two bogeys in the first six holes, Woods suddenly found
the swing and the putting touch that he had worked on Saturday
night. With birdie putts on the 17th and 18th holes for a 31 on the
back nine and a 5-under-par 67, he forced the three-hole playoff
that he won by one stroke by one-putting for a birdie and two pars.
</P>
<P>
   With his fifth major at age 24, Woods has also won four out of
the last five majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he is doing right now,'' Nicklaus said after watching
Woods shoot 66-67 in the first two rounds, ``I think he is a better
player than I ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   That's powerful praise from the golfer who is generally
considered to be the best in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger is doing it with regularity and he is doing it with so
much left in him, so much more power to burn.'' Nicklaus said. ``I
don't think I have ever seen anybody do what he is doing that much
within himself. He doesn't have to extend himself at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, however, did need to extend himself against May, who
until the weekend here had been a virtual unknown on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was playing,'' Nicklaus said, ``I always had Arnold
Palmer, Gary Player, Lee Trevino, Tom Watson, guys that won quite a
few majors. They were not afraid to win a tournament. Tiger not
only has the ability to be so much better than the other guys, but
the other guys are not sure they can win. He's got everything
sitting in front of him, plus that factor that is a big factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus mentioned another factor, that Woods is using clubs and
balls that are much more high-tech than when the Golden Bear was at
his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never hit my irons anywhere near as hard as Tiger hits his
irons, nor as far,'' Nicklaus said. ``I never tried to. I hit my
irons basically the same distance now as I did in my prime; maybe
not the 1-iron and the 2-iron, but 25 years ago I hit a 5-iron 175
yards and I hit a 5-iron 175 yards now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when Tiger is hitting 175 yards, it's a 7-iron or 8-iron,
most likely an 8-iron. That is just a different way of playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure you can do that with the golf ball we used to
play with because it had so much spin on it. Today you can tailor a
golf ball to your game a little bit more than you could then. You
can get a low spin-rate ball, whatever you want. We couldn't do
that. We played with what was available.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Nicklaus enjoyed watching Woods play golf, he also
enjoyed Woods the young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pleasant young man to play with; he couldn't have been
nicer,'' Nicklaus said. ``He has a good sense of humor. He enjoys
joking around a little bit. If I'm passing the baton, I couldn't
pass it to a nicer young man who is obviously the cream of the crop
right now by a mile.''
</P>
<P>
   And a young man with the Hogan work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the tape,'' Tiger Woods said, alluding to
Sunday's duel, ``I already know what I need to work on, but maybe
I'll see something else to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hogan would appreciate that. &QL;

ACCORD IS REACHED FOR MOST WORKERS IN PHONE WALKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EXCLUSIVE; 10:00 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)  
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two unions representing more than 86,000 striking telephone
workers reached a contract agreement Sunday with the United States'
largest telecommunications employer, Verizon Communications,
indicating that organized labor still has a place in the New
Economy.
</P>
<P>
   Although about one-third of the union locals had still not
signed off on the settlement by Sunday evening, the company and the
union leaders said the 15-day strike was effectively over. They
said union workers in the region affected by the strike _ 12 states
from Maine to Virginia and the District of Columbia _ could begin
returning to their jobs as soon as Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The first task for Verizon will be to try to work down a backlog
of telephone repair and new-service orders that has risen to 90,000
_ one-third more than normal _ since the strike began Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Under the three-year contract agreement, the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers secured numerous concessions from Verizon, which is the
nation's largest provider of wireless and local telephone services,
with 260,000 employees around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The unions secured a 12 percent wage increase, over three years,
for a work force that was already one of the best paid in the
telecommunications industry. The average hourly base pay for a
customer service representative in New York, $26, would increase to
$29.25 in the contract's third year, for example. And in a
new-economy wrinkle, each of Verizon's union workers will, for the
first time, receive a small grant of stock options.
</P>
<P>
   But the broader significance of the agreement, and the reason
the negotiations have been closely watched throughout the
high-technology industry, involves issues that go beyond
traditional wage and benefit concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The unions have won the right to more easily organize workers in
Verizon's wireless division, where fewer than 50 of the division's
32,000 employees belong to a union. The unions also secured
Verizon's promise that union telephone workers will be given the
opportunity to do more work in fast-growing areas like the
installation of high-speed Internet lines _ an activity for which
Verizon has tended to use nonunion contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Those were key points for the unions because wireless and
Internet communications are growing much faster than the
conventional telephone business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contract is a breakthrough not just for our members who
work at Verizon but for workers throughout the telecommunications
industry,'' Larry Mancino, vice president of the Communications
Workers of America, which represents about 72,000 of the striking
employees, said in an interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The unions also secured agreements on several other issues that
reflected worker anxieties in the new economy, which is
characterized by big corporate mergers and an entrepreneurial ethic
in which the shorthand ``24/7'' _ meaning 24 hours a day, seven
days a week _ symbolizes the relentlessness of work in today's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon was created by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of GTE Corp.
and through the formation of a wireless venture with Vodafone
AirTouch of Britain. Union employees, particularly in the
Northeast, had been worried about the prospect of the company
transferring work to other, lower-paying parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The union members, especially customer service representatives,
had also sought relief from job stress resulting from long periods
of work with few breaks and frequent compulsory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon agreed to greater job stability for union members by
limiting the number of employees whose jobs could be moved to a
different region to 0.7 percent of the union workers in a given
geographic area. The measurement would be based on a geographic
area as small as a county, as the unions wanted, instead of an
across-the-board number, as the company wanted.
</P>
<P>
   On job-related stress, Verizon agreed to give customer service
representatives and telephone operators up to five 30-minute
periods each week during which they can do work other than taking
calls.
</P>
<P>
   And mandatory overtime for customer service representatives and
operators would be reduced. For example, operators who are single
mothers will be limited to as few as 7.5 hours a week of overtime
in some areas, down from as much as 20 hours before the strike.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Verizon (pronounced Vuh-RISE-on) was under various pressures to
settle the strike, which had already lasted longer than the token
walkout that the company had apparently expected. It had come at
the busiest time of year for the consumer telecommunications
industry, when many students are about to return to college and
will require new telephone and Internet access service.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the strike began, the company had also begun a
major advertising campaign to make people aware of its new name.
And lately, concern over the company's earnings have pushed
Verizon's share price near a two-year low. Since the strike began,
Verizon's stock has fallen more than 10 percent. It closed at
$42.4375 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad to put this strike behind us and move on,'' the
company's chief executive, Ivan Seidenberg, said in an interview
Sunday. ``I would say that every one of the unions' issues was
legitimate going forward. We've strengthened the fiber of our
company over the long-term with this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen how the agreement will be viewed
elsewhere in labor circles, by other big telecommunications
companies and by Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most wide-reaching contract settlements the
industry has seen,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent analyst of
the telecommunications industry. ``It'll be interesting to see
whether this will result in a more qualified work force or a ball
and chain around the company's leg.''
</P>
<P>
   The unions' right to organize Verizon's wireless division may be
the strike's most significant outcome. The unions won an important
concession allowing them to organize by card check, a process that
allows a given work site to join a union if a majority of its
employees sign cards saying they wish to do so. The process is
faster and less bureaucratic than holding elections.
</P>
<P>
   Under this part of the agreement, the employees at a work
location would join the union if 55 percent sign up through the
cards. The wireless agreement applies only to workers in the strike
region, where about a fourth of the 32,000 employees of the Verizon
Wireless division are located.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would include technicians, customer service
representatives and employees who work as customer sales
representative in the wireless division's retail stores. The
wireless unit has great wage disparities. Based on hourly wage
alone, not counting benefits, line installers at Verizon Wireless
make an average of $27.06 an hour _ 24 cents more than the average
hourly wage for their union counterparts at Verizon.

   (NYT12) COOS BAY, Ore. -- Aug. 20, 2000 -- ORE-LOGGING-2 -- For
places like Coos Bay, Ore., once the largest wood-products shipping
port in the world, there are some painful twists in the form of
technological advancement. These computer oriented jobs are not for
everybody. Some who have worked around trees or at the port all
their lives said they could not imagine being cooped up all day,
staring at a computer screen. A Coos Bay log-yard worker who tags
and sorts giant logs all day. (Shane Young/The New York Times)

   (NYT11) COOS BAY, Ore. -- Aug. 20, 2000 -- ORE-LOGGING-1 -- As
high-tech companies face an acute shortage of workers in many urban
areas, they have begun to branch out to areas of the country that
had been passed over by the boom, bringing jobs and training and
making inroads on the ``digital divide'' between America's urban
and rural regions. George Sjostrom, 59, is one Coos Bay, Ore.,
log-yard worker who has no plans to make the transition to a
computer job. ``I'm out of my world. I wouldn't have any idea what
to do with a computer,'' says Sjostrom, who tags and sorts giant

help paying their bills and battling their insurance companies,
Sunday. ``Our ability to do something about health care depends on

ANGELS WIN WITH `LITTLE BALL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The irony of the Anaheim Angels' 5-4 win over the New
York Yankees on Sunday afternoon was not lost on anybody in the
Angels clubhouse. Not when the little things mean so much.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon hit his Angels-record 224th career home run, which
was the 194th of the season by the team, also a record. But what
ultimately won the game before a Yankee Stadium crowd of 50,048 on
Whitey Ford Day was what Angels manager Mike Scioscia likes to call
``little ball.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of well-timed stolen bases and a couple of seeing-eye
singles gave the Angels the lead. The bullpen held it, with
Shigetoshi Hasegawa getting Paul O'Neill on a liner to left for the
final out with the potential tying run on second base.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa has six saves in six opportunities this season, and is
three for three since Troy Percival went to the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels left New York for Boston on Sunday night with a split
in the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it was the way we won,'' Scioscia said. ``We
manufactured runs, the bullpen held it. That's what's gratifying.
The way we won the ballgame, the way we held the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Yankees who held a lead in the early innings, as
Yankees starter David Cone baffled the Angels hitters with his
array of pitches and arm angles. He shut out the Angels on two hits
through six innings, but grew tired, having made 96 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre turned to his bullpen to preserve the
3-0 lead his team built against Angels starter Matt Wise. The
Angels immediately took advantage as Salmon followed a walk to Mo
Vaughn with a two-run homer off Mike Stanton to cut the Yankees'
lead to 3-2 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon was happy to see Cone leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playing whiffle ball,'' he said. ``You feel he's one
step ahead of you because he's got so many pitches and so many arm
angles.''
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Torre brought in reliever Jeff Nelson to face
Troy Glaus, who walked, and then stole second without a throw.
After Bengie Molina struck out for the second out of the inning,
Adam Kennedy cued one inside third and into shallow left field for
an RBI single that tied the game at 3.
</P>
<P>
   Torre again went to his bullpen, this time for left-hander Randy
Choate to face switch-hitter Kevin Stocker. Choate, though, didn't
pay enough attention to Kennedy, who got such a good jump he also
stole second without a throw.
</P>
<P>
   Then Stocker, down in the count, 0-2, blooped one into right
field for an RBI single and a 4-3 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aggressive running the bases,'' Scioscia said.
``Sometimes you can steal some bags. We stole some bags today that
helped us win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A.K. (Kennedy) hits the flare, Stocker gets the jam job, you
needs those,'' Salmon said. ``It's a testament to our guys' ability
to battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise (2-1) stuck around long enough to earn the victory, his
second in a row. He threw six innings and allowed three runs and
six hits, a linescore similar to his first two starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every start he's had has been almost cloned,'' Scioscia said.
``You can't ask for anything else. He threw strikes, he doesn't
scare off and he made pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise focused on staying composed, not easy to do for young
players new to Yankee Stadium. ``It was a lot of fun today,'' Wise
said. ``My dad (Larry) flew out, and it was probably more fun for
him. He might have had a heart attack, though, I'll have to make
sure he's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels increased their lead to 5-3 in the eighth on Vaughn's
RBI double, and it turned out they needed it. Yankees designated
hitter Glenallen Hill hit a solo homer off Mike Holtz in the bottom
of the eighth to make it 5-4. Scioscia turned it over in the ninth
to Hasegawa, who eventually got the last out with two runners on
base.

COMMENTARY: PARSING GORE'S SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  By   WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON  &UR; _  &LR; In his acceptance speech, Al Gore came across as
earnest and knowledgeable. He did not descend into discomfiting
sentiment, as he did twice before, and he overcame his habit of
speaking in slow condescension.
</P>
<P>
   His was a meat-and-potatoes populist speech. Gore's ``I will not
let you down'' separated him from the president who did. Similar
criticism of the poll-driven Clinton could be inferred from
``Sometimes you have to be willing to spend your popularity in
order to pick the hard right over the easy wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gore's device of audience involvement worked well. He
dramatized welfare reform, subsidized drugs for seniors, federal
subsidy for local schools and ire at HMOs by focusing on individual
faces, adding impact to the television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting his own-manmanship, Gore wrote the speech himself. But
to break from banality, that speech needed a rewrite. Fancy oratory
is not eloquence, but original expression makes an address
memorable and a decent respect for rhetoric is needed to do justice
to history.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his feeble attempt to build upon John Kennedy's
thematic signature, which 40 years before had transfixed the
audience in that venue. ``From this city that marked both the end
of America's journey westward and the beginning of the New
Frontier,'' said Gore, ``let us set out on a new journey to the
best America. A new journey on which we advance not by the turning
of wheels, but by the turning of our minds . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Turning from what toward what? Tentatively trying out the New
Journey as his slogan, Gore stumbled at the first step.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast his labored mechanical metaphor of wagon wheels
grinding westward with the fresh and beautiful evocation of the
frontier theme by his running mate the night before:
</P>
<P>
   ``We may wonder where the next frontier really is,'' Joe
Lieberman said. ``Tonight I believe that the next frontier isn't
just in front of us, but inside of us, to overcome the differences
that are still between us, to break down the barriers that remain .
. .'' You can find plain metaphorical nourishment in his phrase
``isn't just in front of us, but inside of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's fake apology _ ``sometimes people say I'm too serious,
that I talk too much substance and policy'' _ reminded me of
Nixon's ``some of my advisers have suggested I take the easy way.''
(As a White House speechwriter, I often advised ``take the easy
way!'' so I could submit a draft in which Nixon could say he
rejected that counsel.)
</P>
<P>
   When Gore tried to make a phrase, he demonstrated his need for
editorial improvement. ``In this City of Angels,'' he offered in a
lame peroration, ``we can summon the better angels of our nature.''
That was merely a play on words, and a few remembered that in 1988,
Vice President George Bush said that prosperity's purpose was to
allow us ``to pursue our better angels.''
</P>
<P>
   But let's see what a great rewriter once did with that same
figure of speech:
</P>
<P>
   As civil war loomed, William Seward, named by Lincoln to be
Secretary of State, suggested lines for the end of the first
inaugural address. ``I close. We are not, we must not be, aliens or
enemies, but fellow countrymen and brethren.'' Lincoln rewrote: ``I
am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mystic chords,'' suggested Seward, ``which, proceeding
from so many battlefields and so many patriot graves, pass through
all the hearts and hearths in the broad continent of ours, will yet
again harmonize in their ancient music when breathed upon by the
guardian angel of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, in his rewrite of this passage, transformed Seward's
musical metaphor from oratory to poetry by changing not only its
cadence but the source of the heavenly intervention:
</P>
<P>
   ``The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield
and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over
this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again
touched, as they surely will be, by the better angels of our
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   To be your own man does not require that you be your own sole
writer. Creative revision by another pair of eyes helps a speech
rise to a great occasion. Gore should remember Lincoln's
collaborative peroration as he dreams of his own Inaugural Address.
</P>

COMMENTARY: THIS IS CLASS WARFARE? 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``This is my tranquillity,'' said Jose Valles.
``Sitting here waiting for the bus. Because most of the time I am
stressed. Why? I will tell you. Because I don't have enough
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Valles earns his living serving hamburgers at a McDonald's
restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. He's a family man. He and his
wife, Lily, have two children, a boy, 9, and a girl, 6. He talked
about his family's circumstances while waiting in the hot sun last
Thursday afternoon for the No. 60 bus at the corner of Seventh and
Alameda Streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard. It's rough,'' he said. ``You don't have the nice
kiss on the cheek or the `Hello, honey, how are you?' when you come
home from work. It's `What the hell are we gonna do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I make $5.75 an hour. That's about $240 a week. One hundred
ninety dollars after taxes. You can't really live on that. Lily
works in a fast-food place, too. She makes the same as me. Two
weeks of my pay and two weeks of her pay every month goes for rent.
Then you have to pay the fare to go back and forth to work. You
gotta pay for your food. You have bills. We're still paying on the
sofa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, it's stressing me out just thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Valles what he and his family did for recreation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take the kids to the park.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked if they ever went on vacation. He looked at me as if I'd
asked if his children could fly. ``No,'' said Valles quietly.
``There is no money for vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Valleses are among the millions of working families Vice
President Al Gore is trying to connect with as he travels the
country promising to fight for ``those who need a champion, those
who need to be lifted up so they are never left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have denounced this effort to reach out to
working families _ to build, as Gore says, a ``better, fairer, more
prosperous America'' _ as divisive. It's dangerous, we're told.
Un-American.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is ``a candidate who wants to wage class warfare to get
ahead,'' said George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the intersection of greed and paranoia. We may be
enjoying good times, but the wealthy are not yet wealthy enough _
at least in the view of the GOP _ to accede to a little bit of help
for the likes of Jose Valles and his family.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush already gift-wrapping most of the nation's projected
surplus, which he intends to hand over to the very wealthiest among
us, it's fair to ask who's waging war on whom.
</P>
<P>
   In our conversation last week, Valles mentioned politics just
once. ``The politicians keep saying they are going to raise the
minimum wage, but nothing happens,'' he said. ``A minimum wage
increase would help everybody, not just me.''
</P>
<P>
   Class warfare? Let's see. The Democrats have been trying without
success to raise the minimum wage _ now $5.15 an hour _ by a mere
$1 over the next two years. That's a whopping 50 cents an hour the
first year, and another 50 cents the year after. My goodness, is
that an attack on the rich? Is that what they mean by class
warfare?
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans in Congress have stood in the way of this most
modest of pay hikes for the nation's low-wage workers. Gore favors
the increase and says he'll fight for it. If that's class warfare,
we need more of it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, is getting a retirement
package worth an estimated $20 million from the Halliburton Co., an
energy services outfit that has a big financial stake in the
policies of the federal government. No problem, said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But a tiny boost in the minuscule minimum wage would seem to be
a different story.
</P>
<P>
   (The radical Texas Republican Party, at its convention in
Houston in June, declared that all minimum wage laws should be
repealed.)
</P>
<P>
   I asked Jose Valles how his life would change if he earned a few
more dollars a week. He said: ``I would do something nice for Lily.
I would buy some clothes for the children and try to take them to a
movie every now and then. My dream is to someday be able to invest
in a house.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'll tell you the truth. I would like for my kids to
go to college, which I was never able to do. I'm like all parents.
I would like the best for my children. I would like my children to
soar.''

U.S. WANTS VOLLEYBALL RENAISSANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USA Volleyball dusted off its history books to
regain its status as the world's dominant men's team.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Beal coached the United States to its first Olympic medal,
a gold at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. He left in 1986 to coach an
Italian club team, but the foundation was built. With primarily the
same players, the U.S. won every major international event, capping
the run with a second gold at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But the '90s were not kind.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. managed a bronze in '92 at Barcelona then crashed to
ninth in Atlanta four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Beal returned to the national team in 1997 shortly after the
Atlanta debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the most important points of emphasis for me to
our team right now is that they don't need to be like the 1984 or
1988 teams. They need to be like the 2000 team,'' Beal said.
</P>
<P>
   By Atlanta, the international edge the U.S. had over the world
wasn't the only problem as Olympics veteran Mike Lambert explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Beal) has brought some order to our chaos,'' said Lambert,
one of five 2000 members who played on the 1996 team. ``We are a
bunch of good athletes, and we have some good skills. He has
brought a system where we can all play together. I think he has
brought this team together in the sense that instead of being six
individuals out there, we are all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Beal's 1984 team featured a hybrid of veterans and hungry young
players that was blended into a gold-medal team.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 version has the aforementioned core group that has
played in the Olympic spotlight. The youth movement is led by
Highland High of Palmdale graduate Ryan Millar and former
Pepperdine standout George Roumain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a very diverse team,'' Beal said.
</P>
<P>
   And a dangerous one. The Americans went 10-2 in the prestigious
World League, which includes the world's top teams, before
faltering in the league's championship tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. is ranked sixth in the world and was drawn into a
difficult Olympics pool with world No. 1 Italy and No. 2 Russia.
But the U.S. should be a medal threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team is a very competitive team (and can compete)
with anybody in the world,'' said Beal, whose staff includes former
Pepperdine coach Marv Dunphy, the head coach of the 1988 Seoul
gold-medal team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are the best team in the world, but I think
we're moving up. I think we're improving at a faster rate or at as
fast a rate as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert, Pepperdine product Jeff Nygaard and the other '96
veterans are hoping to redeem themselves after a disappointing
Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go out there and play with a lot of fire, emotion and
intensity, then teams have to play to compete with us,'' Lambert
said. ``I think we set the standard now for where the match is
going to go when we play our best. Teams have to try and keep up
with us. We're still kind of a young team, and we haven't peaked
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney would be a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   While Italy, Russia and defending gold medalist Cuba are the
favorites, there figures to be plenty of pressure on the Americans
to return to a sport they dominated in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect they are going to be edgy and anxious; that's part of
sports and you have to manage that emotion,'' Beal said. ``The
great players and the teams that achieve at a high level manage
that environment successfully.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Having found no signs of life more than a week after
the Russian submarine Kursk plunged to the bottom of the Barents
Sea, rescue teams were preparing a plan Sunday to use a ship's
crane to rip a hatch off the giant vessel and begin the grim task
of recovering bodies and a lengthy and dangerous mission to salvage
the submarine's twin nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   In their first full day of work, a team of Norwegian divers
working with the Russians found the rear escape hatch on the
490-foot vessel badly damaged, a Russian official said, and the
divers failed in repeated attempts to muscle it open by hand and
with powerful, special tools.
</P>
<P>
   The divers reported that hatchway valves had been opened from
the inside. It is likely that the body of one of the submarine's
118 crew members lies in the air lock chamber and that the chamber
is filled with water, said Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who
is heading the investigation into the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   His description of the grim discovery was broadcast by Russian
television from the deck of the cruiser Peter the Great and was
consistent with remarks Saturday by Vice Adm. Mikhail Mostak, chief
of staff of Russia's Northern Fleet, indicating that one or more
members of the Kursk crew may have tried to make a desperate escape
from the submarine, only to perish when seawater under great
pressure rushed in.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of frenetic work at a depth of more than 300 feet, the
Norwegian navy team sent back vivid pictures of the escape hatch
that has defied nearly a week of efforts to open it. The divers
pounded with hammers on the hull hoping that their soundings would
locate any remaining air pockets inside.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked in teams of three in six-hour shifts, the divers
sent up requests for special tools to turn the hatch valves, and
some tools were fabricated on board the Norwegian vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, two Norwegian divers flew by helicopter to the
Russian submarine base at Vidayevo, the Kursk's home port, to
practice opening and entering hatches on one of the Kursk's sister
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Planning was under way to rip the Kursk's hatch cover off by
force, according to Klebanov.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joint commission made a decision to open the top hatch of
the rescue lock chamber,'' he said, referring to the escape chamber
that passes through the hull, with inner and outer hatches that
allow emergency exit from the submarine. ``Unfortunately, they
failed to open it for several hours though very powerful tools have
been used.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision was made to try to rip it off with the help of a
crane on the Norwegian rescue ship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials reported that air pockets might still exist in
the compartment below the inner hatch, but they expressed no
expectations that any survivors could be found, though a Norwegian
military spokesman in Oslo, Kjell Grandhagen, said, ``We are still
working on the theory that we are looking for possible survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway's Rear Adm. Einar Skorgen, who is directing the Norwegian
rescue contingent, said the timing of the hatch removal was not
set. ``We have to clarify the consequences of opening it,'' he told
Norwegian television.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent cooperative spirit among Russian, British and
Norwegian rescue crews was somewhat undermined Sunday night when
the spokesman for the Norwegian armed forces, speaking in Oslo,
contradicted Klebanov's statements that the escape hatch was too
severely damaged to be opened manually, or with the British LR5
rescue submarine that arrived on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not drawn the conclusion that the hatch is so damaged
that it cannot be opened,'' the spokesman, John Epsen Lien, told
Reuters. ``We think it should be possible to open it with a British
or Russian rescue capsule.''
</P>
<P>
   (British officials said in London early Monday that Russia had
asked Britain to send its rescue mini-submarine down to the Kursk,
Reuters said.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Klebanov had said that video images of the hatch showed
a serious crack in the donut-shaped ring around it that is used to
create an airtight seal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we think the British sub will not be able to
dock,'' Klebanov said, adding that he believed that the Norwegian
divers would agree to enter the Kursk after studying the entryway
on one of the Kursk's sister ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their commander is now asking them who will go and it is
already clear that someone will go,'' Klebanov said.
``Psychologically, it is very difficult but there is assuredness
that several people will agree and the operation will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian officials have yet to confirm that their divers will
enter the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   What lies ahead after the hatch is opened is a complex and
dangerous investigation of the Kursk's nine compartments. Dangerous
battery acids, unexploded weapons and highly radioactive fuel
elements in the Kursk's twin reactors could pose a serious danger
to the recovery operation.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have speculated about plans to lift the rear
section of the submarine with surface ships and drag the vessel to
shallower water for easier access by salvage divers. With winter
already approaching in the Arctic region, it seemed possible that
the salvage operation could carry over to next spring, but Russian
officials have as yet given no definite accounting of their plans.
</P>
<P>
   As the Norwegian divers worked Sunday, Russian President
Vladimir Putin met in Moscow with senior clergymen of the Russian
Orthodox Church and expressed the powerlessness he felt over the
loss of the 118-member crew.
</P>
<P>
   The attack submarine went down Aug. 12 during military
maneuvers. Two explosions apparently ripped through the hull of the
submarine as it was running at periscope depth, and sent it
crashing to the seabed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With sorrow in our hearts and, I do not exaggerate, tears in
our eyes, we are following all that is happening in the Barents
Sea,'' he said. ``The sailors are doing everything they can to save
their comrades, but, alas, sometimes events _ and not us _ dictate
the logic of how a situation develops.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``until the last minute we will do all that can
be done to save whomever can be saved. We will struggle for the
lives of each of our sailors, and hope for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Putin remained at the Kremlin Sunday, despite calls for
him to travel to Severomorsk, the naval headquarters near the scene
of the disaster, the Russian president held a long conversation
with Igor Spassky, Russia's leading submarine designer.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's public remarks, delivered in an unusually somber and
deliberate tone as he stood in front of the golden brocade walls of
one of the churches inside the Kremlin walls, appeared in part to
be in response to a swell of criticism that the Russian military,
and Putin personally, were too slow to seek foreign assistance in
the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   An investigating commission, headed by Klebanov, announced on
Saturday that preliminary findings showed that the Kursk was
involved in a collision with an object near the surface weighing
8,000 tons or more. He said it was possible that the object was a
ship or an old mine.
</P>
<P>
   Or, Klebanov said, some unknown chain of events could have
triggered a massive internal explosion aboard the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Russian officials say most of the crew died in the
first two minutes after the explosion, including all officers on
the bridge. They say that the pressure of seawater rushing in
compressed the air in the hull and reduced the chances for survival
beyond a few days.

<P>
   CLINTON, Iowa _ If you think you know Al Gore, you should have
seen him just around midnight this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After an impassioned speech late Saturday night, the denim-clad
Gore suddenly grabbed his wife Tipper and boogied on stage as a
local rock band cranked up a hot blues number and confetti rained
down upon the dancing couple.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, which had gathered hours earlier, roared its delight.
Some in the crowd marveled: Who is this guy?
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in accepting the Democratic Party's presidential
nomination last week, assured voters that he is his ``own man'' and
that in the coming weeks they would see ``who I truly am.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fun-loving Al Gore that has rocked the Mark Twain
campaign boat down the Mississippi River the last three days is
somewhat of a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to be serious enough on Sunday, however,
rendezvousing with his vice-presidential running mate, Joseph
Lieberman, and again promising to take on special interests on
behalf of working families and outlining plans ranging from
providing seniors with a prescription drug benefit under Medicare
to giving patients a bill of rights on their own health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to know the facts?'' Gore asked a crowd in
Muscatine, Iowa, to which they shouted, ``Yes!'' ``Am I giving you
too many specifics?'' he said. ``No!'' they roared back.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said a key goal of the new Democratic administration
would be to reach out to the 44 million Americans without health
insurance, many of them children.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman noted that under Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, Texas had among the highest rates of
uninsured women and children in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush says don't mess with Texas, but when it comes to
health care, it is a mess in Texas,'' said Lieberman, who joined
back up with Gore after his Sabbath observance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's fired-up demeanor on the weekend was shared by the
crowds, which have swelled in recent days. Many of those in
attendance have been recent converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people are getting on board,'' said Terry
Willits, a 42-year-old Iowa attorney who was at the rally for Gore
in Clinton near midnight Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched his convention speech with friends, and I remember
someone saying, 'He looks like he took a personality pill,''' she
to the Reuters news agency. ``He was great, and he told us exactly
what he planned to do as president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago, I was worried. I didn't think Al Gore had a
chance. Today, I think he is going to win,'' Willits said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fun Al'' first appeared Friday morning as he and Lieberman
boarded the Mark Twain for the four-day, 400-mile trip down the
Mississippi River through five Midwestern swing states.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters asked him whether he was trying to send any kind of
signal to the voters with the lingering kiss he gave Tipper just
before his acceptance speech the night before in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to send Tipper a signal,'' he replied,
mischievously.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early Saturday afternoon, Gore burst unannounced into the
press section of the campaign riverboat to catch a group of
television producers and camera operators in a game of poker.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed mock horror and, tongue-in-cheek, demanded
``campaign journalism reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, during an evening birthday party for his wife on the open
top deck of the boat, Gore occasionally used a bullhorn to make
small talk with campers and other people in sparsely populated
areas along the banks of the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice shirt,'' he called to one person in the river darkness, a
scene reminiscent of Bill Clinton's microphone chit-chat _ ``I like
your dog!'' _ with people who lived along the tracks his
slow-moving campaign train took through the Midwest in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need your help,'' Gore shouted to another group in the
darkness of the river. Then, with the bullhorn off, he added,
almost in a whisper: ``The boat is sinking.''
</P>
<P>
   And even later Saturday, when his campaign boat pulled into the
dam and lock just north of this Iowa city, hundreds of well-wishers
looked a bit surprised when they heard the Rolling Stones's
sexually suggestive song ``Brown Sugar'' and its famous ``just
around midnight'' refrain blaring from the boat's sound system.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing prepared Gore's campaign entourage for the sight of
Al and Tipper boogie-ing on the stage in Clinton. No one, not even
longtime aides to the vice president, could recall him ever dancing
at a campaign event _ at the Clinton-Gore inaugurations, sure, but
not at a campaign rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is finding his own voice,'' campaign spokesman Chris
Lehane deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with his presidential campaign stumbling, Gore got
unsolicited advice from Clinton: ``Have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And ever since embarking on his Mississippi trip, Gore appears
to be having the time of his political life.
</P>
<P>
   A big contributor has been the unprecedented bounce he has
received in the polls since the convention, such as the CNN-USA
Today Gallup poll released Sunday. That poll had Gore at 47
percent, Bush at 46 percent, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader at 3
percent and Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan at 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 697 likely voters taken Friday and Saturday had an
error margin of (+/-) 4 percentage points. That same poll right
before the convention showed Bush 16 points ahead of Gore, 55
percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush communications director Karen Hughes, appearing on ``Fox
News Sunday,'' cautioned against putting ``too much stock in the
instant polls taken in the immediate aftermath of a convention.''
She noted that Walter Mondale surged ahead of Ronald Reagan in 1984
in some polls but eventually lost the race.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   History aside, Gore's newfound giddiness in the trail is
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   During his speeches, Gore works in the messages from homemade
signs he sees in the crowd into his remarks. Sometimes, he engages
members of the crowd in a brief conversation before going on to the
issue of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the speeches, he remains as long as his
schedule will allow to shake hands, reaching deep into the crowds
that have swelled with each day of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   He slaps hands with children and toddlers and tweaks the noses
of babies.
</P>
<P>
   He poses for pictures and signs autographs.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike previous campaigns, he hugs and hugs and hugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be fired up,'' said Julia Heinzelman, a
middle-aged high school teacher in Dubuque, Iowa, one of the
riverboat stops. ``So much politics happens on TV, and TV is
supposed to be a cool medium. But I'm tired of the coolness. It's
time to get hot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting warmed up,'' Gore remarked to one crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's closest friends have long insisted that the vice
president is fun-loving and funny, but the American public has
rarely gotten a glimpse of ``Fun Al.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though Gore insists that the presidential contest with
Texas Gov. George W. Bush is not a personality contest, you can
expect to see more of ``Fun Al'' after his life on the Mississippi
is over.

DAVID EDELSTEIN, JUDGE IN IBM AND TEAMSTERS CASES, DIES AT 90

By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein, who in his 48
years on the bench presided over two of the Justice Department's
most historic undertakings _ the antitrust action against IBM and
the ongoing effort to rid the Teamsters union of corruption _ died
on Saturday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed by President Truman on Nov. 1, 1951, Edelstein served
as chief judge of the Southern District of New York from 1971 to
1980 and for years was the longest-sitting active judge in the
country. He became eligible for senior status, a sort of
semiretirement, in 1975 but did not take it until 1994, and he
continued to hear cases until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Still among his caseload was U.S. v. the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, the landmark lawsuit first brought by the
Justice Department in 1988, and he continued to play an active role
in the efforts to monitor the union. In June, he rejected the rules
proposed by the union and the Justice Department for next year's
Teamsters elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The submissions are a farrago of ill advice and misguided,
inept, controversial and confused argots,'' he wrote in language
that reflected his reputation for being one of the most thoughtful
and irascible personalities on the bench. ``Their program has the
potential of bringing grief, strife, controversy and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long before his death, however, Edelstein approved a set of
rules for next year's union elections, one of countless decisions
he made over the years aimed at keeping the powerful truckers'
union free of criminal influence. It was Edelstein who approved a
review board decision in 1998 to expel Ron Carey, the union's
former president. And it was a decision by Edelstein in March 1999
that cleared the way for James P. Hoffa to take the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District, said
Sunday: ``Judge Edelstein was a dedicated jurist who was dogged in
his pursuit of justice. His work, in particular on the Teamsters
litigation, will stand as an impressive legacy to his judicial
courage and intellect.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein's reputation for doggedness stemmed from his long role
in the government's antitrust action against International Business
Machines, which was first brought in 1952 when the company's main
business was punch-card technology. In 1956, he signed a consent
order under which IBM agreed to modify some of its business
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Justice Department's current action against Microsoft,
the IBM case had been considered the most important antitrust
action in modern judicial history. But in the end Edelstein was
apparently too dogged, and in 1995 a federal appeals court granted
IBM's request and ordered him off the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it manifestly clear that a reasonable observer would
question the judge's impartiality on the pending issue,'' Chief
Judge Jon O. Newman of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote
in a rare rebuke of a fellow judge. The appellate decision ordered
the case re-assigned.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Edelstein had been overseeing the IBM case for
about 43 years. Before his removal, he had opened an inquiry into
why the Justice Department wanted to drop its case against IBM and
had refused to approve several orders jointly proposed by the
company and the Justice Department to throw out billions of pages
of documents that had accumulated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   David Norton Edelstein was born on Feb. 16, 1910, into a
middle-class family in New York City. He attended public schools
and then Fordham University, earning a bachelor's, a master's and a
law degree.
</P>
<P>
   He paid his way through college and law school by working as a
page boy at the New York Stock Exchange from 1929 to 1932 and was a
firsthand witness to the devastating effects of the great crash.
</P>
<P>
   He worked in private law practice in New York and in the claims
division of the Justice Department before becoming an assistant
U.S. attorney in 1945. He became a special assistant to the U.S.
Attorney General in the lands division in 1947 and was assistant
U.S. attorney general in the customs division from 1948 until 1951
when he was appointed to the bench after Truman's first choice
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   His nomination was opposed by the American Bar Association, the
Association of the Bar of the City of New York and the New York
State Bar Association, which said that he lacked trial experience.
Nevertheless, he was confirmed by the Senate in April 1952 and went
on to one of the longest careers on the bench in what is arguably
the highest profile District Court in the country.
</P>
<P>
   He became chief judge in 1971 on the basis of seniority, and
remained in the post until 1980 when, at the age of 70, tradition
dictated that he step aside. But he remained an active judge,
overseeing the IBM saga and numerous other cases, including the
1984 trial of state Sen. Joseph R. Pisani of New Rochelle on
charges of tax evasion and embezzling campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   The jury convicted Pisani on 18 of 39 counts and acquitted him
of 11 counts, but it was unable to reach a verdict on 10 counts
that made up a large chunk of the government's case, including
allegations that Pisani used $20,000 in state funds to buy a summer
house. Edelstein declared a mistrial on those 10 counts. Pisani's
convictions were reversed on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Edelstein showed particular disdain for
perpetrators of crimes of greed. In 1983, he ordered six wholesale
bakers that had been charged with price-fixing in supplying
doughnuts and pastries to coffee shops and restaurants to provide
the needy with up to $1,200 worth of free baked goods each week for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1987, Edelstein allowed Rudolph Giuliani, then U.S.
attorney for the Southern District, to seize property to prevent a
defendant in a drug case from hiring a high-priced defense lawyer.
``In the same manner that a defendant cannot obtain a Rolls-Royce
with the fruits of a crime, he cannot be permitted to obtain the
services of the Roll-Royce of attorneys from these same tainted
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein, who lived in Manhattan, is survived by his wife of 60
years, the former Florence Koch, and two sons, Jonathan and
Jeffrey, both of New York City.

METS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DODGERS' GIVEAWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the ninth inning of a close game, there was
nobody sitting in the front row of seats beside the camera box near
the Mets dugout at Dodger Stadium. So when Mark Grudzielanek hit a
foul pop and Mets catcher Mike Piazza tumbled over the fence to
catch it, he landed on the concrete ground.
</P>
<P>
   A phalanx of Mets bolted from the dugout. Piazza was bruised,
but fine. He emerged with the ball in hand, and Manager Bobby
Valentine slapped him five. Moments later, Armando Benitez finished
off a 9-6 Mets victory. The Dodgers had handed them the game in the
eighth, and it is hard to blame their fans for bolting the crime
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have won 21 of the last 27 games, and have not lost two
games in a row in a month; as Valentine noted, they made their own
breaks in the decisive inning. With the score tied, 6-6, Mike
Bordick and Darryl Hamilton singled off Terry Adams to open the
eighth. Lenny Harris bounced a ball back to Adams, and, as Harris
said, ``Everything collapsed right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bordick was running from third on contact, and Adams had him
nailed. The pitcher threw to third baseman Adrian Beltre, but
Beltre's throw floated high over catcher Todd Hundley's head,
skipping to the backstop.
</P>
<P>
   Two runs scored there, and another came in after Grudzielanek
let a grounder scoot through his legs. The Mets gave a three-run
lead to John Franco and Benitez, and as usual, the game was
essentially over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is foolish enough to believe people are invincible or
can't be gotten to, but there's no doubts when that situation
arises,'' said Mets first baseman Todd Zeile. ``I think everyone's
as confident as could be in those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco worked a perfect eighth and Benitez a perfect ninth for
his 33rd save. Turk Wendell (6-4) pitched two innings for the
victory, and Dennis Cook got an important out to end the fifth
after the Dodgers had taken a lead off Bobby J. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidence every time,'' said Benitez, who, like
Franco, has not allowed an earned run since June 21. ``I can trust
all those guys in the bullpen, and they can trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers can not trust themselves. They are one game over
.500 since trading Piazza to Florida in May 1998, and just two
games over .500 despite a $98 million payroll this year. ``We can't
make the plays when we need them,'' said Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson. ``You can't be a championship club that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are looking more and more like a champion, despite
losing a game on their wild card lead, which is three and a half
games over Arizona. On a day when Piazza - who also collided with
the concrete back wall to make a catch in the second _ went 0 for
5, teammates like Harris picked him up.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was 2 for 4 with a home run that briefly gave the Mets a
lead in the sixth inning. He romped around the bases after his home
run, tearing through a lineup of high fives as he came back to the
Mets dugout. He is 35 years old and his energy is boundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get late in the season, you need someone to kind of
get guys going, get people pumped up,'' said Hamilton. ``It was
flowing with him today. He was excited.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a measure of this game's wildness that so much action
happened in the ninth spot of the Mets' order, which was first
occupied by Jones, who is 0 for 31 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones came up in the second inning with a runner on second and
one out. He struck out, but Hundley missed the pitch and Jones
reached first on a passed ball. A single by Lenny Harris knocked in
a run, and when Hundley threw wildly to center on a stolen base
attempt, Jones scored to put the Mets ahead, 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley made amends in the bottom of the inning with the first
of two home runs, and a run-scoring double by Shawn Green cut the
Mets lead to 4-3 in the third. They seemed poised to break things
open in the fourth, when Jones came up as the leadoff batter and
walked.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort looked distraught, removing his cap and wiping his
brow. He walked Harris on four pitches, and Derek Bell sacrificed
the runners. But Dreifort got tough, striking out Edgardo Alfonzo _
who earlier slugged an opposite-field, two-run homer _ and getting
Piazza to fly to the center field warning track.
</P>
<P>
   That was the second of three times Piazza flied to the center
field track; other Mets had to do the bashing Sunday. That happened
in the sixth, when Bubba Trammell pinch-hit for Cook, who had
relieved Jones after a Karros single gave the Dodgers a 5-4 lead in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort fell behind Trammell, 2-0, and Trammell crushed a
sinker into the left field bullpen for his second Mets homer.
Harris followed with a home run deep into the bleachers in right,
finishing Dreifort's erratic outing and putting the Mets up, 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, a single by Green eluded Harris in left field,
and his error brought in a run to tie the score. But Wendell picked
Green off second _ ``If he slides, he probably safe,'' Wendell
said. ``He wasn't off the bag by much'' _ and the Dodgers had
scored for the last time. Franco and Benitez made sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how good our bullpen is,'' Hamilton said. ``If we can
give it to those guys, we're sitting pretty.'' &QL;

LABOR DEPARTMENT JOINS LIBBY PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Labor Department has become the second cabinet-level agency
to launch an investigation of how the government failed in its duty
to warn miners in Libby, Mont., that they were being exposed to
lethal levels of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation could force a re-examination of federal
policies governing asbestos exposure that have put at risk tens of
thousands of workers who mine or handle vermiculite, talc and other
contaminated minerals.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Dalton, acting inspector general for the Labor
Department, said Sunday the investigation is focusing on the
actions or lack of actions by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Both
are part of the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   National experts in occupational medicine and union officials
applauded Dalton's action and said that the findings of her team
could help rectify serious deficiencies in how OSHA and MSHA
regulate worker exposure to asbestos today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job of the Department of Labor is to protect America's
workers,'' Dalton said. ``We take very seriously our responsibility
of ensuring that the programs _ including OSHA and MSHA _ work
efficiently and effectively. There can be no shortcuts tolerated
when it comes to the health and safety of workers.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA already investigating
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency's inspector general is
conducting a similar examination of its role at the now-closed
vermiculite mine owned by W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. in Libby. Five auditors
for that agency completed their first round of interviews last week
with miners and their family members who are dying from exposure to
asbestos contained in the vermiculite ore.
</P>
<P>
   All major agencies have an inspector general, appointed by the
president, confirmed by Congress and instructed to act as watchdogs
over the actions of the federal department to which they are
assigned. Their findings are submitted to Congress, which has
responded to several inspector generals' inquiries by taking
legislative action.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph McGowan, spokesman for the Labor Department's inspector
general, said its investigation will go back to decisions made in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to know what happened years ago in this (asbestos)
issue to understand what's happening today,'' Dalton said. ``Our
concerns are whether there are systemic problems in either OSHA,
MSHA or both that may have taken root in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   At Libby, scores of inspections conducted by federal mine
inspectors repeatedly reported the same dangerous levels of
asbestos. OSHA and its research arm, the National Institute of
Occupations Safety and Health, did their own studies confirming the
hazard, but there is no indication that the agencies warned anyone
but Grace management.
</P>
<P>
   `Maybe we can stop it'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time that someone inside the government is trying
to find out what happened,'' said Don Judge, head of the Montana
AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 18 years people have been allowed to become sick and die
because officials in Washington, D.C. made a decision not to tell
these workers about the dangers in Libby's ore. If we can find out
who made that decision, whether it was in the EPA, OSHA or MSHA or
all of them, maybe we can stop it from happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalton says she and her team had been ``closely following the
Libby matter'' and is working closely with EPA's inspector general,
Nikki Tinsley.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that
hundreds of miners and their family members died or were sickened
from exposure to the asbestos-tainted vermiculite ore.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, the P-I showed that millions of pounds of the
dangerous ore had been shipped to processing plants throughout
North America. In some cities, 50 percent or more of the workers at
the processing plants had died from asbestos-related disease.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and union officials who deal daily with workers dying
from asbestos exposure urged the inspector general to get to the
root of what they say is the most serious problem _ how OSHA
determined which asbestos fibers it would regulate.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wright, health and safety director for the United Steel
Workers of America, says there are many important questions that
must be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade ago, George Bush's OSHA made a decision to define
these asbestos fibers as if they were almost harmless. We applaud
the Department of Labor for starting an investigation of that
decision and its consequences,'' Wright said in an interview from
Pittsburgh. ``We'll support that investigation any way we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern for other miners
</P>
<P>
   The mine at Libby closed in 1990. But suspected asbestos
contamination at other mines _ vermiculite mines in Virginia and
South Carolina, talc mines in New York and taconite mines in the
Iron Range of Minnesota and Michigan _ continues to concern health
experts who have seen workers suffer with asbestosis and
asbestos-related cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Harbut has treated thousands of patients with
asbestos-caused disease. He said the investigation of OSHA's and
MSHA's handing of asbestos exposure is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that the inspector general will have the courage to
examine what political and industry pressure was really exerted on
OSHA years ago when it was setting its standard for what type of
asbestos the government will regulate,'' said Harbut, former
chairman of the occupational and environmental medicine section of
the American College of Chest Physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every well-trained physician who treats asbestosis in miners _
taconite, talc or vermiculite _ sees a terminal disease process
caused by the precise asbestos minerals that the mining and
manufacturing industries got OSHA to exclude from the
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   OSHA says that workers cannot be exposed to more than .1
asbestos fibers per cubic centimeter of air, a limit OSHA admits
will still cause some cancers. But MSHA's regulations allow miners
to be exposed to 20 times the limit set by OSHA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disparity just isn't sane,'' Harbut says. ``The inspector
general clearly faces a difficult task but it is one of enormous
importance. One that, over the years, could save the lives of
millions of workers.'
</P>
<P>
   A discredited report
</P>
<P>
   In June, the P-I reported on the death and illness from
asbestos-related diseases of workers at the Vanderbilt Talc Co.
mine in upstate New York. OSHA has acknowledged its decision in
1992 not to regulate fibers found in the talc was based, in part,
on an unauthorized and discredited report that downplayed the risks
faced by workers. That report, characterized by the inspector
general of the Department of Health and Human Services as an
``inappropriate collaboration,'' was done by Vanderbilt officials
and two NIOSH scientists who hid their work from their agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanderbilt mine produces talc used in most crayons
manufactured in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Consumer Product Safety Commission confirmed
the P-I's findings that some crayons were contaminated with low
levels of anthophyllite and tremolite, two types of asbestos
fibers. But CPSC also found even higher levels of so-called
``transitional fibers'' _ minerals that doctors say cause cancer
and other asbestos-related diseases but are not one of the six
forms of asbestos regulated by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Semantics. Thats what this fiber issue is coming down to,''
said Ronald Medford, assistant executive director of hazards
identification at the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The
fibers his agency found were almost identical in structure to the
asbestos that the government can regulate ``and therefore, we think
they shouldn't be in crayons,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   After the CPSC's findings, crayon manufacturers announced that
they would remove all talc from crayons within a year.
</P>
<P>
   `One bright sign'
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerrold Abraham, a professor of pathology at New York's
Upstate Medical University, not only has studied the Vanderbilt
talc, but also the lungs of the people who mine it in biopsies and
autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the inspector general's inquiry ``one bright sign in a
dismal parade of government inaction'' but worries about the safety
of the workers who are still handling the tainted talc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large amount of fibers that CPSC found in the Vanderbilt
talc used by crayon and other manufacturers is asbestos and kills
like asbestos, even though OSHA buckled under to industry pressure
and refused to regulate it. I can only hope that the inspector
general will try to determine how many thousands of workers in
scores of industries died or are now at risk because of this lack
of government integrity,'' Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
   The issues the inspectors are undertaking are complex and
technical, but Dalton says this isn't a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people have broad technical abilities, but for some
scientific and medical evaluations, we have used outside
consultants and specialists from other government agencies,'' she
said. ``If needed, we'll use them again in this examination.''
</P>
<P>
   McGowan said the time needed for the team to complete the
examination ``will depend on access to records and documents we
need and to individuals knowledgeable about what happened along the
way from Libby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a high degree of interest in this office about
getting to the bottom of it all,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As if Vice President Al Gore did not have enough
trouble in his native region, several prominent Southern
politicians of his own party have been keeping their distance from
him as they begin their own general election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates for governor in North Carolina and for
senator in Georgia have avoided appearing with Gore and skipped
last week's Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. The
governor of South Carolina left the convention early and has
dismissed Gore's chances in his state. Each has his own
explanation, and no one will confess to a deliberate snub of the
national ticket. But taken as a whole, their decisions seem to
illustrate the South's general indifference to Gore's appeal and
demonstrate how hard he will have to work to capture even a few
states in the region.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, held a rally in downtown Atlanta on Aug. 10, there was
no sign of Georgia's newest statewide Democratic candidate, Sen.
Zell Miller, the state's former governor. Miller was recently
appointed to replace the late Paul Coverdell, and has only a few
weeks to campaign to keep the job in a special election in
November. But rather than attend the convention, or spend the time
campaigning, he chose to spend last week on a private, unannounced
tour of Georgia's military bases, unaccompanied by reporters or
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate for governor of North Carolina, state
Attorney General Mike Easley, chose not to appear with Gore during
a June visit to meet with flood victims, although the two men met
privately. Easley has made it clear in various interviews that
campaigning with Gore is not a priority for him. Easley, in a
conference call, spoke to the North Carolina delegation at last
week's convention but was criticized by some delegates for not
appearing in person and for distancing himself from the ticket.
Campaign officials said he was too busy campaigning to go to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hodges, the Democratic governor of South Carolina, left the
convention rather conspicuously on Tuesday, before the acceptance
speeches of Gore and Lieberman. Hodges, who has had a rocky
political relationship with Gore, was quoted in The State, the
Columbia newspaper, as saying that Gov. George W. Bush has a ``99
percent'' chance of winning South Carolina, adding that he was not
planning to work hard for the ticket. Hodges is not up for
re-election this year, but is commanding a major campaign for a
November referendum to create a lottery in the state that would
provide more money for education.
</P>
<P>
   According to a series of recent polls taken before the
convention, Gore was behind in every Southern state except his
native Tennessee. Gore may be doing better after his convention
appearance, but the earlier polls showed that he had been hurt by
President Clinton's unpopularity in the region, and his own
positions on issues like gun control and the environment are seen
as less congenial in the South than those of Bush. By contrast,
Democrats like Easley and Miller are the heavy favorites in their
races, and Hodges is a popular figure in his state. All three seem
painfully aware that voters in the region continue to distinguish
between national Democrats and Southern Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always happens, and you can bet it's going to happen in
this year's races _ the Republicans are going to try to tie the
state Democrats to the unpopular head of the national party,'' said
Bill Moore, a professor of political science at the College of
Charleston. ``From their point of view, it's just pragmatic
politics to appear as independent from Gore as they can be.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hodges said he was not trying to be aloof by
leaving the convention early; he said he had made a commitment to
attend a fund-raiser for a state Senate candidate. But he obliquely
suggested that Southern voters have different priorities from those
voiced at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moderate Democratic candidates can win in the South, if they
focus on a core set of issues that voters care about,'' Hodges
said. ``Too often, Democrats at the national level are identified
with more liberal causes that send voters to the Republicans.'' He
backed off his earlier assessment that Gore had no chance in South
Carolina, saying Gore's selection of Lieberman and his positions on
education and Medicare might help him if he chose to campaign in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   But many Southern Democrats are grumbling more openly that the
Gore campaign has spent little time and money in the South,
essentially freeing up candidates to go off on their own. Richard
A. Harpootlian, the chairman of the South Carolina Democratic
Party, said the Bush campaign was still reaping the benefits of
having spent at least $4 million in the state during the hotly
contested Republican primary in February, while the Democrats have
spent about $5,000 in the state so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The successful Democrats in the South have fought hard and
swam against the current to win their elections,'' Harpootlian
said. ``If the national Democrats want to come here and spend some
money and work hard, they can do it, too. But so far, they're
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley, the candidate for North Carolina governor, said much the
same in a recent interview with The Charlotte Observer. ``I want
them to commit the resources, commit the effort,'' he said of the
Gore campaign. ``If they do that, I think they can win the state.''
But in the absence of a strong national presence, Easley said, he
has to run his own race, because ``there's not any room on the
ticket for a weak campaign, top or bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign insists it can be competitive in the South _
particularly in Tennessee, Florida and Georgia, and possibly North
Carolina and Arkansas _ and plans to devote resources to the
region, although Douglas Hattaway, a campaign spokesman, said he
did not know precisely where Gore would appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a Southern New Democrat who has long favored a
strong defense, welfare reform, fiscal responsibility, and values
like that,'' Hattaway said. ``Those are the kind of issues that are
important to Southern voters and New Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rick Dent, a spokesman for Miller, said it might be the
Southern Democrats who wound up helping Gore, a reversal of the
conventional coattails theory. Miller, as a new senator, has been
too busy learning the job and gearing up for his campaign to appear
with the national ticket, Dent said, and has never been terribly
interested in partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to Washington to play partisan games,'' Dent
said. ``But he is a strong vote-getter, and it may just be that
some of his supporters will decide to vote for Mr. Gore.''

AMID DELAYS AND CANCELLATIONS, LABOR SECRETARY TO MEET AIRLINE
OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A record number of flight delays and cancellations
has prompted officials in Washington to call an unusual meeting on
Monday in the hopes of finding ways to ease conditions for
beleaguered air travelers.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of a growing outcry from airline passengers,
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater has summoned airline
executives, union leaders and airport officials to discuss ways to
improve airline travel. Officials from eight major airlines have
said they will attend.
</P>
<P>
   The delays and cancellations, coming at the peak of vacation
season, have fueled a debate that the nation's air system may be
approaching gridlock. With 48,448 delayed flights, June was the
worst month ever for on-time performance, the Federal Aviation
Administration said. In July there was a slight improvement, with
only 44,401 delays, but that was still far more than the 25,672
recorded in the same month two years ago. Those figures do not
reflect the thousands of flights that were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Sunday that they hoped the meeting would help
forge a consensus among the various parts of the nation's air
system on how to deal with the problem and end months of
finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that the secretary can use his power and influence
to help the groups to come together and walk away with specific
action items for the different groups,'' said Mary Trupo, a
spokeswoman for Slater.
</P>
<P>
   Trupo added that the meeting was intended to highlight, and
hopefully build on, some successes in recent months, like the
slight decrease in delays in July from June.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with the nation's air travel have grown as the number
of passengers has increased. The already overloaded air system has
been further buffeted by stormy weather and labor problems.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, the world's largest carrier, is locked in a
dispute with pilots who are refusing overtime shifts. The dispute
has forced the airline to drop 4,800 flights from its summer
schedule and to cut 2,000 flights in September.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Slater flew to Chicago to meet with both sides of the
United dispute but appeared to do little to advance a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The two federal agencies that monitor the airlines, the Federal
Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation, have
also been criticized. A study released by the department's
inspector general in July found that since 1988 the FAA and the
Department of Transportation had underestimated the amount of time
lost by passengers by a total of 247 years.

FOR ELS, AN END TO THE RUNNER - UP STREAK; WATSON STILL GOING
STRONG; NO SURPRISE BY MAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (With GLF-PGA)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ One by one, disappointed players came off the
course, knowing the year's final opportunity to win a major
championship had passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, who finished second in the year's first three majors,
finished the PGA Championship well back in the field at 3-under par
Sunday. At least he didn't have to deal with another second-place
finish, but he was hoping to finally finish first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two days, I totally lost it with my putting stroke,''
said Els, the world's No. 2-ranked player and a two-time U.S. Open
winner. ``I don't believe I have ever putted as bad in all my life.
I missed everything and had a terrible time on the greens. It's a
bit disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been playing well this year. It's obviously very
disappointing to play like this. All in all, I have to look at my
year, and I played very well. I've had a good time. I could have
done better here and there, but I can't complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson and Davis Love III tied for ninth place at
9-under par, but both players faded over the weekend when they had
a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certainly disappointed,'' said Mickelson, at age 30
looking for his first major championship. ``I would have loved to
have won here at Valhalla. It's a course I felt very comfortable
on. I felt like I had been playing well this year and would have
loved to have won a major.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson Still Going Strong
</P>
<P>
   At 50, Tom Watson shot 68 to finish nine under par for the
tournament, good enough to tie for ninth place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy with the way I played and the way I competed,''
Watson said. ``After not really striking the ball well Sunday, I
was a little bit tentative about how I was going to hit the ball
today. I changed something on the practice range today and it
worked. After the first couple of holes, I was very confident with
what I was doing as far as my golf swing was concerned. After a
start of 76, it wasn't a bad tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   No Surprise By May
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson, who knows Bob May well, was not surprised by
May's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the average fan looks at Bob May, they just see a good
young player,'' Mickelson said. ``When I was growing up in San
Diego, Bob May dominated. He was a couple of years older than I
was, and he won every Southern California PGA junior championship
there was. He qualified for the L.A. Open when he was 15 or 16
years old, and he has been a top, top player at every level of the
game. It's just taken him a little while to get out on the PGA Tour
and to win. He is a very tough competitor. He was one of the most
difficult guys to beat head to head as a junior.'' &QL;

COMETS AGAIN RENEW THEIR BERTH IN WNBA FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ By now, after winning three straight league
championships, the Houston Comets might seem blase about a chance
at a four-peat. Not so Sunday against the Los Angeles Sparks, who
were left stunned at being swept from the Western Conference finals
by a Houston team they dominated in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets were as gritty in victory as they were giddy in
celebration, knocking off the Sparks, 74-69, with clutch shooting
and defense in the final minute to win the series, 2-0. As Janeth
Arcain, the Comets' unlikely star, clinched Houston's fourth
consecutive trip to the WNBA finals with three free throws, her
teammates gleefully danced around as though they were experiencing
something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one step closer to our ultimate goal, but winning
never gets old,'' Cynthia Cooper said with a huge smile.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who has announced her plans to retire after these
finals, led the Comets with 29 points. Arcain, averaging only 8
points in the playoffs, scored 16 points on 6-of-8 shooting. Tammy
Jackson came off the bench to add 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Houston won despite a poor game from Sheryl Swoopes, the WNBA's
most valuable player, who became nauseous and dizzy in the locker
room before the game. She finished with eight points, but handed
out six assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets will play the New York Liberty or the Cleveland
Rockers, who are tied at one game apiece in the Eastern Conference
finals. The deciding game is Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The last professional sports team to win four straight
championships was the National Hockey League's Islanders, who won
four Stanley Cups from 1980-83.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the game goes, you have to tip your hat to
Houston,'' Los Angeles Coach Michael Cooper said. `That's why
they're the three-time defending champions. They know what it takes
to win. They made the necessary plays toward the end to pull this
one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved our effort. I thought there were some things that we
could have done, some shots that didn't go in that normally fall
for us, but that's the way it goes. We wish them well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks trailed, 67-64, with three minutes to play, but
Tamecka Dixon sank a 3-pointer to tie the score. After the teams
traded baskets, the Comets delivered two key plays.
</P>
<P>
   With 39 seconds remaining, Arcain provided the game-winning
basket, drilling a running jumper as the shot clock ticked below
three seconds to give Houston a 71-69 lead. With 22 seconds left,
Jackson provided the game-saving play, swatting away DeLisha
Milton's short jump shot, which could have tied the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to stay whichever way Milton went,'' Jackson
said. ``She's good going to both sides. It was an opportunity that
presented itself, and I was there to block her shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper said: ``Can you pick a better time to block a
shot? Wow, that was something.''
</P>
<P>
   Arcain then made three of four free throws to finish the Sparks,
who had beaten the Comets in each of their three meetings en route
to a league-best 28-4 record during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks also lost on the day Cooper was honored as the WNBA's
Coach of the Year in a pregame ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were probably determined not to lose to us again,'' said
Lisa Leslie, whohad 12 points and 14 rebounds for the Sparks. ``I
think it's really hard to judge based on one or two losses that
we're not a championship-caliber team. We feel like we did a great
job this year. We just lost to a very good and very experienced
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika led the Sparks with 19 points, Dixon scored 17 and
Milton added 12. Although the Sparks had a 34-25 edge in rebounds,
they were held to 35.4 percent shooting, making only 23 of 65
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Houston made 29 of 59 shots, 49.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets quickly established that their 77-56 romp in Game 1
in Houston was not a fluke. That loss last Thursday was the Sparks'
worst this season, but Sunday they broke to a 12-6 lead. The Comets
answered with a 12-0 run and led by as many as nine points in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a lot more experience, especially in the last two
minutes,'' Arcain said. ``That's why we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes said: ``The satisfying part was that we beat them once
at home and once here. I'm sure Michael Cooper's award had them
fired up and excited, but we hung in there, played well and got the
job done.'' &QL;

YANKEES WANNABE? MO SAYS IT AIN'T SO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A headline in Sunday's New York Post said Anaheim
Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn ``wants to be a Yank.'' The story
says Vaughn ``admitted he craves for the opportunity to play for
the Bombers'' and quoted him saying how exciting it would be to
play for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn grew up in Norwalk, Conn., as a fan of the Yankees and
attended prep school in Pawling, N.Y. But he said Sunday he does
not want to be traded to the Yankees. He is in the second year of a
six-year, $80 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everytime I come here they (New York writers) ask about coming
back to play in New York,'' Vaughn said. ``It (his comments about
playing in New York) wasn't meant at all to say I didn't like it
here (with the Angels). Understand, I'm happy where I am. This team
is an up-and-coming team. I want to be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Angels have taken care of me. I'm happy where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival throws in bullpen: Closer Troy Percival, on the
disabled list since Aug.5 with an inflamed nerve in his right
elbow, threw a bullpen workout Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His velocity was there, the sharpness on his breaking ball was
there, but his command is something he's going to have to deal
with,'' Scioscia said. ``I think he's making strides.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival will return to Southern California and begin a rehab
assignment at Single-A Lake Elsinore on Tuesday. If all goes well,
he could be activated toward the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad out: Darin Erstad missed Sunday's game because of a tight
left rib cage, only the third game he's missed this season. Erstad
left Saturday's game after three innings when he began having
muscle spasms in his side.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia said Erstad ``probably'' will sit out
tonight's game against the Red Sox as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to Saturday I feel great,'' Erstad said. ``It wasn't
worse when I woke up, which is an encouraging sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster move: The Angels are expected to send pitcher Brian
Cooper back to Triple-A Edmonton because they don't need a fifth
starter until Aug. 29 and could use an extra arm in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper continues to struggle with his mechanics, resulting in an
inability to locate his pitches. Since throwing a three-hit shutout
against the A's on June 30, Cooper is 1-6 with a 10.02 ERA.

LIBERTY BRUISE ROCKERS TO EVEN SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  By   LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's playoff game between the Cleveland Rockers and New York
Liberty was not staged on the court in Madison Square Garden, but
in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to throw the first punch,'' said Liberty
forward Vickie Johnson, who had ice bags on her sore left shoulder
and sprained right ankle after the battle, which the Liberty won,
51-45. ``The thing we wanted to do was send a message in Madison
Square Garden, our home. They want to talk about physical, we'll be
physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Having lost the first game of the Eastern Conference finals by
yielding to the board-crashing, body-blocking Cleveland Rockers,
the Liberty was determined not to be bullied again. Facing
elimination in the two-of-three-game series, the Liberty drove
straight into the Rockers in the first half, pummeling them into
submission and leaving them scoreless for an 11-minute stretch that
helped give New York a 19-point halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second 20 minutes, the Liberty players hung on in
desperation. They scored only 15 points while earning two technical
fouls. While the technicals may have served as badges for the
players' wounded pride, they were barely able to outlast the
surging Rockers.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty was able to even the series and force tonight's game
in the Garden for the right to play the Houston Comets, the
three-time defending champions, in the Women's National Basketball
Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty has won 12 straight on its home court, three of them
at the Rockers' expense. Cleveland's Merlakia Jones, who scored 14
of her 18 points in the second half, said that her team's late
effort gives it confidence going into Monday night. ``It's going to
be an all-out war,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Her prediction could have stemmed from an incident late in the
game. After coming away with a steal, Weatherspoon was incensed
with the attitude from the Rockers' 6-7 rookie center, Ann Wauters,
a 19-year-old from Belgium. Weatherspoon said Wauters was staring
her down, walking toward her as if to antagonize her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to back down from anyone,'' Weatherspoon said.
``That's not my style. If you're in my home, too, for a youngster
to walk in my face, I'm not taking it from anyone.'' Weatherspoon
practically challenged Wauters to spar, which resulted in a
technical for the Liberty guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty's combative attitude was clear from the game's
opening minutes. With New York trailing, 5-2, Johnson drove through
the lane and drew a foul from Mery Andrade, the Rockers' enforcer.
Later in the first half, the Liberty was literally able to take
Andrade out of the game for a while when she sprained her right
thumb in a collision with New York's Tamika Whitmore.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade left at 9 minutes 13 seconds to get X-rays. In her
absence, the Liberty launched a 19-0 run to take a 24-7 lead, and
the Rockers could not recover. During that stretch, the Rockers
missed 17 straight shots. For the first half, the Liberty shot 57.1
percent from the field and took a 36-17 lead into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Liberty began to play on the fumes of
its emotion, rather than relying on rebounding and defense. ``We
got a little relaxed and lost focus,'' Johnson said. ``I think it
was like we were trying to kill them, trying too much, and
sometimes it works against you. We just needed to settle down and
play Liberty basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   While this was the physical play the Rockers expected, Andrade,
who played 26 minutes yesterday and is expected to play tonight,
said she was surprised that some Liberty players reacted the way
they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have veteran people on that team that should not act the
way they act,'' she said. ``The way we were aggressive, it wasn't
in a mean way to get people hurt. And if you notice, nobody got a
technical foul on Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty's Crystal Robinson earned a technical foul because
she thought Andrade was the one trying to inflict pain with dirty
play. ``Andrade gets you away from the ball, just with elbows in
the throat, and she trips you,'' Robinson said. ``You try to run,
she clips you with her feet. I had had enough of it. I told the
referee if he didn't stop it, I would do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson added a few ``choice words'' to that statement and was
assessed a technical with 11:23 to play. At that point, the Liberty
led,43-28, but started to let the lead slip. Down the stretch, Tari
Phillips steadied the Liberty, finishing the game with 12 points
and 6 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Hammon, who led the Liberty with 13 points, made two foul
shots and her jumper with 6:22 to play kept the lead at 11 points.
The Rockers missed three 3-pointers in the final 1:53, and the
battle was extended to another game. &QL;

LAZIO FINDS NEW FRIENDS IN DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y. _ Vivian and Salvatore Frisicaro were wearing
Hillary stickers, but when Rep. Rick Lazio strode past them at the
Pulaski Day parade on Sunday afternoon, they did not voice
fist-waving contempt or even grimace like the longtime Democrats
they profess to be.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the Frisicaros let slip a secret: They were
apostates, Lazio fans who had turned against their party's Senate
candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need help, economically, medically,'' explained Frisicaro,
69, a retired teacher's aide who said she had put on the sticker as
a courtesy to a friend who handed it to her in this suburb of
Buffalo. ``I think she had her try when President Clinton was in,
with the health-care plan. And health care is still going down the
tubes.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Frisicaros', the political allegiances of Erie County,
a classically blue-collar Democratic redoubt in western New York,
are not always predictable. The county has increasingly become one
of the most crucial swing areas in New York, and if the number of
Lazio backers who lined the route Sunday was any indication,
Clinton cannot assume the county is a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic organization in Erie County is more formidable
than any in the state outside New York City, but it has faced some
unexpected defeats in recent years. It lost the county executive's
office last year and could not stop Gov. George Pataki, a
Republican, from winning the county in 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lazio and Clinton have identified Erie as vital to their
campaigns, and although Clinton skipped the parade, which
celebrates Polish-Americans by honoring the Revolutionary War hero
Casimir Pulaski, she arrived late Sunday afternoon for a visit to
an arts festival that followed the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was greeted enthusiastically as she mingled with people
before taking the stage to dance a polka with her daughter,
Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   She also served kielbasa at a food stand, conducting a taste
test that compared the local variety with one her campaign had
brought from Westchester, her new home county.
</P>
<P>
   In brief comments to reporters, Clinton did not directly address
her chances in Erie, though she expressed fondness for the people
of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign aides disputed the idea that Lazio had a chance
here, saying that wayward white, working-class Democrats like the
Frisicaros would return to the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a swing area that it's important to win, and I'm
confident that we will do so,'' said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman
for the Clinton campaign. ``We have devoted an enormous amount of
time upstate. And we are the only candidate in the race to have an
economic plan to bring new jobs upstate.''
</P>
<P>
   It also might be argued that some of those at the parade could
have been smitten by Lazio because he took time to shake their
hands or pose for photos with their children. Still, it was not
difficult, in more than 20 interviews with Democrats at the parade
to find people leaning toward him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's New York state born,'' said Adolph Rakowski, 62, a
retired custodian who recalled that the only Republican for whom he
had voted in recent years was Pataki in 1998. ``I don't think that
we should have a carpetbagger running. She does not know where
western New York is. If she learns where western New York is, maybe
we can vote for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby was Ray Full, 79, a retired painter, who said it would be
unthinkable to vote for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Full said he had supported a Republican in the past _ Rep. Jack
Quinn, who has close ties to labor _ but would not do so this time.
``Hillary is going to win,'' Full said. ``Most of the time the
Democrats get in around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after he marched, Lazio said the response
pleased him. ``If this today is any indication of the level of
support that we have in a county that has a Democrat registration
edge, we are going to do very well,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like Clinton, Lazio used the day to express his appreciation for
the county and for Polish-Americans, though he seemed to evince a
little confusion about geopolitics when he said in a short speech
that he had favored Poland's entrance into the North American,
rather than North Atlantic, Treaty Organization, or NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and his aides continued to attack a Spanish-language radio
commercial that is being sponsored by the Democratic State
Committee in support of Clinton. The commercial declares that Lazio
has always voted in Congress against the interests of Hispanic
people on government spending, the military's use of a bombing
range in Puerto Rico and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an attempt to bring out the very worst in people,''
Lazio said of the commercial. ``It's beyond distorting the record _
it's an outright fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dismissed his criticism and his demand that the
commercial be withdrawn, saying that it was factually correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``National Hispanic groups have given him a zero for his voting
record,'' she said.

COOPER NAMED WNBA COACH OF YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Former Laker Michael Cooper, a Los Angeles
Sparks assistant last year who took over the helm in November, was
selected the WNBA Coach of the Year after leading the Sparks to a
league record 28 victories in the regular season and their second
consecutive post-season appearance.
</P>
<P>
   League president Val Ackerman presented Cooper with the award
before the Sparks game against the three-time defending champion
Houston Comets Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He was the overwhelming choice with 37 votes. Cleveland's Dan
Hughes had nine and New York's Richie Adubato had six. Houston
coach Van Chancellor, recipient of the previous three honors,
garnered a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper is no stranger to success. He won five NBA championship
with the Lakers, was the Defensive Player of the Year in 1987, and
a five-time first-team member on the All-Defensive team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ranks amongst the best,'' Cooper said. ``This is special
because it's a new kind of breaking ground. Women's professional
sports is on the rise and I am so honored and pleased to be sort of
the base foundation of it. I followed the WNBA since its inception
as far as 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talked a little bit with Johnny. I interviewed for the first
job that they had here. He told me that, Mike the timing wasn't
right.' And it wasn't. Now that the timing was right I was able to
fit in a groove and I just wanted to push women's sports,
especially professional basketball, to let people know that these
women can play the game at a very high level. I'm very, very glad
to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to thanking Laker and Sparks owner Jerry Buss,
president Johnny Buss and general manager Penny Toler and his
family, Cooper acknowledge his assistant coaches and players.
Sparks guard Allison Feaster said it was ``no-brainer who was going
to be the Coach of the Year. ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just amazing the respect that he commands. He's not a man
of many words, and that's good. He says exactly what he feels. The
most important thing about our player-coach relationship is the
trust that we have in him and the trust that he has in us,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   This is really it for Cynthia: After scoring a game-high 29
points to lead the Houston Comets to a 74-69 victory over the
Sparks and into the WNBA Finals, Cynthia Cooper reiterated that she
would be retiring after the season. No if, ands or buts about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my last season, my last playoff, this was my last time
playing in the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles,'' said Cooper,
who won two NCAA championships a USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely an emotional game for me. Yesterday marked
one year that Kim Perrot passed away. Oh man, I prayed before the
game that God allowed me to play hard, just play hard and play
well. I really wanted her to be proud of me and my mom to be proud
of me. So if nothing else I wanted to leave it all out on the court
today to see if I still have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot was the inspirational leader for the Comets for two years
and Cooper's best friend before succumbing to brain cancer Aug. 18,
1999. Perrot's death preceded Cooper's mother, Mary Cobb, who died
of cancer in February last year.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Sears presented a check for $352,551 to the
National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations on behalf of the
Sears WNBA Breast Health Awareness program.

VALENTINE A REMINDER OF PAST DODGERS GLORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers may want to consider a new promotion:
Blindfold night.
</P>
<P>
   This would allow fans to shield their eyes from hideous moments,
like the one that took place in the eighth inning Sunday and
typified a season gone wrong, and pretty much gone, period.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had runners on first and third with no outs when Lenny
Harris hit a nubber along third that Adrian Beltre fielded cleanly.
But Beltre proceeded to lob the ball over the head of catcher Todd
Hundley, allowing one runner to score, and when no one bothered to
cover home as Hundley chased the ball to the backstop, the second
runner scored all the way from first.
</P>
<P>
   That was only one of several gory moments best shielded from the
view of small children during the Mets' 9-6 win. Like the second
inning, when catcher Hundley suffered a passed ball on a called
third strike and moments later misfired on a steal attempt. Those
miscues were worth two runs.
</P>
<P>
   There was a Mark Grudzielanek error that added a third run in
the eighth. There were the back-to-back homers Darren Dreifort
allowed in the sixth after the Dodgers had tied the game. There was
Shawn Green getting picked off second in the seventh inning,
leaving the Dodgers with one run to show from two hits, two walks,
a Met error and a stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst moment of the whole day might have been that TV
picture of Mike Piazza and Mets manager Bobby Valentine standing on
the lip of the Mets dugout and sharing a chuckle during that
R-rated eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Both are ex-Dodgers, of course. Reminders of the club's past
surround it like a moat, prickly thornes that accentuate its
current lost and clueless situation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough that Piazza is hitting .345 with 32 home runs
and 100 RBI. While Hundley was struggling defensively (he did hit
two homers), Piazza Sunday turned in two (set ital) defensive (end)
gems, catching a foul popup in the second while sliding knee first
into a cement curb, and catching another in the ninth while going
head-first into the first row of seats.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is a different matter entirely. He was never a great
Dodger player like Dusty Baker, everyone's first choice to replace
poor Davey Johnson, but Valentine considers the Dodgers his first
family.
</P>
<P>
   When Tommy Lasorda was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the
ex-Dodger manager said Valentine was the best manager in the game.
That caused internal problems that still impact the club today. But
such is the state of the Dodgers misery that the concept of
Valentine someday becoming the Dodgers manager should be taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is manipulative, cocky and not beyond telling a fib or
two, and those opinions come from people who like him. Valentine's
resume includes zero divisional titles and a reputation for being
disingenuous. He and Mets General Manager Steve Phillips have been
waging a personal war for two seasons that seems destined to end
with Valentine moving on, regardless of what happens in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine's Mets won 97 games last season to earn a wild
card berth and advance to the NLCS, where they lost to the Braves
in six games, with three of the four losses by a run.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, the Mets are 74-50, trail Atlanta by 1 games in the
N.L. East and lead the wild card race by 3 games over Arizona and
10 over the Dodgers. Valentine's team has won eight consecutive
series, are 26-12 since the all-star break and 21-6 in their last
27.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets won Sunday with ex-Dodger Harris -- ad infinitum
nauseaum -- posting two runs, two hits and two RBI, and with
Valentine going through five pitchers to secure the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby is a lot like Tommy,'' said Harris after the win,
``except more aggressive. He will put on a lot of plays, so much so
that you never know what to expect. He's a soldier, and he's in
charge of this locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll make that extra move with the bullpen. He'll give a
starter a day off and give a guy like me a chance to play. We get
things done. We can't always depend on a home run from Mike. We
have to do the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have played the entire season without a regular left
fielder and with a 27-year-old rookie, Jay Payton, in center.
Valentine has used catcher Todd Pratt more than one would expect
with Piazza on the same roster, gotten a terrific season from a
player, Derek Bell, who was considered tainted, and played more
little ball than you'd think with seven double-digit home run
hitters on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Bobby for 27 years, and he's never been arrogant
around me,'' said Lasorda. ``He's a little cocky. He's got a lot of
self-confidence. What's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brilliant tactician who knows how to run a ball club.
He won 97 games last year and the most wins any starter had was 13,
and one of those guys was Bulldog (Orel Hershiser). What does he do
wrong? You can't tell me, because there isn't anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda thinks someone in the media who didn't like Valentine
created a reputation that has since taken on a life of its own --
just as Lasorda was once considered a rookie-killer, ``despite the
fact that the Dodgers had nine rookie of the year winners when I
was manager,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misread anything into Lasorda's comments. He wasn't
stumping for Valentine as a replacement for the beleaguered
Johnson, who is simply mortified at this stage of the season, he
was just responding to questions about Valentine's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to imagine the Dodgers being any worse off with
Valentine as manager as they are today. Regardless of any
trepidation over his style, he'd at least demand pride for the
uniform and organization, something the team isn't getting now.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't a Lasorda-Valentine ticket, as G.M. and manager, be
preferable than the out-of-towners and out-of-synch duo of Kevin
Malone and Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Siegfried and Roy would be a better duo. But
that's what Dodger baseball has become, a circus act with a G.M.
culled from the Expos, blindfolds for the fans, and consideration
of things and people, like Valentine, never before imagined.

MILLER OUT, BUT DAWES AND CHOW MAKE TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Shannon Miller went twisting into the air during her
first vault Sunday night but found herself too low in the air and
too short on her landing. With a horrendous thud, her legs jammed
into the padding like post-hole diggers.
</P>
<P>
   Her 23-year-old body buckled on impact. Suddenly, Miller, the
most decorated female gymnast in U.S. history, was flat on her
back, staring at the rafters of the Fleet Center as her coach,
Steve Nunno, and the U.S. coach, Bela Karolyi, circled her. They
spoke, but their words did not register. In her daze, she was more
stunned than injured, more mortified than hurt. With stiff legs,
Miller got up and finished her only event of the night with an
awkward second vault.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, a distraught Miller scratched from the
competition. The doctors cleared her, but it was obvious Miller
could not put on a show that would be in synch with her golden
image. Still, she was looking for a miracle appointment to the
Olympic team, hoping Karolyi's belief in her had not eroded,
believing her body of work might be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was room in the selection committee's subjective
rules to put her on the six-woman team, Karolyi and company chose
the two other remaining members of the 1996 Olympic gold team, Amy
Chow and Dominique Dawes _ alongside with new generation gymnasts
like Elise Ray, Kristen Maloney, Morgan White and Jamie Dantscher.
But they left off Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Miller wiped the tears from her face, knew her career was over
and exited the building.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the end to Miller's comeback simplified the selection
process. If Miller had completed the trials with a solid but not
spectacular performance, if she had finished out of the top six, or
even top 10 at the trials, controversy would have erupted had she
made the team. As it was, Miller's presence caused an undercurrent
of tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if someone says they deserve to be on the team like
she did _ at least that's what I read, I wasn't in her interviews _
then I guess people assume she'll be on it,'' said Dawes, who began
her comeback in April. ``I don't think I deserved to be on the
team. I came her and wanted to prove I belonged. Just because you
made it in '92 and in '96, that doesn't give you the right to think
you belong in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee agreed. They could not rationalize placing Miller
on the team and leaving off someone like Dawes, who finished
seventh, but leapfrogged sixth-place Vanessa Atler to land on the
team. Atler's omission from the team _ with eighth-place Alyssa
Beckerman named as the alternate _ was the major shock of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Atler was mentally unprepared to perform at her best, and she
knew it. For some reason, her heart was not in this meet and it
showed with scores that left her 10th in the trials. Sunday night,
she just bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone else wanted it for me more than I did,''
Atler said. ``When they named the team, it was sort of a relief. I
knew I wasn't ready. I was messing up all over the place. It's not
my time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have any fun here. I don't know, I just wasn't
into it. The performance I put out there is not Olympic materia.
Maybe that's why I'm not as upset about this as I could be. That's
why I'm not taking this too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Atler was even smiling. There were tears everywhere _ some for
joy and some out of disappointment _ but there was very little
controversy. No one had a gripe with the selection procedure.
Although Miller vanished afterward, she did speak during the meet
after she scratched from the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no injury,'' Miller said. ``I just jammed my legs.
They've seen what I can do, and they saw what I did in verification
on Tuesday and then on Friday. If they need me to be ready for the
team, I'll be ready. Obviously I wanted to compete tonight, but I
didn't want to risk an injury. I didn't want to go out there not
looking my best.''
</P>
<P>
   The last image of Miller at the Olympics will have to sustain
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talent is not enough,'' Karolyi said. ``In two back-to-back
performances, on Friday and tonight, she could not prove she was
capable of representing her country.''
</P>
<P>
   There are six women Karolyi believes can try to defend the gold
that Miller led the women to in 1996. Two of the Magnificent Seven
remain, Chow and Dawes. And four young women will circle around
them in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was the most colorful and dramatic trials ever,''
Karolyi said. ``I didn't know how it was going to turn out. I
believe I was right with this process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we are medal contenders. This is a strong team. If
they perform to their potential, they can win a medal.''  &QL;

MAY TRIES TO GET EVEN, BUT FALLS SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ When they were growing up in Southern
California as junior golfers, Bob May set records that Tiger Woods
would break.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were juniors,'' May recalled, ``I was 16 and he was 9,
so he was still playing nine holes and I was playing full rounds.
But later on, in some newspaper articles he would say, `I'm going
to beat Bob May's record,' which he pretty much proceeded to do. He
kept on saying it and doing it, so I was hoping maybe I could get a
chance to get back at him.''
</P>
<P>
   May got that chance in Sunday's final round of the 82nd PGA
Championship, and he almost did get back at Woods.
</P>
<P>
   With a desperate 15-foot birdie putt from the fringe of the 18th
green for a third consecutive 66 to Woods' 67, the 31-year-old May
forced a three-hole playoff that Woods eventually won with a bunker
shot within a foot on the same 18th hole, the final playoff hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it ended,'' May said, ``Tiger told me: `It was a great
match. You played incredible.'''
</P>
<P>
   May, who earned a total of more than $700,000 in previous PGA
Tour and European Tour events this year, played the round of his
life against the world's No. 1-ranked player in one of the most
dramatic duels in a major golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you shoot three 66s in a major, you should win,''
May said, ``but you are playing against the best golfer in the
world, and he proved that is not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In earning $540,000 as the runner-up with a record-sharing
18-under-par total for 72 holes, May at least fulfilled his own
expectations &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``You might say that if I shot maybe 62 today and three 72s, it
was kind of a fluke,'' he said. ``But I shot 72 the first day and
then three rounds of 66 on a pretty good golf course. So I don't
think there is any fluke involved in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had won, it would have been a dream come true. Not only
to win a major, but to beat _ well, we can't say Tiger is the best
ever to play, it wouldn't be fair to a lot of other players, but
when he is done, he may be the best player.''
</P>
<P>
   May trailed Woods by one shot after 54 holes. In the tension of
being in contention in a major tournament for the first time, he
had a strange night of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never played so much golf in my sleep,'' he said. ``I mean,
I slept great until the alarm clock went off, but all I was doing
was playing these holes in my sleep. I was like, wow, I'd play that
hole again and I'd wake up _ well, not really wake up, just kind of
turn over. It was weird. But I never played a hole out. I just kept
on seeing holes, but I never hit a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He hit shots Sunday _ shots that had the gallery rooting for him
as the underdog. When he birdied the 535-yard second hole as Woods
bogeyed, May suddenly led by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they started rooting for me then,'' May said. ``I
think they thought, `This is going to be a little interesting.' And
they seemed to root for me all day. It's tough out there. I turned
to Tiger and said, `Is this what you get every week?' and he said,
`You got it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see how he can be a little irritable at times, and
people think he's not being kind to people. But it is tough when
you get that four or five and a half hours a day. But it's great to
have fans. Fans make the golf tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   May's home is in Las Vegas with his wife, Brenda, and their son,
Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason my wife wasn't here,'' he said, ``is that she's due
with our second child in four and a half weeks, maybe five weeks.
The doctor doesn't let her fly anymore. But my parents were here,
and I had several other friends come in to support me. I probably
had a dozen people I knew personally who came from all over the
country to support me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not counting Tiger Woods. &QL;

AN ACHING HAMPTON SAYS HE'LL SKIP START; HAMILTON HURTING; WALLACE
QUIET ON FUTURE; FIRST IN A WHILE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Hampton said Saturday that if he felt better
Sunday, he expected to work a bullpen session. If things went well,
Hampton might then be cleared to start on Tuesday in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, the plan changed. Hampton, who left his start
last Thursday because of a stress fracture in his right ribs, threw
lightly in the outfield and did feel better. But he did not throw
in the bullpen, and he will not start on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Hampton said, when asked if he will make the start.
``Maybe over the weekend. We'll come up with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Mahomes, who threw six and two-thirds effective innings in a
spot start last week, would be the logical candidate to fill in.
The Mets have little flexibility on their roster, making it
difficult to recall Grant Roberts or Bobby M. Jones from Triple-A
Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's injury, which he believes stems from a high school
football game 11 years ago, is not the kind that worsens the more
he pitches. The Mets believe it is simply a question of how well
Hampton can tolerate the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they want to give it a few more days to heal,''
Hampton said. ``I guess if I'm feeling a lot better after two days
with not a lot of activity, maybe a few more might get us further
down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine said he would make a final decision on
Hampton's status Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton Hurting
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Darryl Hamilton, who has not gone more than a day
without starting since coming off the disabled list on Aug. 9, sat
for the second game in a row Sunday. Lenny Harris started in left
field.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has experienced discomfort in his arthritic left big
toe since playing a game on wet grass during the Mets' last
homestand. He singled as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning and
was removed for a pinch-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want it to be an issue every day,'' Hamilton said.
``It's going to be there the whole year, and I understand that. I
have good days and bad days. Hopefully, I can hold on to the good
days so later in the year, I can go out for a good amount of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace Quiet On Future
</P>
<P>
   Like manager Bobby Valentine and general manager Steve Phillips,
the Mets' coaches all have contracts that expire after this season.
Dave Wallace, the pitching coach, could be attractive to other
teams, and a report in The Los Angeles Times said the Dodgers want
to bring him back. Wallace coached for the Dodgers from 1995-97.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Phillips would not allow other teams to interview
Wallace, who was under contract. ``I like Dave, and he's an
important member of our organization,'' Phillips said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was noncommittal about whether he wanted to return to
the Mets. ``Steve and Fred have been very good to me,'' he said,
referring to Phillips and Fred Wilpon, the co-owner. ``I don't
really concern myself with that stuff. We've got six tough weeks
ahead of us. Those are my only concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who came to the Mets as an adviser to Phillips, joined
Valentine's staff after three coaches were fired last June. Asked
about his relationship with Valentine, Wallace said, ``Since we've
started working together, things have kind of moved along pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   First in a While &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander Bobby J. Jones lasted 4 2/3 innings Sunday, the
first time he has failed to pitch five innings since returning from
an assignment to Triple-A Norfolk. He is 7-2 with a 3.26 earned run
average in 11 starts since then. &QL;

COCAINE RE-EMERGES AS DRUG OF AFFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a nice little jazz bar in the East Village.
The drinks are a fair price and the mix of people is good. The only
problem is that it's tough to get into the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   This agitated a silver-haired college professor named Jason who
was in the bar on Thursday night. He crossed his legs. He uncrossed
them. Reaching the point where he could wait no longer, the
professor walked out onto 13th Street and ducked behind a trash
bin. He had to have that snort of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting harder and harder to use the toilets in the bars
because there are so many people in the toilets doing everything
except using the toilets,'' said Jason, 45, who said he first tried
cocaine two years ago at a Manhattan party. ``If you dope-tested
the top of every toilet tank in the city, I bet half would test
positive for cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the names of increasingly popular pharmacological
drugs _ most notably MDMA or Ecstasy _ and a few of the old
standards like heroin are in the news, little attention is being
paid to the drug that is re-emerging as the narcotic of choice
among New York's pinstripe-and-cocktail set. Cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   While a good many cocaine users and experts maintain that the
drug never really went away, and national surveys and other numbers
suggest that cocaine use is at least holding steady, there is
strong anecdotal evidence to suggest that powder cocaine use is
edging up as it undergoes a renaissance among the well-dressed and
well-fed in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Daytop Village, the largest drug-rehabilitation program in the
city, reports that 45 percent of its 2,000 white- and blue-collar
outpatients were treated for using powder cocaine in 1999, up from
30 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine-related emergencies in New York City increased by 21
percent from 1990 to 1998, according to the Drug Abuse Warning
Network. Jonathan Porteus, a clinical psychologist at Daytop, said
those emergencies range from heart palpitations to lethal
overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cocaine is back for the 30- and 40-year-olds,'' said Avery
Mehlman, the deputy bureau chief of narcotics for the Brooklyn
district attorney. ``Crack is considered to be highly addictive and
synonymous with people down on their luck. Powder cocaine, due to
its higher price, implies a certain social strata. It's become the
drug of choice for the so-called recreational user.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything has changed, it is the culture of cocaine. It is not
bought on a shady street corner anymore, and its use is less and
less clandestine. ``Every bar's got a coke dealer, and everybody
has a delivery service,'' said Andrew M., an independent filmmaker
who sat in the corner of a bar in Chelsea sipping a cosmopolitan
and snorting cocaine from the palm of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then you have your spots that sell cocktails and coke,''
he said. ``The coke bars are becoming the people's choice, because
you don't know who's monitoring your pager anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew M. was referring to the cocaine service that he could
beep to have drugs delivered to his apartment. That is until
federal agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration broke it up
in January, arresting four people and seizing a notebook that
listed the names, addresses and phone numbers of more than 2,000
customers all over Manhattan. The addresses included major
financial institutions, and apartments in affluent parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bunch of yuppies mostly,'' said an agent with the
federal drug agency. ``Lawyers and business types. White people
with too much time and money on their hands. I've got to say,
though, it was a pretty smooth operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebound in cocaine use can be traced to two causes, and both
have their roots in money, said Rick Curtis, a professor of
anthropology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who studies
patterns in urban drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Curtis said, the boom times on Wall Street
have spurred the use of the drug, and so have falling cocaine
prices. There is a worldwide glut in the cocaine market, and when
the authorities confiscate 1,500 pounds, as they did this month in
the Bronx, it makes the newspapers, but it hardly makes a
difference in the supply or the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, a kilogram of cocaine sold for a wholesale
price of $40,000, experts say. Today it goes for $20,000 to $25,000
wholesale. Translated into consumer prices, half a gram costs $25;
a gram, $50; and an ``eight ball,'' 3.5 grams, $150. The average
price for a gram of cocaine in 1990 was $100, Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the dot-com crowd driving it,'' he said. ``It's the hip
art-and-money crowd, the Wall Street people looking for a kick.
There is new money to burn, and it's the 30- to 40-year-olds who
remember the kick.''

ON FIRST DAY, NYPD'S NEW CHIEF ASKS FOR `A CHANCE'  
</HEADLINE>
  By JUAN FORERO    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after being named New York City's new police
commissioner, Bernard Kerik took the first step to fulfill his
pledge to reach out to the city's minority residents, who are among
the department's harshest critics.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday _ along with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Joseph Dunne,
the new first deputy commissioner _ Kerik visited a black church in
East New York, Brooklyn, where he asked about 60 congregants to
give him a chance to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik also spent the first hours after his appointment meeting
patrol officers in the 41,000-member department, visiting precincts
in Manhattan and Brooklyn, including the Midtown South precinct,
where he was a rookie officer, and the 50th Precinct, which covers
the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, 44, who comes to the nation's largest police force after
serving as commissioner of the city's Department of Correction, is
being closely watched by community groups and city leaders because
of strained relations between the department and blacks and
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kerik's predecessor, Howard Safir, a crime drop that had
begun in the early 1990s accelerated, but relations between the
police and the city's minority residents worsened after the torture
of Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, in a Brooklyn precinct house
and the fatal shootings of Amadou Diallo and Patrick Dorismond,
both unarmed black men.
</P>
<P>
   In the visit to Bright Light Baptist Church on Sutter Avenue,
Kerik vowed to work with community leaders while striving to ensure
that officers were respectful of all city residents.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, a former undercover detective who won commendations for
valor, said that he already had told officers that wrongdoing would
be punished. But he also said that mistakes by officers need not
inflame relations with the community if there is understanding and
respect on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik told the congregation that in visits yesterday morning to
the 33rd and 34th precincts in Washington Heights, he had advised
officers: ``If you do something and you do something by accident,
if you do something that you didn't mean and it wasn't intentional,
I need to be able to go to the community and say, `I need help.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``In order for me to do that, they've got to believe
in you. They've got to trust you. You've got to show them respect.
And, I'm sure if you show them that respect, you're going to get
the respect back.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerik also had something to say to those, including the Rev. Al
Sharpton, who were critical of his appointment, though he did not
single out anyone by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've listened to the nay-sayers,'' he said. ``I've listened to
all the derogatory comments in the last 24 hours. It's somewhat
humorous. They don't even know me. They never met me.''
</P>
<P>
   And he asked the churchgoers to tell others to support him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to tell them one thing: `Give him a chance,''' said
Kerik &UR; .  &LR;  The pastor of Bright Light, the Rev. H. Devore Chapman,
and many church members said they had known and respected Dunne
since the early 1990s, when he was commander of the neighborhood's
precinct, the 75th. Therefore, they said, theirs was a community
that was willing to listen to the new commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a community for him to start in, to work with him,''
Wooten said after the service.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, in remarks at the church, said that the new leadership
in the department would provide ``a chance to try to improve on
things, to do things differently.''
</P>
<P>
   He also stressed that it was imperative that the community
respect the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to improve with the way the police deal with the
community, and the community has to improve with the way they deal
with the police,'' he said. Kerik also spent time demonstrating his
support for rank-and-file officers in the department, where morale
has been affected by criticism and what many officers see as low
wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know, as your boss and commanding officer, I
support you and understand your job,'' he told about 15 officers at
the 50th Precinct station house.

ANALYSIS :  KERIK'S APPOINTMENT TO NYPD TOP SPOT LEAVES SOME
WONDERING
</HEADLINE>
 By ERIC LIPTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
rejected the advice of the departing police commissioner and the
wishes of much of the rest of the department hierarchy. But the
leadership team he installed in the city's highest profile agency
makes perfect sense, if viewed through the mayor's prism.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new police commissioner, Bernard Kerik, is someone the mayor
trusts, and whose loyalty, like that of the outgoing police
commissioner Howard Safir, he need not question. The mayor expects
that Kerik, who brought order to the once-chaotic city jails, will
move with alacrity to tighten the Police Department's financial
management.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Dunne, the 31-year department veteran whom Safir backed
and who many had predicted would get the top job, is now first
deputy commissioner, the department's second in command. He can use
the relationships he has established with rank-and-file officers
and the department's top brass, as well as his rapport with some of
the city's minority leaders, to help Kerik pursue his goals.
</P>
<P>
   And at City Hall, the mayor keeps at his side the third finalist
for the commissioner job, Dennison Young Jr., one of his closest
and most trusted aides. Since the administration began, Young has
helped coordinate law enforcement matters, and keeping him there
effectively ensures the mayor can maintain his supreme command over
a department whose crime-reduction campaign has so defined his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the arrangement mixes the best skills of each,
assuming the team can work together for the 16 remaining months the
mayor has in office. ``The city is going to have the good fortune
of having all three of them working together,'' the mayor said on
Saturday. ``It's a wonderful team.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor showed obvious pleasure at his decision. But as he
articulated his choice on Saturday, it became clear that the
effusive praise he had offered Safir _ repeatedly calling him the
city's greatest police commissioner _ might have been too generous.
If not, why then would the mayor appoint a new commissioner who has
implied he wants to curtail overtime spending, make Police
Department managers more accountable and improve department morale,
while also pushing to ease tension between the department and
ethnic groups?
</P>
<P>
   The community relations campaign got under way yesterday
morning, as Giuliani, Kerik and Dunne together went to the Greater
Bright Light Baptist Church in Brooklyn for the Sunday service at
the predominately black church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the department to reach out more, and we want the
people of the city to understand that we expect from them that they
are going to respect the police more,'' Giuliani said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   By passing over Dunne, 52, who as chief of the department had
been the top uniformed officer in the 41,000-person force, the
mayor demonstrated his concern that a man who had spent his entire
career within the department might be too caught up in the
traditional ways and too closely allied with his department
colleagues. For the mayor, these questions of loyalty are
particularly important now, as his administration presses the
Police Department unions to accept money-saving changes in
personnel rules and to switch to a merit-based system of pay
raises. The department's largest union is resisting such changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure most New Yorkers will agree that New York City's
police officers have been productive and we will leave the rest of
the negotiations to the bargaining table,'' said Joseph Mancini, a
spokesman for the 27,000-member Patrolman's Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, 44, and Giuliani first met when Kerik worked as a city
narcotics detective and Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, was
making his first run for mayor. Kerik coordinated Giuliani's
security detail on weekends during his second campaign, and shortly
after the mayor went into office in 1994, Kerik became the first
deputy commissioner at the Department of Correction.
</P>
<P>
   His success in reshaping the city's troubled Correction
Department _ where inmate stabbings and violence against officers
had surged _ is largely what earned him his new job. Kerik, who
became correction commissioner in January 1998, shares the mayor's
obsession for numbers.
</P>
<P>
   He applied this data-driven approach to Correction, measuring
employee performance on more than 130 statistical yardsticks, from
inmate violence to officer overtime and sick time and the speed at
which broken equipment was repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik was able to get more out of correction workers and ``at
the same time build their morale by holding them accountable,'' the
mayor said yesterday. ``That is the sign of a truly effective
leader, in the modern day in which you have to accomplish all of
those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerik clearly intends to take some of his same management
techniques to the Police Department. ``It'll give you a way to get
to see every little bit of the agency, every area where you may be
lacking,'' Kerik said on Saturday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But some city officials and former police administrators
question how effective the commissioner will be at accomplishing
these goals. He served as a city police officer for only eight
years before leaving for the Correction Department, and his quick
rise to the top of the nation's largest police department may
result in some resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of supervisors or
commanders in the Police Department who have seniority to him,''
said City Councilman Sheldon Leffler, D-Queens, who is chairman of
the Public Safety Committee. ``That has often made it difficult for
someone assuming command to get people under him to follow his
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerik is also known to be temperamental, and his willingness to
demote and replace subordinates who do not live up to his
expectations may heighten resistance. Kerik comes out of a
department where the customers are under lock and key. He will
suddenly be serving the city at large, running an agency that has
four times as many employees. And Kerik, who does not have a
college degree, is now leading an agency that wants its
rank-and-file officers to have college experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is OK to be the commissioner without college, but you can't
be a cop without college,'' said Rafael Collazo, first vice
president of the Latino Officers Association, which represents some
correction officers and police officers. ``It is outrageous. If we
are holding out a standard for police, it should start from the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, by not naming Dunne, who earned a high degree of
respect from black leaders in the city when he was a Brooklyn
precinct commander, the mayor has already inspired some criticism
that he is not adequately committed to repairing the relationship
between the police and minorities, which has suffered following
recent shootings of unarmed black men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that the mayor felt there was a need to build
bridges,'' said City Councilwoman Annette Robinson, a Brooklyn
Democrat who is black. ``Joe Dunne could have done that. I am
saddened that he was not given that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton echoed that view, but Giuliani rejected the
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win with some people,'' the mayor said, laughing.
``We're doing everything we can to reach out. There are some people
that make their reputations and money on criticizing the Police
Department. You are never going to please them.''

`CYRANO DE BERGERAC': NOT JUST A NOSE, BUT A STATE OF MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  By BRUCE WEBER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   In the light mist that suffuses
the black-box stage of the Clark Studio Theater at Lincoln Center,
the Aquila Theater Company's production of ``Cyrano de Bergerac''
begins with an engaging series of directorial ideas. Actors enter
and begin building a makeshift theater out of rudimentary props: a
platform on a pushcart, a closet-size proscenium with light drapes
for a curtain.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Collapsed umbrella skeletons, lonely-looking on the floor, are
raised high by a pulley, their arms spreading, tiny lights along
them illuminated: Voila! Chandeliers! And the babbling Parisians
who arrive for a theater performance in the opening scene of
Rostand's comic melodrama are portrayed by a shuffling scrum of
actors holding puppets, the frivolous repartee traded among the
animators and the animated.
</P>
<P>
   The clear message is that this is to be a conceptual ``Cyrano,''
the vision of Robert Richmond, associate artistic director of the
Aquila, a nine-year-old, half-British, half-American touring
company based in London and New York. Richmond, who also directed
the company's ``Comedy of Errors'' that was enthusiastically
received in New York this summer (I didn't see it), has adapted the
script as well as directed this production, and he sets a high
standard for charm and invention in his opening sequence, which has
a precociously witty feel.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, it is only intermittently matched thereafter, as the
tether of the auteur tightens around the collar of the production,
and both actors and script are held in thrall to an inconsistent
welter of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Written in the late 19th century and set in the 17th, ``Cyrano''
is of course the defining parable of the
appearance-versus-character question, the story of the world's most
competent, honorable and manly man whose gifts and accomplishments
are dwarfed only by his nose _ the shame of which keeps him from
declaring love for the beautiful Roxanne, makes him defensive and
bitter, and consigns him to a martyr's loneliness. With its
gloriously highfalutin speechifying, its unabashedly outsize
passions and its elbow-in-the-ribs spirit, it has always been
attractively ripe for interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is that Richmond doesn't seem to have settled
on a tone for the show, which waffles among broad farce,
anachronistic sitcomesque jokiness and, particularly in the
soliloquies of Cyrano himself (Anthony Cochrane), straightforwardly
formal melodrama. His script adaptation mixes modern colloquialisms
and occasional vulgarity _ Cyrano's colleagues, the Gascon guards,
are prone to flatulence jokes and flourishing their middle fingers
_ with Rostand's more sophisticated tongue-in-cheekiness, an
undermining flirtation with sophomoric baseness.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond does create a handful of effective tableaux _ as in the
famous scene in which Cyrano, speaking for handsome but
inarticulate Christian (Alvero Heinig), woos Roxanne (Lisa Carter)
beneath her window _ in which the actors are positioned to play to
the audience rather than one another, a simple idea that pays
dividends to the performers, connecting them to their characters in
a way that Richmond's more heavy-handed tricks do not. His
swordplay scenes, in slow motion, replete with smoke and effusive
lighting, are merely grandiose.
</P>
<P>
   In sum there's a showoffy quality to this production:
independent scenes informed by separate ideas (Hey, watch this!)
rather than a firm grip on the play as a whole. But Richmond's
reins are tightly held throughout, and the actors are victimized by
his sacrifice of sustained wit for mere jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting players particularly appear to be roped firmly
into broad comic performances their gifts don't support Sean Fri,
as De Guiche, the privileged military officer who has designs on
Roxanne, and Heinig (who plays the fop humiliated by Cyrano's
eloquent recitation of nose jokes, as well as Christian) overplay
the wimpy card with conventional mugging.
</P>
<P>
   Most egregiously, Jenny Israel, as Roxanne's maid, for some
reason employs the overexcited accent of a Southern yahoo, as if
she reported to work from the set of ``The Andy Griffith Show.''
Even Carter, who, as Roxanne, is poised when in serious mode
(despite a hoop dress that consists of only barrel staves and
exposes her undies), becomes frivolously cartoonish when Richmond
unnecessarily wants her shallow attraction to Christian
underscored.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the play Cochrane gives a game performance
here; his verbal aptitude for Cyrano's eloquence is apparent (a
Scot, he has the voice and accent for it) and shows himself capable
of both the seriousness of Cyrano's torment and the glibness of a
Seinfeld. But the nature of the production has him shuttling back
and forth between impulses, as though he's changing masks; in his
several long speeches he does a lot of pacing, which feels less
like a character's nervous release of energy than an actor's
desperate search for a center.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's performance Cochrane had the added burden of
keeping his makeup glued on. His nose fell off twice before he
finally put it in his coat and finished the play without it. He
provided one glitteringly timed ad-lib, patting his pocket when he
would otherwise have pointed to his face, but otherwise his
performance was improved for his not having to worry about it.
Cyrano's nose was better off in his head, not on it. Like a lot of
obvious elements in this production, it was only calling attention
to itself.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: PENETRATING THE REMOTE AMAZON RAIN FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP M. BOFFEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brazil's vast Amazon rain forest, almost half the size of the
continental United States, has long been protected by its great
expanse and the difficulty of traversing it. Huge bites have been
chomped from its southern and eastern edges over the past three
decades to make way for cattle ranches, farms, highways and human
settlements. But the remote interior has remained untouched and
largely inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   That has led some skeptics to suggest that dire predictions
about the fate of the rain forest have been greatly exaggerated.
After all, satellite images show that only 14 percent of the
original Amazon forest in Brazil has been cleared, and some of that
is growing back. That would seem to leave almost 90 percent of the
forest still standing _ by far the largest expanse of intact rain
forest anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But an accumulating body of evidence suggests that the actual
destruction is far worse than the satellite images convey _ and
will get even worse in coming years. The satellites can see areas
cleared for ranches and farms, but they cannot spot the trees lost
to logging, which is done selectively in the Amazon rather than by
clear-cutting, and they cannot see destruction from fires beneath
the forest canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from the Woods Hole Research Center and Brazil
estimated last year that, when these two factors are considered,
the forests are actually disappearing at more than twice the rate
officially reported.
</P>
<P>
   The loss threatens to reduce the great diversity of plants,
insects and wildlife that makes the Amazon the greatest repository
of species on earth. It could also speed the rate of global warming
because forests store great amounts of carbon dioxide, the chief
global warming gas, and then release it when the trees are burned
or decompose.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmingly, the forest is becoming increasingly vulnerable to
fires like those that are currently devastating the American West
and that devastated the Amazon itself in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, fire is not part of the ecology of
the damp, humid rain forest. Truly destructive fires used to be
rare events, occurring every few centuries under conditions of
severe drought. But bad fires now seem to be occurring every couple
of decades, and many researchers have concluded that the forest is
drying to the point where the danger of conflagration is
significant.
</P>
<P>
   Now the forest is facing an added threat _ a slew of paved roads
and other infrastructure projects, mostly proposed under a
development program known as Avanca Brasil (Forward Brazil). These
projects could rob the forest of its inaccessibility and spur
accelerated development, further fragmenting the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of what could happen is already visible along a
road that runs 600 miles north from Manaus, a remote jungle
metropolis, to the Venezuelan border, as I found on a trip to the
area this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Though originally billed as a surgical cut through the trees to
give Manaus an overland link to the sea, the road soon sprouted
offshoots into the surrounding forest and prompted the central
government to announce a grandiose colonization scheme to boost
agricultural production. Soon the adjacent forest had been chopped
into fragments to accommodate fields and pastures.
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to research by Brazil's National Institute
for Amazon Research and the Smithsonian Institution, conducted in
forest fragments north of Manaus, was to deprive some species of
their habitats and allow sunlight and hot winds to penetrate the
forest and dry it out.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same may well happen elsewhere as additional roads
through the jungle are paved, including one from Santarem, an
inland port along the Amazon, to Cuiaba in the south, right through
the center of the rain forest. By one count, the length of paved
road through the Amazon will increase by more than 2,700 miles in
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, river channels will be widened, dams will be
built for electric power, and the forest will be transected by
power and gas lines. Meanwhile, Asian and Brazilian timber
companies are boosting their cutting and a wholly new threat _
large-scale soybean farming _ is emerging.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for the Amazon lies in a heightened environmental
consciousness. Environmentally minded governors have been elected
in two Amazon states, and even the governor of Amazonas, the state
encompassing Manaus, who once vowed to give a chainsaw to every
citizen, has begun extolling ecotourism. In one farsighted move,
Brazil has set aside sizable tracts in the Amazon as Indian
reserves, thereby giving stewardship to the indigenous peoples who
have long lived in harmony with the forest.
</P>
<P>
   No one can expect Brazil to forgo all development of the vast
Amazon, least of all the industrialized nations that long ago
leveled their own virgin forests. But the trick will be to guide
development along lines that preserve the region's biological
diversity and its spongelike ability to absorb carbon dioxide and
thus forestall global warming.
</P>
<P>
   International lending agencies can play a role here by ensuring
that whatever projects they finance are minimally destructive. The
G-7, in particular, has a farsighted pilot program to encourage
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers hope that a way can be found to give Brazil
credit under global warming agreements for the contribution its
forests make in storing carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists fear that approach could divert attention from
the need to curb fossil fuel emissions, and the Brazilian
government itself, always wary about outside interference in the
Amazon, has been opposed. But the approach may gain momentum from
the recent decision of the United States to seek similar credit for
its own forests. It is surely in the world's interest to encourage
Brazil to slow the destruction.

EDITORIAL: DEFENSE IN THE 21ST CENTURY  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Aug. 21: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign has embarked on an unhelpful debate
between the candidates about Gov. George W. Bush's assertion that
American military forces have been ``hollowed out'' during the
Clinton administration. That is not true, and it deflects the
conversation from a host of important defense issues that the
candidates should be addressing. The United States has by far the
world's most powerful military forces and invests more money in
maintaining them and their weapons than the next 10 largest
countries combined spend on their militaries. The question for
Americans to consider is whether the armed forces are adapting
quickly enough to fight the kinds of battles they are likely to
face in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The paramount non-nuclear military issue before the nation is
how the country's military forces should be organized, armed,
trained and used. We will deal in a later piece with nuclear
weapons and missile defense schemes. The United States must
maintain conventional military forces of sufficient strength to
defend the nation's vital interests. But war should always be the
option of last resort in settling a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   When Washington sends Americans into combat, it must do so with
the intention and means to achieve victory quickly and decisively
but without a wanton use of firepower. America cannot expect that
all its future conflicts will be as casualty free as those of the
past decade. Still, commanders must exercise military power
overseas with due regard for the safety of U.S. troops and civilian
populations. Ground troops should be employed only if air power and
precision weapons cannot achieve U.S. goals.
</P>
<P>
   Though the armed services have been downsized over the past 10
years and battle doctrines have been modified since the demise of
the Soviet Union, the United States today still has military forces
better suited to dealing with the kinds of threats encountered
during the Cold War than the new dangers the nation faces. That
must change.
</P>
<P>
   America now has some 1.4 million men and women on active duty,
down from about 2.2 million a decade ago. The Army has shrunk from
18 divisions (each with roughly 15,000 troops) to 10, though it
still has 470,000 people over all. The Air Force has gone from 22
air wings (each with 72 planes) to 12. The Navy has slimmed from 13
aircraft carrier groups to 12 and from a total of 528 ships to 315.
Defense spending, at nearly $300 billion a year and once again
rising in real terms, is now about 25 percent below the peak Reagan
years, after accounting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's conventional forces are now organized on the
assumption that they might have to fight two regional wars
simultaneously, for example in the Persian Gulf and the Korean
peninsula. Future military conflicts are possible in either region,
but overlapping wars seem highly improbable. The Pentagon should be
ready to fight one regional war on short notice, using ground
forces if necessary, while relying on air power to give the country
time to mobilize for a second conflict. One regional war would
likely require four to five army divisions, five air wings and
three carrier groups. In the highly unlikely event of a second war
breaking out at the same time, the country should rely on
mobilizing its 865,000 reserve troops, including eight reserve air
wings.
</P>
<P>
   To fight regional wars, the army needs lighter, more easily
transportable tanks and artillery than it has today. The Pentagon
needs to strengthen its capacity for airlifting and sealifting
troops into battle regions. The services also should be equipped
with a robust arsenal of sea- and air-launched cruise missiles,
more smart weapons and airborne drones for intelligence. The
Pentagon must improve the way it delivers to battlefield commanders
the sophisticated photographic intelligence now available from
satellites and reconnaissance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Persian Gulf War nine years ago, the largest U.S.
military operations have involved protracted peacekeeping, as in
Bosnia, punitive air and missile strikes, as in Iraq, or emergency
actions to halt ethnic conflicts, as in Kosovo. The future is
likely to see more of these interventions, which require different
kinds of training, equipment and planning than the large European
land battles anticipated during the Cold War. The Army, with its
heavy weaponry and lack of mobility, seems least prepared to engage
in these new conflicts, as seen in Kosovo. Even if a decision had
been made to use ground forces, it would have taken many months to
transport an effective force to the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and the Air Force are better adapted to the
post-cold-war world. But too much of their weapons budgets are now
allocated to dubious projects like the next-generation fighter
plane. This is an expensive indulgence in a world where no
potential rival is developing aircraft superior to America's
current F-16s and F-15s. The Air Force could use the money it would
save to assure a more reliable flow of spare parts and more cargo
planes for airlifting troops and equipment, among other things. The
Navy could devote its savings to adapting more of its submarine and
surface fleet for launching cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Charges that the U.S. military is unprepared to wage war are a
regular feature of presidential campaigns. A more fundamental
debate is needed, looking not just at time spent training for
combat but also at factors like air and sealift capacity and the
availability of appropriate equipment. Both candidates have
usefully called attention to issues of military pay and housing and
to the need to recruit and retain skilled pilots and computer
professionals at a time when the civilian economy is offering
attractive lures.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has offered a few thoughtful and provocative ideas on
defense but now needs to move beyond generalities. Gore, long a
student of military issues, has seemed content to let the Clinton
administration's record and policies speak for him. Both candidates
have chosen running mates who are interested and knowledgeable
about military issues. The two tickets should now move on to an
expansive defense debate.

PIPELINE BLAST VICTIM`S FATHER FRUSTRATED, SADDENED BY NEW
EXPLOSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CANDY HATCHER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLINGHAM _ Frank King, who for 14 months has lobbied and
yelled and cried and pleaded with public officials to make
pipelines safe, now doesn't know what to say.
</P>
<P>
   He is so, so sorry for the 10 in New Mexico who died Saturday in
the latest pipeline explosion. And he is so frustrated with some
politicians, who he says have done little but talk since promising
him last year that they'd ``do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Do they forget so quickly? he wonders. Were those three deaths
in Bellingham last year not enough?
</P>
<P>
   King's 10-year-old son Wade and his friend, Stephen Tsiorvas,
were playing in a park by Whatcom Creek the afternoon of June 10,
1999, when an enormous fireball raced through the creek and
enveloped them.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion, fueled by 229,000 gallons of gasoline that poured
from a break in the 400-mile pipeline system, also killed Liam
Wood, 18, a recent high school graduate who was fishing in the
creek.
</P>
<P>
   King vowed to make those deaths mean something. He vowed to work
hard to ensure that no other family would have to endure the
depression, the rage, the frustration his family struggles with
daily.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Sunday that he didn't work hard enough. Ten more
people _ five of them younger than 6 _ are dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could've done a better job of convincing the
politicians,'' King said. ``Maybe this accident wouldn't have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He blames the pipeline industry, which he said repairs pipes
only after leaks or spills. He blames the Office of Pipeline
Safety, the federal agency that is supposed to regulate the
industry. He blames members of Congress, who he says gave lip
service to the issue, proposed a few regulations and went home to
campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have zero tolerance for spills,'' he said. ``If we
eliminate spills, we eliminate accidents. Right now, we're reacting
to a horrible accident. We need the industry to be proactive, start
fixing things before they break.''
</P>
<P>
   Other pipeline-safety advocates echo his frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just keeps happening, over and over,'' said Lois Epstein,
senior engineer for Environmental Defense, a national research and
advocacy group. ``The Office of Pipeline Safety is in denial. We
need Congress to step in and put some specific requirements in the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more specific standards, increased liability,'' said
Epstein, who also wants right-to-know laws that tell the public how
pipelines are performing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the public relies on the Office of Pipeline Safety. In
May, the General Accounting Office called the office weak,
inefficient and slow to adopt reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the GAO reported that hazardous liquid pipelines such as
the one in Bellingham, which make up about 11 percent of the
nation's 2.2 million miles of pipeline, have eight times as many
major accidents per mile as natural gas lines. They also account
for half the property and environmental damage caused by pipeline
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The public has become immune to gas and oil leaks, Epstein said.
There are at least two 30,000-gallon spills a week in the U.S. But
``when it's just an environmental hazard, people say, `Oh, those
poor little birds.' When people are injured or die, it's, `Oh, how
can we prevent this from happening again?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson said another accident was bound
to happen. ``Pipeline accidents are not unique and isolated things.
The system needs to be strengthened. That's what we keep working
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the explosion in Bellingham, ``We have gotten so many
safety things done. I believe we have _ or will have _ the safest
pipeline in the U.S. But (the New Mexico explosion) will make it a
greater challenge for community confidence. People are going to be
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatcom Creek still bears scars from the fire. Towering over the
green weeds and flowing water are stark, black stalks that used to
be trees. They cut a mournful swath through the woods where a sign
warns: ``due to hazardous conditions, park area closed.''
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico, too, will have those scars _ and grief over the loss
of two families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said at the Washington State Legislature, `Not one more
death,''' said Sen. Georgia Gardner, D-Blaine. ``Now we have 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem here is the State of Washington and the State of
New Mexico have no authority to make meaningful safety regulations.
We have to have federal authority to allow us to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond being a tragedy,'' she said. ``I really think it's
criminal. We're not protecting these people.''
</P>

TIGER WOODS CAPS `TRIPLE CROWN' WITH PGA TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Move over, Ben. You've got company. Tiger
Woods is in the house, and he's here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, a playoff winner Sunday at in the PGA Championship at
Valhalla Golf Club, joined Fort Worth legend Ben Hogan as the only
professional golfers to win three major championshps in one season.
</P>
<P>
   Woods completed his version of the ``Triple Crown'' by holding
off Bob May with a birdie and two pars in a three-hole, aggregate
playoff. Woods, 24, forced the playoff by burying a 5-foot birdie
putt on the final hole of regulation to join May as the only
golfers in history to reach 18-under par at the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   For Woods, it marked his third consecutive victory in a major
championship and the third consecutive time he has recorded a
tournament scoring record on the way to hoisting the hardware.
Woods, who closed with a 67, posted sub-par scores in his final 14
rounds at major championships this season, with a scoring average
of 67.7 during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is dominant,'' said Tom Watson, who finished in a tie for
ninth at the PGA. ``Tiger is doing things nobody else has ever
done. You are seeing a phenomenon that the game may never, ever see
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, none of Hogan's victories during his 1953 ``Triple
Crown'' included a 72-hole score lower than 274 _ four strokes
higher than Woods' total Sunday. But the fact that Hogan won five
times in six starts, including a 3-for-3 sweep in 1953 majors (he
skipped the PGA), has caused some veteran observers to wonder if
Hogan hasn't been swept aside in a rush to esteem Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget that Hogan did this, too. And that year might
have been even better than Tiger's year,'' said Dave Anderson, 71,
a columnist for the ``New York Times''.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Jenkins, renowned author and golfer writer from Fort Worth
who covered Hogan in his prime, said he places the two seasons on
``equal footing.'' The merits of both accomplishments may be
debated, said Jenkins, but there's no question Woods' 2000 season
and Hogan's 1953 campaign constitute two of the four greatest years
ever turned in by a golfer.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates would be Bobby Jones' ``Grand Slam'' in
1930 (two professional and two amateur majors) and Byron Nelson's
11 straight victories in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a toss-up between those four, depending on your
perspective,'' said Jenkins, 70. ``But what Tiger did is definitely
one of the greatest four years in golf history.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods achieved his defining moment by shaking May, a career
non-winner on the PGA Tour, with a 20-foot birdie putt on the first
hole of the aggregate playoff. When he added two additional pars
and May could not answer with a birdie, Woods won for the fourth
time in the past five majors contested on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   This victory, he said, was his sweetest in a major because
because May _ who closed with a 66 _ made the chase extremely
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one memorable battle and I really enjoyed it,'' Woods
said. ``We never backed off from each other. It was
birdie-for-birdie, shot-for-shot ... That's as good as it gets,
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the closing round included more plot twists than a
Stephen King novel. May, 31, took the lead on the second hole with
a birdie-bogey swing and never relinquished it during regulation.
At the 72nd hole, May drained a 15-foot birdie putt from the fringe
that forced Woods to answer with a birdie of his own to continue
his historic quest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite falling a stroke short, May said the fact that he strung
together three consecutive 66s at Valhalla should prove ``there was
no fluke'' about his presence in a final-round pairing at a major
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said joining Hogan as a ``Triple Crown'' winner made for
``a special day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of admiration for a lot of great champions that
have played the game,'' Woods said. ``Ben Hogan won so many
tournaments, it's scary. He was incredible. He played at a level
that not too many players could ever attain.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods has attained that level three times this season. In
February, he became the first golfer since Hogan in 1948 to win six
consecutive PGA Tour events. Last month, Woods joined Hogan, Jack
Nicklaus, Gary Player and Gene Sarazen as the only golfers to
complete the career grand slam. Now, Woods and Hogan are the only
professional golfers with ``Triple Crown'' seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In one regard, Jenkins said Woods has eclipsed Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd live to see the day that a golfer would be
the world's most famous athlete,'' Jenkins said. ``But I have. It's
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredible, of course, could also serve as an appropriate
summation for Woods' 2000 season. Or Hogan's, in 1953. nn

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Having found no signs of life more than a week after
the Russian submarine Kursk plunged to the bottom of the Barents
Sea, rescue teams were preparing a plan Sunday to use a ship's
crane to rip a hatch off the giant vessel and begin the grim task
of recovering bodies and a lengthy and dangerous mission to salvage
the submarine's twin nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   In their first full day of work, a team of Norwegian divers
working with the Russians found the rear escape hatch on the
490-foot vessel badly damaged, a Russian official said, and the
divers failed in repeated attempts to muscle it open by hand and
with powerful, special tools.
</P>
<P>
   The divers reported that hatchway valves had been opened from
the inside. It is likely that the body of one of the submarine's
118 crew members lies in the air lock chamber and that the chamber
is filled with water, said Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who
is heading the investigation into the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   His description of the grim discovery was broadcast by Russian
television from the deck of the cruiser Peter the Great and was
consistent with remarks Saturday by Vice Adm. Mikhail Mostak, chief
of staff of Russia's Northern Fleet, indicating that one or more
members of the Kursk crew may have tried to make a desperate escape
from the submarine, only to perish when seawater under great
pressure rushed in.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of frenetic work at a depth of more than 300 feet, the
Norwegian navy team sent back vivid pictures of the escape hatch
that has defied nearly a week of efforts to open it. The divers
pounded with hammers on the hull hoping that their soundings would
locate any remaining air pockets inside.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked in teams of three in six-hour shifts, the divers
sent up requests for special tools to turn the hatch valves, and
some tools were fabricated on board the Norwegian vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, two Norwegian divers flew by helicopter to the
Russian submarine base at Vidyayevo, the Kursk's home port, to
practice opening and entering hatches on one of the Kursk's sister
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Planning was under way to rip the Kursk's hatch cover off by
force, according to Klebanov.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joint commission made a decision to open the top hatch of
the rescue lock chamber,'' he said, referring to the escape chamber
that passes through the hull, with inner and outer hatches that
allow emergency exit from the submarine. ``Unfortunately, they
failed to open it for several hours though very powerful tools have
been used.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision was made to try to rip it off with the help of a
crane on the Norwegian rescue ship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials reported that air pockets might still exist in
the compartment below the inner hatch, but they expressed no
expectations that any survivors could be found, though a Norwegian
military spokesman in Oslo, Kjell Grandhagen, said, ``We are still
working on the theory that we are looking for possible survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway's Rear Adm. Einar Skorgen, who is directing the Norwegian
rescue contingent, said the timing of the hatch removal was not
set. ``We have to clarify the consequences of opening it,'' he told
Norwegian television.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent cooperative spirit among Russian, British and
Norwegian rescue crews was somewhat undermined Sunday night when
the spokesman for the Norwegian armed forces, speaking in Oslo,
contradicted Klebanov's statements that the escape hatch was too
severely damaged to be opened manually, or with the British LR5
rescue submarine that arrived on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not drawn the conclusion that the hatch is so damaged
that it cannot be opened,'' the spokesman, John Epsen Lien, told
Reuters. ``We think it should be possible to open it with a British
or Russian rescue capsule.''
</P>
<P>
   (British officials said in London early Monday that Russia had
asked Britain to send its rescue mini-submarine down to the Kursk,
Reuters said.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Klebanov had said that video images of the hatch showed
a serious crack in the donut-shaped ring around it that is used to
create an airtight seal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we think the British sub will not be able to
dock,'' Klebanov said, adding that he believed that the Norwegian
divers would agree to enter the Kursk after studying the entryway
on one of the Kursk's sister ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their commander is now asking them who will go and it is
already clear that someone will go,'' Klebanov said.
``Psychologically, it is very difficult but there is assuredness
that several people will agree and the operation will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian officials have yet to confirm that their divers will
enter the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   What lies ahead after the hatch is opened is a complex and
dangerous investigation of the Kursk's nine compartments. Dangerous
battery acids, unexploded weapons and highly radioactive fuel
elements in the Kursk's twin reactors could pose a serious danger
to the recovery operation.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have speculated about plans to lift the rear
section of the submarine with surface ships and drag the vessel to
shallower water for easier access by salvage divers. With winter
already approaching in the Arctic region, it seemed possible that
the salvage operation could carry over to next spring, but Russian
officials have as yet given no definite accounting of their plans.
</P>
<P>
   As the Norwegian divers worked Sunday, Russian President
Vladimir Putin met in Moscow with senior clergymen of the Russian
Orthodox Church and expressed the powerlessness he felt over the
loss of the 118-member crew.
</P>
<P>
   The attack submarine went down Aug. 12 during military
maneuvers. Two explosions apparently ripped through the hull of the
submarine as it was running at periscope depth, and sent it
crashing to the seabed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With sorrow in our hearts and, I do not exaggerate, tears in
our eyes, we are following all that is happening in the Barents
Sea,'' he said. ``The sailors are doing everything they can to save
their comrades, but, alas, sometimes events _ and not us _ dictate
the logic of how a situation develops.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``until the last minute we will do all that can
be done to save whomever can be saved. We will struggle for the
lives of each of our sailors, and hope for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Putin remained at the Kremlin Sunday, despite calls for
him to travel to Severomorsk, the naval headquarters near the scene
of the disaster, the Russian president held a long conversation
with Igor Spassky, Russia's leading submarine designer.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's public remarks, delivered in an unusually somber and
deliberate tone as he stood in front of the golden brocade walls of
one of the churches inside the Kremlin walls, appeared in part to
be in response to a swell of criticism that the Russian military,
and Putin personally, were too slow to seek foreign assistance in
the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   An investigating commission, headed by Klebanov, announced on
Saturday that preliminary findings showed that the Kursk was
involved in a collision with an object near the surface weighing
8,000 tons or more. He said it was possible that the object was a
ship or an old mine.
</P>
<P>
   Or, Klebanov said, some unknown chain of events could have
triggered a massive internal explosion aboard the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Russian officials say most of the crew died in the
first two minutes after the explosion, including all officers on
the bridge. They say that the pressure of seawater rushing in
compressed the air in the hull and reduced the chances for survival
beyond a few days.

TOWN THAT LIVES OFF THE SEA MOURNS SUBMARINE DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>

   MURMANSK, Russia _ In this city that lives off the sea, people
know about disaster. But even here, the tragedy of the sunken
submarine Kursk, which entombed 118 sailors, has rattled residents
and brought a hush to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner of the city where most of the navy staff members
live, residents said they noticed an unusual stillness after
officials said on Saturday _ for the first time since the accident
on Aug. 12 _ that most of the crew on the nuclear-powered submarine
probably had died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood, called Rosta, borders the bay. It is not only
home to many navy people, but also to a navy museum and a submarine
repair factory. Tall grass and bright dots of purple flowers fringe
crumbling cement apartment buildings here. Only a few people were
strolling Sunday afternoon, though the air in this northern city
had warmed since morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so quiet today,'' said Sveta, a 29-year-old mother of
two, wheeling her youngest in a baby carriage. ``We keep thinking
about them, the sailors. The military _ that is the worst
profession. It is bad money and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   She has lived all her life in Murmansk. Her husband works on a
fishing boat that sails mostly in foreign seas, giving the family
access to much sought after foreign currency. She said that her
husband managed to avoid military service, compulsory in Russia,
after he graduated from college six years ago. Their 10-month-old
son, Dmitri, will follow his father's example when he grows up, if
she has anything to say about it, Sveta said.
</P>
<P>
   The navy has had its share of disasters for vessels from this
fleet. Another nuclear-powered submarine, the Komsomolets, sank off
the coast of Norway in 1989, killing 42 members of the crew after a
fire on board raged out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, federal agents stormed a nuclear-powered
submarine and shot a 19-year-old sailor who had killed eight crew
members.
</P>
<P>
   Many have left this region since the Soviet Union collapsed in
1991, mostly to chase higher wages and better job opportunities
farther south. The Murmansk region, which encompasses all of the
Kola Peninsula, and is home to 983,000 people, has lost about 15
percent of its population since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the region had one of the highest unemployment rates in
the country. According to the state statistics committee, an
average sailor brings home about $85 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the day after the Kursk sailors were declared dead,
residents continued to click on radios and televisions every hour
for the news as the rescue effort dragged on. But Sunday, as they
watched and listened, they seemed numbly resigned to the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Two women behind the counter at the Youth Cafe in central
Murmansk took a break from placing chickens on a roaster to turn on
a radio for news. People in line behind the counter leaned closer
to listen. Few took solace in the fact that foreign rescue crews
began work Sunday. The hospital boat meant for ailing crew members
left for the small town of Vidyayevo, where the sailors' families
are staying. It will instead treat anguished relatives.
</P>
<P>
   There were special prayers in the main church in town Sunday.
The Rev. Andrei Amelin, one of the three priests on duty, spoke of
his past service as a navy officer. The 29-year-old priest served
in the navy for 10 years before joining the church three years ago.
The church began holding special services on Monday as soon as news
of the accident spread.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents said that the mysterious submarine disaster
clearly shows that lives mean little here and that the government
in the Kremlin has lost touch with people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shame, a shame before the whole world,'' said Andrei
Lebedev, a 37-year-old engineer who works on a fishing trawler.
``Everyone knows how much they were being paid. Their lives mean
nothing.''
