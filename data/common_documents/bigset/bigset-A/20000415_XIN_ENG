<HEADLINE> Vietnam Refutes U.S. Resolution on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam Friday denounced a
resolution adopted Thursday by a committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives on human rights in Vietnam as blatant interference
in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh said
the External Relations Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives was deliberately distorting the facts and running
counter to the improving relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is a paradox that a country that made the harshest
violations against the Vietnamese people's fundamental rights is
now judging human rights in Vietnam, Thanh said.
</P>
<P>
One of the most fundamental human rights is to live in peace,
independence and freedom, she said, adding that the Vietnamese
people have experienced an extremely hard struggle against foreign
aggressors and suffered great losses and sacrifices to win those
fundamental rights.
</P>
<P>
More than anyone else, she noted, the Vietnamese state and
people respect, ensure and work for fundamental human rights.
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam, the spokeswoman stressed, such fundamental rights
as freedom of speech, press, assembly, demonstration, association,
belief and religion have been exercised and respected as
stipulated by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the state of Vietnam has exerted efforts to
improve people's living conditions, Thanh added.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's legal system has been improved step by step to ensure
fundamental rights to freedom and development for every Vietnamese
citizen in all fields, Thanh said.

<HEADLINE> Major Pak Infiltration Bid Foiled: India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian security forces foiled
on Friday a major attempt by Pakistan to send 60 heavily-armed
militants to the Kashmir valley, killing one of them and arresting
two others, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The infiltrators, allegedly backed by Pakistan, tried to sneak
into Indian territory through Nowgam area of Handwara in the
Kupwara sector in West Kashmir, but were confronted by alert
security personnel guarding the northern borders, the PTI quoted
official sources in Srinagar, capital of India-controlled Jammu
and Kashmir, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The militants were equipped with sophisticated weapons and the
exchange of fire lasted several hours, during which one
infiltrator was shot dead and two others nabbed, the sources said,
adding that the rest of the infiltrators fled back to Pakistan-
controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Indian security forces have launched a massive operation in
nearby forest areas to flush out infiltrators who could have taken
shelter in the dense woods, they said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first major infiltration attempt by Pakistan-
trained militants to sneak into the valley this season, the PTI
said, adding that chances of infiltration increase in summers as
snow starts melting on the mountain peaks on the Line of Control (
LoC).
</P>
<P>
The PTI also noted that with reports that more than 3,000
militants, including foreign mercenaries, were awaiting a chance
to intrude into Jammu and Kashmir to step up militancy, security
along the borders has already been beefed up.
</P>
<P>
Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes, however, said in
Calcutta Friday that he could see no tension along the LoC. "There
is nothing to be worried about so far as the LoC is concerned," he
said.

<HEADLINE> France Calls on Burkina Faso Parties to Hold Political Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- France Friday called on the
government and opposition parties of Burkina Faso to hold sincere
political dialogue to ease tensions which have resulted from the
arrests of some opposition militants recently.
</P>
<P>
"We learned that the demonstrations and strikes launched by
Fight Against Immunity has led to the arrest of several members of
the group, including its president Halidou Ouedraogo," said
Francois Rivasseau, assistant spokesman of the French Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Fight Against Immunity was protesting the immunity
protecting the people responsible for several murders in the
country, including a well-known journalist named Norbert Zongo.
</P>
<P>
"We are following with much attention the evolution of the
situation in Burkina Faso. We hope that the Burkina Faso
authorities, which have already taken important measures for
political reforms, will establish a sincere and frank dialogue
with the opposition parties on their worries and calls for a
reinforcement of democratic institutions," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
According to Agence France Presse, 39 members of the Fight
Against Immunity were arrested on Thursday by police and
paramilitary gendarmerie in Ouagadougou, capital of the country.

<HEADLINE> China Willing to Strengthen Cooperation in Organized Crime Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to enhance
cooperation with all other countries and international
organizations in fighting against cross-border organized crime,
Chinese Minister of Justice Gao Changli said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 10th UN congress on crime prevention and
offenders treatment, Gao said that since the situation on cross-
border organized crime has grown increasingly serious, "we could
not be successful in coping with this challenge without thorough
international cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Gao, who led the Chinese delegation to the congress, said the
international community, including the UN and all member states,
must further examine the state of cross-border organized crime and
take effective preventive steps against such crime in various
forms.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on China's measures against organized crime, Gao said,
China has a sound domestic legal system, which constitutes the
basis for fruitful international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's Criminal Law, revised in 1997 to define the
organization of and participation in organized crime and money-
laundering as criminal acts, has become more biting, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
China established special agencies responsible for the control
and prevention of organized crime in the early 1990s, he said. In
recent years, the Chinese law enforcement agencies intensified
their campaigns against criminal groups of Mafia nature involved
in smuggling and economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
China has signed with 31 countries 33 bilateral agreements on
legal cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We have also signed extradition treaties with 11 countries and
acceded to over 20 multilateral conventions relating to or
including articles on mutual legal assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
State leaders, ministers and representatives of over 150
countries, and representatives from UN and other international
institutions and non-governmental organizations are participating
in the eight-day meeting, which started on April 10.

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) stated Saturday their rejection to a
referendum and to the constitutional assembly proposed by the
government and the Liberal Party, respectively, against corruption.
</P>
<P>
The rejection is contained in a communique from the Secretariat
of the biggest guerrilla group in the country, made known by its
main spokesman Raul Reyes in San Vicente del Caguan, one of the
five municipalities that make up the distension zone.
</P>
<P>
"We reject the two proposals, because the referendum put
forward by President Andres Pastrana against corruption in the
Congress is already included in point seven of the agenda about
the political reform," said Reyes.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional assembly will be the final dot and the
product of the peace process in the country for the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The communique says at the same time that the FARC affirmed
their will to carry out to the end the peace process, underscoring
that "we will not leave the negotiations table unless a bomb blows
us up."

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Government, Sandinistas Seek National Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The country is in a situation of crisis, and to surmount it
there are only two choices. One of them would be to change the
government..., and the other to advance in a national dialogue in
which the economic and social themes and the theme of corruption
will be discussed," said Ortega.
</P>
<P>
The top Sandinista leader said that the present situation is
unsustainable for Nicaragua and "if we continue on the same track,
we are putting the country on the way to a social explosion, the
consequences of which we would not be able to measure."
</P>
<P>
President Aleman said "I share the idea of commander Daniel
Ortega of calling to a national dialogue with a vision of nation."
</P>
<P>
The convocation pretends that "all the social sectors will take
part in a common proposal to prevent them from complaining
afterwards that they were not informed of this or that," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 former contras blocked several highways of the
country last week demanding from the government to fulfill its old
commitment of legalizing the property of the land they are
occupying now.
</P>
<P>
One of the former contras was shot dead by police during the
confrontations, and at least five policemen were injured.
</P>
<P>
Some 17 former contras invaded Monday the Peruvian embassy in
Managua to request political asylum because they consider
themselves persecuted by police.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 Nicaraguan businessmen who were protesting Thursday
against the construction of a traffic circle that bars the
entrance to their stores faced riot police with sticks and stones.

<HEADLINE> Minsk Blasts U.S. Congress Statement on Belarus Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The statement on the situation in Belarus passed by the U.S.
House of Representatives makes a groundless and tendentious
assessment of the internal political situation in Belarus and of
actions by the authorities," said Belarus Foreign Ministry
spokesman Nikolai Borisevich, cited by Interfax.
</P>
<P>
"It is deplorable that the American lawmakers fail to
understand and make a biased assessment of the processes of
Belarussian-Russian integration, which are being conducted on the
basis of preservation of the independence and sovereignty of the
two countries and in the interests of increasing the welfare of
both peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress statement called on the U.S. administration
to put pressure on Belarus via the Russian leadership. "Such a
statement cannot be assessed in any other way than as open
interference in internal affairs and relations between sovereign
states," stated the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that the approval of such a document and the
principles it incorporates do not meet the goals of normalization
of Belarussian-American relations or of a wide public dialogue
that is being conducted in Belarussian society," Borisevich
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said Minsk is ready for a frank and open discussion with
Washington on any problem in bilateral relations, including
matters that cause concern in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"That is a much more effective path than a groundless
declaration of accusations," he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces $120 Million Dollars to Prevent Youth Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced 120 million dollars in new federal grants Saturday to
prevent youth violence in schools.
</P>
<P>
"In our national struggle against youth violence we must not
fail our children; our future depends on it," Clinton said in his
weekly radio address to mark the first anniversary of the shooting
deaths at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to place more police officers in schools and help even
the youngest kids cope with their problems.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced that he and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
will host a White House Conference on Teenagers on May 2 to "talk
through the challenges of raising responsible children."
</P>
<P>
"We need to talk about safety and security in every house in
America," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As we prepare next week to mark the one-year anniversary of
the tragedy at Columbine High School, our thoughts turn to the
safety of our communities, schools and children," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
On April 20, 1999, two students at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colorado, fatally shot 12 students and a teacher before
killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
Of the total amount of 120 million dollars, 40 million dollars
are granted to 23 school districts that he said have found
successful, comprehensive approaches to help troubled young people,
60 million dollars are allocated to provide 452 police officers in
schools in more than 220 communities.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said 20 million dollars are earmarked for local

KUWAIT CITY, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud arrived in the Saudi city of Jeddah Saturday for talks with
Saudi leaders mainly on Israel's possible withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Lahoud is scheduled to meet King Fahd
Ibn Abdul-Aziz, and Crown Prince and First Deputy Prime Minister
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Lebanese diplomats told the Kuwait News

</P>
<P>
Israel has announced unilaterally that it would pull back from
south Lebanon by July, which Israel has occupied since its invasion
of the tiny Middle East state in June 1982.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said Lahoud would extend gratitude to the Saudi
leaders for their relentless support to Lebanon against repeated
Israeli attacks on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi-Lebanese talks, they added, would also cover Arab
issues, the Middle East peace process and the Palestinian refugees
in Lebanon.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Over 9,000 Children, Elderly Die in March in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 9,328 children and
elderly people died of various diseases last month in Iraq due to
malnutrition and medicine shortages caused by the decade-long U.N.
sanctions against the country, said the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In a report released on Saturday, the ministry said that 6,438
children, under the age of five, died of diarrhea, pneumonia,
respiratory infections and malnutrition, while 2,890 above five and
elderly people died of hypertension, diabetes and malignant
neoplasms.
</P>
<P>
Such a mortality was in sharp contrast with the same month in
1989, when only 362 children and 407 elderly people died.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly called on the U.N. to end the harsh
sanctions, which have claimed the lives of more than 1.5 million
people ever since its imposition in 1990 to punish the country for
its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Iraq has long accused the U.S. and British delegates
at the U.N. Sanctions Committee of impeding the implementation of
the U.N. oil-for-food program by deliberately holding back the
contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries to buy food, medicine
and other humanitarian supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal, which was launched in 1996 and now in its
seventh phase, allows Iraq to sell a certain amount of oil every
six months to buy basic necessities to help offset the effects of
the stringent U.N. sanctions.

BETHLEHEM (Palestine), April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC) held a meeting here Saturday to welcome
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who arrived in the city for a state
visit to Palestine.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, PLC Speaker Ahmed Qurei welcomed Jiang's visit,
the first by a Chinese head of state to Palestine, saying the
Palestinian people are very happy to greet President Jiang in the
holy city of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people will never forget the lasting support the
Chinese people and its leaders have provided since the beginning of
the Palestinian revolution, and always appreciate their
understandings for the Palestine cause, Qurei said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat started his speech by
hailing Jiang's visit as a historic event. The visit is of special
significance because of the unique position China occupies in the
hearts of the Palestinian people, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
China has offered strong support for the Palestinian people
since the very beginning of their revolutionary cause, Arafat
noted. Over the past four decades, China has become a symbol of
lasting friendship both for the Palestinian people and its
liberation movement, he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestine has always conducted consultations with China at every
historical juncture in the Palestinian cause, and China's support
has enabled the Palestinian people to meet every challenge with
more strength and ability, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's visit came at a time when the Middle East peace entered
its most sensitive and difficult stage, Arafat noted, citing the
looming deadline for reaching a permanent peace between Palestine
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The final resolution of the regional conflict needs a more
businesslike attitude in the negotiations and especially stricter
honoring of signed agreements, Arafat stressed.
</P>
<P>
While adhering to their rights to establish an independent state
and insisting on the implementation of signed peace agreements and
relevant U.N. resolutions, the Palestinian people expect the whole
international community including China to play a greater role in
advancing the peace process, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed his belief that China as a country with
increasing international influence will continue to help the
realization of peace based on relevant U.N. resolutions in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian president expressed satisfaction over the
cooperation between China and Palestine in various fields, saying
he is very glad to see that more and more Palestinian businessmen
and entrepreneurs are establishing economic ties with their Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Arafat extended congratulations to Jiang over the return of Hong
Kong and Macao to the motherland of China, saying that the
Palestinian people are joining China in expecting the full
reunification of the country.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reiterated that Palestine upholds the "One China" policy
and supports China's policy of "One Country, Two Systems."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Arafat held a ceremony at the presidential
office to welcome Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Palestine was the second leg of Jiang's five-nation state visit.
The other four countries are Israel, Turkey, Greece and South
Africa. During the visit, he will also meet Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Alexandria of Egypt.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Give Direct Aid to Iraqi Opposition: Coordinator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government will start to
give direct material aid to opposition powers in Iraq, Francis
Ricciardone, the U.S. special coordinator for transitional period
in Iraq has said.
</P>
<P>
Ricciardone, who accompanied U.S. Assistant Secretary for Near
Eastern Affairs Edward Walker on a visit here, made the
announcement at a news conference Friday held in the American
Embassy in Turkey, the Anatolia News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the U.S. didn't give even one dollar to the Iraqi
opposition directly so far except that we spent money for some
organizations and conferences to help them express themselves."
</P>
<P>
He made it clear, however, that the United States will change
this way. "We'll start giving direct material support to the Iraqi
opposition in the near future. As a first step, we'll transfer 250,
000 dollars to the Iraqi opposition to make their organization more
effective," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ricciardone said that the Iraqi opposition, which will become
stronger by the material support, is expected to set up a "
civilized" Iraq to accept everybody as a first class citizen. "We
want to see Iraq as a free and undivided country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Turkish Armed Forces' operations against the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq, Ricciardone
said that Turkey exercises the right to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
The militants of PKK, which has been struggling for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey since 1984, often
cross the Turco-Iraqi border into Iraq to evade Turkish military
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Ricciardone said that the United States has attached importance
to views and proposals from Turkey in the formation of its policy
towards northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Initiates Friend of China Charity Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Five Chinese orphans with
facial deformities have arrived in the United States to undergo
surgery following a free trip provided by Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The children, ages one to three, suffer craniofacial
deformities and were brought to University of Virginia Medical
Center in Charlottesville, Virginia where they undergo surgery
beginning this week.
</P>
<P>
Four of the children are from the orphanage in Luoyang, in
central China, and one is from Beijing. One of them suffers a
massive blood vessel tumor in her lip and jaw, which impedes her
ability to eat.
</P>
<P>
The complimentary trip of the orphans and their caretakers,
arranged by Northwest Airlines, is part of "Friend of China"
program initiated by Northwest to assist people with special needs
in China in the areas of medicine and education.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Northwest will partner with well-established
U.S. and international charity organizations to utilize Northwest'
s staff and resources in China.
</P>
<P>
Northwest donated one million yuan (120,000 U.S. dollars) in
free air transportation to initiate the program. As part of the
program, Northwest will send more Chinese children to the United
States and American children to China to undergo medical treatment
that they are unable to receive in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
At Northwest's Shanghai-Detroit inauguration ceremony in
Shanghai Pudong International Airport in April 8, John Walkins,
Northwest vice president and general manager in China, and two
Chinese orphans unveiled a special design on the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The design featured the Chinese characters "Friend of China"
which were specially created by Mr. Qiao Yu, the famous Chinese
author and Chairman of China Music and Literature Academy.
</P>
<P>
The next group of children will likely fly to the Babies and
Children's Hospital in New York City and the C.F. Mott Hospital at
the University of Michigan. The children will undergo complex
surgeries at these hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The surgeons performing the operations are donating their
medical care and hospitals are donating their staff and facilities-
-all arranged by the Grace Children's Foundation.
</P>
<P>
"We are grateful that Northwest Airlines will be our partner in
this important endeavor." Nancy Robertson, executive director of
The Grace Children's Foundation in New York.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, Northwest will send at least 30 children to the United
States for heart, eye, cleft palate and other types of urgent
surgical procedures.

</P>
<P>
On Friday evening, police raided a house where they found a
large supply of tools and equipment that protesters apparently
planned to use to thwart police efforts to break up human
blockades. It was the second time this week that officers seized
such equipment.
</P>
<P>
Before police moved into the headquarters of the protesters
Saturday morning, some 20 demonstrators from 10 countries appeared
at the home of World Bank President James Wolfensohn and handed
him a letter protesting the institution's lending policies.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn, on his way to work, listened quietly as Vineeta
Gupta, an Indian physician, read part of the letter.
</P>
<P>
The protesters believe that the World Bank and IMF foist ill-
suited economic policies on poor nations, forcing them deeper into
misery. They also believe IMF and World Bank policies serve the
interests of rich countries at the expense of the poorest people
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Police expanded a security perimeter around the IMF and World
Bank, which stand just blocks from major tourist attractions such
as the White House. Sunday's demonstration is expected to start at
an area just behind the White House but President Bill Clinton
will be in California State over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hundreds of police surrounded the IMF and World Bank
buildings while a string of television crews set up residence
across the street, bringing worldwide media attention to what is
normally a quiet gathering of the world's financial elite.

<HEADLINE> Norway's Proposal for Hunting Whales Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Norway lost in its campaign here
Saturday for lifting a ban on hunting minke whales in the
northeastern and north Atlantic Ocean at the ongoing 11th
Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species.
</P>
<P>
Norway needed a majority of two-thirds votes to pass its
proposal, but with 120 countries casting votes, only 52 voted for
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, three proposals to open up commercial whaling
by Japan were also turned down.
</P>
<P>
Theoretically both Japan and Norway could revive its proposal
at a plenary session of the CITES conference next week, but they
said that they would not ask for another vote since the results
Saturday were not near the two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
Similar proposals were rejected by CITES at its previous
conference in 1997, and all commercial whaling has been banned by
the International Whaling Commission since 1986.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's War Veterans Start Evacuating Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's war veterans Saturday
started evacuating the farms they had occupied about two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
A leading member of the Zimbabwe National War Veterans
Association Godwin Ganda told the Zimbabwe News Agency before
addressing a small group of ex-combatants and ex-detainees at
Idaho farm in Norton, about 42 kilometers southwest of the capital
Harare that all the former freedom fighters should start
withdrawing from the farms with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the decision had come following Acting President
Joseph Msika's order and the one given by the High Court, Ganda
just said the decision was after analysing the state of affairs.
</P>
<P>
"All war veterans should start withdrawing with immediate
effect. We want the withdrawals to be done by today (Saturday)
and they will be done today," Ganda said.
</P>
<P>
Msika Thursday ordered all the war veterans and land-hungry
communal people to withdraw from the farms to clear the way for
an orderly resettlement.
</P>
<P>
He told them that it was no longer necessary for the former
freedom fighters to continue occupying the farms.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the High Court ordered the state and the
police to move in and assist in the eviction of war veterans and
communal people on the 900 occupied farms.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Warns Israel Against Encroachment on Lebanon After Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas
Saturday hinted continuation of resistance against Israel if it
encroaches on Lebanese territories after planned withdrawal from
south Lebanon by July this year.
</P>
<P>
"Any encroachment of Lebanon's territory, national water and
airspace will be regarded as aggression to Lebanon after Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon," the Oriental radio quoted Hezbollah
Secretary-General Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah made the warning before thousands of his followers in
southern suburbs of the capital city Beirut on the occasion of
Ashura, an official holiday as well as a holiday for the country's
Shi'ite Muslims to commemorate the death of Prophet Mohammed's
grandson, Imam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
In early March, Israeli cabinet approved Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's plans to withdraw Israeli forces from south Lebanon by July
with or without a peace agreement with Lebanon and its powerbroker
Syria.
</P>
<P>
However, under the Israel Defense Forces' withdrawal plan code-
named "Operation Morning Twilight," Israel will keep some military
outposts in areas about 500 meters into the Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas leader also called on Israel to release all
Lebanese prisoners in Israeli jails without trial for years.
</P>
<P>
He criticized France for its approval to grant political asylum
to members of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) after the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He called on France to correct its mistake so the long-standing
relations between the two countries will not be blemished.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard Thursday said his country
was considering accepting SLA militiamen after Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been waging a war of attrition
to end Israel's occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed guerrillas could hold the balance
in determining the state of the Israeli-Lebanese border after
Israel pulls out its troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled security zone in 1985 in south
Lebanon with a claimed aim of protecting its northern border from
cross-border attacks by anti-Israeli guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Canada Bars Asian Travelers against Livestock Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Travelers who have recently been
to South Korea and Japan are being ordered to stay away from farms
and ranches for 30 days after their arrival in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Canadian health inspectors are imposing the restrictions
because they fear that travelers could be carriers of an
agriculture condition known as foot-and-mouth disease on their
clothes and in their luggage.
</P>
<P>
The country's Ottawa Citizen newspaper reported Saturday that
officials with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency began notifying
Canada Customs agents of the restrictions this week after
outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease were confirmed in Japanese and
South Korean cattle.
</P>
<P>
Canadian farmers are being told not to allow anyone onto their
farms who may have recently traveled in the two northeastern Asian
countries until one month after their arrival.
</P>
<P>
Travelers from the two countries are being advised to wash
their clothes upon arrival, while dogs used by Canada Customs will
also be looking for potentially infected meat products being
brought into Canada, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Foot-and-mouth disease does not affect humans, but is capable
of wiping out entire heads of livestock. Canada has been free of
the disease since 1952, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Lauds Palestinians' Efforts in Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BETHLEHEM, Palestine, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin praised the Palestinians for their
painstaking efforts in pushing forward the Middle East peace
process and reaffirmed China's support to their just cause.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the welcome ceremony co-hosted by President of
the State of Palestine Yasser Arafat and speaker of Palestine
Council Ahmad Qurei, Jiang expressed his appreciation that the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), led by President Arafat, has
chosen the correct solution in settling the dispute between Israel
and Palestine through peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that by adopting a flexible and pragmatic stance in
peace negotiations with the Israelis, the Palestinians have made
great efforts and contributions in shoring up the peace process in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Like all peoples in the world, the people in the Middle East
are yearning for a peaceful, stable and developing new century,
Jiang said, adding that it is gratifying that the peace process in
the region has seen vital breakthroughs after overcoming various
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
The voice demanding accelerated peace talks for an earlier
solution to the Palestinian-Israeli disputes and achievement of
regional peace and development are increasingly louder, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the international community is paying more attention
to the peace process in the region, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a peaceful solution to the Middle East issue and
achievement of lasting peace and harmony between the two great
peoples of Arabs and Jews are the inevitable end-results in the
historical process of development and progress.
</P>
<P>
If related United Nations' resolutions and the "land for peace"
principle are strictly observed, Jiang said, any difficulties and
obstacles facing the Middle East issue could be overcome through
earnest and mutually-trusted talks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that the peoples in the region would soon
bury their hatchets to jointly build a beautiful future.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also lauded the attainments that
Palestinians have made under the leadership of President Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinians, who had made important
contributions to the human civilization and progress in history,
have at long last established their own political regime on their
own land, and are now advancing toward the founding of an
independent state, following long-term unremitting struggles for
national liberation and independence.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he is glad to see that the Palestinian people are
enthusiastically undertaking economic constructions and believes
that the country will have a better and brighter future.
</P>
<P>
Jiang reiterated the Chinese government's stance of supporting
firmly the Palestinian people in their just cause and the Chinese
people are lasting, trusted friends of their Palestinian
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Arab and Chinese, two peoples linked by the
Silk Road in ancient times, have enjoyed long-standing friendship
and given mutual support in their respective great struggles for
national liberation and independence.
</P>
<P>
Over the past half century, the Chinese government and people
have earnestly stood by the Palestinians in their just struggles,
and China is one of the first countries that acknowledged the
Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Palestinian State,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that bilateral friendship, tested by time and
international ups and downs, gets firmer as time goes by.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that on the land of Palestine, he and Arafat, a
friend of the Chinese people who visited China for many times,
discussed the friendly Sino-Palestinian relations and agreed to
enhance bilateral cooperation.

courtesy but it will help advance the solution of a number of key
problems of our cooperation," Putin said.

He will hold talks with Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko on the speed of unification and concrete steps to

<HEADLINE> Fighting Resumes in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting resumed in
Somali Lower Shabelleh region between the Biyo-Mal and Tunnih
clans after the break-up of three cease-fires agreement between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Unexpected exchange of heavy gunfire has flared up between the
two sides in Ababay village, some 10 Km North of Brava town, after
a Biyo-Mal man was killed.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has then intensified early on Saturday morning as
the sphere of the clashes enlarged to Bur Olow village, about 13
Km South of Brava town.
</P>
<P>
As the less armed Tunnih fighters have started retreating
backwards, the Biyo-Mal men have further culminated their
insurgencies against the villages of the Tunnih people South of
coastal Brava district.
</P>
<P>
There are no exact casualty figures available at this as the
fighting still continues in the remote countryside deep to the
South of Brava.
</P>
<P>
However, commuters who fled the fighting and reached Brava
district have confirmed seeing three dead bodies in Arshanley
village, 40 Km South of Brava district.
</P>
<P>
A VHF radio operator in the region has also confirmed the death
of four more people and nearly ten others wounded. One of the
wounded men from the Biyo-Mal clan has been brought to Brava town
last night. The wounded of the less armed Tunnih fighters have
nowhere to turn to for the treatment of their wounded ones.
</P>
<P>
The armed confrontations between the local clans is seriously
hampering the movement of the desperately need humanitarian
supplies. This fighting between the Tunnih and Biyo-Mal clans in
Lower Shabelleh region has intercepted the smooth movement of a
large WFP food convoy heading towards the famine stricken region
of Bay.
</P>
<P>
At least one was killed and two others wounded after the
security guards escorting the WFP food convoy have been attacked
by gunmen from the Biyo-Mal clan fighting against the Tunnih
people in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to a VHF radio operator, the convoy consisting of
more than 30 trucks of food with about a dozen battle wagons
escorting them was ordered to stop for control outside Arshanley
village by the Biyo-Mal fighters.
</P>
<P>
But the escort militiamen have opposed to the orders of the
gunmen and have engaged them instead immediately.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report of casualties on the security guards
of the WFP convoy, but according to the report, the Biyo-Mal
fighters have been chased away and four assault rifles have been
confiscated from them and with force the convoy headed towards its
destination.
</P>
<P>
Several battle wagons from the Islamic courts have rushed to
Brava district Saturday in an effort of helping restore the law
and order and play a mediation role in the conflict between the
Biyo-Mal and Tunnih clans.
</P>
<P>
Elders from the warring clans have called upon the Islamic
courts to intervene into the situation and the Islamic courts now
seem to be responding to the call.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between the two clans began late last month over
farmlands leased to Biyo-Mal farmers. Since there had been no
rains for the past season, the Biyo-Mal farmers claimed that they
still reserve the right to cultivate the land until they make one
harvest, something the owners of the farmlands have refused.
</P>
<P>
Several villages have already been destroyed and hundreds of
families have been displaced since the fighting began.

Jiang noted that the history and reality of the Middle East have
proved that use of force can not solve the problem and that
confrontation goes against the trend of the times. Instead, peace
negotiation is the only way out of the crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
He praised Arafat's adherence to the strategic choice of solving
differences through peace negotiation and his unremitting efforts
to expand the Palestinian self-rule areas by combining principled
stance with flexible tactics.
</P>
<P>
China is also glad to notice that the Palestinian leaders value
the unity of various parties in Palestine, coordination among Arab
countries and rallying international support so that the just cause
of the Palestinian people have won support from peace-loving forces
in the world.
</P>
<P>
As negotiations proceed, the peace process will be faced with
more difficulties, which call for all parties concerned to conduct
practical negotiation in the spirit of "respecting the history,
facing the reality and placing an eye on the future," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way will progress be made in the peace process by
overcoming differences and obstacles," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated China's support for the peace process,
saying that the Middle East problem must be solved in accordance
with relevant United Nations resolutions and the land-for-peace
principle. Palestine and Israel should abide by the agreements
which have already been reached between them, he said.
</P>
<P>
The same principles should be applied to the settlement of the
conflicts between Israel and Syria as well as between Israel and
Lebanon, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China will spare no efforts in realizing fair
and lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Arafat gave a briefing on the peace process, saying that despite
many difficulties, Palestine will continue its efforts to push
forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two presidents were present at a signing
ceremony of two bilateral documents on economic cooperation and
trade as well as on China's assistance to the construction of a
hospital in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here Saturday morning for a state visit to
Palestine at the invitation of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a Chinese head of state toured Palestine,
which is the second leg of Jiang's five-nation visit. The other
four countries are Israel, Turkey, Greece and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects UNMOVIC Arms Inspection Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Baghdad on Saturday rejected a U.
N. Security Council decision to approve a new arms inspection plan
for Iraq, saying the move means "nothing."
</P>
<P>
"What has been decided by the Security Council concerning the
commission which they have set up does not mean anything to us,"
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Aziz reiterated Iraq's rejection of the Security Council
Resolution 1284, which created the new arms inspection body, the
United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspections Commission
(UNMOVIC), for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I have never hinted that Iraq will cooperate with this
resolution," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking two days after the Security Council unanimously
approved an arms inspection plan for Iraq, drawn up by Hans Blix,
executive chairman of UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also repeated a call for the total lifting of the decade-
long U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"Any resolution that does not satisfy Iraq by lifting the
embargo carries no value," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz is just one of the senior Iraqi officials who have
repeatedly rejected Resolution 1284, claiming that the resolution
aims at either prolonging the U.N. sanctions or placing Iraq's oil
under "colonial control" of the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, who says it has long been rid of any weapons of mass
destruction, has barred U.N. arms inspectors from returning the
country since December 1998, when the U.S. and Britain launched the
four-night Operation Desert Fox air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has insisted that the total lifting of sanctions is the
precondition for the return of U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 1284, adopted last December, stipulates the return of
U.N. arms inspectors to Iraq and offers to suspend sanctions for
renewable 120-day periods if inspectors report that Iraq has
cooperated "in all respects" with them and shown progress towards
answering their outstanding questions about its disarmament.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook, who arrived here on Saturday, will prepare the ground for
the "defreezing" of Indo-U.K. defense ties, which were affected by
India's nuclear tests in 1998, an Indian Foreign Office spokesman
said Sunday.

Cook, who will begin official talks with his Indian counterpart

</P>
<P>
The meeting, which will be the fifth of the group, is likely to
focus on armament purchases, military cooperation and strategic
dialogue, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The meeting may be followed by visits of chiefs of the army and
naval staff, which were called off after India's nuclear tests, he
said, adding that the British government had extended a fresh
invitation to the Indian side.

<HEADLINE> Majority of Norwegians Vote for Joining EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- An absolute majority of
Norwegians voted yes in a recent nationwide survey on the
country's application for the membership of the Europe Union, the
evening paper Aftenposten reported here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 56 percent of Norwegians said they are
for their country to join the EU, 6 percent more than those who
said yes last December, while those who voted against went down to
44 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, more voters backed EU membership in
almost every part of the country than last December.
</P>
<P>
The opinion shift is most noticeable in the north, where voters
used to be opposed to the EU membership by a large margin. However,
this time the survey counted 45 percent of yes votes, 15 percent
higher than in December.
</P>
<P>
In Oslo, 63 percent said yes while only 56 percent did in the
last survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey also witnessed a more positive attitude among female
voters. Forty-three percent of Norwegian women agreed to joining
the EU, 6 percent higher than that of four months ago.
</P>
<P>
Support also increased among male voters, from 54 percent to 57
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian government had applied for EU membership twice,
in 1972 and in 1994 respectively. Both attempts failed in public
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the public opinion now turns favorable for
such a move because in recent years, the integration process is
getting faster in Europe, particularly since the launch of the
euro and the EU decision to set up a European Rapid Reaction Force.

President Putin a major political victory and opening the way for
talks with the U.S. on further cuts in both nation's still-

<P>
BETHLEHEM, Palestine, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here Saturday that furthering the Sino-Palestinian
friendly relations, which have withstood changes of international
situation, is in the fundamental interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should be committed to promoting bilateral ties by
constantly adding new contents to the friendship, Jiang said during
his talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining frequent high-level contacts constitutes an
important way of promoting the bilateral ties, Jiang said, adding
that the leaders of the two countries should encourage the
exchanges on various levels and strengthen the consultation system
as an effort to push forward the relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Palestine should explore news ways and
channels to enhance economic and trade cooperation. The two
governments should encourage the business circles of the two
countries to speed up mutual beneficial cooperation in order to
push the bilateral trade to a new high, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation to Palestine's adherence to the
one China policy and support for China's re-unification cause and
China's stances in dealing with the international issues.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Chinese government and people always
support the just cause and reasonable requirements of the
Palestinian people, as well as the Palestinian self-rule
government's right choice of settling conflicts through peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens, China will never change its stand of
supporting Palestine's just cause, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat extended his warm welcome to Jiang, saying that the
Palestinian people are very pleased to receive Jiang, the good
friend of Palestine, on their own territory.

He cited the visit as an important one which will have
significant bearing in the world.
</P>

tremendous support and help to their struggle, and Palestine would
like to consolidate its ties with China in the new century, and
expand the cooperation in various fields.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The battle of loss-making Rover
has taken a new twist as its ex-Executive John Towers formally
launched his consortium's bid to take over the company.
</P>
<P>
BBC quoted German car maker BMW Saturday as saying that Werner
Saemann, head of the UK-based Rover, held talks with Towers in
Birmingham on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Towers was providing a new offer, worth about 800 million
pounds, for Rover, which BMW plans to spin off to British venture
capital fund Alchemy Partners.
</P>
<P>
Though few details of Towers's bid have been disclosed, it
envisages the continuation of volume car production, which would
mean far fewer job losses than the Alchemy plan.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that Towers's bid has two
alternatives: one will have the new mini built at Cowley and the
other will not.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that BMW has halted the transfer of the Rover
workforce to venture capitalist Alchemy. The news delighted
General Secretary Roger Lyons of the Manufacturing, Science and
Finance Union.
</P>
<P>
"The delay means BMW has finally acknowledged its
responsibility towards thousands of skilled and professional Rover
employees," said Lyons
</P>
<P>
The Towers plan was endorsed by Trade Secretary Stephen Byers,
who said, "It offers a better prospect than perhaps anything else.
He has some exciting ideas which are worthy of consideration."

U.S. dollars for health emergency to avert preventable
drought-related diseases in parts of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian authorities have
suspended all the students of the Faculty of Engineering at the
University of Dar es Salaam following a last week bloody riot
among the students, local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
All the 883 students were forced to vacant the campus effective
from Friday to allow for an investigation into the April 7 violent
encounter between them and the students from the Faculty of Law, a
notice by the university was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A bloody fighting broke out when the engineering students
blocked the law students from using their lecture hall last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The university authorities had to seek the policemen to
intervene as the students exchanged blows and stones, chairs and
bottles, causing injuries and destruction of property.
</P>
<P>
Uniformed policemen have since been standing guard at the
administration block and patrolling the paths and buildings of the
university.
</P>
<P>
The administration had formed a four-member committee to
conduct a preliminary investigation into various aspects of the
violation.
</P>
<P>
A lecturer was quoted as saying that the conflict was a
manifestation of poor behavior formation of the students and that
it would be hard to reform them during their short stay on the
campus.
</P>
<P>
"I am shocked by this senseless struggle characterized with
selfish and individualistic motives that cannot be easily
understood by a mature person, " Dr Sengondo Mvungi of the Law
Faculty added.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian States to Pay Own Foreign Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- States in Nigeria are henceforth to
 liquidate their foreign debts on themselves, said a new Nigerian
federal government directive given Friday aimed at ensuring
prudence in the handling of public funds.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper said on Saturday
that before the instruction, the federal government used to pay
foreign debts from the federation account before disbursements
were made to all the three tiers of government.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement became a disadvantage to states which had
little or no debts as foreign debts were settled before
disbursements based on the revenue allocation formula.
</P>
<P>
But those states with huge foreign debts voiced their
dissatisfaction with the directive.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the country's western Oyo State government
Adesoji Akanbi decried the situation as one in which inherited
debts could cripple developmental efforts of various state
governments.
</P>
<P>
He bemoaned the situation whereby the Oyo State government
would spend the equivalent of its one year budget on debt
repayment within its short lifespan which ends in three years.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Massive Gold Sales Not to Cause Devaluation (1) By Li Nuer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The world's total demand for
gold will continue to rise and gold price is likely going up in
the coming few years despite many central banks' intention to
reduce their gold holdings, a senior World Gold Council (WGC)
official said.
</P>
<P>
"No devaluation of gold will occur since there is an estimated
steady rise in the demand of gold every year despite the massive
gold sales by many central banks," Emily Y. M. Li, a WGC area
manager, told Xinhua Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gold will remain to be a stabilized financial tool in the
future and it continues to play an important role in the total
gross reserves of all countries around the world, Li said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the United States, which has the biggest share of
the world official gold holdings, Li noted, has so far had no
intention to sell any of its 8,139 tons of gold, which represents
56.1 percent of its total gross reserves.
</P>
<P>
However, the WGC official admitted, the gold price has been
depressed since last May when the British central bank made a
decision to dispose of 415 tons of gold out of the 715 tons it
holds.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss bank authorities are also expected to sell late this
spring some 200 tons of gold, which is causing anxiety in the
market as the Dutch central bank has already sold a total of 100
tons of gold as part of its plan to sell 300 tons over five years
from the announcement at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, Li strongly believes in the metal's continued
valuable role in economy. "Gold is one of the most stable
financial tools, and also a kind of independent assets," she
explained. "It is not affected by any political and economic
changes of a country."
</P>
<P>
She gave some examples in this regard. During the Asian
financial crisis, Li said, residents in South Korea sold their
gold jewelry to the central banks and hundreds of tons of gold
were traded for foreign currencies to tide over the difficulty.
The same was also true in Thailand and Indonesia, she said.
</P>
<P>
"A stock market may collapse, but gold will never," Li said.
With the economic globalization, all countries need gold to build
up their resistance to any financial risks, including wars and
natural disasters, she elaborated.

<TEXT>
<P>
Li stressed that it is very important to keep a proper ratio,
preferably 20 percent to 30 percent, of gold in a country's gross
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Li attributed the psychological pressure and fears of gold
devaluation to media involvement in the recent gold sales. As a
matter of fact, more gold holdings were sold by the central banks
10 years ago than in recent years, she added.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that there is a total demand for gold of some
3,000 tons annually and the total annual production every year is
estimated about 2,400 tons. The gap of 600 tons has to be met by
central banks' gold trading, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to WGC figures, the world's total demand for gold in
1999 increased by 21 percent from 1998 to reach 3,278.4 tons, of
which 85.3 percent was needed by the jewelry industry and 14.7
percent went to the investment market.
</P>
<P>
To remove the uncertainty in the gold market, 15 leading
central banks, including the European Central Bank and the
national banks of the United Kingdom and Switzerland, signed a
pact in Washington in September last year to curb the selling of
any of the gold reserves apart from "already decided sales" in a
five year period. They also agreed not to expand their gold
leasing and use of gold futures and options.
</P>
<P>
The 15 signatories to the Washington Agreement collectively
hold around 16,000 tons of gold, more than 50 percent of the world
's official gold holdings. The United States, the International
Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements have also
said they will abide by the spirit of the Washington pact, and
this brought the total amount of official gold to be covered by
the agreement to 26,000 tons, or nearly 85 percent of the world's
total.
</P>
<P>
According to the WGC official, the total of the already decided
sales over the next five years will not exceed 2,000 tons, or
about 400 tons annually. Of this total, 1,300 tons will be sold by
Switzerland and 365 by the UK, with approximately 335 tons for
countries that have already decided to sell but have not as yet
made an announcement.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the pact has increased the certainty and
transparency of the official gold holdings and removed the anxiety
over the sales and the reduction of the official gold reserves
over the past years.

<P>
Commenting on China's gold market, Li said, as a gold producer
and a key gold consumption center, China ranked the third in world
gold demand in 1999 with about 205 tons, next to India and the
United States, and the fourth in gold output after South Africa,
the United States and Australia, with about 173 tons.
</P>
<P>
With its expected accession into the World Trade Organization,
China's reform in the gold market will go faster and the imminent
need is to work out an efficient gold management system compatible
with its market-oriented environment, the WGC official said.
</P>
<P>
China adjusted gold price in 1999 six times in line with the
international pricing, as against once or twice in 1996 and 1997,
and to relinquish control on silver purchase and allocation, China
already opened the domestic silver market in January 2000, a
stepping stone for gold market reform.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China's total annual gold output is estimated at
160 to 170 tons in the past few years, with an annual rise of 12
percent to 20 percent, and the total amount produced last year was
170 tons.
</P>
<P>
However, the efficiency is not as high as expected, for China
has a total of 1,200 gold mines, each with an annual output of
over one ton, but South Africa has only 21 gold mines and its
total annual gold output is over 200 tons, said Li, who has been
in charge of the WGC's gold business and research in China's
mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan for over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the rapid growth of the gold output in China in
the past years to the out-of-control mining and the subsidy
provided by the central bank, the People's Bank of China. With the
fast paces of reforming the gold mining system, she said, there
will be no big increase in gold output in the country in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Li said, the gold mining cost in China is as high
as 250 U.S. dollars per ton, while that of South Africa is below
200 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Even though, China has an immense gold market potential," the
WGC official concluded.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cambodia Strives to Develop Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government has
been taking various measures for the development of the tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
Like other countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS),
Cambodia has much to offer in terms of culture, nature, history
and scenic beauty and the traditional hospitality, such as the
world famous tourist destination -- Angkor Wat, and the three
beautiful rivers -- Mekong, Toule Sap and Bassac.
</P>
<P>
Despite its rich resources, Cambodia's tourism industry
remained undeveloped in past years due to the decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the peace, political stability and the efforts made by
the new coalition government since it was formed in 1998, the
Kingdom of Cambodia has received more than 367,000 tourists in
1999, a 28.35 percent increase over a year earlier and earned 136
million U.S. dollars. And in the first two months of this year,
the number of tourists rose by 53 percent compared with the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
To improve the tourist environment, the Cambodian government
took many measures to improve the social order and security, such
a s the crackdown on illegal weapons and other criminal offenses.
</P>
<P>
Many national roads and bridges have been renovated and
repaired. And the government plans to open up more border areas to
access by cars and coaches from Vietnam, Laos and Thailand, for
the first time in 30 years. That will make ecotourism based on
Cambodia's exceptional flora and fauna and its interesting hill
tribe cultures a major new part of the attraction.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, airports and aviation improvements are at the top of
the ministry of tourism's agenda. Work is under way to expand the
terminal at Phnom Penh's airport while approval has been given for
an upgrade of Siem Reap runway and back up facilities to
accommodate larger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Besides the improvement of hard infrastructure, the royal
government is also concentrating on the soft infrastructure - the
institutions, laws, policies and plans as well as the training
required to attract investment and development and deliver an
international standard tourism product.
</P>
<P>
The policies adopted by the royal government include working
closely with the private sector to create a conducive business
environment and harness their resources and ideas, to welcome
foreign investors and provide incentives and support to the
private sector to develop the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
In order to raise the popularity and to improve its
international image, the royal government has made its endeavor to
carry on active promoting and advertising.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cambodia attached great importance to enhance the
bilateral cooperation on tourism with its neighboring countries.
For the first time, it hosted a regional tourism conference
recently with an aim to make the region more alluring to tourists
by working together with the five countries that share the Mekong
river -- Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and China.
</P>
<P>
The government's "Open Skies" policy has attracted scores of
airlines to seek landing rights or increase existing frequencies
and passenger loads to Phnom Penh and to Siem Reap.
</P>
<P>
While the Vietnamese Airlines launched its direct flight from
Ho Chi Minh City to Siem Reap province on January 7, 2000, the
Bangkok Airlines, also taking advantage of the policy, introduced
direct flights between Phnom Penh and Pattaya and Phuket recently,
in addition to its direct flight from Bangkok to Siem Reap since
1998.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has now opened air links with Bangkok, Singapore,
Kuala Lumpur, Ho Chi Minh city, China's Hong Kong and Guangzhou.
On April 9, 2000, Royal Air Cambodge began its twice-weekly
commercial flights to China's biggest city Shanghai to attract
more Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
According to the tourism ministry, the country has built more
than 200 hotels in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Sihanoukville and other
provinces with about 8,000 rooms. There are 161 travel agencies
with more than 1,000 tourist guides.
</P>
<P>
While industry sources expected that Cambodia in the next few
years is going to be a big, big market, Tourism Minister Veng
Serevuth expressed his belief that "three to five years from now
on, this country will be booming."

<HEADLINE> 9 Kosovars Detained for Refusing to Leave Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
Saturday moved against a group of Kosovar refugees, taking nine of
them into detention for refusing to leave Australia.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said the nine had made it
clear they would not leave the country voluntarily by Sunday's
deadline.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 Albanian Kosovars, who were given temporary refuge
in Australia, were refusing to return home.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock declined to say where the nine had been taken, but it
is believed they could have been flown to secure detention centers.
</P>
<P>
"We've made arrangements at this stage to move nine -- a family
of four, two families of two and one other person," Ruddock told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said others had signed forms agreeing to leave Australia.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said any more Kosovars who do not agree to leave by
Sunday would also be taken into detention.
</P>
<P>
He said although the Tasmania State Premier Jim Bacon had
indicated he would be prepared to sponsor some of the Kosovars to
remain, all applications to settle in Australia must be made from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
"There are provisions for state and territory-nominated
categories of sponsorship," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> West-Boosted Economic Reforms not Benefit Africa: Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Tanzanian scholar
has criticized that despite the adoption of painful economic
reforms by many African countries over the past two decades, the
promised benefits of trade liberalization and increased foreign
investments have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
The Vice Chancellor of the University of Dar es Sallam Matthew
Luhanga said Friday that Africa has not yet achieved easier access
to northern markets, expanded technology transfer and technical
assistance, a local newspaper The Guardian reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Seventy percent of wealth generated by trade liberalization
have flown to developed countries," Professor Luhanga told a
seminar on the role of the United Nations in meeting the
challenges of globalization in the 21st century held in the Dar es
Salaam University.
</P>
<P>
Luhanga said that current rules governing world trade, which
were set largely by the industrialized countries, had only
contributed to Africa's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization is a fact of life but I believe we have
underestimated its fragility," he said. "The spread of markets
out-passes the availability of societies and their political
systems to adjust to them."
</P>
<P>
He warned that without strong governance, the dangers of global
 conflicts could be the reality of the 21st century as revealed by
trade wars promoted by national and corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
Dr Haji Semboja from the Economic and Social Research
Foundation (ESRF), told the participants that the current position
of Tanzania in the world economy was characterized by
marginalization in trade, investment and technology flows.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by Tanzania Youth alliance for
Development and Cooperation in collaboration with Dar es Salaam
University Marketing Association.

<HEADLINE> UN Mission in Angola Extended for Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council has
extended the mandate of the UN Office to Angola (UNOA) for six
months, saying that this might contribute greatly for the
promotion of peace and the national reconciliation in the war-torn
southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
According to the report by the Angolan official news agency
Angop, the security council said in a resolution that the move is
also intended to work in the promotion of human rights and
regional security in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The 1294 resolution was unanimously approved by the 15 members
of the security council, under which the 30-member UNOA will stay
in Angola till October 15.
</P>
<P>
In one of his latest reports to the security council, secretary
general Kofi Annan underlined that the humanitarian situation in
Angola remained grave, reminding that there are over three million
displaced Angolan persons in the country, of which 1.6 Million
internally displaced have been hit by the war.
</P>
<P>
The report added that persisting insecurity in areas recaptured
by government forces is an important obstacle to the supply of
humanitarian aid, adding that one third of the population live in
zones not accessible to humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
UNOA was created in October last year after the 1,000-strong
unsuccessful UN peacekeeping mission was withdrawn from the
country in late February, said the Angolan press.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Determined to Become Training Center of Qualified Professionals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, an economic powerhouse
in south China's Guangdong Province, is determined to become a
training center for qualified professionals.
</P>
<P>
According to an education training plan of the city, it will
work harder to make sure that 30 percent of its population aged 18
to 22 years should be receiving full-time schooling in colleges by
the year of 2005.
</P>
<P>
The plan is also designed to add Shenzhen with more
universities as Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong and has had
economic boom thanks to China's reform and opening-up drive in the
past two decades, has few colleges of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
A local official in charge of educational affairs pledged that
they would make use of the city's advantages in working systems,
policies and funds, and attract well-known universities to start
schools in Shenzhen or to lure scientific and technological
achievements to settle down in this south China city.
</P>
<P>
By now, 30 major universities have set up representative
offices which are responsible for training of qualified personnel
on behalf of their respective universities and application of
scientific and technological achievements in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Qinghua University, Chinese version of MIT, for instance, has
set up a research institute in Shenzhen, while Beijing University,
the country's most prestigious university, has also built a center
for manufacturing, training and research.

<HEADLINE> Reconstruction on Southern End of Xining-Lhasa Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Work started today on rebuilding of
the southern end of 2,100-km Xining-Lhasa Highway which runs from
north to the south on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Reconstruction of Yangbajain-Lhasa section, with a length of 66.
4 km, is listed as one of Tibet's key projects during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan Period (1996-2000). The reconstruction will cost
395 million yuan (47.6 million U.S. dollars) and will take two
years to finish.
</P>
<P>
Transport in Tibet now mainly relies on highways, with Qinghai-
Tibet Highway shouldering more than 80 percent of the region's
cargo and passenger transport.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction of Yangbajain-Lhasa section was approved by
the Ministry of Communications late last year.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, Tibet will build or continue to
construct 25 highway projects this year, which will require an
estimated investment of 854 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> China's Car Output to Rise This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to turn out 650,
000 sedan cars this year, up 12 percent over last year, according
to estimates of the China Commercial Information Center.
</P>
<P>
The center estimates that domestic demand for cars will rise by
10.7 percent to 620,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
The center said that imported cars will not affect the
dominance of domestic cars because local cars are mostly priced
under 100,000 yuan, and it is the car-part companies that will
suffer from imports.
</P>
<P>
The center estimates that China's car imports will be around 60,
000 this year, most of them luxury sedans. Auto prices are
expected to decline as producers and retailer try to reduce their
mounting inventories, and as China awaits imminent entry into the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
The center said that about 80 percent of all car buyers will
pay fully in cash, while the rest will choose payment of
installments.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Army Ready to Quell Political Violence: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean army is prepared to
move in and quell the political violence currently gripping the
country, a senior army officer said in Harare Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some three people have died and over 200 others arrested in
political violence, which has erupted countrywide in the run-up
to next month's general elections.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Charles Tarumbwa, who is head of the army's
administration section, said this at a graduation ceremony of at
the Zimbabwe School of Military Engineers.
</P>
<P>
He called on members of the army to be apolitical at all times,
adding that it was important that the members remembered that
their job was to defend the country and maintain law and order,
not to be political activists.
</P>
<P>
He said although the police force had not yet asked for
assistance, the army was "very much prepared" to bring the
country's political situation back to normal since that was part
of their job.
</P>
<P>
"You are obviously aware of what is happening on the political
front as the date for elections draws closer. My only comment is
to remind you that as members of the security forces, you are
there to maintain law and order and not be part of what is going
on at the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although our main job is to protect the country from outside
forces, we are also prepared to move in and stabilize the
situation should the police force invite us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The army was in 1998 called upon to quell violence, which had
erupted countrywide following prices hikes. Several people were
injured and property worth several millions of dollars was
destroyed before the army moved in to assist the police force.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Police Against Court Ruling on Farm Occupations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean police Friday said
they would appeal against a High Court ruling compelling the
force to evict ex- combatants from white-owned farms they have
occupied in the past two months, the daily Herald reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
War veterans, on the other hand, remained defiant and vowed not
to leave the farms, despite Thursday's ruling ordering the
invaders to withdraw from the farms.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Friday Attorney General Patrick Chinamasa said
the police had instructed him to note an appeal against the
judgement with the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
He said the grounds of appeal remained essentially that on the
basis of an honest assessment of the prevailing situation the
court order was incapable of practical enforcement.
</P>
<P>
"Acting Commissioner of Police Griffiths Mpofu wishes it to be
made known that police are willing to abide by the judgement of
the court, but regrettably lack the necessary resources to
enforce the order, have no power to allocate themselves
additional resources which are required for the exercise and have
no power to order the army to come to its assistance in mounting
the exercise," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinamasa said until the police concerns were addressed, the
order of the court remained incapable of practical enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The government Thursday ordered the former freedom fighters to
move out of the farms as the High Court was ordering the police
to act against the continued occupation of farms by war veterans.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans
Association Chenjerai Hunzvi Friday refused to comment on the
matter. But in an interview with Reuters, the war veterans' boss
said he was not interested in what the court had ruled.
</P>
<P>
He said the courts, which were trying to stop people from
occupying land,
</P>
<P>
should be revamped.
</P>
<P>
"The judicial system of this country must be revamped. It is
not for the people of Zimbabwe. It is for the white man. The
position of the people of Zimbabwe today is that the system must
be revamped. They are undermining the powers of the executive,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"The land must go to the indigenous people of Zimbabwe. We
fought to liberate the land," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The whites have resisted a peaceful process for 20 years and
the resistance has come to a point that the masses and the war
veterans are saying we cannot bear the devil," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government Tuesday appointed a three-man ministerial team
to explain to the war veterans the implications of the land Bill
and the British government's change of heart over the funding of
the resettlement program.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Restructure Health Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is planning
to restructure the Health Ministry to enable it deliver
sustainable medical care that is affordable and accessible to all
citizens, Public Health Minister Sam Ongeri has said.
</P>
<P>
He said there would be a transfer of increased responsibility
for planning and resource allocation to the districts and
facilities in the country's peripheries, thus improving service
delivery and reducing loss of resources, the state-owned Kenya
Times newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In his written speech read out at the opening of a workshop in
the capital, Ongeri said the traditionally favored centralized
planning and resources allocation system has proved ineffective.
</P>
<P>
He noted that such system is to blame for the ministry's
inability to deal with preventable and easily controlled
diseases.
</P>
<P>
The minister admitted that Kenya has started the new millennium
with many of its citizens still lacking access to basic health
care, safe drinking water, proper sanitation and adequate
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
To fight these problems, Ongeri said, decentralization of
health care services to the districts will be undertaken for
creating an enabling regulatory environment and mechanism to
allow for participation of the private sector, non-governmental
organizations, missions and communities.
</P>
<P>
The government has put in place appropriate intervention
measures in form of a national health sector strategic plan for
the 1999-2004 period, Ongeri added.

NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS)
has culled about 200 lions from the Aberdares National Park in
central part of the country to protect the rare bongo species,
which is threatened with extinction.
</P>
<P>
The bongo is rare, spiral horned antelope with a coat that is
bright red brown with narrow cream stripes. Its population has
dropped to just about 100 in the Aberdares, the Daily Nation

Lions were deliberately introduced to the Aberdares in the
1930s. While the sanctuary of the bongos is only the Aberdares

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou's Retail Sales of Consumer Goods Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales of consumer
commodities rose by 15.9 percent in Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, to hit 29.145 billion yuan (3.5
billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Guangzhou City Statistics Bureau said that
the economic performance has been doing well in this south China
city since the beginning of the year, with the gross domestic
product (GDP) growing by 14.6 percent, the highest growth rate in
ten major cities on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
The statistical report said that export, residents' consumption
and real estate are the major factors behind the city's fast
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The city had a rise of 30.6 percent in exports in the first
quarter of the year as it has been taking a range of measures to
encourage export since late last year.
</P>
<P>
Because most real estate developers are confident of the
potential market after the country stop distributing state-
subsidized flats, they have been active in making investments.
And the investments made from January to March totaled nearly five
billion yuan, up 23.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Purchase power has improved as a result of a steady growth in
family income for residents of Guangzhou. The average salary of
workers per capita in the city for January-March period was 4,318
yuan, up 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the per capita consumptive expenditure
was over 3,000 yuan, up 20.5 percent from the same period last
year, or 19.7 percentage points more than that in last year.
</P>
<P>
The spending was mainly for transport, telecommunications,
cultural activities, education, entertainment, as well as interior
housing decoration.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China has set the target for coal
production in the second quarter, which stands at 222.16 million
tons, the China Coal News reported.
</P>
<P>
The planned coal production in major coal mines during this
period is set at 119.5 million tons, and small coal mines at
township level at 57.48 million tons, according to the State
Administration of Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
Coal production in the first quarter this year has fallen
substantially on an annual basis, which led to a reduction of
stockpile and rebounding of coal prices.
</P>
<P>
China, the world's largest coal producer, reduced its coal
output to 1.1 billion tons last year by cutting 250 million tons
of coal production. This year, the country will force a large
number of small coal mines to close down or cut production, and
see that large coal mines reduce stockpiles and produce less.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Common Goal, Just Appeals Emerge From South Summit  By Gu Zhenqiu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The first South Summit concluded
here Friday in what is believed to be a milestone in the South
quest for its development in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit, the largest gathering of heads of state
and government of the Group of 77 (G-77) since its founding in
1964, strengthened the Third World's collective call for more aid,
fewer debts, reduced poverty, a greater say in international
political and economic decision-making, and a bigger role of the
United Nations in safeguarding the common interests of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 heads of state or government and delegations from 122
developing countries attended the first summit of G-77, whose
membership has swelled to 133 countries over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which opened here Wednesday following two days of
preparatory meetings, was convened at a time when many developing
countries are being marginalized and the North-South gap is
further widened in economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The summit also came at a time when the world is seeing a
weakening role of the United Nations in vital areas of world
economy, peace and security, and many important issues have been
shifted to forums outside the U.N. system.
</P>
<P>
"Only a relatively small number of countries are enjoying these
games of world economy. Many millions of people are excluded, left
behind in squalor," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Under the current unjust and irrational international political
and economic system, developed countries are in a dominant
position in setting the "rules of the games" of world economy, and
the "dividends" of the globalization have not been fairly shared
between the developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries, representing some 80 percent of the world
's total population, are faced with armed conflicts, difficulties
in access to markets in the North, crushing debt burdens,
unprecedented spread of AIDS, and a shortage of necessary funds to
join the North in technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
Though globalization has presented severe challenges to the
South, the process also provided developing countries with a big
room for cooperation. Meanwhile, the new situation requires new
thinking and new approaches to the South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
To shake themselves off the embarrassed situation, the Third
World countries vowed to strengthen the South-South cooperation in
addition to their pains-taking efforts to enter the North-South
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The Program of Action, adopted at the summit, said that
developing countries will continue to review the proposal of the
establishment of a South-South monetary fund, South-South economic
and social development fund and a South-South commodity price
stabilization fund within the process of reviewing the feasibility
study of the South Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a declaration issued by the summit called for close
cooperation with the industrialized North.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to promote a North-South dialogue based on
the spirit of partnership, mutual benefit and genuine
interdependence," it said, citing the need to shrink foreign debts,
transfer technology and reverse declining official development
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Globalization and technical advancement have greatly increased
interdependence among countries in the world, and there will be no
peace and prosperity in the global village without peace and
prosperity in the South.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply convinced of the need to create a new spirit of
international cooperation based on the principles of achieving
shared benefits, but also based on common but differentiated
responsibilities, between the developing and industrialized
countries," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The summit demonstrated the urgent need for the South to
reflect on the world economic situation, and the emerging
challenges of economic and social development, identifying the
problems that affect the South and seeking solutions.
</P>
<P>
With problems discussed and actions planned, the South will
work together in a cooperative spirit to map out a strategy for
common development in the new century. As long as developing
countries are united as one and make tireless efforts, a peaceful,
stable and prosperous South will firmly stand in the world.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Asks UN to Free Bosnian Serb Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government Friday
again called on the Untied Nations Security Council to take
measures to secure the immediate release of former top Bosnian
Serb leader Momocilo Krajisnik from the UN war crimes tribunal in
The Hague.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Yugoslav Justice Minister Petar Jojic
demanded the immediate release of the 55-year-old former speaker
of the Bosnian Serb assembly, saying that his arrest earlier this
month was made "in a terrorist fashion".
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik was secretly indicted by the International Criminal
Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and arrested in a pre-dawn
raid on April 3 in the Bosnian town of Pale by French soldiers of
the NATO-led multinational Stabilization Force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers blasted the door of Krajisnik's abode open and
caught him in the face of his family. Jojic described the arrest
as a latest international terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik was in hours transferred to The Hague and made his
first court appearance on April 7. He pleaded not guilty to all
nine charges including genocide and complicity in genocide in 1991
and 1992 in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik signed the Dayton peace accord that ended the 1992-
1995 Bosnian war, and was later elected speaker of the Bosnian
Serb assembly in a vote supervised by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Jojic accused the NATO and the ICTY of violating the norm of
international relations, requesting UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan and the Security Council to take necessary measures to get
Krajisnik freed.

<P>
LIMA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
said Friday that he will win in the second round of the
presidential elections to be held in June.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, nominated for re-election by the ruling political
alliance Peru-2000, agreed Friday to debate in public with his
main rival Alejandro Toledo, an international economist.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori failed to claim an outright victory in the first round
of polling held on April 9.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a televised speech that about 10 million
out of the total 14.65 million Peruvian electorate cast their
ballots on last Sunday's election and the election was carried out
under a normal, clean and transparent way.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said the results of the first round have been
questioned only by Toledo, who has insisted that the Electoral
Processes National Office manipulated the data to favor Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest results of the electoral office, after
tallying 97.68 percent of the ballots, Fujimori gained 49.84
percent of the votes, followed by Toledo with 40.31 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori was accused of government abuses and irregularities in
the first round, but he denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
In response to criticism that Peruvian television is biased in
his favor, he said many television channels opened their spaces to
the opposition parties, but they refused to use them.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
reiterated Friday that his country will shut down the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant within this year.
</P>
<P>
An Interfax-Ukraine report said Kuchma made the pledge when
meeting visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
He called for "concrete" U.S. assistance in closing the
Chernobyl, where the world's worst nuclear accident occurred in
April, 1986.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said they need "physical support" from the U.S. to
fulfill the project of the Odessa-Brody oil pipeline, which will
benefit both Ukraine and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived here Friday morning, welcomed Ukraine's
position in closing the plant, but urged the country to set a
specific date before discussing the funding issue.
</P>
<P>
U.S. will continue to support Ukraine's reform and call on the
international financial organizations to help the country, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Yushenko also met Albright on bilateral
economic and trade issues. The two sides decided that the prime
minister will visit U.S. in early May.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released in Kiev on Friday, Albright also
welcomed Russian Duma's ratification of the START II treaty.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Interior and
Justice Minister Winston Spadafora denied Friday an allegation
that there is foreign military presence in the country to protect
Panama and the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, the minister said his government will
not ask any foreign country to protect Panama.
</P>
<P>
Spadafora also said the Panama Canal will be never shut down
and there will be continuous access to it.
</P>
<P>
On the amendments to the security plan, he said within the
framework of the plan, the success or failure of the waterway
depends on the coordination among the National Police, the
National Maritime Service, the National Air Service, the
Institutional Protection Service and the Civil Protection National
System.
</P>
<P>
The plan will consider good advices from any other countries.
It would be absurd for Panama not to accept more advanced
technology suggestion, he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that accepting good advises from other countries
does not mean his government will give up its sovereignty. Panama
will only sign agreements with foreign countries on information
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Spadafora said that as a country with no army, Panama needs
timely information on the defense of the national territory and
the Canal.
</P>
<P>
Panama has not signed any information exchange accord with
other countries, but many countries are interested in discussing
the subject, the minister said.

BUENOS AIRES, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Top financial officials from
Argentina and Brazil approved Friday a statistical system to
assess economic situation in preparation for further economic
integration within the South American trade bloc, Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
Future use of the uniformed methods, which involve the defining

process.
</P>
<P>
Experts from both countries are still working on details of the
new methods, said a top Argentine financial official attending the

Officials have agreed after talks to maintain different levels
of exchange rates in the development of a common market in the
region.

<HEADLINE> South Summit Concludes in Havana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The first South Summit concluded
Friday with Third World leaders vowing to unite as one in fighting
poverty, demanding debt relief and a greater say in world
political and economic affairs, and joining developed countries in
technical revolution.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Group of 77 (G-77), Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo, formally declared the conclusion of the summit, which
opened on Wednesday following two days of preparatory meetings
attended by senior officials and foreign ministers of G-77 members.
</P>
<P>
The South Summit, the largest gathering of heads of state and
government of the G-77, adopted two final documents -- the Final
declaration and the Program of Action -- before the closing of the
three-day historic event.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 heads of state and government and delegations from 122
G-77 countries all have one objective: to strengthen South-South
cooperation for common development in developing countries in face
of globalization.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the broad themes of globalization, knowledge and
technology, South-South cooperation and North-South relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing session at the Havana International
Conference Center, Cuban President Fidel Castro said the
participating representatives, after several days of extensive
discussions, reached consensus on the necessity to reform the
existing international economic and financial regime. He said he
was grateful to the representatives for the consensus.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said: "We are time-limited and time-conscious to the
drive to carry out the Program of Action."
</P>
<P>
"From now, we are about to shift the system to be more just,
fair, equitable and mutual beneficial to our collective interests,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The Summit was held at the turn of century when many developing
countries are being marginalized in the tide of globalization,
which is characterized by rapid expansion of trade, investment,
capital flows and advancements in information technology.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization has increased the vulnerability of those
countries of the South, which are in the process of being
integrated into the world economy," said the Program of Action.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the summit demands the establishment of a just and
fair new international political and economic order, and a greater
say of developing countries in multilateral lending institutions,
such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the
World Trade Organization, as well as in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Poverty reduction is high on the agenda of the summit.
</P>
<P>
"Our peoples have run out of patience," Cuban Foreign Minister
Felipe Perez Roque told a meeting of G-77 foreign ministers on
Tuesday. "For decades they have suffered broken promises and are
today living in an economic and social situation that is
increasingly serious and unsustainable."
</P>
<P>
Belize's Prime Minister Said Musa said: "Nothing we say or do
will have any true meaning for our people unless we can
significantly and quickly reduce the shameful number of those who
live in poverty, even as more people than ever become millionaires.
"
</P>
<P>
"One day, humankind will be called to account: How come you
never made no connection between growing poverty for the many and
booming wealth for a few?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the leaders joining Said are U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, South African President Thabo Mbeki who is chairman of the
Non-Aligned Movement, Vietnamese President Tran Duc Long,
Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, who headed a Chinese
government delegation, describing the summit as "a grand,
pioneering meeting."
</P>
<P>
"In the interests of safeguarding world peace and promoting
development, let us look back over the past and forward into the
future and work together in a cooperative spirit to map out a
strategy for common development in the new century."
</P>
<P>
"The new century will present us both hope and difficulties,"
he said. "We people of developing countries have never been in
want of the courage to surmount difficulties or an undaunted
enterprising spirit."
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that as long as developing countries unite as
one and make tireless efforts, there will firmly stand a peaceful,
stable and prosperous South."
</P>
<P>
G-77, set up by 77 developing countries in Geneva in 1964, saw
its membership growing to 133 countries, but the original name was
retained because of its historic significance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations and
the largest grouping in the South, G-77 provides the means for the
developing world to articulate and promote its collective economic
interests and enhance its joint negotiating capacity on all major
international economic issues in the United Nations system, and
promote economic and technical cooperation among developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Asks NATO to Protect Its Border With Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Boris
Trajkovski Friday asked NATO for protection of its border with the
troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone exchange with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Trajkovski expressed grave concern over tensions on the
border and asked Washington and the international community to
deliver a warning to the various political forces in Kosovo
against any encroachment upon Macedonia's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He described the border situation as "the principal
preoccupation of Macedonia," the presidential office said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not wish to enter into conflict with (Kosovar) terrorist
groups, but if they do not respect our country and its territorial
sovereignty ... and if they represent a threat to our soldiers,
then we shall deal with them firmly," Trajkovski was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He did not identifying the terrorist groups concerned. However,
except parts of Mitrovica in the northern party of Kosovo, most
parts of the border area with Macedonia are under control of
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Albright, Trajkovski mentioned the recent
kidnapping on the border of four Macedonian soldiers, who were
later released, and asked the U.S. and NATO's peacekeeping force (
KFOR) to provide help by stepping up patrol and control along the
border, where the U.S. contingent of the KFOR is stationed.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia, a logistical base for NATO's operations in Kosovo,
detained on Tuesday about 30 allegedly drunken U.S. troops, who
were involved in a street fight with Macedonian civilians in the
capital Skopje.

<HEADLINE> South Summit Asks U.S. to Lift Embargo Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The first South Summit Friday
night unanimously called on the United States to "immediately lift
" the embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, on behalf of the Group of 77
(G-77), raised the proposal at the summit, asking representatives
of G-77 countries and other developing countries to join him in
the appeal. His proposal was greeted with warm applause.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-imposed embargo is "little too long," Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been imposing embargo on the Caribbean island
country since the early 1960s. But the Cuban government and its
people, through painstaking efforts over the past four decades,
made an impressive headway in education, health care and social
development.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan repeated his praise of such
achievements when he was in Havana to attend the South Summit, the
largest gathering of heads of states and governments in the 36-
year-old G-77.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the U.N. General Assembly has
overwhelmingly adopted several resolutions to demand an immediate
lift of the U.S. embargo against Cuba, but such an embargo
remained in place as Washington turned a deaf ear to the unified
appeal and relevant General Assembly resolutions.

<HEADLINE> South Summit Adopts Two Final Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The first South Summit adopted two
final documents on Friday night to define developing countries'
vision, targets and future strategy of defending their collective
interests in the tide of globalization.
</P>
<P>
The first document, a final declaration, is a forward-looking
declaration which sets out a vision and broad strategy for the
future while the second one, the Program of Action, is an action-
oriented document which clearly defines measures, targets and time
frames for implementation.
</P>
<P>
The documents were adopted following the three-day South Summit,
which was held after two days of preparatory meetings, attended by
senior officials and foreign ministers respectively.
</P>
<P>
The South Summit, the largest gathering of heads of state and
government of the Group of 77 (G-77), was held at a time when many
developing countries are being marginalized in the tide of
globalization and the North-South gap is being widened.
</P>
<P>
The two documents voiced concerns of developing countries at
issues including their crushing debt burdens, the eradication of
poverty, and the marginalization in the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
The two documents vowed to strengthen the South-South
cooperation in addition to efforts to improve the North-South
relations in order to join developed countries in technology
revolution.
</P>
<P>
The documents called for efforts to strengthen the role of the
United Nations, which, under the U.N. Charter, has the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security in the
world.
</P>
<P>
G-77, set up by 77 developing countries in Geneva in 1964, saw
its membership growing to 133 countries over the past three
decades, but its original name was retained due to its historic
significance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations and
the largest grouping in the South, G-77 is aimed at providing the
means for the developing world to articulate and promote its
collective economic interests and enhance its joint negotiating
capacity on all major international economic issues in the U.N.
system, and promote economic and technical cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former President's Children to be Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto's children are scheduled for questioning by the Attorney
General's Office (AGO) next Tuesday in relation to their father's
widening graft case, according to national newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer representing Soeharto's family Juan Felix Tampubolon
said he received the AGO's summonses for Soeharto's eldest
daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana and second son Bambang
Trihatmodjo on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
"Both are summoned to appear on Tuesday as witnesses in a case
related to Soeharto's charity foundations," Tampubolon was quoted
by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
During his reign, the 78-year-old Soeharto chaired nine
charities, which have been accused of receiving government
privileges and facilities as well as being one of Soeharto's main
business vehicles. Soeharto has handed over the control of seven
of the nine charitable foundations to the government last year.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who was forced to step down in May 1998 after 32
years in power, is accused of massive corruption and power abuse.
</P>
<P>
Investigation into Soeharto has been hampered by his ailing
health. The initial questioning of the former president earlier
this month was stopped by doctors, who also prevented the
resumption of the questioning a week after.
</P>
<P>
Director of Corruption Affairs at the AGO Chairul Imam said
that along with the two siblings, executives of the foundations
would also be ordered to appear for questioning.
</P>
<P>
He said the questioning of key witnesses would be conducted
while arranging a new schedule for Soeharto's questioning.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has been put under city arrest since Wednesday, but
Chairul said the former president would be granted a permit to
leave Jakarta for special reasons, such as family matters or
medical treatment, as long as there was prior notice and as long
as he applied to the AGO.
</P>
<P>
Newly inaugurated AGO spokesman Yushar Yahya said that under
the city arrest Soeharto does not require any permit from the AGO
to receive guests or to pay visits as long as he is still inside
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Yahya reiterated that the authorities would not hesitate to
take stern measures against Soeharto if he violates the city
arrest status.
</P>
<P>
"If, for instance, he goes out of town, then another legal
action can be imposed on him -- such as prison detention," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police Seize Bogus Rupiah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian police have seized
counterfeit rupiah that amounted to 29 billion rupiah (3.7 million
U.S. dollars) from January 1997 through February of this year.
</P>
<P>
National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Dadang Garnida said that
police findings showed an increase of counterfeit rupiah being
circulated over the past three years in Java island and Greater
Jakarta areas.
</P>
<P>
He said the circulation of counterfeit bills reached 0.0076
percent of the total cash in circulation. Although the amount of
fake rupiah was still below the alarming level of 0.1 percent of
the total money in circulation and did not affect the country's
economy, the frequent discovery of counterfeit bills had raised
public concern.
</P>
<P>
"Although the economy has not been affected, circulation of
fake money has created restlessness among the general public," he
was quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for involvement of the police and central
bank officials to cope with the problem and called on the public
not to hesitate to report to the police when they received fake
bills.

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Roadblocks installed by Colombian
guerrillas could affect exports recovery, Javier Diaz, National
Exporters Association chairman, warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
The blocks, which put out of service important roads in the
nation, increased the cost of transportation and warehousing of
merchandise and caused delays in deliveries abroad, said Diaz.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing the risk of not being able to fulfill our
commitments with our customers abroad."
</P>
<P>
He said activities of the National Liberation Army (ELN) and of
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), that blocked in
the last days the routes toward the seaports in the north of the
country, produced difficulties for the movement of cargo to the
shipping points, which could be reflected in the figures of the
growth of exports in the first semester of 2000.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the closing of the roads continue, Colombia
will become an unreliable supplier for the international community.
</P>
<P>
The armed stoppage, promoted by the ELN and the FARC, covered
at least seven departments in the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Education Tops Chinese Families' Expense: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Education is now a major expense
for most Chinese families, a recent survey on the importance of
education shows.
</P>
<P>
About 43 percent said that education is now one of the biggest
expenditures within the family, and about 60 percent said that
they are going to apply a hefty amount of money toward educational
purposes next year.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the Economy Watch Center of the
National Bureau of Statistics among 502 residents in Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The rising importance of education for people, the increase of
family income, and the reform of education system contributed to
the survey's results, analyzed an official with the center.
</P>
<P>
The education fee in the college has sharply risen by 20 to 30
percent in recent years. And also, high-level education has become
a prerequisite for a job in cities. Now, even college students are
having a hard time finding a job.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of people in the survey said that investment
in education is crucial for their future.
</P>
<P>
"People attribute more importance to education and are willing
to pay more," said the official, and "the society also provides
more paid education programs."

<HEADLINE> Finland Welcomes Russian Duma's Ratification of START II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Finland welcomed the decision of
the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) to ratify the
Russian-U.S. Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty-II (START II),
Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
"In the view of Finland it is a very positive development that
the Russian State Duma has ratified START II and cut the knot that
had for a long time slowed down the nuclear disarmament process
between the U.S. and the Russian Federation," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the ratification opens possibilities for an
early commencement of negotiations on START III that would include
transparency measures on tactical nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"This transparency would also serve the security interests of
the Nordic area," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ratification was approved on Friday by a vote of 288
against 131 with four abstentions in the Russian State Duma.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact signed by former Russian president Boris Yeltsin
and former U.S. president George Bush in 1993 in Moscow, Russia
and the United States agreed to cut the number of their nuclear
warheads from 6,000 to no more than 3,500 on each side by 2007.
The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from the two countries said in Geneva on Thursday
that U.S. and Russian officials would hold talks next week to
assess the prospects for launching talks on START-III.
</P>
<P>
START-III was agreed in outline three years ago but the hard
work is to agree how deep further cuts should be. Washington is
looking to cut arsenals to 2,000-2,500 warheads each, while
Russian officials say they are ready to go lower to 1,500 each,
again driven largely by economic considerations.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India to Continue Linkage Railway Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Indian railway
authorities Friday agreed to continue the Samjhota Express Train
service plying between Lahore (Pakistan) and Atari (India) under
an interim arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after a one-day meeting by senior
officials from both sides at Wagha border, 28 kilometers east of
Lahore, capital of Pakistan's Punjab province.
</P>
<P>
Under the interim arrangement, India will bring its rakes up to
Wagha border from where Pakistani rakes will bring passengers to
Lahore. Similarly on way to Atari, Pakistani trains will go up to
Wagha from where Indian trains will be attached.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement will continue up to May 1 and before that,
railway officials from the two countries will meet on April 26 at
Wagha Border again to discuss some of the proposals for a
permanent arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had threatened to stop Samjhota Express Train because,
according to Pakistani officials, under an agreement with India in
1991, India was not fulfilling its obligation of bringing its
rakes alternately for six months of each year up to Lahore since
1994.
</P>
<P>
About 800 to 1,000 passengers from both countries travel each
time twice a week by Samjhota Express Train, which traverses 28
kilometers within Pakistan from Lahore to Wagha and three and a
half kilometers from Wagha to Atari.

<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- English premier league football
club Tottenham Hotspur manager George Graham is in hospital and
could miss the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
Graham is suffering from chronic joint inflammation and extreme
fever and is likely to be in hospital for a week.
</P>
<P>
And he is unlikely to be able to resume his football duties for
a month.
</P>
<P>
Graham told the Daily Mail: "Outside my family, the chairman (
Alan Sugar) was the first person informed about my problem and he
is full aware of the situation."
</P>
<P>
Graham has battled on through pain until Spurs had passed the
42-point target which assured them against even an outside chance
of relegation.
</P>
<P>
And he had continued to take training despite being troubled by
rheumatoid arthritis and he concealed his plight from the players.
</P>
<P>
Assistant coach Stewart Houston and director of football David
Pleat now look likely to take charge of first team affairs.
</P>
<P>
Spurs are due to play Aston Villa at White Hart Lane on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham have lost their last two Premiership games, against
Middlesbrough and Liverpool, and drew 1-1 with relegation
candidates Watford.
</P>
<P>
Their poor form has led fans to call for Graham's resignation.

LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- English premier league football
club Arsenal striker Davor Suker is to be given a free transfer at
the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian international was halfway through his two-year
contract with the north London club.
</P>
<P>
West Ham could now be lining up a move for him. The club
manager Harry Redknapp said: "Suker is a top quality player and we
would be interested in him."
</P>
<P>
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said on Friday he did not feel it
fair that a player with international ambitions should be confined
to a peripheral first team role with the club.
</P>
<P>
Wenger said: "Davor has done really well for us but we have not
been able to use him as often as he would have liked.
</P>
<P>
"A player of his ability deserves to be playing regularly so we
will be letting him go. There is no animosity. He has paid the
price for the way Thierry Henry has exploded this season. It means
that I have Davor, Thierry, Dennis Bergkamp and Nwankwo Kanu for
two positions," he said.

MOSCOW, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov discussed the ratification of the 1993 Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty-II (START-II) and the 1997 ballistic missile
agreements by Russia's State Duma with his U.S., French and
British counterparts by telephone Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Friday vote of the Russian State Duma, lower house of
parliament, "is an option for a stable, predictable situation in
the world and for strengthening international security, and a
responsible step by Russia, which reaffirms its commitments in the
sphere of nuclear disarmament," Ivanov told the Western ministers,
quoted by the news agency Interfax.
</P>
<P>
The Western ministers congratulated Russia on the ratification
and said it would be "of historic significance," according to the
Russian minister.
</P>
<P>
The Duma's approval of START-II was only the first step in
Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin's program, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He said Putin's program also includes a whole number of other
important steps aimed at strengthening strategic stability and
preventing the U.S. from creating a national missile defense
system banned by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
"But if the United States goes ahead with the missile defense
plan,Russia will consider backing out of START-II and other
measures,"Ivanov warned.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Prepares for OPEC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
announced Saturday that Algeria, Nigeria, and Qatar confirmed
their attendance to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) Second Summit to be held here.
</P>
<P>
President Chavez said that his counterparts of Algeria,
Abdelazis Buteflika, of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasango, and of Quatar,
Emir Hamad ben Khalifa al-Thani, confirmed their attendance to the
OPEC summit in this country, to be held September 28-30.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said at a press conference held at his return from the
Group of 77 Summit of heads of state and of government in Havana,
Cuba, that he had mentioned there the perspectives and
possibilities of the Second OPEC Summit.
</P>
<P>
That meeting will analyze the oil policy, environmental issues,
relations of the oil cartel with the world community and OPEC
cooperation with developing countries, said the Venezuelan
president.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, Latin America's only one OPEC member and the
largest oil exporter of the region, had scheduled the meeting for
February of this year, but the strong rains of December that
lashed this nation forced its postponement.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said as he presented a resume of the first year of his
mandate, that despite the suspension, Venezuela recovered his
leading role in the oil cartel and in the international market of
crude thanks to the agreements with the OPEC and independent
producers.
</P>
<P>
"Venezuela is now taken into account at the moment of making
decisions in the OPEC. It was not so before, because Venezuela had
a reputation of being irresponsible, of violating the agreements,
of playing games," said Chavez.
</P>
<P>
This OPEC summit will be the second to be held in the 39 years
of the history of the organization and will have as special guests
Mexico, Norway, Russia and Oman, among other independent producers.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomatic sources have said that it is not very
likely that the Persian Gulf leaders, like Saudi Arabia, Iraq and
Kuwait, will attend the OPEC meeting in Caracas, because of
problems of health, security, and political differences.

<HEADLINE> Biotechnology to Help Food Security: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Biotechnology will contribute
to food security in the face of a growing population every day
more urbanized, said the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The FAO said in its Declaration on Biotechnology that the
application of practices of biological improvement can generate
better yields in the marginal lands of the countries where
insufficient harvests to feed the population are reaped.
</P>
<P>
The organization called in a document published during the 26th
Regional Conference for Latin America and the Caribbean "to do
everything possible to have the developing countries and the
agriculture producers with little resources benefit more from
biotechnological research."
</P>
<P>
It said that the proposal can be achieved by applying better
mechanisms for
financing the field of the sciences directed to promote
agricultural production and by a more fluid dialogue between the
public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The FAO considered that the application of this kind of
measures is justified, given the potential contribution of the
processes of genetic improvement to increase the food supply and
to surmount the problems of food vulnerability and insecurity.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, U.S. To Sign Space Cooperation Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Brazil and
the United States will sign an agreement of technological
safeguarding that will forbid the transference of sensitive
technology on rockets and satellites.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, to be signed in Sao Luis, in Brazil's northeast
on April 18, also foresees that the U.S. firms will use the
Alcantara base for the launching of rockets targeted for
scientific experiments and for the orbiting of satellites.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian authorities quoted Saturday by the Agencia Brasil as
saying that the Brazilian space program will reach with this
agreement one of its goals: the commercialization of the Alcantara
base in the northeast of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Alcantara base permits, for its location on the Earth
equator, more economic operation and less risk of failure for
satellites in an equatorial orbit.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government is studying the possibility of
building a sea port and a railroad link with the launching base.
