Nagasaki remembers 53rd anniversary of atomic bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In ceremonies marked by undiminished anger at the
world's nuclear powers, Nagasaki on Sunday remembered the atomic
bomb that devastated this port city 53 year ago.
	   ``We cannot help but feel anger at the legitimization of nuclear
weapons by those countries that possess them,'' Mayor Itcho Ito
told thousands who gathered at the city's Peace Park to commemorate
the anniversary.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi criticized India and
Pakistan for making the world a more dangerous place with their
tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May.
	   ``Our government strongly urges both the Indian and Pakistani
governments to immediately stop nuclear tests and unconditionally
conclude the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,'' he said.
	   Under international pressure, Pakistan and India have said they
are ready to engage in negotiations on a treaty on nuclear
materials like plutonium and highly enriched uranium.
	   About 700 people attended an early morning service at Nagasaki's
Urakami Cathedral, which was rebuilt along with much of the city
after the atomic explosion in 1945.
	   Some 25,000 people joined in the Peace Park ceremony, where
survivors read gruesome accounts of destruction and the suffering
that followed the blast.
	   City residents recognized a moment of silence as Buddhist
temples rang bells at 11:02 a.m. (0202 GMT), the exact time that
the bomb exploded after a U.S. B-29 dropped it.
	   More than 60,000 people perished in the blast, which had an
explosive force of 22 kilotons, or 22,000 tons of TNT.
	   The Nagasaki attack came three days after the United States
dropped a smaller bomb on the city of Hiroshima in an effort to
force the Japanese into surrender at the end of World War II.

British-Australian national freed by Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime has freed a
Western man arrested in April and sentenced to five years in prison
for collaborating with a student rebel group, official newspapers
reported Sunday.
	   James Rupert Russell Mawdsley, 25, who holds British and
Australian citizenship, was pardoned Thursday and left Myanmar
immediately after barely three months in custody, the New Light of
Myanmar reported.
	   Mawdsley, an avowed opponent of the government who had been
deported last year after staging a one-man protest in Yangon, was
made an example of in May after he was arrested again, this time in
the southern city of Moulmein.
	   Mawdsley was handing out leaflets on behalf of the All Burma
Students Democratic Front, a group of student exiles who took up
arms in 1988 after a pro-democracy uprising was crushed. Myanmar is
also known as Burma.
	   The government considers the group a terrorist organization. The
ABSDF said Mawdsley had entered Myanmar from Thailand intending to
be arrested to draw attention to the country's plight.
	   In Myanmar's first public trial since 1988, Mawdsley was
sentenced to five years in Yangon's notorious Insein Prison, where
hundreds of political prisoners are held, for illegal entry and
collaborating with a terrorist group.
	   Mawdsley was also fined 50,000 kyats (dlrs 8,300 at official
exchange rates).
	   Newspapers reported that Mawdsley's father, David, visited his
son Wednesday and appealed to the government for leniency. A pardon
was granted and the pair left Thursday on a Thai Airways flight.
The final destination was not disclosed.
	   British and Australian diplomats were unavailable for comment.

Firefighters put out four blazes in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Firefighters have extinguished four blazes in
Russia's Far East, one of their few successes in a region scorched
by dozens of fires in recent weeks, a news report said Sunday.
	   The fires consumed about 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) in the
Khabarovsk region before they were doused on Saturday, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The fires have burned more than 172,000 hectares (425,000 acres)
of forest in the Far East this summer, and about 1,500 workers are
currently fighting the blazes.
	   An unusually dry winter and spring made the Far East vulnerable
than usual, and without rain, the fires may burn until the fall, or
possibly even the winter. The fires are in remote forests and have
not threatened human settlements.

Report: Japanese-European venture to develop super-thin TV screens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. and Philips Electronics of the
Netherlands have agreed to jointly develop a low-cost TV screen
thin enough to be hung from a wall, a newspaper said Sunday.
	   The companies want to find a way to market sets using a new
technology called plasma display at prices cheap enough to compete
with conventional tube televisions, according to the Nihon Keizai
business daily.
	   Plasma display TVs now cost more than 1 million yen (dlrs
7,000). Fujitsu and Philips hope to sell the screens at less than
half that price early next year, the report said.
	   The TV sets will be compatible with new technologies such as
ground-based digital broadcasts that will soon begin in the United
States.
	   The companies will manufacture a 42-inch (107-centimeter) screen
that's about the same thickness as a framed painting, allowing
buyers to hang the TV set on their wall, the newspaper said.
	   Fujitsu became the first company to begin mass production of
plasma display screens in 1996 and currently builds about 48,000 of
the 55,000 screens sold annually worldwide, the report said.

Opposition targeted in Cambodia's post-election reprisals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Embargoed by source until 0001 GMT Aug. 10

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Though threats, harassment and
attacks against opposition members appear on the decline since the
ruling party won Cambodia's recent elections, a pervasive climate
of fear remains, a human rights group said Sunday.
	   The New York-based Human Rights Watch urged the international
community to pressure strongman Hun Sen, whose party won the July
26 parliamentary elections, to disarm and punish those responsible
_ allegedly his own supporters _ for terrorizing his opponents.
	   Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party have been accused of
widespread violence in the electoral campaign, and later of
falsifying results to enlarge their parliamentary majority.
	   Violence has eased since the election, though scores of
opposition supporters fled to the capital in fear of retaliation by
ruling party officials in the provinces.
	   The lull ``does nothing to ease the intense fear among
opposition supporters, particularly in the provinces, that they are
going to become targets of violence,'' Sidney Jones, Asia director
of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.
	   ``It also does nothing to prevent another wave of repression
against them once the international spotlight is lifted,'' Jones
said.
	   The elections came a year after Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom
Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup, shattering a tense
dual premiership formed after U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. As
many as 100 of the prince's loyalists were subsequently killed.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new elections would bring back legitimacy and
aid lost after his takeover. With an eye to the international
approval he seeks, Hun Sen made a televised appeal to security
forces Aug. 1 to not terrorize opposition members.
	   Reported violence immediately dropped.
	   But Human Rights Watch said that ``the fear created by attacks
and threats in the immediate post-election period has already done
its work. People in Phnom Penh and outside the capital are wary of
voicing support for opposition organizations.''
	   Threats and retaliation have not entirely stopped, the group
said. Though to date no one has been killed, shots have been fired
at opposition members or their houses.
	   Several activists have been beaten or followed by members of Hun
Sen's party, or by local affiliated officials. Others have been
threatened with death unless they leave their homes.
	   Activists returning to their home provinces from Phnom Penh have
been threatened for complaining about persecution, Human Rights
Watch said.
	   In the two months prior to the election, 18 people were killed
in murders apparently related to the elections, according to the
local office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Columbus 6, New England 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Stern John scored two goals, and Robert
Warzycha assisted on two as the Columbus Crew snapped a three-game
losing streak and beat the New England Revolution 6-1 in Major
League Soccer Saturday night.
	   The six goals were a franchise record for the Crew.
	   John scored his first goal in the 32nd minute to give the Crew
(10-11) a 2-0 lead. He scored the Crews' sixth goal in the 84th
minute.
	   Warzycha assisted on John's first goal and on a goal by Brian
McBride in the 41st minute.
	   The Crew got its first goal in the 26th minute by Jason Farrell.
	   The Crew also got goals from Thomas Dooley and Rob Smith in the
second half.
	   The lone goal for the Revolution (7-17) came in the 89th minute
by Raul Diaz Arce.
 &UR; Galaxy 2, Fire 1
	   In Chicago, Steve Jolley's header in the 90th minute lifted the
Los Angeles Galaxy to a 2-1 victory over Chicago on Saturday, for
the Fire's fifth consecutive loss.
	   With a record home crowd of 37,122 on hand at Soldier Field,
Chicago had tied the game 1-1 in the 87th minute, but Los Angeles
avoided a shootout when Jolley took a centering pass from Paul
Caligiuri and netted the game-winner just seconds before the game
ended.
	   The goal allowed the Galaxy (18-6) to widen its lead to 15
points over second-place Chicago (13-10) in the MLS' Western
Conference.
	   Both teams scored on own goals.
	   The Galaxy took a 1-0 lead in the 37th minute when Fire defender
Francis Okaroh attempted to play a header back to Chicago goalie
Jorge Campos. The ball floated over Campos' hands and into the net.
	   Chicago evened the score when Danny Pena of the Galaxy,
attempting to cut off a cross while sliding, knocked the ball
passed goalie Kevin Hartman and into his own net.
 &UR; Wizards 3, Rapids 1
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Mo Johnston scored two goals and Mark
Chung had two assists as the Wizards beat the Colorado Rapids 3-1
Saturday night at Arrowhead Stadium.
	   Johnston, who leads the Wizards with nine goals, scored with
assists from Chung and Preki in the 71st minute. Johnston had the
game-winning goal on a free kick in the 87th minute.
	   Kansas City forward Paul Wright scored on a cross from Chung in
the 90th minute.
	   The Rapids scored first in the opening half. Defender Steve
Trittschuh scored on a header off a long free kick by Chris
Henderson in the 16th minute.
	   The Wizards (10-12) are now in fourth place in the Western
Conference, one point ahead of Dallas and three behind the
third-place Rapids (11-12).

Hospital workers in Russian Far East stage hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fifty hospital workers in Russia's Far East have
begun a hunger strike to protest wages that are five months
overdue, a news report said Sunday.
	   The workers in the village of Troitskoye, in the Khabarovsk
region, say they haven't been paid since March, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   They are among millions of Russian workers who receive their
salaries months late, part of the country's chronic cycle of
non-payments.

Pierce upsets top-ranked Hingis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with Hingis-Pierce match. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ Unseeded Mary Pierce rallied from a
huge deficit and saved three match points in stunning top-ranked
Martina Hingis 3-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-2 Saturday night in the semifinals
of the dlrs 450,000 Toshiba Tennis Classic.
	   Pierce will face second-seeded Lindsay Davenport in Sunday's
final. Davenport advanced with a 6-4, 2-6, 7-5 victory over
fourth-seeded Monica Seles.
	   Pierce, down one set and 1-4 in the second set, fought back to
force a tiebreak. After Pierce took a 4-1 lead in the tiebreak,
Hingis won five consecutive points, setting up her first match
point.
	   But Pierce hit a tremendous swinging forehand volley to cut the
lead to 6-5. Pierce saved another match point when she hit a
swinging backhand to tie the score 6-6.
	   After Hingis got to match point for the third time, Pierce hit a
forehand volley to pull even at 7-7.
	   Pierce went ahead 8-7 on an easy forehand volley at the net
before winning the set when Hingis put a forehand into the net.
	   Hingis held serve to start the third set, but Pierce dominated
the rest of the match as she reeled off five straight games. Pierce
closed out the match when Hingis hit a backhand into the net.
	   ``I just kept focusing through each point,'' said Pierce, who
has won five of eight career matches against Hingis. ``I kept
fighting point by point. I never let down, never gave up.''
	   Hingis was upset that she allowed the match to slip away.
	   ``I had so many chances,'' she said. ``I just have to forget
about this match.''
	   After Pierce won the tiebreak, Hingis admitted that she ``kind
of gave up in the third set. It shouldn't happen.''
	   The win avenged Hingis' 6-0, 6-2 victory over Pierce in the
semifinals here last year.
	   Davenport used a late service break en route to winning the
final three games in her victory.
	   Davenport was down 5-4 in the third set when she held serve,
then hit a cross-court backhand winner to break Seles' serve and go
ahead 6-5.
	   After Seles saved one match point, she hit a backhand wide to
end the 96-minute match.
	   ``She was on such a roll in the second set and parts of the
third that I was just trying to hang in there on my service games
and wait for some opportunities,'' Davenport said. ``I got some at
the end.''
	   Seles called the loss ``frustrating'' because she let an
overturned line call in the third set affect her.
	   With Seles leading 3-2, and Davenport serving at 30-30, Seles
appeared to get a break point when a shot by Davenport was called
out by the linesman. But chair umpire Anne Lasserre-Ullrich of
France overruled the call.
	   Seles protested and finally persuaded Lasserre-Ullrich to call
for a replay. Davenport won the replayed point and, eventually, the
game to even the score at 3-3.
	   ``It bothered me a little more than it should have,'' Seles
admitted. ``In my mind it did (make a difference) because it just
bugged me more than it should have.''
	   Davenport won 88 points compared to 87 for Seles, who hit 41
winners while Davenport had 39. And both players converted four
break points.
	   But Davenport, who ran her record against Seles to 3-0, didn't
think the level of play was very high.
	   ``I don't think either one of us played our best today,'' she
said.

In Kazakstan, abortions end more than 40 percent of pregnancies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 40 percent of all pregnancies are
terminated by abortions in the Central Asian nation of Kazakstan,
where the procedure is carried out about 200,000 times a year, a
news report said Sunday.
	   The high rate is a legacy of Soviet-era policies that made
abortion the only available means of birth control in many regions.
	   Pathfinder International, a private group, announced the figures
in the Kazak capital Astana as part of their project to improve
women's health in the former Soviet republic, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   The group has been working with medical personnel and teenagers
in Kazakstan to distribute information about birth control.

Nagasaki remembers 53rd anniversary of atomic bombing

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In ceremonies marked by undiminished anger at the
world's nuclear powers, Nagasaki on Sunday remembered the atomic
bomb that devastated this port city 53 years ago.
	   ``We cannot help but feel anger at the legitimization of nuclear
weapons by those countries that possess them,'' Mayor Itcho Ito
told thousands who gathered at the city's Peace Park to commemorate
the anniversary.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi criticized India and
Pakistan for making the world a more dangerous place with their
tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May.
	   ``Our government strongly urges both the Indian and Pakistani
governments to immediately stop nuclear tests and unconditionally
conclude the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,'' he said.
	   Under international pressure, Pakistan and India have said they
are ready to engage in negotiations on a treaty on nuclear
materials like plutonium and highly enriched uranium.
	   About 700 people attended an early morning service at Nagasaki's
Urakami Cathedral, which was rebuilt along with much of the city
after the atomic explosion in 1945.
	   Some 25,000 people joined in the Peace Park, where survivors
read gruesome accounts of destruction and the suffering that
followed the blast.
	   City residents recognized a moment of silence as Buddhist
temples rang bells at 11:02 a.m. (0202 GMT), the exact time that
the bomb exploded after a U.S. B-29 dropped it.
	   More than 60,000 people perished in the blast, which had an
explosive force of 22 kilotons, or 22,000 tons of TNT.
	   The Nagasaki attack came three days after the United States
dropped a smaller bomb on the city of Hiroshima in an effort to
force the Japanese into surrender at the end of World War II.

Molitor becomes fifth player with 3,000 hits, 500 steals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By RON LESKO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Paul Molitor stole his 500th career base
Saturday night in the middle of a 5-for-5 performance, making him
the fifth player in major league history to collect 500 steals and
3,000 hits.
	   ``I probably won't fully realize the significance of some of
these achievements until later on,'' said Molitor, who has been
slumping recently and came into the game hitting only .260. ``I
haven't had that good of a season, so it was nice to have one of
those special nights.''
	   The Minnesota Twins designated hitter singled leading off the
third inning in what became a 6-3 loss to Baltimore. With Todd
Walker at bat two outs later, Molitor slid in head first at second
base ahead of Lenny Webster's off-target, one-hop throw.
	   Molitor, who will turn 42 on Aug. 22, joined Ty Cobb (4,191
hits, 892 steals), Honus Wagner (3,415, 722), Eddie Collins (3,315,
744) and Lou Brock (3,023, 938).
	   ``I have always passionately followed the game, and I am aware
of the precedent of joining elite company,'' said Molitor, whose
3,271 hits are 10th on the career list. ``It makes you feel awfully
good to realize you are only part of a handful of players to reach
a certain milestone.''
	   Walker followed Molitor's fifth steal of the season with an RBI
single, allowing Molitor to score his 1,757th run, 16th in major
league history. But Molitor was far from finished.
	   He beat out an infield hit in the fifth, then doubled off the
wall in left-center field in the seventh. Molitor scored career run
1,758 on Ron Coomer's single, then finished his sixth career
five-hit game with a single in the ninth.
	   That drew a standing ovation from what remained of the crowd of
18,396, and Molitor seemed genuinely touched.
	   ``Here we are in the midst of a (seven-game) losing streak and
we're behind by three runs, yet they give me a nice ovation,'' he
said.
	   Part of the reason for the ovation probably was that the fans
realize this could be Molitor's final season. He hinted as much to
Baltimore first baseman Rafael Palmeiro after one of his early hits
Saturday, which sparked another conversation with Palmeiro after
hit No. 5.
	   ``I mentioned to Palmeiro earlier in the game that I didn't know
if I would be back for another season,'' Molitor said. ``But he
told me I was crazy about thinking about retirement after going
5-for-5.''

Mare's field goals propel Miami past Washington, 19-16
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LANDOVER, Maryland (AP) _ Olinde Mare, who has no competition in
the Dolphins training camp, made field goals of 27, 45, 50 and 46
yards in Miami's 19-16 victory over Washington on Saturday night.
	   One of Mare's kicks capped a strong, game-opening, 70-yard drive
by the Dan Marino-led first team that took 9:37 off the clock.
	   Marino, in his only series, was 6-for-7 for 58 yards, and
running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar rushed for 46 yards in eight
carries.
	   Redskins rookie Skip Hicks had 52 yards and a touchdown on nine
rushes.
	   Dolphins safety Brock Marion sprained his ankle on a running
play in the second quarter and did not return.
 &UR; Steelers 24, Bills 13 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Jahine Arnold, not assured of making Pittsburgh's
season-opening roster, set up the Steelers' first three scores with
two long kickoff returns and a reception.
	   Rookie Pete Gonzalez was 6-for-11 for 116 yards and a touchdown
for Pittsburgh (1-1).
	   Doug Flutie, the 36-year-old former Heisman Trophy winner who
has spent most of the 1990s playing in Canada, was frequently
flushed out of the pocket to deliver hurried passes while going
6-of-12 for 44 yards for the Bills.
	   Buffalo's Rob Johnson, acquired from Jacksonville during the
offseason, played the entire first half and was 8-of-13 for 75
yards.
 &UR; Ravens 19, Bears 14 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Jim Harbaugh directed two scoring drives in his
Baltimore debut as the Ravens inaugurated their lavish new stadium.
	   A sellout crowd of 65,938 showed up for the grand opening of the
yet-to-be-named dlrs 220 million stadium adjacent to Oriole Park at
Camden Yards.
	   Harbaugh, obtained in an offseason trade from Indianapolis, went
10-for-13 for 60 yards and scrambled twice for 28 yards. He left
with 6:07 left in the second quarter after moving the Ravens 80
yards in 18 plays in a drive that consumed more than 11 minutes and
gave Baltimore a 9-0 lead.
 &UR; Panthers 30, Jaguars 27 &QC; 
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, John Kasay, who kicked field goals
of of 38, 24, 27 and 29 yards in the first half, hit his fifth in
as many attempts, a 30-yarder with four seconds left, for the win.
	   Kerry Collins was 16-of-22 for 162 yards and was not
intercepted. His lone touchdown pass, a 3-yard toss to Muhsin
Muhammad, helped the Panthers to a 19-10 halftime lead.
	   Jacksonville starter Mark Brunell completed two of three passes,
including a 13-yard touchdown strike to Keenan McCardell, before
calling it a night after the Jaguars' first two possessions.
 &UR; Broncos 20, Rams 13
	   In St. Louis, backup quarterback Bubby Brister produced 13
first-half points while John Elway was in Minnesota with his ailing
wife.
	   Brister was 13-for-22 for 181 yards and a touchdown, and helped
set up two field goals by Jason Elam. Rookie Brian Griese, who also
saw extensive playing time, was 10-for-15 for 123 yards.
	   Greg Hill, signed to a free-agent deal on Monday, had 56 yards
on seven carries and a 3-yard touchdown for the Rams.
 &UR; Packers 31, Saints 7 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Travis Jervey rushed nine times for 100
yards and two touchdowns for the Packers (2-0).
	   Jervey has rushed 14 times for 172 yards during the preseason,
an average of more than 12 yards a carry.
	   Brett Favre, who was just 1-of-5 for two yards and a fumble
against Kansas City last week, completed all seven of his passes
for 86 yards and a touchdown.
	   The Saints' Billy Joe Hobert, starting for Heath Shuler, out
with an injured foot, was 7-of-16 for 81 yards.
 &UR; Giants 24, Bengals 17 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Phillippi Sparks forced a fumble
and had an interception, and New York converted four turnovers into
24 points in the first football game played on a grass field at
Giants Stadium.
	   Danny Kanell and third-string quarterback Mike Cherry each threw
a touchdown pass for the Giants.
	   Bengals backup Eric Kresser was 10-of-14 for 138 yards and a
touchdown. Former Jet Neil O'Donnell, battling Jeff Blake for the
starting job, was 6-of-15 for 49 yards.
 &UR; Chiefs 17, Buccaneers 13 &QC; 
	   In Norman, Oklahoma, Kansas City receiver Chris Ortiz recovered
a Tampa Bay fumble in the end zone with 44 seconds left to give the
Chiefs (1-1) a wild victory in the first exhibition game at the
University of Oklahoma since 1976.
	   Eric Vance, who set up the Bucs' go-ahead touchdown with an
interception earlier in the quarter, picked off Pat Barnes' long
pass and was turning upfield when he dropped the ball at the 5-yard
line. It squirted back into the end zone and Ortiz, the intended
receiver, got to it first.
	   Michael Husted's 25-yard field goal with 2:02 remaining had
given the Buccaneers (1-1) a 13-10 lead.
 &UR; Raiders 16, Cowboys 3 &QC; 
	   In Irving, Texas, Jeff George was 6-of-11 for 128 yards and one
touchdown in one quarter as he helped make Jon Gruden's Oakland
coaching debut a success.
	   Terry Mickens, a backup wide receiver, caught seven passes for
120 yards and a touchdown for the Raiders.
	   Dallas' Troy Aikman was only 1-of-6 for six yards in his brief
appearance. Backup Jason Garrett was 5-of-9 for 32 yards for the
Cowboys (0-2).
	   Richie Cunningham's 22-yard field goal accounted for Dallas'
only score.
 &UR; Seahawks 24, Colts 21 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, Peyton Manning, whose first NFL pass went for a
touchdown, was 8-of-15 for 113 yards yet was outplayed by Seattle
backup Jon Kitna.
	   After four handoffs to Marshall Faulk on his first series,
Manning, the first pick in this year's draft, threw a 48-yard
touchdown pass to Marvin Harrison.
	   Kitna, who played four series, completed 9 of 13 passes for 92
yards, including a 25-yard touchdown pass to Mike Pritchard in the
first quarter that put Seattle ahead to stay, 10-7.
	   The Seahawks (2-0) played their second game without No. 1
quarterback, Warren Moon, who has refused to report to the team's
training camp in a contract holdout.
	   Seattle lost cornerback Willie Williams, who suffered a sprained
ankle, and linebacker Chad Brown, who left with a lower back
sprain.
 &UR; Chargers 27, 49ers 21 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Ryan Leaf, the No. 2 pick in this year's draft,
came out poised and led two scoring drives for the Chargers _
capping one with an impressive 3-yard TD pass to Bryan Still.
	   Leaf, 14-of-20 for 116 yards, had a more productive night than
San Francisco's Steve Young.
	   Young threw just seven passes, completing three for 20 yards and
was sacked once, by Marco Coleman. Backup quarterback Jim
Druckenmiller was 7-of-13 for 71 yards for the 49ers (1-1).

Seoul enjoys respite as torrential rains head south

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with higher death toll in 2nd graf, U.S. soldier dead

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The sun came out over flood-stricken
Seoul for the first time in four days Sunday as the worst rains to
hit the South Korean capital in nearly 80 years moved southward.
	   But the strong rain fronts battered central South Korea Sunday,
causing new flooding and mud-slides that left seven dead, including
a U.S. Army soldier.
	   As of mid-afternoon on Sunday, the death toll from this week's
storms stood at 165, including 10 South Korean and three U.S. Army
soldiers. Sixty-nine people, all South Koreans, remained missing,
and more than 82,000 people were left homeless.
	   Property damage estimates ranged from dlrs 200 million to dlrs 2
billion.
	   At Suwon air base south of Seoul, a U.S. Army soldier was killed
after apparently falling into a flooded ditch shortly after
midnight, the U.S. military command said in a news release.
	   Attempts to rescue the soldier failed due to the flood waters,
it said. The unidentified dead soldier is from 1-43rd Air Defense
Artillery Battalion assigned to the air base.
	   In Tangjin, 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Seoul, where
up to 32 centimeters (12.5 inches) fell overnight, six South Korean
civilians were killed in two different mud-slides, government
officials said.
	   In nearby village Taean, two others were killed by lightning,
they said.
	   The rains _ dubbed by local media as ``guerrilla-style rain
storms'' because of their unpredictability _ moved slowly south
Sunday, deluging western coastal regions, weather reports said.
	   Millions of people in and around Seoul got a lull from storms
that dumped more than 1 meters (39.3 inches) in the past four days.
	   Thousands of refugees housed at temporary shelters began to
return to their homes as flood waters receded rapidly. Some key
highways in Seoul were reopened to traffic.
	   Most of this week's deaths and property damage were reported in
the capital and its surrounding areas, where nearly half of South
Korea's 44 million people reside.
	   Wide parts of Seoul, with a population of 12 million, remained
flooded Sunday after receiving torrential rains incessantly in the
past four days. On Saturday, 33.2 centimeters (13 inches) fell in
Seoul, the most to fall in one day since Aug. 2, 1920, weather
reports said.
	   Millions of people in Seoul's low-lying areas stayed at their
homes or makeshift shelters overnight, keeping an uneasy vigil on
the Han River and its tributaries, which government officials
warned could overflow if more rain falls.
	   But the rains over upper South Korea eased after midnight
Saturday. Bright sun rays peeked through overcast Seoul skies on
Sunday afternoon.
	   Still, weather officials refused to lift a storm warning in
effect for Seoul and its surrounding areas since Wednesday.
	   ``It's really difficult to make an exact forecast. The rain
storm is highly unpredictable and may reappear any time,''
weatherman Kim Sung-soo told The Associated Press. Kim said the
rain storm was swept in from China.
	   Three national television networks that had continued
weather-related broadcasts nonstop for the past three days returned
to normal programming Sunday morning, saying that ``the worst
appears to be over.''
	   On the front-line, U.S. and South Korean soldiers, using
mine-detectors and metal sticks, were combing valleys and stream
beds in search of 10 tons of artillery shells and 200 antipersonnel
land mines swept away in mud-slides and floods.
	   The deluge was brought by the same storm system that a week
earlier sent flash floods raging down mountain valleys in the
southern tip of the Korean peninsula, killing 67 campers and
leaving 29 missing and feared dead.

China battles to plug breach in key Yangtze River dike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese soldiers and civilian volunteers
struggled to plug a major breach along a key Yangtze River dike
Sunday as the flood-swollen waterway continued to rise.
	   A lack of expertise and proper equipment were slowing efforts to
fill a hole in the dike that has flooded a 4-square-kilometer (
1.6-square-mile) area of Jiujiang city since bursting on Friday,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Eight river boats have been sunk in the breach to try to block
it, along with several truck loads of stone, soybeans, rice and
various other materials, the agency said.
	   Residents have constructed a 90 meter-(297 foot-) long temporary
levee behind the breached dike to contain the flooding, with
another 3,000-meter- (9,900-foot-) long dike raised behind it as an
extra precaution, Xinhua said.
	   The Jiujiang hole is one of the most serious breaches so far in
the approximately 30,000 kilometers (18,600 miles) of dikes in the
Yangtze region that authorities worry could collapse after weeks of
rain and flooding.
	   A flood crest, the fourth this year, was heading towards
Jiujiang after roaring through upstream sections of the river in
Hubei province on Saturday, Xinhua said. Water levels at Wuhan, an
industrial center in Hubei with 7 million inhabitants, have been
rising slowly since Saturday, it said.
	   If those waters rise too high, authorities plan to open sluice
gates and possibly dynamite dikes to divert water into a flood
plain in central Hubei province in order to relieve pressure on
waterlogged dikes and save cities further downstream.
	   About 330,000 people have been evacuated from the Jingjiang
area, leaving behind homes that will be covered by water if the
last-ditch order to flood from China's Cabinet is given.
	   For that to happen, water levels on the Yangtze would have to
reach the record high of 45 meters (148.5 feet) at Shashi city,
north of the flood diversion area, Xinhua reported. Waters were
within centimeters (inches) of the level, Xinhua said.
	   The area was last used to divert the Yangtze in 1954, when
floods killed more than 30,000 people. A curfew has been thrown
over the area, and security forces have been ordered to remove
residents reluctant to leave behind their homes and belongings.
	   In Jiujiang, a center of industry and tourism in Jiangxi
province, army engineers plan to drive a dozen steel pipes into in
the gap in an attempt to block it, Xinhua said.
	   Thousands of residents have been evacuated from areas of the
city where flood waters reportedly rose as high as 2 meters (6.6
feet), and families living on the ground floor of apartment
buildings have been ordered to move. Jiujiang has an urban
population of about 500,000.
	   More than 2,000 persons have died nationwide in floods caused by
seasonal rains that arrived a month early and fell much harder than
usual. Millions more have been made homeless, while flood damage
and the relief effort are expected to be a major drag on the
Chinese economy in the second half of 1998.

Malaysia to jail those it says spread rumors of racial strife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A full-scale federal investigation
has been launched to find and imprison without trial the
``traitors'' who spread rumors of riots in Malaysia's capital, news
reports said Sunday.
	   Panic-buying at supermarkets and frenzied phone calls gripped
the capital, Kuala Lumpur, into the weekend as word circulated of
ethnic violence and a police crackdown in the city's red-light
district where many Indonesian immigrants live.
	   Nationwide, people heaved sighs of relief at the prime
minister's assurance late Friday night that, ``There are no riots.
All the rumors are only lies.'' But the panic that ensued in the
capital of 3 million people has prompted stern police action.
	   ``This is my warning to those responsible,'' Inspector-General
of Police Abdul Rahim Noor was quoted as saying in the Star
newspaper. ``Wait for your fate as we will arrest you wherever you
may be in the country.''
	   During a snap press conference called over the weekend to
address the matter, Abdul Rahim said the rumor mongers, believed to
have spread their word over the Internet, would be detained under
the powerful Internal Security Act, which permits jail without
trial.
	   A special team of federal police officers was formed to
investigate the source of the rumors, which remained front-page
news on the country's three English-language dailies for the second
day running.
	   ``The police have several e-mail addresses and are tracing those
involved,'' said Home Ministry Secretary-General Samsuddin Osman.
	   A widely-distributed e-mail alleged that owners of hardware
stores had reported a sharp rise in sales of machetes by
Indonesians, said to be arming themselves for an upcoming face-off
with police.
	   Authorities have set a deadline of Aug. 15 for employers of
foreign workers to renew permits. A widespread crackdown on illegal
immigrants is expected to follow.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad angrily dismissed the rumors as
``lies'' and those who spread them as ``traitors.'' He urged
Malaysians Saturday to stay united amid the rumors, which he said
were spread to create chaos.
	   Malaysia's indigenous Malays and ethnic Chinese and Indians have
existed peacefully, though somewhat uneasily, since race riots in
the capital in 1969 left dozens dead.
	   Abdul Rahim cited the panic from the rumors _ which in two days
spread across the nation, prompting newsrooms and embassies in the
capital to dispatch investigators to confirm the reports _ as
evidence of widespread racial concerns.
	   ``This clearly shows that the racial clashes in 1969 are still
lingering in people's minds,'' the police chief said.
	   One Sunday columnist compared the national mood to America in
1938, when Orson Welles radio broadcast of the H.G. Wells' novel
``The War of the Worlds'' convinced thousands of panicked listeners
that Martians had invaded earth.
	   ``On Friday, many Malaysian's chose to believe fiction because
they did not understand the power of information technology,''
wrote the columnist in the Star newspaper.
	   Deputy Home Minister Ong Ka Ting instructed the public to keep
close watch of the media, which the government would use to
announce emergency measures, such as curfew, if the situation
worsened.

China battles to plug breach in key Yangtze River dike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to add Eds note &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with efforts to plug hole in dike. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese soldiers and civilian volunteers
struggled to plug a major breach along a key Yangtze River dike
Sunday as the flood-swollen waterway continued to rise.
	   A lack of expertise and proper equipment were slowing efforts to
fill a hole in the dike that has flooded a 4-square-kilometer (
1.6-square-mile) area of Jiujiang city since bursting on Friday,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Eight river boats have been sunk in the breach to try to block
it, along with several truck loads of stone, soybeans, rice and
various other materials, the agency said.
	   Residents have constructed a 90 meter-(297 foot-) long temporary
levee behind the breached dike to contain the flooding, with
another 3,000-meter- (9,900-foot-) long dike raised behind it as an
extra precaution, Xinhua said.
	   The Jiujiang hole is one of the most serious breaches so far in
the approximately 30,000 kilometers (18,600 miles) of dikes in the
Yangtze region that authorities worry could collapse after weeks of
rain and flooding.
	   A flood crest, the fourth this year, was heading towards
Jiujiang after roaring through upstream sections of the river in
Hubei province on Saturday, Xinhua said. Water levels at Wuhan, an
industrial center in Hubei with 7 million inhabitants, have been
rising slowly since Saturday, it said.
	   If those waters rise too high, authorities plan to open sluice
gates and possibly dynamite dikes to divert water into a flood
plain in central Hubei province in order to relieve pressure on
waterlogged dikes and save cities further downstream.
	   About 330,000 people have been evacuated from the Jingjiang
area, leaving behind homes that will be covered by water if the
last-ditch order to flood from China's Cabinet is given.
	   For that to happen, water levels on the Yangtze would have to
reach the record high of 45 meters (148.5 feet) at Shashi city,
north of the flood diversion area, Xinhua reported. Waters were
within centimeters (inches) of the level, Xinhua said.
	   The area was last used to divert the Yangtze in 1954, when
floods killed more than 30,000 people. A curfew has been thrown
over the area, and security forces have been ordered to remove
residents reluctant to leave behind their homes and belongings.
	   In Jiujiang, a center of industry and tourism in Jiangxi
province, army engineers plan to drive a dozen steel pipes into in
the gap in an attempt to block it, Xinhua said.
	   Thousands of residents have been evacuated from areas of the
city where flood waters reportedly rose as high as 2 meters (6.6
feet), and families living on the ground floor of apartment
buildings have been ordered to move. Jiujiang has an urban
population of about 500,000.
	   More than 2,000 persons have died nationwide in floods caused by
seasonal rains that arrived a month early and fell much harder than
usual. Millions more have been made homeless, while flood damage
and the relief effort are expected to be a major drag on the
Chinese economy in the second half of 1998.

Three level atop National Rugby League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Newcastle struggled to break its
two-game losing streak with a 19-12 win Sunday over Gold Coast in a
National Rugby League match, allowing the Knights to stay among the
league leaders.
	   The home side stamped its authority on the game early with tries
to Jason Moodie (10th minute), Owen Craigie (19th) and Evan
Cochrane (30th) for a 12-0 halftime lead.
	   The win left Newcastle level with Melbourne and Brisbane for the
league lead, with Brisbane expected to take the minor premiership
on percentages. All three teams have 16 wins, a draw and five
losses after 22 matches.
	   In other matches Sunday, Sydney City beat Illawarra 48-10,
Canterbury defeated St. George 28-16 and South Sydney edged
Auckland 20-18.
	   Brad Fittler scored two of Sydney City's eight tries, the loss
all but ending the Steelers hopes of making the playoffs. South
Sydney moved off the bottom of the ladder with its close win over
Auckland.
	   Brisbane maintained its position at the top with a tough 22-10
win Saturday over North Queensland. The Broncos held a 12-8 lead at
halftime, but North Queensland narrowed it to 12-10 in the 44th
minute through a Josh Hannay penalty goal before the Broncos pulled
away.
	   Paul Carige scored a late try to break a 14-14 tie as Parramatta
beat Penrith 20-14. Canberra kept alive its slim chances of a top
six finish with a 22-0 win over Western Suburbs.
	   North Sydney all but ended Balmain's premiership hopes with a
comfortable 22-6 win.
	   Balmain ran with a strong breeze in the first half, but trailed
12-2 at the break after tries from North Sydney pair Michael
Buettner and Ben Ikin. Buettner added another try late in the
second half.
	   On Friday, Melbourne stand-in captain Tawera Nikau proved the
perfect link against his former club, setting up two of the Storm's
four tries as they overpowered Cronulla 20-10.
	   The win sealed Melbourne's place in the top six and a home final
in its first year.
	   At Adelaide, a try-saving tackle and an intercept try from
rookie winger Alf Duncan kept Manly's finals hopes alive in a 32-10
win over Adelaide. (djp)

Government says people afraid to break law; Suu Kyi security eased
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime stiffened its
security detail on the streets around Nobel laureate Aung San Suu
Kyi's house Sunday after complying with her requests to withdraw
the detachment from her property.
	   But security outside her home and in the capital remained light
a day after the sensitive 10th anniversary of a nationwide uprising
against military rule, which the army eventually crushed by killing
as many as 3,000 people.
	   The anniversary itself passed calmly Saturday without
demonstrations anywhere in the country, the government reported.
Rumors continued to fly Sunday that pro-democracy activists were
gathering to stage protests, but none could be confirmed.
	   Government newspapers said plainly that the peaceful anniversary
_ which dashed predictions by exiled Myanmar opposition groups of a
new uprising _ could be attributed to fear.
	   ``Even though the democracy princess wanted the people to go out
on the streets and create an anarchy in the country, the people
dare not break the laws of the existing government,'' said an
opinion piece.
	   Suu Kyi, who recently engaged authorities in a six-day standoff
on a road outside the capital, requested Thursday that the security
detail posted inside her lakeside compound be withdrawn.
	   The government announced Saturday it had complied but would
continue to assure her safety. The detail is believed by diplomats
to be part of extensive surveillance of Suu Kyi and her party, the
National League for Democracy.
	   On University Avenue where she lives, signs put in place two
years ago to warn off non-residents were supplemented Saturday with
long bamboo poles that can be raised to allow people to enter. But
unlike in past tense periods, there were no barbed-wire barricades.
	   Neighbors said that two cars _ one a marked police vehicle, the
other unmarked _ were parked outside Suu Kyi's residence, facing in
either direction. They appeared poised to easily follow her if she
tried to leave.
	   Suu Kyi has been stepping up her campaign to bring more
democracy to the country, also known as Burma, ahead of an Aug. 21
deadline she has set for the government to finally convene the
parliament elected in 1990.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the elections, but the
military, which has ruled the country since 1962, never allowed
parliament to meet and has steadily persecuted Suu Kyi's
supporters.
	   Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San, has spent most
of the past decade under house arrest or less formal restriction to
her home.
	   On Friday, her party exercised one of its few available powers
and refused a government invitation for Chairman Aung Shwe to meet
a mid-level Cabinet minister for talks. Suu Kyi and the party's two
vice chairmen were forbidden from attending.
	   The NLD has long called for a dialogue, but fears the ruling
State Peace and Development Council is trying to divide the party's
leaders and isolate Suu Kyi, the group's most potent international
symbol.
	   In Bangkok, Thailand, police ordered the 200 or so Myanmar
citizens who had gathered outside the embassy Saturday to protest
against the government to disperse.
	   Their numbers Sunday were down to about 70, but police said they
wanted the figure under 40, citing complaints from the embassy and
residents. Three protesters who did not have papers to be in
Bangkok were detained and were to be sent back to a refugee camp.

American wins annual race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: CORRECTS spelling of winner's name to Browne, ADDS quotes, new
details throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Colorado's Daniel Browne won the City
to Surf 14-kilometer (8.75-mile) race Sunday through the streets of
Sydney in a time of 41 minutes, 35 seconds.
	   Second place went to Canberra-based Ethiopian Sizay Desabor, 13
seconds behind with Robbie Johnson of New Zealand following in
42:00.
	   The first woman to finish was Australian Olympian Kerryn McCann
in 48:10. American Liz Wilson was second in 48:53 and Sachkoyo
Yokatsuko of Japan third in 50:09.
	   More than 40,000 people entered the race which starts in the
city's central business district and finishes at Bondi Beach.
	   Browne, a 23-year-old graduate of the United States Military
Academy, added to an already bulging 1998 honor roll.
	   He has already won three American national titles this year _
the 10,000-meters, the indoor 3,000 and the 4-kilometer
cross-country.
	   In Australia as a coach of 79 high school students here as part
of a world sports exchange, Browne kept a low profile in the leadup
to the event.
	   He observed but didn't participate in last Friday's media
conference, but said some of the other competitors' comments had
psyched him into running to win rather than just compete.
	   Browne said he came into Sunday's race only having resumed
running a week ago after taking a rest following his fifth place in
the 10,000 meters at the Goodwill Games in New York.
	   ``This really wasn't on my planned schedule of events, I think
my coach is going to be a little bit mad at me for doing it,''
Browne said.
	   ``I haven't done any speedwork or anything, I just sort of ran
on strength and a little bit of guts.''
	   It is only the fourth time in 28 years an overseas runner has
won the event.
	   McCann said she was surprised to break away from the field as
early as she did even though she always intended leading from the
start.
	   ``I wanted to lead from start to finish only because when you're
in front and everybody's cheering and yelling the first female it
puts you on a high and it carried me through to the end,'' she
said.
	   Over 60 runners required medical treatment and nine were taken
to hospital but no one was reported in a serious condition.

Prime minister willing to compromise with opposition on financial
</HEADLINE>
bills

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government would be
willing to amend key bad-loan disposal bills to accommodate demands
from opposition parties, Obuchi was quoted as saying Sunday.
	   ``We need to pass (the bills) as early as possible by striking a
compromise with opposition parties, no matter what the cost,''
Obuchi was quoted as saying by Kyodo News service.
	   Last week, the government and the governing Liberal Democratic
Party submitted six bills to Parliament designed to clean up bad
loans in the financial system and establish a ``bridge bank''
system aimed at preventing bank failures from triggering a wave of
corporate bankruptcies.
	   Opposition politicians say the proposals will bail out
struggling banks without attacking their problems head-on. They
have also called for measures to punish executives guilty of
mismanaging banks.
	   ``We must enter into talks with opposition forces that may have
negotiable plans,'' Obuchi was reported as saying at a news
conference in the southwestern city of Nagasaki.
	   Although the LDP holds a 13-seat majority in the more powerful
lower house of the two-chamber parliament, the opposition controls
the upper house.
	   The bank legislation is needed to clean up the estimated 80
trillion yen (dlrs 551 billion) in bad loans clogging the country's
financial system. Most of the debts are left over from the collapse
of the real estate market in the early 1990s.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China dynamited dikes along a stretch of the
swollen Yangtze River on Sunday in a desperate bid to divert
floodwaters menacing cities and huge swathes of farmland in central
Hubei province.
	   Secondary dikes were blown at 12 a.m. (0400 GMT) in Jianli
County, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) upriver from the industrial
center of Wuhan, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. More
solid primary dikes farther back from the river remain mostly
intact along the Yangtze.
	   The aim was to divert up to 800 million cubic meters (28 billion
cubic feet) of water and lower the raging Yangtze's water level by
10-25 centimeters (4-10 inches), it reported.
	   That appeared to be an effort to avoid flooding the much larger
Jingjiang diversion area farther upriver, where about 330,000
people have already been evacuated to high ground. Their homes and
fields will be covered by water if China's Cabinet gives the
last-ditch order to open floodgates and possibly blast Jingjiang's
dikes.
	   For that to happen, water levels on the Yangtze would have to
reach the record high of 45 meters (148.5 feet) at Shashi city,
north of the flood diversion area, Xinhua reported. The water level
at Shashi stood at 44.70 meters (147.5 feet) at noon Sunday, after
falling slightly from Saturday, Xinhua said.
	   Jingjiang was last used to divert the Yangtze in 1954, when
floods killed more than 30,000 people. A curfew has been imposed in
the area and security forces removed residents who were reluctant
to leave behind their homes and belongings.
	   In Jianli, 50,000 residents were forced out of their homes ahead
of the flooding, and many were ``reluctant to move,'' Xinhua said.
Xinhua has said that residents affected by any diversion schemes
will be compensated for lost property and crops.
	   Soldiers and civilian volunteers, meanwhile, struggled to plug a
major breach in the Yangtze dike at Jiujiang city that burst
Friday, Xinhua said.
	   A lack of expertise and proper equipment were slowing efforts to
fill a hole in the dike that has flooded a 4-square-kilometer
(1.6-square-mile) area of the city.
	   Eight river boats have been sunk in the breach to try to block
it, along with several truckloads of stone, soybeans, rice and
various other materials, the agency said.
	   Residents have constructed a 90-meter (297-foot)-long temporary
levee behind the breached dike to contain the flooding, with
another 3,000-meter (9,900-foot)-long dike raised behind it as an
extra precaution, Xinhua said.
	   The Jiujiang hole is one of the most serious breaches so far in
the approximately 30,000 kilometers (18,600 miles) of dikes in the
Yangtze region that authorities worry could collapse after weeks of
rain and flooding.
	   A flood crest, the fourth this year, was heading toward Jiujiang
after roaring through upstream sections of the river in Hubei
province Saturday, Xinhua said. Water levels at Wuhan, an
industrial center in Hubei with 7 million inhabitants, have been
rising slowly since Saturday, it said.
	   In Jiujiang, a center of industry and tourism in Jiangxi
province, army engineers plan to drive a dozen steel pipes into the
gap in an attempt to block it, Xinhua said. Thousands of residents
have been evacuated from areas of the city where floodwaters
reportedly rose as high as 2 meters (6.5 feet), and families living
on the ground floors of apartment buildings have been ordered to
move. Jiujiang has an urban population of about 500,000.
	   More than 2,000 people have died nationwide in floods caused by
seasonal rains that arrived a month early and fell much harder than
usual. Millions more have been made homeless, while flood damage
and the relief effort are expected to be a major drag on the
Chinese economy in the second half of 1998.

Bank projects economy will shrink more than 3 percent this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A leading bank expects Hong Kong's economy,
which is mired in recession, to shrink about 3.5 percent in the
current fiscal year, a news report said Sunday.
	   The estimate from the Bank of East Asia came after a week of bad
news, including poor corporate earnings reports, a 12 percent drop
in the stock market, and speculative attacks on the currency.
	   Hong Kong's troubles rattled much of Asia, and Monday is
expected to be the start of another volatile week on its markets.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said Saturday he anticipated
speculators would continue to try to dislodge the Hong Kong dollar
from its firm peg of 7.80 to the U.S. dollar. However, he and other
officials have strongly backed the currency link.
	   Hong Kong has huge currency reserves, and Tsang pledged any
speculative effort would be defeated.
	   The Hong Kong Standard quoted Shermus Kwok, economist for the
Bank of East Asia, as saying the bank expected the economy to
shrink by between 3.5 and 3.7 percent in the fiscal year that began
April 1.
	   That estimate is more pessimistic than many forecasts made by
other bankers and analysts, who said earlier in the week they
expected shrinkage of 2 to 3 percent.
	   Officials originally projected 3.5 percent growth this year, but
that estimate is largely considered to be irrelevant now.
	   Among the pieces of bad news that emerged last week was the
government's estimate that the economy shrank 2.8 percent in the
first quarter. No figures are available yet for the second quarter
of the year, but it is widely expected to be worse.

Prime minister willing to compromise with opposition on financial

bills &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to clarify nature of bills &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ To accommodate demands from opposition parties,
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government would be willing to amend
key bills aimed at cleaning up the morass of bad loans weighing
down Japan's economy, Obuchi was quoted as saying Sunday.
	   ``We need to pass (the bills) as early as possible by striking a
compromise with opposition parties, no matter what the cost,''
Obuchi was quoted as saying by Kyodo News service.
	   Last week, the government and the governing Liberal Democratic
Party submitted six bills to Parliament designed to clean up bad
loans in the financial system and establish a ``bridge bank''
system aimed at preventing bank failures from triggering a wave of
corporate bankruptcies.
	   Opposition politicians say the proposals will bail out
struggling banks without attacking their problems head-on. They
have also called for measures to punish executives guilty of
mismanaging banks.
	   ``We must enter into talks with opposition forces that may have
negotiable plans,'' Obuchi was reported as saying at a news
conference in the southwestern city of Nagasaki.
	   Although the LDP holds a 13-seat majority in the more powerful
lower house of the two-chamber parliament, the opposition controls
the upper house.
	   The bank legislation is needed to clean up the estimated 80
trillion yen (dlrs 551 billion) in bad loans clogging the country's
financial system. Most of the debts are left over from the collapse
of the real estate market in the early 1990s.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A hijacker seized a Russian airliner Sunday with
97 passengers on board as it arrived in Moscow on a flight from
Siberia, officials said.
	   The unidentified man was demanding 621,000 rubles (dlrs 100,000)
and threatened to blow up the TU-154 jet if he did not receive it,
said a spokesman for the Emergency Situations Ministry who
identified himself only as Mr. Bannikov.
	   The airplane had just arrived at Moscow's Domodedovo Airport
from the Siberian city of Ust-Ilimsk when the man seized the plane,
Bannikov said.
	   An agent from the Federal Security Service was allowed on board
and began negotiations with the hijacker, the spokesman added.
	   The hijacker wanted to fly to another destination, but the exact
location was not immediately clear, the spokesman added.
	   No additional details were available.

Indonesian operations suffering, Coca-Cola Amatil boss says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. managing director
David Kennedy said Sunday its Indonesian operations had reached
bottom, with no short-term sign of improvement.
	   The bottling company's operations in South Korea faced fewer
problems in the long term than those in Indonesia because the
Korean economy was more likely to improve faster than other Asian
economies, Kennedy said.
	   On Thursday, the company warned that volumes were expected to be
lower in South Korea in 1998 and said its Indonesian operations
would post a small trading loss in the second half.
	   ``I think in the case of Indonesia, I would say that our
business has bottomed out there and assuming that there's no other
social or political shock, that we're about where we're going to be
for a while,'' Kennedy told the Nine television network's Business
Sunday.
	   ``I don't see any upside there for some time. In the case of
South Korea, that's less clear.''
	   He said the Indonesian business had market leadership, minimal
competition and annual volumes of more than 60 million cases, and
that level of turnover could be maintained.
	   ``Our business is cash-flow positive and we'll be able to
maintain that for an indefinite period. ... It will take some time,
I believe, for that country to adjust, but I'm not in the business
of trying to predict when that might come,'' he said.

Brazil is land of coffee, but good luck finding tasty cup to drink

<TEXT>
	   POCOS DE CALDAS, Brazil (AP) _ Sure, Brazilians down enough
thimble-sized ``cafezinhos'' to make them the world's
second-largest nation of coffee drinkers after the United States.
	   It's also true Brazil is the largest producer and exporter of
coffee.
	   But that doesn't mean it's easy finding a steaming cup of good
coffee.
	   ``Brazilians have gotten used to drinking bad coffee,'' laments
Jose Barbosa do Rosario, who edits Coffee Business magazine.
	   Brazilians grew accustomed to bad coffee in the 1960s, when the
government decided that instead of destroying the accumulating
mountains of coffee beans it was obliged to buy from growers, it
would practically give surplus beans away to domestic roasters.
	   But because good quality beans commanded higher prices on the
international market, the coffee left over was usually poor, and
Brazilians got used to it.
	   ``It doesn't pay to produce quality coffee if there's no market
for it,'' grower Oswaldo Aranha Neto says.
	   There are, however, some encouraging signs.
	   The Association of Brazilian Coffee Producers is running a
school to train restaurant and cafe operators how to make good
coffee. And the Brazilian Coffee Industry Association recently
began awarding a seal of purity to roasters who can prove their
coffee is pure.
	   Purity does not necessarily spell quality, though. Because of
the harvesting techniques employed, Brazil ends up with more bad
coffee beans than some other countries.
	   In Colombia, for instance, coffee berries are picked from the
trees only when they are ripe. In Brazil, the berries are taken in
a single swoop. Unripe, overripe, bug-eaten and broken beans are
sifted out later by machines.
	   It is those rejected beans that are the raw material for all
those cafezinhos _ ``little coffees'' _ that Brazilians know and
love.

	   POCOS DE CALDAS, Brazil (AP) _ Eder Latronico has spent 36 years
tasting coffee, but don't let that fool you _ he hates the stuff.
	   ``I never drink coffee. I just taste it and spit it out. At home
I drink tea,'' said Latronico, 58, who works as a coffee classifier
at the Poco de Caldas Coffee Cooperative.
	   The co-op buys coffee from hundreds of farmers, and Latronico's
job is to rate each lot and advise roasters how to get a uniform
taste for their trademark blends using the available stocks.
	   Five days a week during the four-month harvest season, Latronico
lines up hundreds of cups of coffee on a turntable and flicks a
spoonful from each cup into his mouth, then spits it out. All this
is done with breathtaking speed as the table spins below him.
	   ``What worries me is that even though I spit it out, some of the
coffee seeps down _ and if I have to get a new spittoon every two
years, due to corrosion, just imagine what it does to my stomach,''
he said.
	   The coffee Latronico slurps up and spits out isn't normal coffee
either. He roasts each sample only lightly and gives it only a
coarse grind.
	   Latronico says the light roast gives him a better idea of the
coffee's true quality. The coarse grind is so the dregs fall to the
bottom of the cup and don't end up in his mouth.
	   ``It's a good way to taste coffee; it's not a good way to drink
it,'' Latronico concedes.

Hong Kong issues year's first cyclone warning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Tropical depression Penny headed toward the
South China coast Sunday, and Hong Kong officials issued their
first tropical storm warning of the year.
	   At 3 p.m. (0700 GMT), Penny was centered about 420 kilometers
(260 miles) southeast of Hong Kong in the South China Sea. It was
expected to move toward the coast of Guangdong, passing within 200
kilometers (125 miles) of Hong Kong on Monday, said a bulletin from
the Hong Kong Observatory.
	   A tropical depression is a cyclone with maximum wind speeds near
the center of 62 kilometers an hour (38 mph).
	   Penny, with maximum center winds now estimated at 46 kph (29
mph), was forecast to strengthen gradually and move northwest at
about 22 kph (14 mph).
	   A standby storm warning was issued in Hong Kong Sunday morning.
	   Although officials said it still was difficult to predict
Penny's exact path, a higher warning level was possible. If a level
3 alert is issued, shelters will be opened for people who live on
boats on Hong Kong's numerous islands.

	   NIGDE, Turkey (AP) _ A minibus crashed into a truck near the
southern Turkish city of Nigde on Sunday, setting off a freeway
pileup that killed at least 18 people and injured 23, the
provincial governor said.
	   Nine vehicles were involved in the early morning crash, which
occurred during heavy traffic on the freeway between Nigde and the
city of Adana, Nigde Gov. Adil Yazar told private NTV television.
	   Nigde is 215 miles (345 kms) south of Ankara, the capital.
	   The highway was opened to traffic after rescue crews retrieved
bodies from crumpled vehicles and collected body parts from the
scene.
	   Many drivers take to the roads early to escape the scorching
summer heat that often reaches 102 degrees (39 degrees Celsius)
during the day in many parts of the country.

Police detain mainland Chinese official, seven others in drug

busts &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Police arrested eight men, including a
mainland Chinese official and a former Hong Kong police officer, in
two drug busts that yielded millions of dollars worth of heroin and
amphetamines, news reports said Sunday.
	   The drug busts were reportedly the largest in Taiwan history.
	   Deng Deming, 43, who works for mainland China's State Council
office in Hong Kong, was arrested with Hong Kong residents Cheng
Wei-wen and Li Kuo-chiang, both 50, Malaysian Tan Chien-chi, 45,
and Taiwanese Hsu Chin-chien, 35, in a bust that yielded eight
kilograms (18 pounds) of heroin, the official Central News Agency
reported.
	   The United Daily Evening News said that Li was a former Hong
Kong policeman.
	   Despite testy relations between China and Taiwan, the Chinese
mainland is thought to be a major source of illegal drugs passing
through the island, but it was rare for a mainland official to be
arrested in a drug bust.
	   It was unclear whether the arrest might further damage relations
between the two sides, which have been strained by the killing of a
Taiwanese city counselor on the mainland.
	   The heroin, in 22 separate packages, was found in food
containers in an unidentified building in Taipei, and had an
estimated street value of 300 million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 8.8
million), the news agency said.
	   Deng, allegedly part of a drug syndicate that stretched from
Hong Kong to Singapore, flew in from Hong Kong last Wednesday. He
was detained early Saturday while doing business with the other
suspects, the report added.
	   Taiwan Television quoted police as saying the four men were
using Taiwan as a transit point for drug distribution to other
parts of Southeast Asia. The TV report added that the heroin may
have come from south China's Yunnan province, near the narcotics
production area known as the Golden Triangle in northern Myanmar.
	   ``The packaging of the heroin pieces are all different, so we
cannot determine at this point where they originally came from,''
Taipei District Inspector Huang Pao-hen said on television.
	   Police also arrested three unidentified men and seized more than
650 kilograms (1,430 pounds) of amphetamines in a separate raid on
a fishing boat moored in the eastern port of Suao, about 45
kilometers (28 miles) from the capital Taipei, Taiwan Television
said.
	   The drugs were stuffed in pipes and hidden in the hull of the
fishing boat, which had just come from mainland China, the report
said. Police did not give an estimated value for the drugs.
	   Taiwan has cracked down heavily on production and distribution
of illicit drugs, forcing drug syndicates to smuggle increasing
amounts of the finished product from China.
	   The drugs usually are hidden on fishing boats that cross the
130-kilometer (80-mile) Taiwan Strait, which separates this island
from the Chinese mainland.
	   In June, Taiwan police arrested three men and confiscated 34
kilograms (75 pounds) of amphetamines with an estimated street
value of 100 million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 3.6 million) hidden
in a shipping container south of Taipei.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Fifty-six men, almost all laborers, were
treated for heat exhaustion after they fainted while working in
temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit), hospital
officials said Sunday.
	   None of the workers was in serious condition from Saturday's
heat and only two remained in the hospital, said officials at the

	   No deaths have been reported in this Gulf island from the hot
weather, which has sent the mercury soaring to 54 degrees Celsius
(129 Fahrenheit) in recent days. Humidity has hit 90 percent.
	   On Thursday, 13 people, most of them laborers, were treated for
dehydration. Newspapers have urged readers to avoiding direct
exposure to the sun.
	   Last month in the neighboring state of Qatar, five workers died
while working at a construction site as temperatures rose above 50
degrees Celsius. More than 150 people were treated for sunstroke,
exhaustion and dehydration.
	   Summer temperatures in the Gulf usually hover around 45 degrees
Celsius (113 Fahrenheit), although 50-degree Celsius is not
uncommon.

Hijacker seizes airplane at Moscow airport

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A hijacker seized a Russian airliner as it arrived
in Moscow on Sunday and threatened to blow up the plane if he did
not receive 621,000 rubles (dlrs 100,000), officials said.
	   The unidentified man commandeered the TU-154 jet upon its
arrival at Moscow's Domodedovo Airport on a domestic flight from
the central Siberian city of Ust-Ilimsk, the Ministry of Emergency
Situations said.
	   The man demanded the money and a flight to another destination,
but the exact location was not immediately clear.
	   An agent from the Federal Security Service was allowed on board
and began negotiations with the hijacker, said a spokesman for the
ministry who identified himself only as Mr. Bannikov.
	   Security agents were sent to the airport, which remained open to
normal traffic while the hijacked plane sat on the tarmac,
officials said.

Taliban pressure foes near Kabul after attack on Mazar-e-Sharif
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Reports of fighting Sunday appeared to
contradict claims by the Taliban that they were in charge of
Mazar-e-Sharif, the last major Afghan city outside the extremist
Islamic militia's undisputed control.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance, meanwhile, was also under pressure
near Kabul in the Panjshir Valley, where ousted military chief
Ahmed Shah Masood has struggled to hold ground since he and
President Burhanuddin Rabbani lost the capital two years ago.
	   Indian-based Afghan Ambassador Masood Khalili, who has remained
loyal to Rabbani, said street fighting was escalating Sunday in
Mazar-e-Sharif, some 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Kabul, a
day after Taliban fighters entered it.
	   Khalili also accused Taliban fighters of killing civilians,
targeting Shiite Muslims in particular. The Taliban, like most
Afghans, adhere to the Sunni sect of Islam.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition was regrouping, Khalili said. ``God
knows what will happen in the next 24 hours.''
	   Khalili's report could not be immediately confirmed. But a
fierce defense of Mazar-e-Sharif had been expected. Its loss would
be a severe blow to an opposition backed into a dwindling corner of
northern Afghanistan, and a boost to the Taliban's four-year-old
campaign to impose their strict interpretation of Islamic rule on
all of Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban, whose name means ``students of Islam,'' emerged in
1994, pledging to bring peace to Afghanistan after years of civil
war. In the areas they control, the Taliban have barred girls from
school, confined most women to their homes, forbade all music
except religious songs, and staged frequent public mutilations of
thieves and executions of murderers.
	   After heavy overnight fighting, the Taliban on Sunday had
advanced 15 kilometers (9 miles) along the New Road Pass, 40
kilometers (25 miles) northeast of Kabul. Taliban Commander Haji
Ibrahim said retreating opposition troops left behind the bodies of
five fighters, while 10 of his men were injured in a land mine
explosion.
	   ``We plan to launch a massive attack soon'' on Masood's
stronghold, Ibrahim said.
	   The new Taliban position outside Kabul put them just 20
kilometers (12 miles) from Bagram, a Russian-built air base that is
the biggest in Afghanistan. Masood's forces have been unable to use
the air base because it was within striking distance of Taliban
rockets.
	   An opposition rocket landed on the perimeter of the Taliban-held
Kabul airport Sunday morning. There were no immediate reports of
casualties.
	   In some parts of Afghanistan, the Taliban have bribed military
commanders to surrender or counted on being welcomed by local
residents eager to embrace anyone promising peace or to accept the
Taliban as their ethnic brothers.
	   But Mazar-e-Sharif is inhabited mostly by ethnic Uzbeks and
Tajiks, while the Taliban, like most other Afghans, are Pashtuns.
The Taliban are Sunni, while the Hezb-e-Wahadat militia that calls
the city its stronghold is made up of Shiite Muslims. Residents
resented Taliban attempts last year to impose their version of
Islam on Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Last May, the Taliban entered Mazar-e-Sharif at the invitation
of a warlord who had turned on his anti-Taliban allies. The warlord
then turned again _ allegiance-switching has been a hallmark of
Afghanistan's years of civil war _ and the Taliban took heavy
casualties while being driven out.
	   ``Last year, we were invited in. But this time, we burned the
mountains,'' said Taliban spokesman Abdul Manam Niyazi, using an
expression for heavy fighting while speaking Saturday by satellite
phone from Mazar-e-Sharif.

Three lock up home-ground advantage for playoffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Sydney, North Melbourne and the
Western Bulldogs have all but sewn up three of the top four
Australian Football League positions, guaranteeing home-ground
advantage in next month's finals.
	   With three Australian Rules football rounds remaining, the trio
have a two-game advantage over Adelaide with a spot in the top half
of the final eight ensuring home advantage in the first week of the
finals, at least.
	   The crucial game Sunday was Sydney's 10.14 (74) to 9.14 (68)
victory over West Coast, a result which drops the Eagles to
seventh.
	   West Coast was leapfrogged Sunday by reigning premier Adelaide,
which ended the finals chances of local rivals Port Adelaide with a
22.12 (144) to 10.10 (70) victory.
	   The other match Sunday saw Richmond move back into eighth spot,
ahead of Melbourne, after downing Collingwood 12.14 (86) to 9.13
(67).
	   On Saturday, cellar-dwellars Hawthorn surprised St. Kilda, last
year's runners-up, by 10 goals, winning 19.14 (128) to 10.9 (69).
The Saints have lost four of their last five games.
	   Essendon's forward line proved too much for Fremantle as the
Bombers cruised to a 33-point victory. The 18.11 (119) to 12.14
(86) win was the Bombers' fifth in a row and kept open the door to
a top four berth with three games remaining.
	   Geelong ended its six-game losing streak with a one-point win
over the Bulldogs, 14.13 (97) to 13.18 (96). The Cats trailed at
each break but Carl Steinfort's point late in the game gave them
the win after the lead changed four times in the last quarter.
	   Melbourne forward David Schwarz struck form with a six-goal
performance to lift the Demons to a 49-point victory over Carlton.
Schwarz broke open the match with a five-goal burst in the third
term as Melbourne sailed to a 16.17 (113) to 8.16 (64) win.
	   On Friday, North Melbourne led by eight points at the first
break en route to a 15.23 (113) to 12.14 (86) win over Brisbane.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Fearing an escalation in fighting in
eastern Congo, foreign aid workers in the rebel-controlled city of
Bukavu have fled across the border into neighboring Rwanda,
state-controlled radio in Rwanda reported.
	   More than 60 foreigners including Americans, Canadians and
Belgians, left the city, the Rwandan report said.
	   In Kinshasa, the government on Sunday increased security around
the capital, closing all river ports and halting traffic across its
river border with the Republic of Congo.
	   Tutsi gunmen with close ties to Rwanda launched a rebellion a
week ago in Congo's eastern Kivu region and vowed to topple
President Laurent Kabila's 14-month-old regime.
	   Within the first few days of their uprising, the rebels captured
several key cities near the Rwandan border, including Goma and
Bukavu.
	   They also control several small towns in Congo's far west near
the Atlantic coastline about 250 kilometers (150 miles) southwest
of Kinshasa.
	   Kabila accuses the Tutsi-led Rwandan government of masterminding
the revolt, although Rwanda repeatedly has denied the charge.
	   On Saturday, Kabila sat down in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, with
his Rwandan adversary, President Pasteur Bizimungu, to try to find
a peaceful end to growing hostilities. They were joined by five
other regional leaders.
	   Neither side emerged optimistic and the prospects for a solution
emerging from the talks appeared dim.
	   Throughout the weekend, Congo broadcast accusations against
Rwanda and urged young people to join newly created militia units
to defend the country.
	   State-controlled television in Kinshasa broadcast scenes from a
demonstration rally by a Congolese student group calling for an
invasion of Rwanda.
	   ``The Circle of Kasai Students simply recommends the annexation
of the infamous Republic of Rwanda, which will, as a result, become
the 12th province of the Democratic Republic of Congo,'' an
unidentified student leader said in the broadcast.
	   In the Rwandan capital Kigali, Bizimungu accused Kabila of
trying to establish a pretext to attack Rwanda and threatened Congo
with a preemptive strike.
	   ``We will not wait for Congo to attack first,'' Bizimungu told
The Associated Press.
	   Bizimungu said Rwanda had credible evidence of Kabila's training
of at least 10,000 former Hutu soldiers and militiamen in the
southern city of Kamina, and that he planned to use them against
Rwanda.
	   The rebels were responsible for the 1994 genocide of more than
500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus. The killing
ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in Rwanda in July 1994,
sending the former Hutu government across the border into Congo.
	   Bizimungu again rejected Kabila's charges that 2,000 Rwandan
troops were fighting alongside Congolese Tutsis and advancing from
the east of the country.
	   In preparation for what Kabila warned could be protracted war,
thousands of young men and women have been enlisting in the army
and joining militia units.
	   The rebellious Rwandan soldiers and Congolese Tutsi fighters _
called Banyamulenge _ backed Kabila last year in his ouster of
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, but they have since grown disaffected.
	   The Banyamulenge have close ethnic ties with the Tutsis, who now
govern Rwanda.

Father of rogue trader Nick Leeson also has cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Days after lawyers for imprisoned securities
trader Nick Leeson announced he has colon cancer, his father said
he, too, is suffering from the disease.
	   In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, William Leeson, 58,
said he has the same form of blood cancer that killed his wife in
1987 and is too ill to fly to Singapore to visit his son in jail.
	   He urged the Singapore authorities to allow his 31-year-old son
to return home. ''It would make life so much easier for us if he
was in prison over here,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.
	   Nick Leeson, 31, was diagnosed Wednesday with colon cancer which
has spread to his lymph nodes. His lawyers have submitted a plea to
the Singapore authorities to release him early on compassionate
grounds.
	   He is serving a 6 1/2-year prison sentence in Singapore for
making hundreds of millions of dollars in unauthorized futures
deals that brought down Barings, Britain's oldest merchant bank.
	   William Leeson, a plasterer who lives in Watford, north of
London, said he was incredulous to learn of his son's illness
Wednesday.
	   ``I couldn't believe it,'' the Sunday Telegraph quoted him as
saying. ``Now it is slowly sinking in. It is like me with cancer,
even now you can't believe it.
	   ``But we know it is serious, very serious. Nick has got to fight
and Nick will fight. He is a lot like his dad and mother in that
respect. He will fight it.''
	   News reports said Leeson, who is being held in the prison wing
of New Changi Hospital, was due to undergo an operation within the
next few days.
	   From his base in Singapore, Nick Leeson lost dlrs 1.38 billion
speculating on Asian stock markets. British investigators concluded
that financial controls within Barings were ``woefully inadequate''
and faulted the Bank of England for not keeping close enough tabs.
	   Barings went broke in February 1995 and was taken over by the
Dutch banking and insurance company, ING Group.
	   Leeson began serving his sentence in December 1995.

Torrential rains weakening in South Korea after more than 230

Korea &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Torrential rains were weakening Sunday
after a four-day deluge that left more than 230 people dead or
missing in South Korea, mostly in Seoul and surrounding areas.
	   The latest casualties were seven people, including a U.S. Army
soldier, killed in central coastal regions Sunday as the rain
fronts moved south.
	   The sun came out over Seoul for the first time in four days
Sunday after the worst rains to hit the capital in nearly 80 years.
The rains were expected to taper off elsewhere in South Korea on
Monday, weather officials said.
	   The death toll from this week's storms reached 165, including 10
South Korean and three U.S. Army soldiers. Another 69 people, all
South Koreans, were listed as missing and presumed dead.
	   More than 82,000 people were driven from their homes, and
property damage was estimated at up to dlrs 2 billion.
	   At Suwon air base south of Seoul, an American soldier died after
apparently falling into a flooded ditch shortly after midnight, the
U.S. military command said in a news release.
	   It said the floodwaters foiled attempts to rescue the soldier,
whose name was not immediately released. The soldier was from the
1-43rd Air Defense Artillery Battalion assigned to the air base.
	   In Tangjin, 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Seoul, where
up to 32 centimeters (12.5 inches) fell overnight, six South Korean
civilians were killed in two different mud-slides, government
officials said.
	   Lightning killed two others in the nearby village of Taean, they
said.
	   In what local media called ``guerrilla-style rain storms''
because of their unpredictability, most of the deaths and property
damage were reported in Seoul and its surrounding areas, where
nearly half of South Korea's 44 million people live.
	   Wide parts of Seoul, a city of 12 million, remained flooded
Sunday after receiving more than 1 meter (39.3 inches) of rain in
the past four days. On Saturday, 33.2 centimeters (13 inches) fell
in Seoul, the most to fall in one day since Aug. 2, 1920, weather
reports said.
	   Millions of people in Seoul's low-lying areas stayed at their
homes or makeshift shelters overnight, keeping an uneasy vigil on
the Han River and its tributaries, which government officials
warned could overflow if more rain falls.
	   But the rains over upper South Korea eased after midnight
Saturday. Bright sun rays peeked through overcast Seoul skies
Sunday afternoon.
	   Weather officials lifted storm warnings in effect for much of
South Korea since Wednesday.
	   Three national television networks that had continued
weather-related broadcasts non-stop for the past three days
returned to normal programming Sunday morning, saying that ``the
worst appears to be over.''
	   In areas near communist North Korea, U.S. and South Korean
soldiers, using mine-detectors and metal sticks, were combing
valleys and stream beds in search of 10 tons of artillery shells
and 200 anti-personnel land mines swept away in mud-slides and
floods.
	   The deluge was brought by the same storm system that a week
earlier sent flash floods raging down mountain valleys at the
southern tip of the Korean Peninsula, killing 67 campers and
leaving 29 missing and feared dead.

Taiwan, U.S. sign WTO pact; agree on agriculture tariff cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan and the United States have signed a
bilateral agreement for the island's accession to the World Trade
Organization, news reports said Sunday.
	   Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu and U.S. Assistant
Trade Representative Robert Cassidy signed the pact in Washington
Friday, after lengthy negotiations on tariff rates for 8,000
agricultural and industrial products, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs said in a statement.
	   Under the agreement, Taiwan will cut tariffs on many
agricultural and industrial products, open up its
telecommunications and financial services sectors, and enter into
agreements on government procurement and civil aviation pacts
sponsored by the World Trade Organization.
	   The liberalization of financial services will have long-term
benefits, the Central News Agency quoted Taiwan Central Bank
officials as saying.
	   To date, the island has signed trade agreements with 23 out of
the 26 organization members that requested bilateral talks. Hong
Kong, Canada and the European Union still need to sign with Taiwan,
the ministry added.
	   Taiwan has successfully negotiated with all members that
objected to its bid to join the 132-member trade body. Officials
said they hope to enter the WTO early next year, but much depends
on China's attitude.
	   Relations across the Taiwan Strait have often been hostile since
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to Taiwan after losing a civil
war to Mao Tse-tung's Communists in 1949.
	   Although economic relations have warmed up considerably, China _
which views Taiwan as a renegade province _ has said the island
must not be admitted to the WTO ahead of it.

Palestinian legislators approve Arafat's Cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian legislators approved
Yasser Arafat's new Cabinet on Sunday, despite criticism that the
Palestinian leader has done nothing to address charges of
widespread government corruption.
	   Arafat announced the new Cabinet last week, a year after
legislators demanded the old one be dissolved because of
corruption. But the roster left in place most of the former
ministers _ including those accused of corruption _ and added 10
others.

Kido wins fourth career triumph in Mizuno Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATO, Japan (AP) _ Fuki Kido shot a 2-under-par 70 Sunday and
won the Mizuno Ladies by six strokes, her first victory in three
years.
	   Kido, who had a three-shot lead overnight, sank two birdies
against two bogeys on the front nine, where South Korean Lee
Young-me moved within two strokes of the lead.
	   On the back side, however, Kido raced away with birdies on Nos.
13 and 15 for a four-round total of 7-under 281. Lee double-bogeyed
the 11th hole and then bogeyed the 12th before a birdie on the 13th
en route to a 71 and 287.
	   Another close rival, Yuka Irie, shot a 73 and slipped into the
tie for second with Lee.
	   The victory, Kido's fourth in 14 years as a pro, was worth 10.8
million yen (dlrs 72,000) from a purse of 60 million yen (dlrs
414,000).
	   ``It's been so long since I won last time,'' said the
36-year-old Kido. It was in the 1995 Kachidoki Queen's. ``Another
surprise was that I found my mother among the gallery out there
today.''
	   ``It was the first time that I could watch her play without
worrying too much about her score,'' said Kido's mother, Mitsue,
referring to her daughter's solid lead.
	   Lee, winner of the Toto Motors Ladies in May, was seeking her
seventh victory since joining the Japan tour in 1987.
	   Irie, a co-leader after the second round, was in contention for
her first title of the season and fourth overall.
	   Akiko Fukushima, the tour's top player in the last two seasons,
shot the day's best round of 67 and shared fourth at 288 with South
Korean Kim Ae-sook, Yuko Motoyama and Hisako Ogane.
	   Fukushima, winner of last week's Golf 5 Ladies, was seeking her
second victory this season and 13th overall.

Man dies of suspected crocodile attack

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ Wounds apparently made by a crocodile
have been found on the body of a man missing for more than two days
in a remote Northern Territory river, police said Sunday.
	   The body of the unidentified Aboriginal man was found Sunday on
the bank of the Roper River. It was about 400 meters (440 yards)
downstream from where he went missing, Sgt. Richard Cheal of the
Ngukurr police said.
	   ``The body had wounds on it which were consistent with a
crocodile,'' Cheal said.
	   He said the body would be flown to Darwin for an autopsy to
confirm whether the man, in his late 20s, died as a result of a
crocodile attack.
	   Police said the man disappeared when a dinghy capsized as he and
six others were trying to cross the Roper River early Friday.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two hijackers seized a Russian airliner shortly
before it landed in Moscow on Sunday and threatened to blow up the
plane if they did not receive 621,000 rubles (dlrs 100,000),
officials said.
	   The unidentified men commandeered the TU-154 jet carrying 97
passengers while en route to Moscow's Domodedovo Airport from the
Siberian city of Tymen, according to officials from the Emergency
Situations Ministry and the Federal Security Service.
	   Earlier reports said there was only one hijacker and that the
flight was coming from Ust-Ilimsk, also in Siberia.
	   The hijackers were demanding the money and a flight to another
destination, but the exact location was not immediately clear,
officials said.
	   Sergei Matyugin, a spokesman for the security service, told
journalists at the airport that all the passengers and crew had
been removed from the plane. He said the only people still on the
plane were the two hijackers.
	   Earlier, the Emergency Situations Ministry said that an agent
from the security service had been allowed on board and began
negotiations with the hijackers.
	   The conflicting accounts could not immediately be reconciled.
	   Security agents arrived at the scene shortly after the
hijacking, but the airport continued to handle regular air traffic
while the hijacked plane sat on the tarmac, officials said.
	   Russia's last hijacking took place in December, when a man
claiming to be wired with explosives commandeered a plane traveling
to Moscow from the eastern city of Magadan. He was captured shortly
after the plane landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1 airport.

Jazz singer performs as Americans return to Baalbek festival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Jazz singer Nina Simone shook her hips
and shoulders and brought the audience to its feet in a performance
amid the ancient ruins of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon.
	   ``We love you Nina!'' many in the crowd shouted.
	   ``Is that a marriage proposal?'' the 65-year-old American
jokingly replied during her show Saturday night.
	   This is the first year Americans returned to the Baalbek
International Festival since 1974. Jazz pianist Herbie Hancock
performed earlier, and American conductor Carl St. Claire appeared
with the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra.
	   Lebanon was off-limits to Americans from 1987 until last year on
U.S. government orders because of kidnappings of Americans and
other foreigners. Baalbek was a stronghold of the Shiite Muslim
radicals blamed for the abductions.
	   Simone made it an American evening with such favorites as ``My
Way'' and ``I Love You Porgy,'' and adlibbed lyrics about Martin
Luther King Jr. and even President Clinton.
	   The sold-out crowd of an estimated 4,000 _ young and old _ rose
to its feet and cheered when Simone sang ``My Baby Just Cares for
Me.''
	   Simone was sometimes aided walking on stage under the towering
floodlit columns of Baalbek's Jupiter Temple. But she got quickly
into the mood, shaking her hips and shoulders to the music of her
four-man band.
	   ``It was great. The ambiance, thousands of years of history, the
music, the people...,'' said Randa Haddad, an ophthalmologist at
American University Hospital who like hundreds came on a two-hour
bus ride from Beirut.
	   Others complained the show was too short. Simone, appearing
tired, sang and played piano for about 80 minutes.
	   Many Americans and other international stars played Baalbek
before the festival was halted by the 1975-90 civil war. It resumed
last year and has 14 nights of performances this year between July
24 and Aug. 29.
	   Brendan Stafford, a Briton who came to Baalbek for the first
time especially for Simone, said he was not worried about his
safety in the one-time den of kidnappers.
	   ``I was curious more than worried,'' he said.

Palestinian legislators approve Arafat's Cabinet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with council vote, swearing in ceremony, background.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian legislators approved
Yasser Arafat's new Cabinet on Sunday, despite criticism that the
Palestinian leader has done nothing to address charges of
widespread government corruption.
	   The legislative council, which is dominated by Arafat's Fatah
faction, approved the Cabinet by a vote of 55-28. There were three
abstentions. The new ministers were to be sworn in Sunday night at
a ceremony in the Gaza Strip.
	   Arafat announced the new Cabinet last week, a year after
legislators demanded the old one be dissolved because of
corruption. But the roster left in place most of the former
ministers _ including those accused of corruption _ and added 10
others.
	   Two ministers _ Hanan Ashrawi and Abdel Jawad Saleh _ quit last
week in protest.
	   Ashrawi, one of the most prominent Palestinian political
figures, urged her fellow legislators to vote down the new Cabinet,
saying Saturday, ``We have to respect ourselves. We have to make
tough decisions.''
	   Some of Arafat's usual critics, like Bethlehem legislator Salah
Tamari, were apparently coopted by being given places in the new
Cabinet.
	   Palestinian political analyst Ghassan Khatib said the
legislators approval of the same ministers they had declared
corrupt a year ago would undermine the credibility of the council.

Philippine government to immunize 17 million students against

measles &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government plans to
immunize 17 million students against measles within 10 years under
a program aimed at eradicating the disease, an official said
Sunday.
	   The free immunizations beginning next month will benefit grade-
and high-school students aged 6 to 15 nationwide, Education
Secretary Andrew Gonzales said.
	   A separate anti-measles immunization program for college
students and soldiers is being considered, he said in a statement.
	   Health officials estimate at least 20 percent of Filipino
children, who are most susceptible to the disease, are not
immunized against measles, a highly communicable viral disease
characterized by the appearance of small, red skin spots, high
fever and nasal discharge.

die from complications arising from measles each year, partly due

Leader of war-time Bosnian Serb military group killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The commander of an infamous
Bosnian Serb war-time paramilitary unit and post-war police chief,
Srdjan Knezevic, was killed by two masked gunmen, media and sources
said Sunday.
	   Knezevic was a commander of the ``White Wolves'' unit which
during the Bosnian war fought along the front lines around
Sarajevo. Sources said he was close to the Serb war-time leader and
No. 1 war crimes suspect, Radovan Karadzic.
	   After the war, Knezevic became a deputy chief of the Bosnian
Serb police in the Sarajevo region.
	   According to the Sarajevo ONASA news agency and local sources,
Knezevic was killed Friday night in front of his apartment in Pale,
18 kilometers (11 miles) east of Sarajevo. He was gunned down by
more than 20 bullets, the agency said.
	   Western officials believe that the murder could have been a
result of conflict among local mafia.

	   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany (AP) _ A C-141 cargo plane carrying
15 critically injured victims of the Nairobi embassy bombing
arrived Sunday at Ramstein Air Base, where they were met by medical
teams and a squadron of ambulances.
	   Forty ground and medical personnel rushed to meet the plane and
unload the injured on stretchers to eight ambulances that will
transport most of the patients to the U.S. military hospital in
Landstuhl.
	   An Army helicopter waited nearby to to fly a critically injured
Kenyan, believed to be a U.S. embassy employee, immediately to a
neurosurgical intensive care unit at the University Medical Center
in Homburg, 30 kilometers (20 miles away).
	   Flags at the base 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of
Frankfurt flew at half-mast. U.S. Charge d'Affaires Michael Polt
also was on hand to meet the plane, standing in for vacationing
U.S. Ambassador John Kornblum.
	   Base commanders could not immediately confirm the nationalities
of those on board, but it was previously reported that 10 Americans
and five Kenyans were being flown to Germany for treatment.
	   The C-141, tasked for the mission because it can make the 9-hour
long journey without a refueling stop, will be loaded with
additional medical supplies, including surgical packets and tubing,
for a return flight to Nairobi later Sunday.
	   The cargo plane was scheduled to return to Ramstein on Monday
with less critically injured patients, said hospital commander Col.
Lawrence R. Whitehurst
	   Another plane carrying U.S. State Department and FBI
investigators, along with medical supplies, departed Ramstein
overnight Saturday for Kenya, base officials said.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Torrential rains were weakening Sunday
after a four-day deluge that left more than 230 people dead or
missing in South Korea, mostly in Seoul and surrounding areas.
	   The latest casualties were seven people, including a U.S. Army
soldier, killed in central coastal regions Sunday as the rain
fronts moved south.
	   The sun came out over Seoul for the first time in four days
Sunday after the worst rains to hit the capital in nearly 80 years.
The rains were expected to taper off elsewhere in South Korea on
Monday, weather officials said.
	   The death toll from this week's storms reached 165, including 10
South Korean and three U.S. Army soldiers. Another 69 people, all
South Koreans, were listed as missing and presumed dead.
	   More than 82,000 people were driven from their homes, and
property damage was estimated at up to dlrs 2 billion.
	   At Suwon air base south of Seoul, an American soldier died after
apparently falling into a flooded ditch shortly after midnight, the
U.S. military command said in a news release.
	   It said the floodwaters foiled attempts to rescue the soldier,
whose name was not immediately released. The soldier was from the
1-43rd Air Defense Artillery Battalion assigned to the air base.
	   In a separate news release, the command identified two U.S. Army
soldiers killed Saturday as Staff Sgt. Jennifer T. Warner, 35, of
Tullahoma, Tennessee, and Specialist Thomas D. Patterson, 27, of
Indianapolis, Indiana.
	   The two, assigned to the 304th Signal Battalion of the 8th
Army's 1st Signal Brigade, died when a mud-slide hit their unit's
field site near Myundae Mountain south of Seoul, it said.
	   In Tangjin, 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Seoul, where
up to 32 centimeters (12.5 inches) fell overnight, six South Korean
civilians were killed in two different mud-slides, government
officials said.
	   Lightning killed two others in the nearby village of Taean, they
said.
	   In what local media called ``guerrilla-style rain storms''
because of their unpredictability, most of the deaths and property
damage were reported in Seoul and its surrounding areas, where
nearly half of South Korea's 44 million people live.
	   Wide parts of Seoul, a city of 12 million, remained flooded
Sunday after receiving more than 1 meter (39.3 inches) of rain in
the past four days. On Saturday, 33.2 centimeters (13 inches) fell
in Seoul, the most to fall in one day since Aug. 2, 1920, weather
reports said.
	   Millions of people in Seoul's low-lying areas stayed at their
homes or makeshift shelters overnight, keeping an uneasy vigil on
the Han River and its tributaries, which government officials
warned could overflow if more rain falls.
	   But the rains over upper South Korea eased after midnight
Saturday. Bright sun rays peeked through overcast Seoul skies
Sunday afternoon.
	   Weather officials lifted storm warnings in effect for much of
South Korea since Wednesday.
	   Three national television networks that had continued
weather-related broadcasts non-stop for the past three days
returned to normal programming Sunday morning, saying that ``the
worst appears to be over.''
	   In areas near communist North Korea, U.S. and South Korean
soldiers, using mine-detectors and metal sticks, were combing
valleys and stream beds in search of 10 tons of artillery shells
and 200 anti-personnel land mines swept away in mud-slides and
floods.
	   The deluge was brought by the same storm system that a week
earlier sent flash floods raging down mountain valleys at the
southern tip of the Korean Peninsula, killing 67 campers and
leaving 29 missing and feared dead.

French painting taken in brazen robbery

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ A painting valued at up to U.S.
dlrs 1 million was stolen by a man armed with a shotgun in a daring
robbery Sunday at the Auckland Art Gallery.
	   Police suspect the four-minute heist of one of New Zealand's
most expensive and popular European works was a well-executed hit
by a professional who will sell it overseas.
	   Interpol has been notified of the theft of the 19th century
painting, ``Still on Top,'' by French-born artist Jacques-Joseph
(James) Tissot.
	   Sunday night, police were screening security surveillance film
of the man, clad in black, including a motorcycle helmet, dark
visor and gloves, who burst through the main door with a sawed-off
shotgun and a crowbar late Sunday morning.
	   Museum official Kate Darrow said the man ran through the Grey
Gallery waving a firearm and yelling ``get down,'' and ``keep
back'' to staff and patrons.
	   She said the man appeared to know where he was going and went to
the Lower Wellesley Gallery, where the painting was displayed.
	   ``It all happened very quickly,'' another witness said. ``The
guy in the helmet pushed the gun into a guard's ribs. I thought the
poor guy (guard) was going to faint because he looked helpless and
out of breath.''
	   The gunman grabbed the painting off the wall and dropped it on
the ground, perhaps as a mistake or to smash the glass and gilt
frame. He then used the crowbar to remove the canvas from the frame
and take it off the backing board.
	   The robber left through the main entrance and skirted behind the
gallery into Albert Park, pursued by a member of the public.
	   Police Detective Sgt. Carolyn Butcher said the offender turned
around to fire a warning shot into the air. He sprinted through
Albert Park with the canvas under his arm, and is believed to have
climbed on a motorcycle and escaped via a nearby highway.

	   TRABZON, Turkey (AP) _ Floods caused by torrential rains along
the eastern Black Sea coast killed seven people and collapsed
scores of houses, the semi-official Anatolia news agency said
Sunday.
	   The worst hit area in Saturday's flooding was the village of
Beskoy, where some 50 one-story houses, a mosque and a school
collapsed.
	   The houses were evacuated when the water began to rise.
	   Trabzon is 750 kilometers (470 miles) northeast of Ankara, the
capital.

Palestinian legislators approve Arafat's Cabinet

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian legislators approved
Yasser Arafat's new Cabinet on Sunday, despite criticism that the
Palestinian leader has done nothing to address charges of
widespread government corruption.
	   The legislative council, which is dominated by Arafat's Fatah
faction, approved the Cabinet by a vote of 55-28. There were three
abstentions. The new ministers were to be sworn in Sunday night at
a ceremony in the Gaza Strip.
	   Arafat announced the new Cabinet last week, a year after
legislators demanded the old one be dissolved due to corruption.
But the roster left in place most of the former ministers _
including those accused of corruption _ and added 10 others.
	   Two ministers _ Hanan Ashrawi and Abdel Jawad Saleh _ quit last
week in protest.
	   Ashrawi, one of the most prominent Palestinian political
figures, urged her fellow legislators to vote down the new Cabinet,
saying Saturday, ``We have to respect ourselves. We have to make
tough decisions.''
	   Some of Arafat's usual critics, like Bethlehem legislator Salah
Tamari, were apparently coopted by being given places in the new
Cabinet.
	   Palestinian political analyst Ghassan Khatib said the
legislators' approval of the same ministers they had declared
corrupt a year ago would undermine the credibility of the council.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ As the death toll in the terrorist bombing
of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya rose to 190, an Israeli search team
Sunday morning rescued a mother and her son from an upper floor in
a nearby 22-story building.
	   Using a 150-ton crane, drills and blowtorches, another Israeli
team was trying to free a woman named Rose trapped in a collapsed
building adjacent to the embassy.
	   While rescue efforts were stepped up, U.S. and Kenyan
investigators continued searching for clues to Friday's bombing.
The U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania was also destroyed by a
simultaneous terrorist bomb.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian legislators approved
Yasser Arafat's new Cabinet by a wide margin on Sunday, despite
criticism that the Palestinian leader has done nothing to address
charges of widespread government corruption.
	   The legislative council, which is dominated by Arafat's Fatah
faction, approved the Cabinet by a vote of 55-28 with three
abstentions. The new ministers were to be sworn in at a ceremony
Sunday night in the Gaza Strip.
	   Arafat announced the new Cabinet last week, a year after
legislators demanded the old one be dissolved because of
corruption. But the roster left in place most of the former
ministers _ including those accused of corruption _ and added 10
others.
	   Two ministers _ Hanan Ashrawi and Abdel Jawad Saleh _ quit last
week in protest.
	   Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian political leader, said Sunday
that the substantial vote against the new Cabinet was ``a warning
signal ... that this government has to face the serious
expectations of the people.''
	   Husam Khader, a Fatah legislator who voted against the Cabinet,
said the council, ``by giving a vote of confidence to this
government, has legalized corruption.''
	   The council demanded last year that Arafat dissolve the Cabinet
after a legislative committee report found extensive abuses in all
government ministries and recommended that three ministers _
Planning Minister Nabil Shaath, Civil Affairs Minister Jamil
Tarifi, and Transportation Minister Ali Qawasmeh _ be put on trial.
The three ministers, who denied any wrongdoing, all retained their
jobs in the new Cabinet.
	   The committee report followed a government audit that found
nearly half the Palestinian Authority's dlrs 800 million annual
budget had been squandered through corruption and mismanagement.
	   Despite repeated promises, Arafat put off any action until the
legislative council threatened in recent months to hold a vote of
no-confidence in his government.
	   Some of Arafat's usual critics, like Bethlehem legislator Salah
Tamari, were apparently coopted by being given seats in the new
Cabinet.
	   Palestinian political analyst Ghassan Khatib said the
legislators approval of the same ministers they had declared
corrupt a year ago would further undermine the credibility of the
council, which has struggled to be taken seriously and play a real
part in governing the Palestinian territories.

Fire scorches forest in northern Morocco
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TANGIERS, Morocco (AP) _ More than 500 people on Sunday were
fighting a forest fire on the outskirts of this northern city, and
authorities said they suspected arson.
	   The fire broke out on Saturday, and had extended over 250
hectares (617.5 acres) of forest containing conifer, eucalyptus and
pine trees, authorities said.
	   Firemen and armed forces from several cities, as well as many
local volunteers, were helping fight the fire.
	   Tijani Kasmi, governor of the nearby town of Beni Makada, said
he suspected arson after having spoken to local residents.
	   The forest, on the northern edge of the city, is a popular
weekend hangout for locals.
	   There was no sign Sunday of the fire ceasing.
	   ``The wind, the difficult access and the density of undergrowth
after a very rainy winter are hampering our operations,'' said
Moulay Hassan Taleb, head of the Tangiers Civil Protection Group.

	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Jazz singer Nina Simone shook her hips
and shoulders and brought the audience to its feet in a performance
amid the ancient ruins of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon.
	   ``We love you Nina!'' many in the crowd shouted.
	   ``Is that a marriage proposal?'' the 65-year-old American
jokingly replied during her show Saturday night.
	   This is the first year Americans returned to the Baalbek
International Festival since 1974. Jazz pianist Herbie Hancock
performed earlier, and American conductor Carl St. Claire appeared
with the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra.
	   Lebanon was off-limits to Americans from 1987 until last year on
U.S. government orders because of kidnappings of Americans and
other foreigners. Baalbek was a stronghold of the Shiite Muslim
radicals blamed for the abductions.
	   Simone made it an American evening with such favorites as ``My
Way'' and ``I Love You Porgy,'' and adlibbed lyrics about Martin
Luther King Jr. and even President Clinton.
	   The sold-out crowd of an estimated 4,000 _ young and old _ rose
to its feet and cheered when Simone sang ``My Baby Just Cares for
Me.''
	   Simone was sometimes aided walking on stage under the towering
floodlit columns of Baalbek's Jupiter Temple. But she got quickly
into the mood, shaking her hips and shoulders to the music of her
four-man band.
	   ``It was great. The ambiance, thousands of years of history, the
music, the people...,'' said Randa Haddad, an ophthalmologist at
American University Hospital who like hundreds came on a two-hour
bus ride from Beirut.
	   Others complained the show was too short. Simone, appearing
tired, sang and played piano for about 80 minutes.
	   Many Americans and other international stars played Baalbek
before the festival was halted by the 1975-90 civil war. It resumed
last year and has 14 nights of performances this year between July
24 and Aug. 29.
	   Brendan Stafford, a Briton who came to Baalbek for the first
time especially for Simone, said he was not worried about his
safety in the one-time den of kidnappers.
	   ``I was curious more than worried,'' he said.

Indonesian riot investigation team to question Suharto son-in-law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A government-appointed team
investigating riots that left 1,200 people dead in May plans to
question senior military officers already under scrutiny in the
kidnapping of pro-democracy activists.
	   Critics have accused the government and military of doing little
to stop the violence, which included widespread rape.
	   Rights activist Marzuki Darusman, who heads the fact-finding
team, was quoted Sunday by the newspaper Merdeka as saying his team
would coordinate with a military Officer Honor Council formed to
investigate the kidnappings.
	   ``It is most possible that we will directly question those being
interrogated'' by the council, said Marzuki, who also is vice
chairman of the National Commission on Human Rights.
	   Three army officers, including Lt. Gen. Prabowo, a son-in-law of
former President Suharto, are being investigated in connection with
the kidnappings of political activists.
	   Prabowo was in charge of Indonesia's special forces, which have
been implicated in the abduction of at least 23 government
opponents since last year. Of those, 14 are still missing.
	   The other two officers are Prabowo's successor, Maj. Gen. Muchdi
Purwopranjono, and Col. Chairawan, a former chief of intelligence
of the elite force, named Kopassus.
	   Army Chief of Staff. Gen. Subagyo Hadisiswoyo, who heads the
military investigating team, has said preliminary results showed
Prabowo, 46, bore the greatest responsibility in the abductions.
	   The riots in May shocked Indonesians and foreign investors
alike, and helped force Suharto to step down as president, ending
32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Thousands of homes and buildings, mostly owned by ethnic
Chinese, were looted, ransacked and burned. Rock-throwing mobs
smashed windows and destroyed cars.
	   Late last month, new President B.J. Habibie set up 19-member
fact-finding team to investigate the May 13-14 riots. Its members
include senior army and police generals, bureaucrats, human rights
activists and members of several private organizations.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two hijackers seized a Russian passenger plane as
it was approaching Moscow on Sunday and threatened to blow up the
jet if they did not receive 621,000 rubles (dlrs 100,000),
officials said.
	   The unidentified men commandeered the TU-154 jet carrying 97
passengers as it headed to Moscow's Domodedovo Airport from the
Siberian city of Tymen, according to security officials.
	   The hijackers, who first announced their demands in a written
note to the crew, wanted the money as well as a flight to another
country, which was not specified, the officials added.
	   After the plane landed, the women and children were allowed off,
but the male passengers remained on board, said Alexander Sopov,
chief of security at the airport.
	   Security officials at the airport used the plane's crew as
intermediaries in negotiations with the hijackers, Sopov said. He
dismissed previous reports that a security agent had been allowed
on board to handle the talks.
	   Earlier, Sergei Matyugin, a spokesman for the Federal Security
Service, said all the passengers and crew had been removed from the
plane.
	   The conflicting accounts could not immediately be reconciled.
	   Security agents arrived at the scene shortly after the
hijacking, but the airport continued to handle regular air traffic
while the hijacked plane sat on the tarmac, officials said.
	   Russia's last hijacking took place in December, when a man
claiming to be wired with explosives commandeered a plane traveling
to Moscow from the eastern city of Magadan. He was captured shortly
after the plane landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1 airport.
	   Since the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, airport security has
deteriorated, particularly at regional airports. There have been a
number of hijackings on domestic flights, but in most cases the
hijacker has surrendered following negotiations with authorities.

	   In Nairobi, rescue efforts had focused on the badly damaged
embassy building and the adjacent Ufundi Cooperative building which
collapsed, not the 22-story Cooperative Bank of Kenya building
which although badly damaged remained standing.
	   On Sunday morning, an Israeli team searched the Cooperative Bank
building and discovered a woman and her son, who is about 12 years
old, in the caretaker's apartment on the 17th floor.
	   ``They were caught in the blast. There was a lot of rubble
around and they were basically scared. They were afraid of going
down the stairs which are filled with rubble. The Israeli workers
heard noises and found these people,'' said John Sparrow of the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   ``We've heard there may be up to 10 people in the building.
We're not sure of their condition,'' he told The Associated Press.

Serbs try to wrap up offensive; KLA ponders talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces tried to wrap up a heavy
offensive against ethnic Albanian fighters Sunday, closing in on a
mountain stronghold, while one rebel faction signaled its readiness
for talks and others kept up resistance.
	   After overrunning several villages used where KLA fighters were
based, the Serbs appeared to turn their sights next to Junik, high
in the mountains near the border between the secessionist Serbian
province and Albania.
	   In a sign of continuing rebel resistance, the pro-Serb Media
Center said Sunday that ethnic Albanian guerrillas had attacked
several Serb houses and a police checkpoint overnight, but there
were no injuries.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, a Rugova-allied politician said
Saturday that a moderate KLA faction had agreed in principle to
enter an alliance with ethnic Albanian politicians in Kosovo, led
by Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Ilaz Ramajli told The Associated Press that the KLA had not yet
announced its final decision, ``but they are examining all the
proposes made to them in a positive way.''
	   It is impossible to pin down who, if anyone, has the authority
to speak for the entire KLA. Others in the rebel army still either
oppose the pacifist Rugova as the chief representative of all
ethnic Albanians in negotiations, or reject the notion of talks
with Serbia altogether.
	   Nonetheless, a Western diplomat said Ramajli's statement showed
that painstaking, U.S.-led diplomacy toward starting talks was
again moving forward.
	   The West has sent signals to the ethnic Albanians in recent days
that a NATO offensive against the Serbs is not imminent _
apparently hoping to force the KLA to the negotiating table in a
bid to end the conflict.
	   On Friday and Saturday, diplomats handed both sides a proposal
outlining models for how autonomy might work in predominantly
Albanian Kosovo, which enjoyed autonomy until Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic revoked it in 1989.
	   Milosevic has indicated he would be willing to restore Kosovo's
autonomy, wich many ethnic Albanian politicians have said they
would accept autonomy as a first step to independence. The biggest
stumbling block to negotiations has been the KLA, which has
insisted only on outright independence.
	   The blueprint was drafted by the so-called Balkan Contact Group
of six international powers _ Britain, Germany, France, Italy, the
United States and Russia _ which has been trying to secure a
political solution for Kosovo since fighting between Serb forces
and the KLA escalated in March.
	   ``We hope that both parties will find ideas in this paper
helpful to them when they sit down to negotiate, which we believe
they must,'' said Brian Donnelly, the British ambassador to
Yugoslavia, who presented the paper to both sides.
	   Yugoslav officials called the proposal a positive step.
	   While the recent Serb offensive against the rebels has been
winding down, Serb forces on Saturday continued attacks on villages
in the Drenica region, a hotbed of ethnic Albanian nationalism.
	   Tens of thousands of people have been driven from their homes in
the past two weeks.

Palestinian legislators approve Arafat's Cabinet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Ashrawi, other legislators,
background on corruption charges. &QL; 
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Legislators approved Yasser Arafat's
new Cabinet by a wide margin on Sunday, despite criticism that the
Palestinian leader has done nothing to address charges of
widespread government corruption.
	   The legislative council, which is dominated by Arafat's Fatah
faction, approved the Cabinet by a vote of 55-28 with three
abstentions. The new ministers were to be sworn in at a ceremony
Sunday night in the Gaza Strip.
	   Arafat announced the new Cabinet last week, a year after
legislators demanded the old one be dissolved because of
corruption. But the roster left in place most of the former
ministers _ including those accused of corruption _ and added 10
others.
	   Two ministers _ Hanan Ashrawi and Abdel Jawad Saleh _ quit last
week in protest.
	   Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian political leader, said Sunday
that the substantial vote against the new Cabinet was ``a warning
signal ... that this government has to face the serious
expectations of the people.''
	   Husam Khader, a Fatah legislator who voted against the Cabinet,
said the council, ``by giving a vote of confidence to this
government, has legalized corruption.''
	   The council demanded last year that Arafat dissolve the Cabinet
after a legislative committee report found extensive abuses in all
government ministries and recommended that three ministers _
Planning Minister Nabil Shaath, Civil Affairs Minister Jamil
Tarifi, and Transportation Minister Ali Qawasmeh _ be put on trial.
The three ministers, who denied any wrongdoing, all retained their
jobs in the new Cabinet.
	   The committee report followed a government audit that found
nearly half the Palestinian Authority's dlrs 800 million annual
budget had been squandered through corruption and mismanagement.
	   Despite repeated promises, Arafat put off any action until the
legislative council threatened in recent months to hold a vote of
no-confidence in his government.
	   Some of Arafat's usual critics, like Bethlehem legislator Salah
Tamari, were apparently coopted by being given seats in the new
Cabinet.
	   Palestinian political analyst Ghassan Khatib said the
legislators approval of the same ministers they had declared
corrupt a year ago would further undermine the credibility of the
council, which has struggled to be taken seriously and play a real
part in governing the Palestinian territories.

Son of club owner escapes unhurt from gangland shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) - Gang warfare flared up again when two
gunmen tried to kill the son of a gambling club owner before dawn
Sunday, nine days after a member of a rival family was shot to
death.
	   Loucas Fanieros, 31, escaped unhurt when his car was sprayed
with bullets, said a police statement. Police had warned of a
possible attack on the Fanieros clan after Andros Aeroporos, 32,
was shot dead July 31.
	   He was killed a month after he and two of his brothers were
acquitted for the attempted murder of Loucas Fanieros' father,
Antonis, who was shot and seriously wounded as he left his club a
year earlier.
	   Gang shootings have killed or wounded 16 people in Cyprus in the
past three years. The island, known for its tourist business, bills
itself as the ``Island of Love'' from the legend that the Greek
fertility goddess Aphrodite was born in the sea off Cyprus.
	   Earlier this week, Justice and Police Minister Nicos Koshis
complained about gangs ``battling for domination and control of
cabaret prostitution, gambling and drug smuggling.''
	   He has said that gang leaders make as much as dlrs 2 million a
month by exploiting some 2,000 Russian and Eastern European
prostitutes working in the island's 100 cabarets.
	   Koshis recently said he was considering creating an anti-crime
squad of police ``untouchables.'' But he later questioned the idea,
saying police ``may be untouchables to start with, but given that
everyone has his price, will they remain above corruption?''

Singapore observes national day amid tension and gloom
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore observed its national day Sunday amid
heightened tensions with two of its neighbors and growing gloom
over the economy.
	   The Southeast Asian city-state tried to shrug off the glut of
bad news with a parade, fireworks and mass displays reminding its
populace of hardships overcome.
	   Singapore has progressed from a relatively poor backwater to a
world class financial and manufacturing center in three decades.
Its corruption-free governance and modern infrastructure are
frequently rated among the highest in world competitiveness
surveys.
	   But relations have soured yet again with Malaysia, 33 years
after Singapore gained independence when it was expelled from the
Malaysian Federation because of irreconcilable political
differences and racial tensions.
	   The two countries have bickered for years over a number of
unresolved issues, including the sale of water, a disputed island,
and land owned by Malaysia within the island republic.
	   The latest irritant was Singapore's recent relocation of an
immigration and customs checkpoint, with accusations of bad faith
from both sides of the border.
	   ``We are not in the wrong. We are not being difficult. These are
things which happen in our relations with neighbors from time to
time. It cannot be helped,'' Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong was quoted by state-run television as saying Sunday.
	   In the island republic's other large neighbor, Indonesia,
President B.J. Habibie told a newspaper last week that prosperous
Singapore has not done enough to help his nation cope with its
worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   ``You see, a friend in need is a friend indeed,'' Habibie said.
``I don't have that feeling from Singapore.''
	   The two countries also have been unable to finalize a trade
financing scheme proposed by Singapore late last year, in which
dlrs 3 billion would guarantee payments for key imports into the
country.
	   Officials close to Habibie say he was hurt by comments from
Singapore patriarch Lee Kuan Yew in February suggesting that
then-President Suharto's selection of Habibie as vice president had
shaken regional markets.
	   Meanwhile, Singapore's economy is being dragged down by the
Asian crisis.
	   ``The challenges that we face today are the most formidable
since independence in 1965,'' Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said
Saturday.
	   Layoffs have reached record levels, and are expected to rise
further. Unemployment, bankruptcies and business closures are up as
salaries and profits begin to plummet.
	   Property values and the stock market have fallen sharply in the
past year, and are likely to remain weak in the medium term.
	   The government has forecast slight growth for 1998, though many
private economists predict outright recession. Even Goh has
conceded that the normally buoyant Singapore economy will likely
contract next year.
	   Workers who have suffered salary cuts or lost jobs, or who fear
unemployment, are increasingly seeking help from psychiatrists and
counselors, according to The Sunday Times.
	   A number of psychiatrists interviewed by the newspaper said they
are counseling more patients who have been laid off or who are in
financial difficulties.

Bosnian Croats expel Muslim refugees from Bosnian village
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Angry Bosnian Croats
expelled a group of Muslim refugees who had just returned to their
village in central Bosnia, local media and officials said Sunday.
	   The incident was a blow to international officials who are
trying to speed up the return of refugees driven from their homes
in the Bosnian war.
	   The weekend tension began Friday night, when a group of Bosnian
Croats surrounded the village of Gacice, where 47 Muslim refugees
recently returned to their pre-war homes.
	   NATO officials said soldiers of the NATO-led peace force already
were present around the village, 65 kilometers (40 miles) northwest
of Sarajevo, in case the situation got out of control.
	   After local officials failed to disperse the crowd, Muslims were
forced to leave their village for the second time Saturday
afternoon. Initially, they fled Gacice from Bosnian Croat forces
during the war in 1993.
	   Responding to the incident, another group of Muslims who were
also supposed to return to Gacice in the next few days blocked a
local road Saturday between Vitez and Zenica.
	   The Sarajevo daily ``Dnevni Avaz'' reported that several local
journalists and local officials were assaulted by the Croat crowd.
No serious injuries were reported.
	   The newspaper also said local radio stations in the nearby
Croat-held town of Vitez were calling on veterans and war widows to
join the crowd to try to prevent the return of Muslims.
	   Several thousand Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims have returned
to their homes since the end of the war in 1995, but some two
million remain displaced within Bosnia and across Europe.
	   Western diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, believe
the incident _ like similar ones over the past three years _ was
instigated by local hard-line officials who oppose the Dayton peace
accord and the return of refugees.

Pontiff decries terror bombings, violence elsewhere in world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Sunday
decried the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and lamented war and
other suffering in troublespots around the world.
	   The two bombings, the pope said, rendered ``ever more precarious
security on the African continent.''
	   In condolence telegrams sent Saturday, John Paul said he hoped
the violence would prompt the international community to
``cooperate and double efforts aimed at building a world of peace
and justice in which such offenses to life and to the dignity of
man find no place.''
	   Addressing tourists and pilgrims at his summer residence outside
Rome, the pope said the season's relaxation ``shouldn't make us
forget the fate of many populations which suffer hard trials and
see their present and future threatened.''
	   The pope denounced as ``injustifiable massacres'' the latest
violence in Rwanda and Guinea-Bissau involving army forces and
rebels, and noted that in Congo, ``weapons have again begun to
speak.''
	   John Paul also recalled those suffering in Sudan, where famine
looms in the south, theater of war between rebels and the military
for 15 years.
	   Turning his attention to Asia, John Paul expressed dismay that
the people of Myanmar ``still haven't seen realized their own
aspirations for democracy'' and noted there was hope that dialogue
and negotiations might lead to a solution for East Timor, the
disputed territory where Indonesia pulled out 600 combat troops on
Saturday.
	   Closer to home, the pope recalled those caught up in the clashes
between ethnic Albanian rebels and Serb forces in Kosovo.
	   John Paul also remembered the victims of flooding in China,
Bangladesh and South Korea.

Serbs try to wrap up offensive; KLA ponders talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces tried to wrap up a heavy
offensive against ethnic Albanian fighters on Sunday, closing in on
a mountain stronghold, while one rebel faction signaled its
readiness for talks and others kept up resistance.
	   After overrunning several villages used where Kosovo Liberation
Army rebels were based, the Serbs appeared to turn their sights
next to Junik, high in the mountains near the border between the
secessionist Serbian province and Albania.
	   In a sign of continuing rebel resistance, the pro-Serb Media
Center said Sunday that ethnic Albanian guerrillas had attacked
several Serb houses and a police checkpoint overnight, but there
were no injuries.
	   The West has sent signals to the ethnic Albanians in recent days
that a NATO offensive against the Serbs is not imminent _
apparently hoping to force the militant KLA to the negotiating
table in a bid to end the conflict.
	   On Friday and Saturday, diplomats handed both sides a proposal
outlining models for how autonomy might work in predominantly
Albanian Kosovo, which enjoyed autonomy until Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic revoked it in 1989.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, one politician said Sunday that
a moderate KLA faction had agreed in principle to enter an alliance
with ethnic Albanian politicians in Kosovo, led by Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Ilaz Ramajli, who is allied with Rogova, told The Associated
Press that the KLA had not yet announced its final decision, ``but
they are examining all the proposes made to them in a positive
way.''
	   It is impossible to pin down who, if anyone, has the authority
to speak for the entire KLA. Others in the rebel army still either
oppose the pacifist Rugova as the chief representative of all
ethnic Albanians in negotiations, or reject the notion of talks
with Serbia.
	   Nonetheless, a Western diplomat said Ramajli's statement showed
that painstaking, U.S.-led diplomacy toward starting talks was
again moving forward.
	   Milosevic has indicated he would be willing to restore Kosovo's
autonomy, which many ethnic Albanian politicians have said they
would accept as a first step to independence. The biggest stumbling
block to negotiations has been the KLA, which has insisted only on
outright independence.
	   The blueprint was drafted by the so-called Balkan Contact Group
of six international powers _ Britain, Germany, France, Italy, the
United States and Russia _ which has been trying to secure a
political solution for Kosovo since fighting between Serb forces
and the KLA escalated in March.
	   ``We hope that both parties will find ideas in this paper
helpful to them when they sit down to negotiate, which we believe
they must,'' said Brian Donnelly, the British ambassador to
Yugoslavia, who presented the paper to both sides.
	   Yugoslav officials called the proposal a positive step.
	   While the recent Serb offensive against the rebels has been
winding down, Serb forces on Saturday continued attacks on villages
in the Drenica region, a hotbed of ethnic Albanian nationalism.
	   Tens of thousands of people have been driven from their homes in
the past two weeks.

Netanyahu offers Israeli help investigating embassy bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered
Israel's help Sunday in tracking down the terrorists who bombed
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Netanyahu said early indications were that the bombings were the
result of ``international terrorism centered on Islamic
fundamentalism.''
	   Israeli army teams were leading search-and-rescue efforts in
Nairobi, and Netanyahu said he had been warmly thanked by telephone
by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and U.S. President Clinton.
	   ``We are prepared to help not only in rescue operations, but
also in international efforts _ in the intelligence field and
others _ to fight this terrorism, which we have faced for many
years,'' Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem.
	   ``Today, perhaps in light of the attack in Kenya, it is
understood how essential a broad international front is.''
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that exiled Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden, who lives in
Afghanistan, was one of the main suspects in the bombings, and that
Egyptian elements connected to him may also have been involved.
	   Bin Laden has threatened a holy war against U.S. troops in his
homeland and Americans elsewhere overseas, and is suspected of
backing terrorist acts around the world.
	   The official would not confirm whether Israeli intelligence
officials had been sent to join the investigation.

Havel getting better, another week in intensive care ahead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel's condition
improved Sunday, but doctors said the hospitalized Czech leader may
remain in intensive care for another week.
	   Havel's personal physician, Ilja Kotik, said the 61-year-old
president is still breathing with the occasional aid of a
respirator.
	   ``The president is without fever and feels good,'' Kotik said,
noting that the pneumonia is further receding due to a new type of
antibiotics introduced last week.
	   Havel's wife, Dagmar, said he is watching movies and reading
newspapers, and communicates through written notes.
	   ``I hope we will be able to go out for a little walk, soon,''
she said.
	   But doctors cautioned that Havel is not out of trouble yet.
	   ``The (laboratory) findings we have are not normal yet,'' said
Kotik, pointing to lung X-rays and blood tests. ``There is still
time before we celebrate victory.''
	   In April, the Czech leader suffered a ruptured colon while
vacationing in the Austrian Alps and underwent an emergency
colostomy, an operation in which doctors form an artificial opening
in the colon for expelling waste.
	   On July 26, a combined Austrian-Czech team of doctors in Prague
closed the colostomy. Havel developed pneumonia last Monday related
to the operation.
	   After all of Havel's previous operations, breathing problems and
infections hindered the president's recovery.
	   Havel has been hospitalized five times since December 1996 when
a third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.
	   The Czech presidency is a largely ceremonial position, so while
Havel is hospitalized there is no need for his powers to be
transferred to someone else.

Bosnian Croats expel Muslim refugees from Bosnian village
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Angry Bosnian Croats
expelled a group of Muslim refugees who had just returned to their
village in central Bosnia, local media and officials said Sunday.
	   The incident was a blow to international officials who are
trying to speed up the return of refugees driven from their homes
in the Bosnian war.
	   The weekend tension began Friday night, when a group of Bosnian
Croats surrounded the village of Gacice, where 47 Muslim refugees
recently returned to their prewar homes.
	   NATO officials said soldiers of the NATO-led peace force already
were present around the village, 65 kilometers (40 miles) northwest
of Sarajevo, in case the situation got out of control.
	   After local officials failed to disperse the crowd, Muslims were
forced to leave their village Saturday afternoon for the second
time. Initially, they fled Gacice from Bosnian Croat forces during
the war in 1993.
	   Responding to the incident, another group of Muslims who were
also supposed to return to Gacice in the next few days blocked a
local road Saturday between Vitez and Zenica.
	   The Sarajevo daily ``Dnevni Avaz'' reported that several local
journalists and local officials were assaulted by the Croat crowd.
No serious injuries were reported.
	   The newspaper also said local radio stations in the nearby
Croat-held town of Vitez were calling on veterans and war widows to
join the crowd to try to prevent the return of Muslims.
	   Several thousand Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims have returned
to their homes since the end of the war in 1995, but some two
million remain displaced within Bosnia and across Europe.
	   Western diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, believe
the incident _ like similar ones over the past three years _ was
instigated by local hard-line officials who oppose the Dayton peace
accord and the return of refugees.

bandaged eyes escorted by two nurses.
	   An Army helicopter waited nearby to fly a critically injured
Kenyan, believed to be a U.S. embassy employee, immediately to a
neurosurgical intensive care unit at the University Medical Center
in Homburg, 30 kilometers (20 miles away).
	   Lt. Col. Russ Turner, chief medical officer on board, said the
patients endured the 9-hour journey from Nairobi quietly. The
injuries were typical of a bombing attack, he said, including eye
injuries and broken bones.
	   ``Everyone did quite well,'' Turner said. ``They are very
seriously, seriously injured, traumatized mentally as well as
physically.''
	   Flags at the base 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of
Frankfurt flew at half-mast. U.S. Charge d'Affaires Michael Polt
also was on hand to meet the plane, standing in for vacationing
U.S. Ambassador John Kornblum.
	   The C-141, tasked for the mission because it can make the long
journey without a refueling stop, will be loaded with additional
medical supplies, including surgical packets and tubing, for a
return flight to Nairobi later Sunday.
	   The cargo plane was scheduled to return to Ramstein on Monday
with less critically injured patients, said hospital commander Col.
Lawrence R. Whitehurst
	   Another plane carrying U.S. State Department and FBI
investigators, along with medical supplies, departed Ramstein
overnight Saturday for Kenya, base officials said.

Guinea-Bissau maintains cease-fire and new talks set
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's government and a rebel
military faction have agreed to extend their 2-week cease-fire, and
scheduled another round of talks, news agencies reported Sunday.
	   The next round of talks to resolve the two-month-old conflict in
the West African nation were scheduled for Aug. 18 and 19, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   Delegations from President Joao Bernardo Vieira's government and
the rebel faction loyal to Brig. Ansumane Mane met Saturday.
	   These talks, like those that led to the July 26 cease-fire, took
place on a frigate moored off the coast of the former Portuguese
colony. The next round will be held on the Cape Verde archipelago.
	   Guinea-Bissau's peace negotiations are being brokered by a
delegation from the Committee of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, or
CPLP. The CPLP is made up of Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique,
Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe.
	   Mane attempted a coup in June, after he was dismissed as arms
forces chief for allegedly running arms to Senegalese separatists.
The rebel officers accused President Vieira of rampant corruption
and demanded he step down.
	   Fierce fighting between the renegade soldiers and troops loyal
to Vieira _ the latter supported by reinforcements from Senegal and
the Republic of Guinea _ triggered an exodus from the capital,
Bissau.
	   Relief agencies recently warned of a possible humanitarian
crisis because food and medical aid was not reaching the displaced
population.

Paper says Iraq to accept nothing short of lifting sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will accept nothing short of the
lifting of trade sanctions in its current row with the U.N.
Security Council over weapons inspections, the ruling Baath Party
newspaper al-Thawra said Sunday.
	   ``The council is obliged to deeply understand Iraq's demands ...
(and) accept all of them because they are legal and objective since
it has completely implemented the requirements under (U.N.)
resolution 687,'' the paper said.
	   Under the terms of the resolution, the ban on Iraqi exports
should be lifted once U.N. weapons experts declare that Baghdad has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction and the means to make
such lethal armaments.
	   To demand the end of sanctions, Iraq last Wednesday declared a
freeze on cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspection program. The
Security Council termed that move unacceptable, but urged more
negotiations and suggested it was open to lifting the sanctions.
	   Iraq has not officially reacted to the Security Council's stand
but al-Thawra said Baghdad will turn down offers that fall short of
its demand.
	   ``The council should not think that a piece of cake like the one
given to two angry boys will satisfy Iraq,'' the paper said in an
editorial.
	   The current dispute began when chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler on Monday rejected an Iraqi demand that he state
Iraq had destroyed its dangerous weapons. He said he did not have
the evidence to make that declaration.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of
neighboring Kuwait, include a ban on the free export of Iraq's oil,
its most profitable commodity.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Janet Sullivan said Sunday that U.N. arms
inspections were now restricted to sites subject to ongoing
monitoring, which Iraq had said could continue.
	   She said the United Nations has suspended searches of other
sites by weapons inspectors. In the past, Iraq has blocked such
inspections by failing to provide escorts for the inspectors. The
escorts are required under U.N. agreements with Iraq.

	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Sunday
decried the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and lamented war and
other suffering in troublespots around the world.
	   The two bombings, the pope said, rendered ``ever more precarious
security on the African continent.''
	   In condolence telegrams sent Saturday to the archbishops in the
two stricken African capitals, John Paul denounced the ``heinous
crime'' and ``sinister acts of violence and destruction, and called
on the international community to ``work together and redouble

such offenses to human life and dignity will have no place.''

Netanyahu offers Israeli help investigating embassy bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered
Israel's help Sunday in tracking down the terrorists who bombed
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Netanyahu said early indications were that the bombings were the
result of ``international terrorism centered on Islamic
fundamentalism.''
	   Israeli army teams were leading search-and-rescue efforts in
Nairobi, and Netanyahu said he had been warmly thanked by telephone
by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
	   ``We are prepared to help not only in rescue operations, but
also in international efforts _ in the intelligence field and
others _ to fight this terrorism, which we have faced for many
years,'' Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem.
	   ``Today, perhaps in light of the attack in Kenya, it is
understood how essential a broad international front is.''
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that exiled Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden, who lives in
Afghanistan, was one of the main suspects in the bombings, and that
Egyptian elements connected to him may also have been involved.
	   Bin Laden has threatened a holy war against U.S. troops in his
homeland and Americans elsewhere overseas, and is suspected of
backing terrorist acts around the world.
	   The official would not confirm whether Israeli intelligence
officials had been sent to join the investigation.

Muslims set up new political party in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A group of Muslims set up a new
political party Sunday, saying its main aim would be to fight for
respect of human rights and freedom of religion.
	   About 10,000 people attended the formal launching of the Party
of Justice at Al-Azhar, the second biggest mosque in the capital,
Jakarta.
	   In his inaugural speech, party leader Nur Mahmudi Isma'il
welcomed the armed forces' decision to withdraw some troops from
the predominantly Muslim province of Aceh in northern Sumatra,
where the military has been accused of widespread abuses in
operations against an armed separatist movement.
	   He described the decision as proof of the military's commitment
to respect human rights.
	   The party will urge the government to revoke a regulation that
obliges all social and political organizations to adopt the
official state ideology as their single ideology.
	   It is the 57th new political party formed in Indonesian since
the fall of former President Suharto, who had ruled Indonesia for
32 years with an iron hand, allowing only three parties.
	   Some 40 of the new parties have registered with the Ministry of
Home Affairs to participate in next year's parliamentary elections.
	   Suharto quit in May following widespread violence and protests
against his authoritarian rule. He was replaced by then Vice
President B.J. Habibie, who has promised democratic reforms.

Albania to investigate all Arabs after Africa blasts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ All Arabs in Albania will be investigated
following an allegation that the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania
were linked to arrests in this Balkan country, the Interior
Ministry said Sunday.
	   While declining to confirm a link between Friday's two bombings
and the arrest of Egyptians in Albania last month, the ministry
said any Arabs who have entered the country will soon be
investigated rigorously.
	   A group known as the Islamic Jihad vowed last week to strike
American interests because some of its members were arrested in
Albania, according to a report in Thursday's Al-Hayat, a daily
Arabic language newspaper published in London.
	   All entry points will now come under extra surveillance from the
police and security services, an official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``Some of them might target Albania for operating unlawfully,''
the official said. ``Many Arabs are here as members of Islamic
humanitarian organizations.''

Jiang trip to Japan to proceed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin will visit Japan
this fall as planned amid growing concern over the ripple effects
of Japan's worsening economic crisis, state media reported.
	   Jiang is ``willing to engage in a wide range of contacts with
all walks of life in Japan, including the government and the
public,'' the official Xinhua News Agency quoting him as telling
newly appointed Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura.
	   China is anxious for Japan to prop up the sagging yen and
reverse a dip in its imports that contributed to lower Chinese
economic growth in the first half of the year.
	   Komura briefed Jiang on measures the government of Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi is taking to revive the ailing Japanese
economy, and promised Japan will make ``contributions to easing the
Asian economic difficulty,'' Xinhua said.
	   Japan is China's biggest trading partner and a major source of
investment and development aid. But their relationship is still
haunted by memories of Japan's brutal 1931-1945 occupation of
China, and Jiang reminded Komura that Japanese militarism had
brought ``catastrophes to the Chinese people.''
	   ``It is imperative to summarize both the positive and negative
experiences of Sino-Japanese ties,'' the agency paraphrased Jiang
as saying.
	   Japan has offered apologies to ease lingering animosity in
recent years. In 1995, then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama
expressed ``deep remorse'' and a ``heartfelt apology for the
tremendous damage and sufferings to the Chinese people caused by my
country's colonial rule and aggression.''
	   Obuchi's new Cabinet will ``strictly observe'' the sentiments
expressed by Murayama, Komura said.
	   Jiang had planned a state visit to Japan in the fall to meet
with Obuchi's predecessor Ryutaro Hashimoto. But Hashimoto resigned
abruptly after his governing Liberal Democratic Party suffered a
major setback in parliamentary elections last month.

Taliban pressure foes near Kabul after attack on Mazar-e-Sharif

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Reports of fighting Sunday appeared to
contradict claims by the Taliban that they were in charge of
Mazar-e-Sharif, the last major Afghan city outside the extremist
Islamic militia's undisputed control.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance, meanwhile, was also under pressure
near Kabul in the Panjshir Valley, where ousted military chief
Ahmed Shah Masood has struggled to hold ground since he and
President Burhanuddin Rabbani lost the capital two years ago.
	   Indian-based Afghan Ambassador Masood Khalili, who has remained
loyal to Rabbani, said street fighting was escalating Sunday in
Mazar-e-Sharif, some 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Kabul, a
day after Taliban fighters entered it.
	   Khalili also accused Taliban fighters of killing civilians,
targeting Shiite Muslims in particular. The Taliban, like most
Afghans, adhere to the Sunni sect of Islam.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition was regrouping, Khalili said. ``God
knows what will happen in the next 24 hours.''
	   The coalition's key members are Masood, ethnic Uzbek warlord
Rashid Dostum, and the Shiite Hezb-e-Wahadat militia. Dostum and
Masood were directing the fighting Sunday from Pulkhumri, 200
kilometers (120 miles) southeast of Mazar-e-Sharif, said
Hezb-e-Wahadat spokesman Azizullah Shashaq.
	   Shashaq, speaking by satellite phone from south of
Mazar-e-Sharif in Bamyan province, said coalition forces held the
airport on the eastern edge of Mazar-e-Sharif. He reported fighting
near the airport Sunday, and added he had heard of heavy fighting
to the north, in Kunduz province. Shashaq had no details.
	   The reports of fighting could not be immediately confirmed. But
a fierce defense of Mazar-e-Sharif had been expected. Its loss
would be a severe blow to an opposition backed into a dwindling
corner of northern Afghanistan, and a boost to the Taliban's
four-year-old campaign to impose their strict interpretation of
Islamic rule on all of Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban, whose name means ``students of Islam,'' emerged in
1994, pledging to bring peace to Afghanistan after years of civil
war. In the areas they control, the Taliban have barred girls from
school, confined most women to their homes, forbade all music
except religious songs, and staged frequent public mutilations of
thieves and executions of murderers.
	   After heavy overnight fighting, the Taliban on Sunday had
advanced 15 kilometers (9 miles) along the New Road Pass, 40
kilometers (25 miles) northeast of Kabul. Taliban Commander Haji
Ibrahim said retreating opposition troops left behind the bodies of
five fighters, while 10 of his men were injured in a land mine
explosion.
	   ``We plan to launch a massive attack soon'' on Masood's
stronghold, Ibrahim said.
	   The new Taliban position outside Kabul put them just 20
kilometers (12 miles) from Bagram, a Russian-built air base that is
the biggest in Afghanistan. Masood's forces have been unable to use
the air base because it was within striking distance of Taliban
rockets.
	   An opposition rocket landed on the perimeter of the Taliban-held
Kabul airport Sunday morning. There were no immediate reports of
casualties.
	   In some parts of Afghanistan, the Taliban have bribed military
commanders to surrender or counted on being welcomed by local
residents eager to embrace anyone promising peace or to accept the
Taliban as their ethnic brothers.
	   But Mazar-e-Sharif is inhabited mostly by ethnic Uzbeks and
Tajiks, while the Taliban, like most other Afghans, are Pashtuns.
The Taliban are Sunni, while the Hezb-e-Wahadat militia that calls
Mazar-e-Sharif its stronghold is made up of Shiites. Residents
resented Taliban attempts last year to impose their version of
Islam on Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Last May, the Taliban entered Mazar-e-Sharif at the invitation
of a warlord who had turned on his anti-Taliban allies. The warlord
then turned again _ allegiance-switching has been a hallmark of
Afghanistan's years of civil war _ and the Taliban took heavy
casualties while being driven out.
	   ``Last year, we were invited in. But this time, we burned the
mountains,'' said Taliban spokesman Abdul Manam Niyazi, using an
expression for heavy fighting while speaking Saturday by satellite
phone from Mazar-e-Sharif.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime arrested 18
foreigners Sunday for distributing pamphlets the government said
were aimed at inciting unrest.
	   The arrests came a day after the 10th anniversary of a
nationwide uprising against military rule in Myanmar passed without
unrest anywhere in the country, according to the government.
	   Those arrested included six U.S. citizens, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Philippines nationals and one
Australian, a government official said in a statement faxed to The
Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand.

from the plane after they became convinced that none of them had

	   Authorities had been saying that two hijackers had seized the

	   During the flight, crew members came across a note demanding the
money, plus a flight to another country.

China's state enterprises shed 3.53 million workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's mostly money-losing state enterprises
shed 3.53 million workers over the past year as a government drive
to end their massive drain on the state budget gained steam, media
reported Sunday.
	   State-owned enterprises employed 69.6 million workers as of the
end of June, down from 73.1 million a year earlier, the official
Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The reduction marks a quickening of the drive to either make
state-owned companies profitable or allow them to go bust. China's
leaders pledged themselves to reforming the sector at a Communist
Party conference last year, and have said they will stick to their
commitments even as the Asian economic crisis' impact on the
Chinese economy grows.
	   Those companies are being allowed to sack workers and partially
dismantle the old system that made them responsible for their
employees' housing, education, health care, education and a host of
other welfare needs.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji, the man responsible for seeing through the
reforms, says as many as half of all employees of state enterprises
will lose their jobs during the restructuring.
	   Millions of workers, many in middle age, are being forced on to
government welfare for the unemployed, or into retraining schemes
ranging from computer classes to raising rabbits.
	   A key element of China's socialist economy and society, formerly
cosseted state industries have been a huge strain on government
banks, as well as on each other through non-payment of bills and
bad loans.

Top sprinters to bypass Zurich
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) - The fastest sprinters of the last two
years, world champion Maurice Greene of the United States and Ato
Boldon of Trinidad will bypass the lucrative Weltklasse meet in
Zurich, Switzerland their coach said Sunday.
	   John Smith, who trains both in California, said because of a
dispute over terms that isn't about money, Greene, world champion
in 1997, and Boldon, who beat Olympic champion Donovan Bailey
Saturday night in the Herculis track meet, will not be present at
the Swiss meet.
	   Smith said both Boldon and Greene were headed home to California
Sunday morning. Boldon won the 100 over Bailey in 9.92 seconds
Saturday night. Greene did not run.
	   Boldon has run 9.86 twice this year, and Greene won the world
title last year in 9.86.
	   Bailey's world record of 9.84 was set at the Olympics in 1996
but the Canadian has done only 9.91 and 9.93 over the past two
years.
	   The Zurich meet on Wednesday has always attracted the best
fields because of a high budget and a fast track, which benefits
top performances. Three world records were set last year and a
number of others have been set in other years.
	   Smith doesn't want to put Boldon and Greene head-to-head against
each other every time out, unless the terms are right.
	   Smith blames the dispute on the new format of the Golden League,
which gives a bonus of dlrs 1 million, for athletes to share if
they remain unbeaten in certain events, which includes the men's
100 this year. There are six Golden league meets and the Grand Prix
final in Moscow, Sept. 5.
	   ``Since the inception of the Golden League, it seems that (the
Zurich) meet has changed,'' Smith said. ``We've never had any
problems before.''
	   ``The attitude of sprinters is a little different from others
who dominate their events, like Marion Jones or Bryan Bronson,''
Smith said. ``There is no incentive for the sprinters to go after
the big payment because a wrong blink can lose a race.''
	   Frankie Fredericks, who won the first two Golden league meets in
the 100, came in third behind Boldon and lost out on his chance for
a share of the dlrs 1 million.
	   Smith pointed that as an example.
	   ``Before the meet Fredericks was the one who was undefeated,''
Smith said. ``After the meet things changed.''
	   ``There is a lot of parity now. We look to maximize ourselves at
a different level,'' Smith said.
	   That is to bring together the top field under the right
conditions and avoid having head-to-head clashes every meet.
	   All the top sprinters met at Paris and will probably meet again
in Lausanne, Switzerland Aug. 25.
	   ``There are times when we are able to gather the top gunslingers
together,'' Smith said.

Illegal immigration invades southern Spain during summer time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Thousands of North Africans fleeing poverty
and unemployment have been trying to enter wealthy Europe via Spain
illegally by nightly clandestine sailings from Morocco across the
Strait of Gibraltar.
	   Since January, police have caught more than 7,000 would-be
immigrants, most of whom made the hazardous crossing in packed,
make-shift single-motor boats, Madrid daily El Pais reported
Sunday, citing figures of the Spanish Interior Ministry, which is
responsible for immigration matters.
	   Many of these immigrants are believed to drown each year in the
attempt.
	   On Thursday, the Interior Minister reported 38 Moroccans drowned
a month ago just off the coast of the Spanish enclave of Melilla,
bringing the death toll to 69 in 1998 so far, El Pais reported.
	   The illegal immigrants pay relatively large sums to be taken in
nighttime trips across Strait, which is nine miles (15 kilometers)
at its narrowest. They try to cross especially during the summer
time when weather is mild and the sea is generally safer.
	   This summer, more people appear to be crossing. Last Monday
alone, 57 North Africans were detained in two separate boats and
another 26 were found hidden in an Italian truck traveling toward
the French border.
	   Those caught are sent home. But hundreds more make the crossing
undetected and go on to northern Europe where they seek jobs at its
industrial centers.
	   Although Spain is an easy destiny, El Pais reported officials
say more police control in the southern coast have forced North
Africans to take their chances through Italy's porous sea coast,
where authorities have caught more than 3,000 would-be immigrants
in July alone.

Donald and Pollock rip through England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Darren Gough, playing at his county's own
headquarters, inspired England's push for victory Sunday after a
sensational collapse had left South Africa 219 runs to win the
fifth and final cricket test.
	   After fast bowlers Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock had taken five
wickets each at Headingley to skittle out England for 240, Gough
trapped opener Gehardus Liebenberg leg before wicket for six before
lunch.
	   South Africa, left with a minimum of 158 overs over five
sessions to win, was 10 for one at lunch on the penultimate day
with Gary Kirsten and Jacques Kallis, unbeaten on three and one
respectively.
	   In an all too familiar collapse associated with England batting
this summer, the home side, resuming on 206 for four, was bowled
out in a 16-over spell.
	   Donald (5-71) and Pollock (5-53), bowling in tandem, made a
mockery of the England batting, claiming the last six wickets for
34 runs.
	   In the first innings too, England, lost 6 for 34 to be bowled
out for 230.
	   The latest collapse included the wicket of Nasser Hussain, who
was denied a well deserved century, falling for 94 after over seven
hours at the crease. He hit 13 boundaries off 341 balls.
	   Hussain was deceived by a ball that stopped on him, and drove a
catch to skipper Hansie Cronje at mid off to give Pollock his first
five-wicket haul in the series.
	   Donald, the chief wrecker in the series, compounded England's
collapse in his second over, removing a hapless Graeme Hick (1) and
Andrew Flintoff (0) in the space of six balls.
	   Donald's fourth haul of five gave him 33 wickets for the series
at 19.78, a record for South Africa in England.

	   MOSCOW: the note.
	   Security forces, some in armored personnel carriers, remained on
the tarmac for several hours. But they withdrew after the male
passengers were removed from the plane and taken to the terminal
building on a bus.
	   The male passengers were being kept in a hall in the terminal
building for questioning, Interfax reported.
	   However, there was no word that anyone had been arrested.
	   Russia's last hijacking took place in December, when a man
claiming to be wired with explosives commandeered a plane traveling
to Moscow from the eastern city of Magadan. He was captured shortly
after the plane landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1 airport.
	   Since the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, airport security has
deteriorated, particularly at regional airports. There have been a
number of hijackings on domestic flights, but in most cases the
hijacker has surrendered following negotiations with authorities.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will accept nothing short of the
lifting of trade sanctions in its current row with the U.N.
Security Council over weapons inspections, the ruling Baath Party
newspaper al-Thawra said Sunday.
	   Under the terms of the resolution, the ban on Iraqi exports
should be lifted once U.N. weapons experts declare that Baghdad has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction and the means to make
such lethal armaments.
	   ``The council is obliged to deeply understand Iraq's demands ...
(and) accept all of them because they are legal and objective since
it has completely implemented the requirements under (U.N.)
resolution 687,'' the paper said.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of
neighboring Kuwait, include a ban on the free export of Iraq's oil,
its most profitable commodity.
	   To demand the end of sanctions, Iraq on Wednesday declared a
freeze on cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspection program. The
Security Council termed that move unacceptable, but urged more
negotiations and suggested it was open to lifting the sanctions.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Janet Sullivan said Sunday that U.N. arms
inspections were now restricted to sites subject to ongoing
monitoring, which Iraq allowed to continue.
	   She said the United Nations has suspended searches of other
sites by weapons inspectors. In the past, Iraq has blocked such
inspections by failing to provide escorts for the inspectors. The
escorts are required under U.N. agreements with Iraq.
	   Iraq has not officially reacted to the Security Council's stand
but al-Thawra said Baghdad will turn down offers that fall short of
its demand.
	   ``The council should not think that a piece of cake like the one
given to two angry boys will satisfy Iraq,'' the paper said in an
editorial.
	   The current dispute began when chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler on Monday rejected an Iraqi demand that he state
Iraq had destroyed its dangerous weapons. He said he did not have
the evidence to make that declaration.

	   The statement said that ``18 foreigners were apprehended
attempting to incite unrest in Yangon.''
	   ``Foreigners who were distributing the pamphlets in downtown
Yangon were reported to the police by citizens and taken to police

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia loses dlrs 1.25 billion
yearly as a result of Malaysian importers and exporters using
Singapore port, a news report said Sunday.
	   The report by the Bernama news agency quoted Transport Minister
Ling Liong Sik as saying shippers who complained that ports in
Malaysia were slow and inefficient were behind the times.
	   ``Yes, seven or eight years ago, we faced congestion, boxes lost
and delays, but all these are history now,'' he told reporters in
Port Klang, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Kuala Lumpur.
	   He took a delegation of Malaysian Chinese Association members of
parliament, state assemblymen and senators to visit the port.
	   Ling said 40 percent of containers were cleared within 24 hours,
and Port Klang had no shortage of empty containers.
	   A few weeks ago, Ling had said he would suggest that the
government make it mandatory for Malaysian importers and exports to
use local ports.

YANGON: statement said.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Bangkok-based opposition groups of Myanmar exiles and
pro-democracy activists had been predicting for weeks that the
people of Myanmar might rise up against the military government
Saturday.
	   The anniversary marked Aug. 8, 1988, when months of simmering
discontent erupted into nationwide protests against military rule.
The government changed leaders but eventually crushed the unrest
with bullets and bayonets. As many as 3,000 people died.
	   On the anniversary day, Yangon and other parts of Myanmar, also
known as Burma, were quiet, the government and independent
witnesses said. Security was light in the capital and no trouble
was reported in other cities.
	   The same situation was believed to have prevailed Sunday, though
rumors were constant of demonstrations. None was confirmed except
the pamphleteering by the foreign activists.
	   Sources close to the opposition National League for Democracy
told reporters in Bangkok that leader Aung San Suu Kyi had told her
supporters not to go into the streets to provoke the military.
	   The anniversary came two weeks ahead of an Aug. 21 deadline set
by Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, for the
government to finally convene the parliament elected in 1990.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the vote, but the military
never honored the result after its supporters lost.

U.N. suspends new weapons inspections in Iraq, keeps monitoring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. suspending inspections; ADDS background on
blocking of inspections at end; CHANGES headline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has suspended new arms
inspections in Iraq after the government's declaration it would
refuse to cooperate with U.N. inspectors, a U.N. official said
Sunday.
	   Janet Sullivan, spokeswoman for the inspection program, said
monitoring of already inspected sites _ which Iraq said could
continue _ was still going on.
	   But she said new inspections, which often involve surprise
visits, were being put off ``in light of the present situation.''
	   ``Pending further instructions ... inspections in respect of
disarmament activities are temporarily suspended,'' she added.
	   Iraq declared its freeze on cooperation to demand the end of
8-year-old U.N. trade sanctions. The Security Council termed that
move ``totally unacceptable,'' but urged more negotiations and
suggested it was open to easing the strictures.
	   The daily Al-Thawra of the ruling Baath Party said, meanwhile,
that Iraq would accept nothing short of the lifting of sanctions in
its row with the U.N. Security Council over the inspections.
	   ``The council is obliged to deeply understand Iraq's demands ...
(and) accept all of them because they are legal and objective since
it has completely implemented the requirements under (U.N.)
resolution 687,'' the paper said.
	   Under the terms of the resolution, the ban on Iraqi exports
should be lifted once U.N. weapons experts declare that Baghdad has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction and the means to make
such lethal armaments.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of
neighboring Kuwait, include a ban on the free export of Iraq's oil,
its most profitable commodity.
	   Iraq has not officially reacted to the Security Council's stand
but al-Thawra said Baghdad will turn down offers that fall short of
its demand.
	   ``The council should not think that a piece of cake like the one
given to two angry boys will satisfy Iraq,'' the paper said in an
editorial.
	   The current dispute began when chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler on Monday rejected an Iraqi demand that he state
Iraq had destroyed its dangerous weapons. He said he did not have
the evidence to make that declaration.
	   The continuing monitoring by U.N. employees in Iraq involves
keeping watch on 460 sites already inspected to see that no
proscribed activity takes place. About 100 U.N. monitors, 120
remote-controlled cameras and dozens of sensors are used in the
program.
	   In the past Iraq has blocked new inspections by physically
stopping U.N. personnel from reaching the sites or by simply
denying them escorts. Under agreements with Iraq, government
escorts must accompany inspectors on their visits to Iraqi
properties.

Swiss cycling chief wants leniency against disgraced riders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Alex Zuelle, one of the Swiss riders
implicated in the cycling drug scandal, hopes to defend his crown
in the the Tour of Spain next month.
	   In an interview with the SonntagsZeitung newspaper Sunday,
Zuelle said his top priority was to train to regain condition in
time for the Spanish classic.
	   He pulled out of the mountainous 232-kilometer (144-mile) San
Sebastian race in northern Spain after 200 kilometers (125 miles)
Saturday _ the first world-class event since the Tour de France.
	   Given the disruption in his cycling schedule, he said he was
happy with his performance.
	   Zuelle and other members of the Festina team were expelled from
the Tour de France last month after the team was found with the
banned performance-boosting hormone, EPO. He confessed to using the
drug.
	   The Swiss cycling federation will decide on sanctions _
including a possible ban _ after receiving a report from world
cycling's governing body.
	   Zuelle said Festina owner Miguel Rodriguez planned to continue
to the end of the season and wanted his riders to do likewise.
	   ``I'm paid by Rodriguez to compete in races and now I want to
concentrate fully on my job,'' he told the paper.
	   ``I have to build myself back up again as I'm meant to start in
the Vuelta (Tour of Spain), which wasn't on my original schedule,''
he said.
	   Zuelle won last year's Tour of Spain. This year's event starts
Sept. 5.

Albania to investigate all Arabs after Africa blasts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ All Arabs in Albania will be investigated
following an allegation that the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania
were linked to arrests in this Balkan country, the Interior
Ministry said Sunday.
	   While declining to confirm a link between Friday's two bombings
and the arrest of Egyptians in Albania last month, the ministry
said any Arabs who have entered the country will soon be
investigated rigorously.
	   A group known as the Islamic Jihad vowed last week to strike
American interests because some of its members were arrested in
Albania, according to a report in Thursday's Al-Hayat, a daily
Arabic language newspaper published in London.
	   All entry points will now come under extra surveillance from the
police and security services, an official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``Some of them might target Albania for operating unlawfully,''
the official said. ``Many Arabs are here as members of Islamic
humanitarian organizations.''

Israel says Greek Catholic archbishop linked to hostile elements
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Vatican's choice as the new Greek Catholic
archbishop in the Galilee is linked to virulent anti-Israel
elements, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said
Sunday.
	   Aviv Bushinsky said Israel still hopes to persuade the Vatican
to change its mind about the appointment of Archbishop Butros
Muallem, who he said was ``linked to Syrian intelligence, to
Archbishop Hilarion Cappucci and to Farouk Kaddoumi.''
	   Kaddoumi is a senior PLO official opposed to the Oslo peace
accords between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   The Syrian-born Capucci was convicted by an Israeli court in the
1970s of smuggling arms to Palestinian guerrillas. He was released
at the intervention of the Vatican and deported.
	   Jerusalem considered denying Muallem, a Palestinian refugee now
serving as a bishop in Brazil, entry to Israel, Bushinsky said, but
backed down due to protests from the Vatican.
	   ``However we have not yet given up, and we are trying to
persuade the Vatican to reconsider its decision,'' he told The
Associated Press.
	   The Vatican has responded sharply to Israel's attempts to
influence the appointment, issuing a statement last week noting
that it has the right to name bishops without outside interference.
	   Israel is not claiming the right to interfere in church
appointments, Bushinsky said, ``but we do have the right to protect
Israel's interests, and we are concerned that Muallem would be a
cause of ferment.''
	   The Greek Catholic community is the largest Christian community
in Israel and the archbishop is its highest-ranking regional
authority.
	   Israeli reports said Netanyahu had made it clear to leaders of
the Greek Catholic church and the Vatican that he wanted Emil
Shufani, a bishop considered friendly to the Israeli government,
for the post.

Thousands pay respects to former communist ruler Zhivkov

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Carrying photos of their long-time
dictator and red Communist flags, thousands of mostly elderly
mourners marched through the Bulgarian capital Sunday in a final
tribute to the late Todor Zhivkov.
	   Zhivkov, who ruled Bulgaria for 35 years until his ouster in
1989, died Thursday at age 86 after falling into a cerebral coma.
He was eastern Europe's last surviving Stalinist leader.
	   More than 10,000 people gathered on a central square to pay
their last respects to Zhivkov, despite blazing heat.
	   His coffin was placed on the stairway outside the former Royal
Palace, directly opposite the now-defunct mausoleum of Zhivkov's
communist predecessor Georgi Dimitrov. On every public holiday for
three and a half decades, Zhivkov appeared on the mausoleum's
balcony to cheer the marching by jubilant crowds.
	   This time it was the hard core of old communist supporters who
appeared. Officials of the reformist government were conspicuously
absent from the memorial ceremony, organized by the family and the
Socialist party that emerged from Zhivkov's former communist party.
	   Later the coffin was moved to the central cemetery for burial.
Thousands walked in a mourning procession the entire 4 kilometers
(2.5 miles) behind the open car carrying the coffin.
	   Former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev's grandson Andrei was among
the few foreign guests at the ceremony. Russian ultranationalist
Vladimir Zhirinovsky sent a wreath.
	   ``The years when Zhivkov ruled will remain in Bulgaria's history
as the golden age,'' said Yordan Yotov, one of Zhivkov's closest
party mates.
	   Other speakers praised also Zhivkov's policy and accused the
current government of having ``destroyed all achievements of
socialism.''
	   To fierce applause, the leader of the anti-fascist union Velko
Valkanov said that ``the era of socialism is only now beginning.''
	   ``Zhivkov is dead. Long live socialism,'' he told the crowd.
	   Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov had said Thursday that
Zhivkov's death meant the era of Bulgarian communism was finally
ending. He called Zhivkov's years in power a ``dark era.''
	   Zhivkov became first secretary of Bulgaria's staunchly Stalinist
Communist Party in 1954. In 1962 he became prime minister, and in
1971 head of state.
	   Abandoned by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who viewed
old-style Stalinists as a major embarrassment, Zhivkov was ousted
as head of the Communist Party in 1989 and replaced as president.
	   He spent the rest of his life in political oblivion, fighting
medical problems toward the end. But he was not forgotten by those
who remain loyal to the notion of socialism.
	   ``During Zhivkov's time I studied free of charge, my medical
treatment was free, my life was good,'' said 65-year-old Elena
Kamenova, who spent two hours in 31-degree heat (88 Fahrenheit) on
the square.
	   Zhivkov's final resting place is a family grave next to his
daughter Ludmila, who died in 1981 under still unclear
circumstances.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ As the death toll in the terrorist bombing
of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya rose to 190, an Israeli search team
Sunday morning rescued a mother and her son from an upper floor in
a nearby 22-story building. Using a 150-ton crane, drills and
blowtorches, another Israeli team was trying to free a woman named
Rose trapped in a collapsed building adjacent to the embassy. While
rescue efforts intensified, U.S. and Kenyan investigators continued
searching for clues to Friday's bombing. The U.S. Embassy in
neighboring Tanzania was also destroyed by a simultaneous terrorist
bomb. (EMBASSY BOMBINGS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a peaceful but confusing end to an airline
hijacking, security officials on Sunday calmly removed 70 male
passengers from an airplane _ including the men believed
responsible for commandeering the aircraft, a news report said.
After a four-hour standoff, the 70 men were taken inside the
terminal building at Moscow's Domodedovo Airport for questioning.
Authorities tried to determine who was responsible for a hijacking
note that demanded 621,000 rubles (dlrs 100,000), the Interfax news
agency said. Authorities decided to peacefully remove all the male
passengers from the plane after they became convinced that none had
any dangerous weapons, Interfax reported. The women and children
had been allowed to leave the plane earlier. (RUSSIA-HIJACKING)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China dynamited dikes along a stretch of the
swollen Yangtze River on Sunday in a desperate bid to divert
floodwaters menacing cities and huge swathes of farmland in central
Hubei province. Secondary dikes were blown at 12 a.m. (0400 GMT) in
Jianli County, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) upriver from the
industrial center of Wuhan, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported. More solid primary dikes farther back from the river
remain mostly intact along the Yangtze. The aim was to divert up to
800 million cubic meters (28 billion cubic feet) of water and lower
the raging Yangtze's water level by 10-25 centimeters (4-10
inches), it reported. That appeared to be an effort to avoid
flooding the much larger Jingjiang diversion area farther upriver,
where about 330,000 people have already been evacuated to high
ground. (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Reports of fighting Sunday appeared to
contradict claims by the Taliban that they were in charge of
Mazar-e-Sharif, the last major Afghan city outside the extremist
Islamic militia's undisputed control. The anti-Taliban alliance,
meanwhile, was also under pressure near Kabul in the Panjshir
Valley, where ousted military chief Ahmed Shah Masood has struggled
to hold ground since he and President Burhanuddin Rabbani lost the
capital two years ago. Indian-based Afghan Ambassador Masood
Khalili, who has remained loyal to Rabbani, said street fighting
was escalating Sunday in Mazar-e-Sharif, some 300 kilometers (190
miles) north of Kabul, a day after Taliban fighters entered it.
Khalili also accused Taliban fighters of killing civilians,
targeting Shiite Muslims in particular. The Taliban, like most
Afghans, adhere to the Sunni sect of Islam. (AFGHANISTAN)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has suspended new arms
inspections in Iraq after the government's declaration it would
refuse to cooperate with U.N. inspectors, a U.N. official said
Sunday. Janet Sullivan, spokeswoman for the inspection program,
said monitoring of already inspected sites _ which Iraq said could
continue _ was still going on. But she said new inspections, which
often involve surprise visits, were being put off ``in light of the
present situation.'' Iraq declared its freeze on cooperation to
demand the end of 8-year-old U.N. trade sanctions. The Security
Council termed that move ``totally unacceptable,'' but urged more
negotiations and suggested it was open to easing the strictures.

Foreign journalists in Malaysia may be required to register:

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's information minister
said Sunday he will propose to the government that all foreign
journalists working in the country be required to register, the
national news agency reported.
	   Minister Mohamed Rahmat said the aim was not to restrict their
movements but to enable the government to know their identity, the
Bernama news agency added.
	   Malaysia would not restrict freedom of the press as people had
always been writing both good and bad things about the country, he
said in Johor Baru, 360 kilometers (225 miles) south of Kuala
Lumpur.
	   ``We are not preventing them but we want to know who they are so
that if there are problems, we can settle them,'' Bernama quoted
him as saying.
	   The report did not elaborate. Both local and foreign journalists
are already accredited with the Ministry of Information.
	   Mohamed also urged Malaysians working for foreign media
organizations to be responsible in their reports, and said they
should not submit to the media owners in all matters.
	   Mohamed said Malaysia was not afraid of negative reports about
the country so long as they were balanced and responsible.
	   Meanwhile, Mohamed Shafie Apdal, parliamentary secretary to the
Ministry of Information, said the people should exercise
self-censorship on negative news and rumors circulated on the
Internet by irresponsible parties out to create disunity.
	   Police have accused rumor mongers, believed to have spread their
word over the Internet, of causing panic in Kuala Lumpur with
stories of riots and ethnic violence.
	   The newspaper Star on Sunday quoted Inspector-General of Police
Abdul Rahim Noor as warning those responsible for the rumors that
``we will arrest you wherever you may be in the country.''

Two arrested in shooting death of American in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Two men have been arrested in the
shooting death of an American outdoorsman who was killed while
camping in northern Pakistan, a police official said Sunday.
	   Khurshid Alam Khan, inspector general of police in the northern
Pakistani town of Gilgit, said robbery appeared to have been the
motive in the attack last week on 53-year-old Edward ``Ned''
Gillette. Gillette's wife, Susan Patterson, was shot in the attack
and was recovering Sunday in Gilgit's hospital.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said Patterson would
soon be brought to the capital, Islamabad.
	   Khan said the would-be robbers apparently panicked after the
Aug. 5 shooting and took nothing. Abid Hussain and Naun Heshel were
arrested Saturday night and charged with murder and assault and
could face additional charges in the case, Khan said. He said
police found a 12-gauge shotgun believed used in the attack in the
suspects' possession.
	   The mountainous Gilgit region, about 220 kilometers (120 miles)
north of Islamabad is popular with foreign and local tourists.
Local villagers, who rely on the tourist trade and look on visitors
as their guests, helped police trace the suspects, Khan said.
	   He said Patterson had also provided evidence, and expressed
admiration for ``the courage and determination shown'' by the
couple. Khan said Gillette, shot twice in the stomach and once in
the back, had urged his wife to escape. She was shot once in the
back.
	   The Boston Globe, quoting relatives, described the couple as
``career adventurers'' from Sun Valley, Idaho, who often spent
summers near Boston in Cape Cod. The newspaper reported Sunday that
they once retraced Marco Polo's steps in a camel ride along the
Silk Route.
	   Gillette in 1978 became the first person to climb Mount McKinley
in one day and in 1981 he participated in the first
circumnavigation of Mount Everest on skis, the Globe said.

Five missing in Pacific after fishing boat catches fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Five crew members of a Japanese fishing vessel were
missing Sunday after their boat caught fire 800 kilometers (500
miles) off Japan's Pacific coast, the Maritime Safety Agency said.
	   A fire broke out in the engine room of the 19-ton tuna fishing
boat Kosho Maru No. 5 Saturday as it worked off the coast of Miyagi
prefecture (state) in northeastern Japan, agency spokesman
Toshihiko Kanazaki said.
	   After calling for help, the vessel's eight crew members
abandoned ship early Saturday.
	   The ship's captain Takao Hamayoshi, 45, and crew members Masaru
Hashimura, 34, and Edy Rugiyanto (phonetic spelling), an
Indonesian, were rescued by a Philippine cargo ship.
	   The five remaining crew members _ Yasuo Kawada, 41, Tadashi
Kobo, 43, Tadashi Imoto, 44, Yutaka Ota, 33, and Indonesian Arif
Jaenudin (phonetic) remained missing, Kanazaki said.
	   Japan's Maritime Safety Agency searched the area with aircraft
until nightfall Sunday and planned to resume the search Monday
morning.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt has imposed a 20 percent tax on steel
and metal products from six countries to prevent them from
monopolizing the local market and harming Egyptian companies,
Supply and Trade Minister Ahmed Guweili was quoted as saying
Sunday.
	   The duties will be imposed on steel from the Ukraine and
Romania, metal basins from Greece and Spain and other products from
India and Pakistan, Egyptian newspapers quoted Guweili as saying.
	   The duties come as Egypt threatens to curb trade with the
European Union to protest its imposition of a six-month
anti-dumping duty of 16.1 percent on Egyptian cotton.
	   Those taxes were introduced after charges from Eurocoton, which
represents the European cotton and textile industries, that Egypt
and five other countries sold their cotton at unfairly low prices.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The State Central Bank of Jordan announced
Sunday that 30 million dinars (dlrs 42.2 million) in development
bonds for the Water Authority will be issued Aug. 15.
	   The Bank said in a memorandum sent to commercial banks in the
Jordanian capital Amman that the five-year bonds will be due for
redemption August 2003.
	   The bonds will be of 100 Jordanian dinar (dlrs 140) denomination
and the interest will be paid in semi-annual installments on Feb.
15 and Aug. 15 of each year starting 1999. The income from
investments in these bonds are free of tax or any fees, the memo
said.

	   Profits amounted to 17.6 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 24.8
million), an increase of five million dinars (dlrs 7 million) from
the same period last year, said a bank official, speaking on

Tehran's former mayor to file appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The former mayor of Tehran, who was
sentenced to five years in jail last month for corruption, will
file an appeal next week, his lawyer was reported as saying Sunday.
	   ``Nothing but acquittal is expected,'' said Bahman Keshavarz,
lawyer of of the deposed mayor, Gholamhossein Karbaschi.
	   ``We will use all legal channels to prove that Karbaschi is
clear of all the charges,'' Keshavarz was quoted by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
	   He said he would lodge the appeal by Thursday.
	   Last month, Karbaschi was found guilty of embezzlement during
his eight-year term as Tehran's mayor and ordered to pay large
fines. He was banned from holding any government job for 20 years.
	   During his trial, which lasted more than a month, Karbaschi
admitted making mistakes, but denied stealing public money.
	   Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate President Mohamamad Khatami,
had been a target of the president's hard-line political rivals and
many Iranians say the trial was a political settling of scores.

Myanmar government arrests 18 foreigners for `inciting unrest'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, CLARIFIES that action was called
detention, grafs 1-2; ADDS background, graf 8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime detained 18
foreigners Sunday for distributing pamphlets the government said
were aimed at inciting unrest.
	   The detentions came a day after the 10th anniversary of a
nationwide uprising against military rule in Myanmar passed without
unrest anywhere in the country, according to the government.
	   Those held included six U.S. citizens, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Philippines nationals and one
Australian, a government official said in a statement faxed to The
Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   The statement said that ``18 foreigners were apprehended
attempting to incite unrest in Yangon.''
	   ``Foreigners who were distributing the pamphlets in downtown
Yangon were reported to the police by citizens and taken to police
stations for questioning and are being detained while the
investigation continues,'' the statement added.
	   ``Various pamphlets and related materials aimed at inciting
public unrest were found in their hotel rooms,'' it said.
	   The foreigners' trip was organized by Na Ga Forum Asia Group, a
private organization in Thailand, and one of those detained was a
professor at Bangkok's Rangsit University, the statement said.
	   Earlier, pro-democracy activists in Bangkok announced that a
``multinational peacemaking team'' had been sent to distribute
``goodwill messages'' expressing support for Myanmar's hopes for
human rights and democracy. It appeared to be the same group.
	   The government statement said the foreigners arrived on tourist
visas Friday from Bangkok and planned to leave Sunday. No names of
the detained activists were released.
	   ``Despite these efforts for agitation, conditions in Yangon,
Mandalay and other parts of the country are peaceful and calm,''
the statement said.
	   Embassies had no immediate information about their citizens
among the detainees. The Myanmar government would not be legally
bound to report an arrest until 24 hours later, diplomats said.
	   Bangkok-based opposition groups and pro-democracy activists had
been predicting for weeks that the people of Myanmar might rise up
against the government Saturday.
	   It was the anniversary of Aug. 8, 1988, when months of
discontent erupted into nationwide protests against military rule.
The government changed leaders but eventually crushed the unrest
with bullets and bayonets. As many as 3,000 people died.
	   On the anniversary day, Yangon and other parts of Myanmar, also
known as Burma, were quiet, the government and independent
witnesses said. Security was light in the capital and no trouble
was reported in other cities.
	   The same situation was believed to have prevailed Sunday, though
rumors were constant of demonstrations. None was confirmed except
the pamphleteering by the foreign activists.
	   Sources close to the opposition National League for Democracy
told reporters in Bangkok that leader Aung San Suu Kyi had ordered
her supporters not to go into the streets to provoke the military.
	   The anniversary came two weeks ahead of an Aug. 21 deadline set
by Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, for the
government to finally convene the parliament elected in 1990.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the vote, but the military
never honored the result after its supporters lost. The military
has ruled the country since 1962 and tolerates almost no dissent.

FA believes drug problem not major despite Atkinson claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's Football Association plans to double its
drugs testing program to ensure that soccer doesn't attract the
same scandals currently affecting cycling, athletics and swimming.
	   Reacting to allegations by former Manchester United and Aston
Villa manager Ron Atkinson that some players regularly go out on
the field with cannabis and cocaine in their system, FA spokesman
Steve Double said that testing proved there didn't appear to be a
major drugs problem in soccer.
	   ``Over the last few years the number of tests have risen from
272 to more than 500,'' Double said. ``The positive finds were
three last year, five the year before that, seven before that and
12 before that.
	   ``We are testing more, but finding less and we currently have a
proposal with the government to double again the existing drug
programme.''
	   Atkinson's book ``A Different Ball Game'' is being serialized in
the Mail on Sunday and includes allegations that ``a well-known
England international is reputed to be the biggest dealer in
football''
	   When asked on BBC radio about that allegation, Atkinson admitted
it wasn't his responsibility to inform the authorities because he
had ``only heard it on rumor or hearsay.''
	   Atkinson, who also has been in charge of West Bromwich Albion,
Atletico Madrid, Coventry and Sheffield Wednesday, called for
compulsory testing rather than the random system curring used by
the FA.
	   Believing that the problems was worse than reported, Atkinson
said he had secretly tested some Villa players for drugs and
discovered they had been taking cannabis.
	   ``There are players turning out every Saturday in the Premier
League with cocaine, certainly cannabis and all sorts of funny
tablets buzzing around in their system.''

in the predominantly Muslim region, where government troops have
been fighting separatist rebels.
	   The team was established Friday, one day after the military said
it would withdraw some of the troops sent to the province in
northern Sumatra to try to crush the separatist movement.
	   International human rights groups have said Indonesian troops
were guilty of arbitrary killings and torture in the late 1980s and
early 1990s against Muslim separatists in Aceh, about 1,750
kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   The local Legal Aid Foundation claimed recently to have found at
least 11 mass graves of victims of military operations in remote
areas.
	   Gov. Syamsuddin Machmud was quoted Sunday by the newspaper
Kompas as saying the team would include local public figures,
private organizations, police and state prosecutors.
	   Machmud said the new team is an expansion of an earlier one that
gathered data on missing people and victims of human rights
violations in the province.
	   On Friday, Gen. Wiranto, Indonesia's military chief, apologized
for any wrongdoing by the military during operations against the
separatists.
	   It was not immediately known how many soldiers would be pulled
out of Aceh, a region where the Dutch encountered stiff resistance
to colonial rule decades ago. At least several thousand Indonesian
soldiers have been sent to the province.
	   Human rights groups say that more than 130 people have been
reported missing in Aceh, one of three Indonesian provinces where
separatist bands are fighting for independence. The other two are
the former Portuguese colony of East Timor and Irian Jaya, a former
Dutch colony on the western part of the island of New Guinea.
	   The Free Aceh Movement has been fighting for an independent
Islamic state in Aceh, 1,750 kilometers (1,093 miles) northwest of
Jakarta, since the mid-1970s.

Stranded Iraqi family will not be deported to Iraq, say officials

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Iraqi family stuck at Cairo airport for
10 days after being deported from Hungary will not face deportation
to Iraq where it fears punishment by the government, Egyptian and
U.N. officials said Sunday.
	   Mahasen Hamid and her three children ended up in Cairo after
Hungary denied them political asylum. Her family says she has been
living in fear after being visited at the airport by an Iraqi
diplomat who told her she would be sent home.
	   Hamid, her two sons Ali, 10, and Zaeen, 8, and daughter Rayam,
7, have been staying at a temporary detention center at Cairo
International Airport since arriving on July 31.
	   The woman's family complained in a letter sent Friday to Egypt's
government and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees that as the
wife of an Iraqi Shiite Muslim dissident she could face dangers
from the government of President Saddam Hussein.
	   But Mohammed el-Khudhari, an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official
in charge of refugees, said Sunday that Hamid and her children will
not be deported to Iraq.
	   ``We will not deport her to the country of origin. We are a
civilized country and will not do anything which might endanger her
life,'' el-Khudhari told The Associated Press.
	   He said Egypt will give access to U.N. refugee officials to see
Hamid and her children.
	   However, Egyptian authorities rejected a request for an AP
reporter to meet with Hamid and the children at Cairo airport.
	   Panos Moumtzis, a Cairo-based official of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, said the the organization took up the
case after receiving her family's letter.
	   ``The UNHCR has intervened in the case of the Iraqi family and
made all necessary contacts with Egyptian authorities to try to
stop their deportation and also try to get access to see them,''
Moumtzis said.
	   ``We believe it is a very serious case because the husband is a
political refugee and their deportation (to Iraq) could endanger
their life.''
	   Hamid's husband, Hadi al-Mohammed, 41, participated in the
uprising against Saddam's regime that followed the Gulf War in
1991, said his brother, Hassan al-Mohammed Hassan.
	   Al-Mohammed fled Iraq that year to an Arab country and then to
Germany three years ago.
	   In a telephone interview from Britain, Hassan said Hamid and the
children flew to Budapest from Jordan through Egypt on June 29 but
they were sent back to Cairo a month later by Hungarian airport
officials.
	   Hassan said that after Hamid's arrival in Cairo, Egyptian
authorities contacted the Iraqi Embassy to the Arab League. He said
an Iraqi diplomat then met her, questioned her about her
application for political asylum ``and informed her that she will
be deported to Iraq.''
	   Hamid and the children escaped Iraq in February in hopes of
joining her husband.
	   Thousands of Iraqis, mostly Shiites and Kurds, have fled Iraq
since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis for financial and political reasons.
Iraq has been under tough U.N. economic sanctions since 1990 when
Saddam ordered his forces to invade Kuwait.

Palestinian wounded in south Lebanon bomb explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A bomb exploded at a refugee camp in
southern Lebanon Sunday, wounding a Palestinian worker.
	   Kaisar Baalous, 35, suffered shrapnel wounds in both legs after
a grenade was hurled by a man in a speeding car at a garbage dump
at Ein el-Hilweh, the largest of Lebanon's 13 refugee camps, said
security officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Baalous was searching for scrap copper at the garbage dump when
the bomb exploded near an office of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction at the camp, the officials said.
	   He was rushed to a hospital in the camp, which is located on the
outskirts of the port city of Sidon in southern Lebanon.
	   The motive for the incident was not immediately known, even
though Arafat's supporters and opponents have in the past battled
for control of Ein el-Hilweh, home to 75,000 Palestinian refugees.
	   Some 350,000 Palestinians live in Lebanon's refugee camps.

Myanmar government arrests 18 foreigners for `inciting unrest'
</HEADLINE>

Kyi situation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime detained 18
foreigners Sunday for distributing pamphlets the government said
were aimed at inciting unrest.
	   The detentions came a day after the 10th anniversary of a
nationwide uprising against military rule in Myanmar passed without
unrest anywhere in the country, according to the government.
	   Those held included six U.S. citizens, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Philippines nationals and one
Australian, a government official said in a statement faxed to The
Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   The statement said that ``18 foreigners were apprehended
attempting to incite unrest in Yangon.''
	   ``Foreigners who were distributing the pamphlets in downtown
Yangon were reported to the police by citizens and taken to police
stations for questioning and are being detained while the
investigation continues,'' the statement added.
	   Pamphlets and other material aimed at inciting unrest were found
in their hotel rooms, it said.
	   The trip was organized by Na Ga Forum Asia Group, a private
organization in Thailand. One of those detained was a professor at
Bangkok's Rangsit University, the statement said.
	   Earlier, pro-democracy activists in Bangkok had announced that a
``multinational peacemaking team'' had entered Myanmar to
distribute ``goodwill messages'' expressing support for human
rights and democracy. It appeared to be the same group.
	   The government statement said the foreigners arrived on tourist
visas Friday from Bangkok and planned to leave Sunday. No names of
the detained activists were released.
	   ``Despite these efforts for agitation, conditions in Yangon,
Mandalay and other parts of the country are peaceful and calm,''
the statement said.
	   Embassies had no immediate information about their citizens in
detention. The government would not be legally bound to report
arrests for the first 24 hours, diplomats said.
	   Separately, newspapers reported that James Russell Rupert
Mawdsley, a British-Australian, was freed Thursday after an appeal
by his family three months into a five-year prison term for passing
out pamphlets on behalf of a student rebel group the government
considers a terrorist organization.
	   Bangkok-based opposition groups and pro-democracy activists had
been predicting for weeks that the people of Myanmar might rise up
against the government Saturday.
	   It was the anniversary of Aug. 8, 1988, when months of
discontent erupted into nationwide protests against military rule.
The government changed leaders but eventually crushed the unrest
with bullets and bayonets. As many as 3,000 people died.
	   On the anniversary day, Yangon and other parts of Myanmar, also
known as Burma, were quiet, the government and independent
witnesses said. Security was remarkably light.
	   The same situation was believed to have prevailed Sunday, though
rumors were constant of demonstrations. None was confirmed except
the pamphleteering by the foreigners.
	   Sources close to the opposition National League for Democracy
told reporters in Bangkok that leader Aung San Suu Kyi had ordered
her supporters not to go into the streets to provoke the military.
	   The anniversary came two weeks ahead of an Aug. 21 deadline set
by Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, for the
government to finally convene the parliament elected in 1990.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the vote, but the military
never allowed the parliament to meet. The military has ruled the
country since 1962 and tolerates almost no dissent.
	   Government newspapers said plainly that the peaceful anniversary
could be attributed to fear.
	   ``Even though the democracy princess wanted the people to go out
on the streets and create an anarchy in the country, the people
dare not break the laws of the existing government,'' said an
opinion piece.
	   The government stiffened its security detail on the streets
around Suu Kyi's house Sunday after complying with her requests to
withdraw the detachment from her property.
	   Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest or largely confined to
her home for the past decade, recently engaged authorities in a
six-day standoff on a road outside the capital.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ As the death toll in the terrorist bombing
of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya rose to 190, an Israeli search team
Sunday morning rescued a mother and her son from an upper floor in
a nearby 22-story building.
	   The Red Cross said 10 more people may be in the building, but
they were unsure of their conditions.
	   Using a 150-ton crane, drills and blowtorches, another Israeli
team was trying to free a woman named Rose trapped in a collapsed
building adjacent to the embassy.
	   While rescue efforts were stepped up, U.S. and Kenyan
investigators continued searching for clues to Friday's bombing.
The U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania was also badly damaged by
a nearly simultaneous bomb.
	   Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi visited the embassy site Sunday
morning and said there were some leads but did not elaborate.
	   The Sunday Nation newspaper quoted an unidentified ``security
man'' as saying he saw three Arab-looking men filming the U.S.
Embassy for about 20 minutes, four days before the bombing. He
alerted guards at the embassy, but they brushed him off, the paper
said.
	   Closed-circuit TV cameras were monitoring the parking area
behind the embassy where the bomb went off, but U.S. Ambassador
Prudence Bushnell said she didn't know whether the cameras or film
survived the blast.
	   There have been several differing accounts of how the explosions
occurred.
	   Preacher Julius Koiyet, who was waiting for a bus outside the
Nairobi embassy, said he was shot by one of four men who jumped
from a yellow van and threw three-foot long (almost 1 meter)
cannisters at the building adjacent to the embassy. Embassy
administrative attache Mary Robinson said she heard what sounded
like shots before the explosion.
	   Ocheng Okwach, who works for the Ministry of Environment and
Natural Resources, was quoted in The Sunday Nation as saying he saw
two men who appeared to be Arabs drive a yellow pickup truck to the
back of the embassy and jump out brandishing machine-guns.
	   ``One man ran back into the the vehicle as the other sprayed
bullets into the American Embassy,'' Okwach was quoted as saying.
	   Kenyan police superintendent Mike Harries was quoted in The
Sunday Times in London as saying that witnesses saw a pickup truck
drive into the car park behind the embassy and sit there for five
minutes before the bomb went off.
	   ``We believe it was a suicide bomber who was targeting the
Americans,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   The FBI, which was sending 60 investigators to Nairobi and a
separate team to the Tanzanian capital, Dar es Salaam, has said its
top priority is to determine the explosive device used and the type
of vehicle which carried it to the scene. FBI spokesman Frank
Scafidi said this information ``can be like a fingerprint of who
did it.''
	   In Nairobi, rescue efforts had focused on the badly damaged
embassy building and the adjacent Ufundi Cooperative building,
which collapsed, not the 22-story Cooperative Bank of Kenya
building which although badly damaged remained standing.
	   On Sunday morning, an Israeli team searching floor to floor with
sniffer dogs discovered a woman and her son, who is about 12 years
old, in the caretaker's apartment on about the 20th floor. They
also found a body on the 17th floor.
	   Lt. Col. Ofer Loefler, spokesman for the Isrsaeli rescue team,
said the child was in the building at the time of the explosion and
his mother went in afterwards to find him.
	   ``They stayed up there because they were afraid to come down,''
he said. Earlier, the Red Cross said both mother and son were
caught in the blast.
	   The mother and son, able to walk from the building with rescue
workers, were taken by ambulance to Nairobi Hospital for a checkup.
	   Meanwhile, another Israeli team working in the Ufundi
Cooperative building was still talking to the woman named Rose who
was trapped near the spot where a man, Gaitara Ngara, was pulled
from the rubble Saturday night after 36 hours.
	   ``Her face is burned, but she's talking,'' John Sparrow of the
International Committee of the Red Cross. ``During the past two
days, she developed a relationship with Gaitara. ... They talked
and kept each other's spirits up.''
	   A second woman, named Jane, was also reported to be alive, not
far from Rose, he said.
	   A 64-member emergency search and rescue team from Fairfax,
County, Virginia arrived with four dogs Sunday, and immediately
went to work in the embassy building and other bomb-damaged
buildings nearby.
	   A 10-man French military-civilian unit, including one doctor and
two dogs, also arrived and was taking part in rescue operations.
	   Kenya's tiny but economically influential Asian community which
contains both Hindus and Muslims was actively involved in rescue
efforts.
	   And Muslim leaders in Kenya condemned the bombing.
	   ``This act of terrorism not only rendered human life and
security valueless, but also caused extensive damage and created
unnecessary tension in an otherwise peaceful country,'' said a
statement signed by Munir Mazrui, vice-chairman of the Coast branch
of the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims.
	   Despite hopeful signs that some of the missing may still be
alive, the death toll mounted.
	   Outside the U.S. Embassy, 155 people died, according to the
Kenyan government. Inside the embassy, an additional 11 Americans
and 24 Kenyans died, an embassy spokesman said. One American and
over 100 Kenyan employees at the embassy were still unaccounted
for.
	   Eight people died in the Tanzanian bombing, but no Americans
were killed there, hospital officials said.
	   Bill Barr, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, confirmed
reports that Consul General Julian Bartley was missing and that his
son, Jay, a university student in San Diego, Calif., had been
killed in the blast.
	   Barr said there would be a private memorial service Sunday for
American Embassy staff in Nairobi.
	   The Kenyan president's office said 4,257 people were injured in
the bombing, 542 were hospitalized, and 25 remain in critical
condition.
	   A U.S. C-141 cargo plane flew 15 critically injured victims to
Ramstein Air Base in Germany Sunday for treatment.
	   Kenyan and Red Cross officials had appealed for fresh blood for
transfusions and other medicines and equipment, including
painkillers and syringes.
	   A plane from the German Red Cross was scheduled to arrive Sunday
with more than 1,000 bags containing fresh blood, Red Cross
spokeswoman Nina Galbe said.
	   In Nairobi, Pauline Wanjiku was one of dozens of Kenyans who
went to downtown Uhuru (Freedom) Park Sunday to donate blood.
	   ``I watched the horrible bomb blast from television and said I
wished I could help,'' the 16-year-old said, lying on a mat on the
grass.
	   At Nairobi Hospital, one of the best-equipped in the city, Dr.
Jack Nyamongo, head of the blood transfusion service, said all
blood received was being screened for hepatitis B, syphillis, and
the HIV virus that causes AIDS.
	   At Sunday Mass at Holy Family Basilica, the Roman Catholic
catherdral in Nairobi, several thousand worshippers offered prayers
for the dead and injured and for their families.
	   Archbishop Rafael Ndingi spoke of both forgiveness _ and of
God's vengeance.
	   ``As we pray for our dead, dear brothers and sisters, we must
also forgive the one who is the cause of this,'' he said. ``When we
forgive, we find consolation.''
	   Retribution, he went on, is God's business. ``God says:
`Vengeance is mine. Leave it to me and I'll take care of it.' ''

Netanyahu urges Russian security adviser to stop helping Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed the
visiting Russian national security adviser on Sunday to help stop
Iran's missile development.
	   Israel has accused Russia of providing weapons technology that
Iran has used to develop missiles capable of reaching the Jewish
state.
	   On Sunday, Netanyahu said that Iran's development of ballistic
missiles with conventional and non-conventional warheads was ``a
direct threat to Israel's security.''
	   ``We're going to discuss ways that Israel and Russia can
cooperate to do something about the problem of missiles in the
Persian Gulf,'' he told reporters before meeting with Andrei
Kokoshin, security adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Netanyahu said the missiles were ``a very big problem for the
stability of our region.''
	   Kokoshin said he hoped the discussions with Netanyahu and other
Israeli officials would lead to greater understanding on the
matter, which he said was ``an important matter for the national
security of Russia as well.''
	   Last month, Iran test-fired the Shahab-3 missile, which with its
range of 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) is capable of hitting Israel
and U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
	   Iran confirmed that the missile had been successfully tested,
but said it is for purely defensive purposes.
	   Russia has denied helping the Iranian missile project, and
Iranian officials also rejected claims that Russia helped build
Shahab-3.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Swede Magnus Norman ousted
Australia's Richard Fromberg 6-3, 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 Sunday to win the
Grolsch Open ATP clay court tennis tournament.
	   Only in the third set did Norman show signs of the heat
exhaustion for which he received courtside treatment during his
Saturday semifinal win over Argentine Mariano Zabaleta.
	   ``Maybe I'm the only one here who wants bad weather,'' said
Norman after the match. ``But I was really glad it wasn't as hot
today as yesterday.''
	   Norman picked up dlrs 66,400 with Fromberg's prize money 39,300.
	   Fromberg was 37 in the rankings at the start of the week to
Norman's 42 but was outmanuvered right from the start.
	   With superb all-court play Norman rushed to 5-3 and a
wrong-footing backhand gave him three set points on the
Australian's serve.
	   Fromberg netted a high backhand volley on the first to lose his
serve for the second time and the set.
	   Norman steamrollered on, breaking Fromberg again in the second
game of the second set. Despite stumbling at break point Norman
managed to recover with a diving retrieval to lead 2-0.
	   Fromberg forced his first break point of the match in the
seventh game but Norman saved it comfortably, going on to serve out
twice, including a love-game to round off the second set.
	   Norman broke again in first game of third but then his game fell
apart as he surrendered his first four service games in the set to
go down 6-2.
	   Games went with serve to 3-3 in the fourth set but Norman was
growing back into his form of the first two sets and broke in the
fourth with a stunning backhand pass on service return.
	   The break proved decisive and at 5-3, Norman converted his
second match point.

Sudanese opposition leader arrives in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ John Garang, the leader of Sudan's largest
rebel group, arrived Sunday for a meeting of Sudanese opposition.
	   Garang, who heads the Sudan People's Liberation Army, is to meet
Tuesday with former Prime Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi and Mohammed
Osman al-Mirgani, who heads the National Democratic Alliance. The
NDA is an umbrella group for Sudanese opposition bodies.
	   The meeting comes at Egypt's request. The Egyptian government
fears that the civil war in southern and eastern Sudan could lead
to a division of the country that would affect the control of the
Nile River, the overwhelming source of Egypt's water.
	   The meeting comes after peace talks between the rebels and the
Sudanese government failed to make headway Friday. At issue were a
cease-fire, the boundaries of southern Sudan, the role of Islam and
a referendum on self-determination for the non-Muslim south.
	   Garang's rebels have been fighting since 1983 for greater
autonomy for the south from the Islamic north. More than 1.5
million people have died in the fighting and related famines.
	   Garang did not speak to reporters on arrival.

Zuelle plans to defend Spanish crown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FIXES overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Alex Zuelle, one of the Swiss riders
implicated in the cycling drug scandal, hopes to defend his crown
in the the Tour of Spain next month.
	   In an interview with the SonntagsZeitung newspaper Sunday,
Zuelle said his top priority was to train to regain condition in
time for the Spanish classic.
	   He pulled out of the mountainous 232-kilometer (144-mile) San
Sebastian race in northern Spain after 200 kilometers (125 miles)
Saturday _ the first world-class event since the Tour de France.
	   Given the disruption in his cycling schedule, he said he was
happy with his performance.
	   Zuelle and other members of the Festina team were expelled from
the Tour de France last month after the team was found with the
banned performance-boosting hormone, EPO. He confessed to using the
drug.
	   The Swiss cycling federation will decide on sanctions _
including a possible ban _ after receiving a report from world
cycling's governing body.
	   Zuelle said Festina owner Miguel Rodriguez planned to continue
to the end of the season and wanted his riders to do likewise.
	   ``I'm paid by Rodriguez to compete in races and now I want to
concentrate fully on my job,'' he told the paper.
	   ``I have to build myself back up again as I'm meant to start in
the Vuelta (Tour of Spain), which wasn't on my original schedule,''
he said.
	   Zuelle won last year's Tour of Spain. This year's event starts
Sept. 5.

China blows dikes in attempt to lower swollen Yangtze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout &QL;

 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Levees were dynamited along a stretch of the
swollen Yangtze River on Sunday in an effort to divert floodwaters
menacing cities and farmland in central China's Hubei province.
	   Secondary dikes were blown at 12 a.m. (0400 GMT) in Jianli
County, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) upriver from the industrial
center of Wuhan, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. More
solid primary dikes farther back from the river remain intact.
	   Police forced 50,000 residents _ many of them ``reluctant to
move'' _ out of their homes ahead of the flooding, Xinhua said. The
government has promised that residents affected by flood diversions
will be compensated for lost property and crops.
	   Engineers hope the diversion of up to 800 million cubic meters
(28 billion cubic feet) of water into farmland behind the dike will
lower the raging Yangtze's water level by 10-25 centimeters (4-10
inches), Xinhua reported.
	   If successful, the deliberate flooding at Jianli could remove
the need to flood the much larger Jingjiang diversion area farther
upriver, where 330,000 people have already been evacuated to high
ground.
	   At 7 p.m. Sunday, the river at Shashi north of the Jingjiang
diversion area stood at 44.65 meters (147.3 feet), dangerously high
but still below the 45-meter (148.5-foot) mark at which authorities
say they will be forced to flood the area, Xinhua said.
	   Jingjiang was last used to divert the Yangtze in 1954, when
floods killed more than 30,000 people.
	   More than 2,000 people have died nationwide this summer in
floods caused by seasonal rains that arrived a month early and fell
much harder than usual. Millions more have been left homeless due
to dikes collapsing along many parts of the Yangtze and its
tributaries in central and eastern China.
	   Soldiers and civilian volunteers plugged a major breach in the
Yangtze dike at Jiujiang city that burst Friday, the state-owned
China Central Television reported.
	   The breach flooded a 4-square-kilometer (1.6-square-mile) area
of the city, but residents were evacuated and no injuries were
reported, Xinhua said.
	   Authorities worry that more of the approximately 30,000
kilometers (18,600 miles) of Yangtze dikes could collapse after
weeks of rain and flooding.
	   Soldiers and residents of riverside communities have kept up
around-the-clock vigils on dikes for weeks, filling cracks and
guarding against undermining by the river.
	   CCTV news showed soldiers in boats rescuing people from trees
and partially submerged homes, but did not say where or when the
footage was taken. Floating bodies were spotted in the countryside
around Jiujiang where dikes burst last week, said photographers who
traveled in the area over the weekend.
	   One woman's corpse lay exposed for three days because residents
were too busy shoring up dikes to transport it to a morgue, they
said.
	   A flood crest, the fourth this year, was heading toward Jiujiang
after roaring through upstream sections of the river in Hubei
province Saturday, Xinhua said. Water levels at Wuhan, an
industrial center in Hubei with 7 million inhabitants, have been
rising slowly since Saturday, it said.

Kofi Annan sets out to prove that the U.N. belongs to the people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Sunday urged ordinary people to reclaim the United Nations as their
own _ a call he promptly reinforced by approaching some protesters
demonstrating against Indonesia's occupation of East Timor.
	   ``Mr. Annan, don't forget East Timor,'' shouted 23-year-old
Carlos Borneo as the secretary-general emerged from visiting the
United Nations pavilion at Lisbon's Expo '98 World Fair.
	   Annan approached Borneo's small group of protesters through a
sea of security guards.
	   ``I hear what you say. We are doing our best about East Timor''
he said, referring to recent U.N.-sponsored talks on the disputed
half-island territory before being whisked away for lunch with
Premier Antonio Guterres at the Portuguese pavilion.
	   Minutes before, Annan stressed at a joint press conference with
Guterres that persuading people to view the U.N. as ``their
organization'' was the key to revitalizing its work.
	   ``I know for a while we were too distant from the people. Too
bureaucratic,'' he said.
	   Annan arrived Friday in Portugal, where the focus of his
five-day visit is a U.N-sponsored international conference on youth
policy. He also is scheduled to meet with officials close to peace
efforts in Algeria, the former Portuguese colonies of Angola,
Guinea-Bissau and East Timor.
	   Annan talked briefly on Sunday about what he called ``the
delicate situation'' in Angola.
	   He said preliminary reports from the recent 10-day visit of his
special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to the southwest African country
indicated ``the threat of an escalation of the violence has
receded.''
	   Brahimi's trip was prompted by the threat of a return to
full-scale conflict, four years after a U.N.-brokered accord sealed
a tenuous end to a 20-year civil war between UNITA rebels and
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' government.
	   Annan called on Dos Santo and UNITA's emblematic leader Jonas
Savimbi to fulfill their promises to relaunch the peace process.
	   ``After so many decades of war, the people of Angola need and
deserve peace and their leaders have the responsibility to do all
they can,'' he said.
	   Annan also mentioned the U.N. investigative mission to Algeria
headed by former Portuguese President Mario Soares who looked into
the massacres and bombings that have killed an estimated 75,000
people since 1992. Soares returned to Lisbon last week to draw up a
report.
	   Annan said he had no yet seen the report, but stressed the group
was able to visit prisons and massacre sites and talk to a far
wider range of sources than previously possible.
	   Annan was due to leave Portugal on Tuesday for a vacation in his
native Ghana.

Thousands pay respects to former Communist ruler Zhivkov

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Carrying photos of their longtime
dictator and red Communist flags, thousands of mostly elderly
Bulgarian mourners marched Sunday through the Bulgarian capital in
a final tribute to the late Todor Zhivkov.
	   Zhivkov, who ruled Bulgaria for 35 years until his ouster in
1989, died Wednesday at age 86 after falling into a coma. He was
eastern Europe's last surviving Stalinist leader.
	   More than 10,000 people gathered on a central square to pay
their last respects to Zhivkov, despite blazing heat.
	   His coffin was placed on the stairway outside the former Royal
Palace, directly opposite the now-defunct mausoleum of Zhivkov's
communist predecessor Georgi Dimitrov. On every public holiday for
three and a half decades, Zhivkov appeared on the mausoleum's
balcony to cheer the marching by jubilant crowds.
	   Officials of the reformist government were conspicuously absent
from the memorial ceremony, organized by the family and the
Socialist party that emerged from Zhivkov's former Communist party.
	   Thousands later walked in behind the car carrying the coffin the
entire four kilometers (2.5 miles) to the general cemetery for
burial.
	   Former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev's grandson Andrei was among
the few foreign guests at the ceremony. Russian ultranationalist
Vladimir Zhirinovsky sent a wreath.
	   ``The years when Zhivkov ruled will remain in Bulgaria's history
as the golden age,'' said Yordan Yotov, one of Zhivkov's closest
party mates.
	   Other speakers praised also Zhivkov's policy and accused the
current government of having ``destroyed all achievements of
socialism.''
	   To fierce applause, the leader of the anti-fascist union Velko
Valkanov said that ``the era of socialism is only now beginning.''
	   ``Zhivkov is dead. Long live socialism,'' he told the crowd.
	   Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov said Thursday that Zhivkov's
death signaled an end to the era of Bulgarian communism. He called
Zhivkov's years in power a ``dark era.''
	   Zhivkov became first secretary of Bulgaria's Stalinist Communist
Party in 1954. In 1962 he became prime minister, and in 1971 head
of state.
	   Abandoned by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who viewed
old-style Stalinists as a major embarrassment, Zhivkov was ousted
as head of the Communist Party in 1989.
	   He spent the rest of his life in political oblivion, fighting
medical problems toward the end. But he was remembered by
loyalists.
	   ``During Zhivkov's time I studied free of charge, my medical
treatment was free, my life was good,'' said 65-year-old Elena
Kamenova, who spent two hours in 31 degree heat (88 Fahrenheit) on
the square.
	   Zhivkov's final resting place is a family grave next to his
daughter Ludmila, who died in 1981 at age 40. According to the
official account, Zhivkov's daughter died of natural causes, but
there were rumors she was poisoned because her work as culture
minister was counter to the Soviet line.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An airplane hijacking ended peacefully at a Moscow
airport on Sunday after a four-hour standoff between security
forces and the anonymous author of a note who demanded dlrs 100,000
and threatened to blow up the plane.
	   No ransom was paid. No bomb was found. Neither was the
perpetrator.
	   The incident began while the East Line TU-154 aircraft was en
route to Moscow from the Siberian city of Tyumen, about 2,400
kilometers (1,500 miles) to the east.
	   Crew members came across a threatening note in the business
section and passed it to the pilots, officials said. According to
the ITAR-Tass news agency, the note warned that ``there is a bomb
on board. We will detonate it if we are not given 621,000 rubles
(dlrs 100,000). We need the money in Moscow.''
	   The note instructed authorities to place the money in five bags
in the airplane's bathroom. It also demanded on onward flight to
another country, officials said.
	   After the plane landed at Moscow's Domodedovo airport, police
and special forces in armored personnel carriers and officials from
the Federal Security Service _ the main successor to the KGB _ were
deployed on the tarmac. But there was no one for them to negotiate
with, since none of the 97 passengers owned up to writing the
ransom note.
	   First women and children were let off the plane. Once the
security forces determined that no one on board was carrying a
weapon, the 70 male passengers were taken inside the terminal for
questioning and all the luggage was searched. Handwriting samples
were being analyzed, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, airport security has
deteriorated, particularly at regional airports. There have been a
number of hijackings on domestic flights, but in most cases the
hijacker has surrendered following negotiations with authorities.

Palestinian wounded in south Lebanon bomb explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A bomb exploded at a refugee camp in
southern Lebanon Sunday, wounding a Palestinian worker.
	   Kaisar Baalous, 35, suffered shrapnel wounds in both legs after
a grenade was hurled by a man in a speeding car at a garbage dump
at Ein el-Hilweh, the largest of Lebanon's 13 refugee camps, said
security officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Baalous was searching for scrap copper at the garbage dump when
the bomb exploded near an office of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction at the camp, the officials said.
	   He was rushed to a hospital in the camp, which is located on the
outskirts of the port city of Sidon in southern Lebanon.
	   The motive for the incident was not immediately known. Arafat's
supporters and opponents have in the past battled for control of
Ein el-Hilweh, home to 75,000 Palestinian refugees.
	   Some 350,000 Palestinians live in Lebanon's refugee camps.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime detained 18
foreigners Sunday for distributing pamphlets the government said
were aimed at inciting unrest.
	   The detentions came a day after the 10th anniversary of a
nationwide uprising against military rule passed without unrest
anywhere in Myanmar, also known as Burma, according to the
government.
	   Those held included six U.S. citizens, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Philippines nationals and one
Australian, a government official said in a statement faxed to The
Associated Press in Bangkok.
	   The coalition of private organizations that sent the activists
confirmed the nationalities but released the name only of Jaran
Dithachai, a political science professor at Bangkok's Rangsit
University, pending notification of families.
	   Annelyn Deluna, a coalition member, said that all 18 activists
sent to Myanmar to hand out ``goodwill messages'' supporting human
rights and democracy had been arrested.
	   ``We thought there were six who reached the airport, but it
seems that the last time they were seen they were being brought to
an office in the airport,'' Deluna said.
	   They did not arrive in Bangkok on their scheduled flight.
	   The government statement said 18 foreigners ``were apprehended
attempting to incite unrest in Yangon.''
	   ``Foreigners who were distributing the pamphlets in downtown
Yangon were reported to the police by citizens and taken to police
stations for questioning and are being detained while the
investigation continues,'' the statement added.
	   Pamphlets and other seditious material were found in their hotel
rooms, it said.
	   The government identified the organizers as Na Ga Forum Asia
Group, but the activists told The Associated Press that that was
the name of their travel agency.
	   The government said the foreigners arrived on tourist visas
Friday from Bangkok and planned to leave Sunday. No names were
released.
	   ``Despite these efforts for agitation, conditions in Yangon,
Mandalay and other parts of the country are peaceful and calm,''
the statement said.
	   Embassies had no immediate information about their citizens in
detention. The government would not be legally bound to report
arrests for the first 24 hours, diplomats said.
	   Exile groups and pro-democracy activists had been predicting for
weeks that the people of Myanmar might rise up against the
government Saturday.
	   It was the anniversary of Aug. 8, 1988, when months of
discontent erupted into nationwide protests against military rule.
The government changed leaders but eventually crushed the unrest
with bullets and bayonets. As many as 3,000 people died.
	   On the anniversary day, Yangon and other parts of Myanmar were
quiet, the government and independent witnesses said. Security was
remarkably light. No demonstrations were confirmed Sunday except
the pamphleteering.
	   Sources close to the opposition National League for Democracy
told reporters in Bangkok that leader Aung San Suu Kyi had ordered
her supporters not to provoke the military.
	   The anniversary came two weeks ahead of an Aug. 21 deadline set
by Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, for the
government to finally convene the parliament elected in 1990.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the vote, but the military
never allowed the parliament to meet. The military has ruled the
country since 1962.
	   Government newspapers said Sunday that the peaceful anniversary
could be attributed to fear.
	   ``Even though the democracy princess wanted the people to go out
on the streets and create an anarchy in the country, the people
dare not break the laws of the existing government,'' said an
opinion piece.
	   The government stiffened its security detail on the streets
around Suu Kyi's house Sunday after complying with her requests to
withdraw the detachment from her property.
	   Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest or largely confined to
her home for the past decade, recently engaged authorities in a
six-day standoff on a road outside the capital.

Assailants open fire on NATO peace force in Bosnia; no injuries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Soldiers serving in the
NATO-led peace force in southern Bosnia came under fire twice over
the weekend in separate incidents, NATO said Sunday.
	   No one was injured in the shooting incidents against
peacekeepers _ the first in Bosnia in months.
	   The attacks occurred late Saturday and early Sunday, a few
kilometers (miles) apart near the town of Jablanica, 50 kilometers
(30 miles) south of Sarajevo.
	   In both occasions, one or more persons fired several shots in
the direction of NATO troops and quickly withdrew into darkness.
One armored vehicle was hit and NATO did not return fire, said Maj.
Sheena Thomson, a spokeswoman for the alliance.
	   Thomson declined to identify the nationalities of the
peacekeepers who were shot at, but the region is controlled mostly
by French, German and Italian troops.
	   NATO was unaware of who carried out the attacks or why, Thomson
said, adding that details were passed to the local authorities and
U.N. police monitors who will investigate the incidents further.
It's possible the perpetrator was the same in both incidents.
	   ``This was an isolated incident, very rare,'' Thomson said.
``But we are obviously monitoring the situation very closely.''
	   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
incidents may be a result of rising tensions across the country
ahead of September general elections.
	   Since NATO deployed its multinational peace force in Bosnia in
1995, 85 of its soldiers have died on duty. Most were victims of
traffic accidents or land mine blasts.

Palestinian legislators approve Arafat's Cabinet

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian legislators approved
Yasser Arafat's new Cabinet by a wide margin on Sunday, despite
criticism that the Palestinian leader had done nothing to address
charges of widespread government corruption.
	   The vote of support left Arafat free to refocus his attention
from internal politics to the deadlocked peace process with Israel.
	   The legislative council, which is dominated by Arafat's Fatah
faction, approved the Cabinet by a vote of 55-28 with three
abstentions. The new ministers were to be sworn in at a ceremony
Sunday night in the Gaza Strip.
	   Arafat announced the new Cabinet last week, a year after
legislators demanded the old one be dissolved because of
corruption. But he left in place most of the former ministers _
including those accused of corruption _ and added 10 others.
	   Two ministers _ Hanan Ashrawi and Abdel Jawad Saleh _ quit last
week in protest.
	   Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian political leader, said Sunday
that the substantial vote against the new Cabinet was ``a warning
signal ... that this government has to face the serious
expectations of the people.''
	   Husam Khader, a Fatah legislator who voted against the Cabinet,
said the council, ``by giving a vote of confidence to this
government, has legalized corruption.''
	   The council demanded last year that Arafat dissolve the Cabinet
after a legislative committee report found extensive abuses in all
government ministries and recommended that three ministers _
Planning Minister Nabil Shaath, Civil Affairs Minister Jamil
Tarifi, and Transportation Minister Ali Qawasmeh _ be put on trial.
The three ministers, who denied any wrongdoing, all retained their
jobs in the new Cabinet.
	   The committee report followed a government audit that found
nearly half the Palestinian Authority's dlrs 800 million annual
budget had been squandered through corruption and mismanagement.
	   Many legislators complained that the new Cabinet, which creates
three new government ministries, would further burden the coffers
of the Palestinian Authority, which depends on foreign donors for
more than half of its budget.
	   Several legislators said they voted in favor of the new Cabinet
as a show of support for Arafat in his dealings with Israel.
	   ``We should not fight over ministries, but come together to
build the state,'' said Mufid Abed Rabbo.
	   Palestinian political analyst Ghassan Khatib said the
legislators' approval of the same ministers they had declared
corrupt a year ago would further undermine the credibility of the
council, which has struggled to be taken seriously and play a real
part in governing the Palestinian territories.

Tehran's former mayor to file appeal corruption conviction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The former mayor of Tehran, who was
sentenced to five years in jail last month for corruption, will
file an appeal this week, his lawyer was reported as saying Sunday.
	   ``Nothing but acquittal is expected,'' said Bahman Keshavarz,
lawyer of of the deposed mayor, Gholamhossein Karbaschi.
	   ``We will use all legal channels to prove that Karbaschi is
clear of all the charges,'' Keshavarz was quoted by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
	   He said he would lodge the appeal by Thursday.
	   Last month, Karbaschi was found guilty of embezzlement during
his 8-year term as Tehran's mayor and ordered to pay large fines.
He was banned from holding any government job for 20 years.
	   During his trial, which lasted more than a month, Karbaschi
admitted making mistakes, but denied stealing public money.
	   Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate President Mohamamad Khatami,
had been a target of the president's hard-line political rivals and
many Iranians say the trial was a political settling of scores.

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Police and leftist guerrillas fought a
fierce gun battle Sunday in the jungles of southeastern India,
killing nine rebels and three policemen.
	   Police said the morning battle began near the town of
Vijayanagaram, 900 kilometers (540 miles) north of Hyderabad,
capital of the Andhra Pradesh state. Guns, ammunitions, grenades
and explosives were recovered after the fighting.
	   Police said the rebels belonged to the outlawed People's War
Group, a Maoist-Leninist organization which is waging an armed
struggle against the administration to create a communist state
comprising tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh and parts of three
neighboring states.
	   Also early Sunday, another group of leftist rebels entered a
village in the eastern state of Bihar and shot dead five people in
their beds, the Press Trust of India reported. The news agency said
police identified the killers as members of the banned Maoist
Communist Center.
	   Police officials said the five victims were killed over a land
dispute.
	   The People's War Group and the Maoist Communist Center are among
a group of leftist rebels that operate in parts of central and
eastern India which is among the poorest regions in the country.
	   They mostly targets rich land owners, accusing them of
exploiting landless farmhands. They often seize the land and
redistributes it among the peasants. The rebels also frequently
attack police and administration officials, accusing them of
colluding with the land owners to deny agricultural workers their
rights.
	   More than 300 people have been killed in leftist violence this
year, police said.

Three killed in skirmish in breakaway Abkhazia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Three Abkhazian policemen were killed
after they opened fire at Georgian security forces, Georgia's
Interior Ministry said Sunday.
	   The three Abkhazians evaded Russian peacekeepers in a buffer
region separating Abkhazian and Georgian forces on Saturday night,
and entered the village of Khurcha in the Zugdidi region in a car.
Georgian policemen ordered the trio to stop, but instead the
Abkhazians started shooting, said Interior Ministry spokeswoman
Maya Mosidze. So the Georgians opened fire, as well.
	   A Georgian policeman was wounded in the skirmish, she said.
	   Georgia's northern region of Abkhazia, on the Black Sea, has
been fighting a war of secession since 1992. Although Russian
peacekeepers have been deployed in the region since 1994, clashes
between separatists and pro-Georgian forces are frequent.
	   The United Nations also has unarmed military observers in
Georgia.

China blows dikes in attempt to lower swollen Yangtze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with visit of premier in grafs 9-10 &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BEJ101-103 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Levees were dynamited along a stretch of the
swollen Yangtze River on Sunday in an effort to divert floodwaters
menacing cities and farmland in central China's Hubei province.
	   Secondary dikes were blown at 12 a.m. (0400 GMT) in Jianli
County, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) upriver from the industrial
center of Wuhan, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. More
solid primary dikes farther back from the river remain intact.
	   Police forced 50,000 residents _ many of them ``reluctant to
move'' _ out of their homes ahead of the flooding, Xinhua said. The
government has promised that residents affected by flood diversions
will be compensated for lost property and crops.
	   Engineers hope the diversion of up to 800 million cubic meters
(28 billion cubic feet) of water into farmland behind the dike will
lower the raging Yangtze's water level by 10-25 centimeters (4-10
inches), Xinhua reported.
	   If successful, the deliberate flooding at Jianli could remove
the need to flood the much larger Jingjiang diversion area farther
upriver, where 330,000 people have already been evacuated to high
ground.
	   At 7 p.m. Sunday, the river at Shashi north of the Jingjiang
diversion area stood at 44.65 meters (147.3 feet), dangerously high
but still below the 45-meter (148.5-foot) mark at which authorities
say they will be forced to flood the area, Xinhua said.
	   Jingjiang was last used to divert the Yangtze in 1954, when
floods killed more than 30,000 people.
	   More than 2,000 people have died nationwide this summer in
floods caused by seasonal rains that arrived a month early and fell
much harder than usual. Millions more have been left homeless due
to dikes collapsing along many parts of the Yangtze and its
tributaries in central and eastern China.
	   Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji inspected flood defenses in Hubei on
Saturday and Sunday, thanking soldiers and area residents for their
efforts to combat the floods.
	   The 2.9 million-strong People's Liberation Army has played a
high-profile role in official reports on the flooding, and Zhu said
the military's hand in fighting floods ``demonstrates once again
that the People's Liberation Army is the Chinese people's own
army,'' Xinhua reported.
	   Meanwhile, soldiers and civilian volunteers plugged a major
breach in the Yangtze dike at Jiujiang city that burst Friday, the
state-owned China Central Television reported.
	   The breach flooded a 4-square-kilometer (1.6-square-mile) area
of the city, but residents were evacuated and no injuries were
reported, Xinhua said.
	   Authorities worry that more of the approximately 30,000
kilometers (18,600 miles) of Yangtze dikes could collapse after
weeks of rain and flooding.
	   Soldiers and residents of riverside communities have kept up
around-the-clock vigils on dikes for weeks, filling cracks and
guarding against undermining by the river.
	   CCTV news showed soldiers in boats rescuing people from trees
and partially submerged homes, but did not say where or when the
footage was taken. Floating bodies were spotted in the countryside
around Jiujiang where dikes burst last week, said photographers who
traveled in the area over the weekend.
	   One woman's corpse lay exposed for three days because residents
were too busy shoring up dikes to transport it to a morgue, they
said.
	   A flood crest, the fourth this year, was heading toward Jiujiang
after roaring through upstream sections of the river in Hubei
province Saturday, Xinhua said. Water levels at Wuhan, an
industrial center in Hubei with 7 million inhabitants, have been
rising slowly since Saturday, it said.

Israeli air force F-16 plane crashes in Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli Air Force F-16 fighter plane crashed
shortly after take-off in northern Israel Sunday after the pilot
noticed an engine malfunction and successfully bailed out, the army
said.
	   Sunday's crash follows a series of accidents in the Israeli Air
Force this year.
	   Israel radio said the dlrs 30 million American-built F-16, which
took off from an air force base in the Jezreel Valley, crashed into
a cotton field and went up in flames.
	   The pilot was lightly injured and taken to a nearby hospital.
The Israeli army said it would investigate the crash but was not
grounding flights as a result.
	   Sunday's crash was the fourth time this year that the Israeli
army lost planes. In March, an F-15 fighter plane crashed during a
training exercise, killing both pilot and navigator. Crews survived
two subsequent crashes.

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Reports of fighting Sunday
contradicted claims by the Taliban that they were in charge of
Mazar-e-Sharif, the last major Afghan city outside the Islamic
militia's undisputed control.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance, meanwhile, was also under pressure
Sunday near Kabul in the Panjshir Valley, losing a few kilometers
(miles) of territory in overnight fighting where ousted military
chief Ahmed Shah Masood has struggled to hold ground since he and
President Burhanuddin Rabbani lost the capital two years ago.
	   The reports of fighting in Mazar-e-Sharif could not be
independently confirmed. But a fierce defense of Mazar-e-Sharif had
been expected. Its loss would be a severe blow to an opposition
backed into a dwindling corner of northern Afghanistan, and a boost
to the Taliban's four-year-old campaign to impose their strict
interpretation of Islamic rule on all of Afghanistan.
	   Spokesman Wakeel Ahmad Muttakeel, reached by satellite phone at
Taliban military headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar,
said Mazar-e-Sharif was calm and completely under their control
Sunday. But Indian-based Afghan Ambassador Masood Khalili, who has
remained loyal to Rabbani, said street fighting was escalating
Sunday in Mazar-e-Sharif, some 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of
Kabul, a day after Taliban fighters entered it.
	   Khalili also accused Taliban fighters of killing civilians,
targeting minority Shiite Muslims in particular.
	   Azizullah Shashaq, another coalition representative, said his
forces held the airport on the eastern edge of Mazar-e-Sharif. He
reported fighting near the airport Sunday, and added he had heard
of heavy fighting to the north, in Kunduz province. Shashaq had no
details.
	   Muttakeel, the Taliban spokesman, said his group had captured
Mazar-e-Sharif's airport but were unable to use it, indicating it
remained under fire or contested.
	   Muttakeel also denied Iranian television reports the Taliban
were holding 11 Iranian diplomats in Mazar-e-Sharif. He said the
diplomats' whereabouts were unknown.
	   Neighboring Iran has backed the northern alliance, while
Pakistan, another neighbor, has backed the Taliban.
	   The Taliban, whose name means ``students of Islam,'' emerged in
1994, pledging to bring peace to Afghanistan after years of civil
war. In the areas they control, they have barred girls from school
and confined most women to their homes.
	   In some parts of Afghanistan, the Taliban have bribed military
commanders to surrender or counted on being welcomed by local
residents eager to embrace anyone promising peace or to accept the
Taliban as their ethnic brothers.
	   But Mazar-e-Sharif is inhabited mostly by ethnic Uzbeks and
Tajiks, while the Taliban, like most other Afghans, are Pashtuns.
The Taliban are Sunni, while the Hezb-e-Wahadat militia that calls
Mazar-e-Sharif its stronghold is made up of Shiites. Residents
resented Taliban attempts last year to impose their version of
Islam on Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Last May, the Taliban entered Mazar-e-Sharif at the invitation
of a warlord who had turned on his anti-Taliban allies. The warlord
then turned again _ allegiance-switching has been a hallmark of
Afghanistan's years of civil war _ and the Taliban took heavy
casualties while being driven out.
	   ``Last year, we were invited in. But this time, we burned the
mountains,'' said Taliban spokesman Abdul Manam Niyazi, using an
expression for heavy fighting while speaking Saturday by satellite
phone from Mazar-e-Sharif.

Iran says POW exchange obstacle to better ties with Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran signaled its willingness Sunday to
normalize relations with neighboring Iraq, but said that exchanging
all prisoners from their 1980-88 war must come first.
	   ``Efforts should be made to normalize ties between the two
countries, and as a prerequisite the existing hindrances on the way
should be identified and removed,'' said Hassan Rowhani, secretary
of Iran's Supreme National Security Council.
	   Iran and Iraq ``must strive to release all of the prisoners of
war,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Rowhani as
saying in a meeting with Iraq's outgoing charge d'affaires in
Tehran, Salah Nouri al-Samarmad.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein urged Iran to normalize relations
Saturday, saying that any step by Tehran to upgrade ties would be
met by ``all cooperation ... from the Arabs, with Iraq in front.''
	   Last month, Iran claimed Iraq still held nearly 4,000 POWs and
accused Baghdad of insincerity in trying to resolve the issue. Iraq
and Iran had signed a deal in June to solve the dispute, which has
long stood in the way of better ties.
	   In April, Iran released 5,584 Iraqi POWs and Iraq freed three
POWs and 316 Iranians it classified as civil law detainees. It was
the largest repatriation of Iranian and Iraqi prisoners since 1990.
	   Rowhani, who also serves as deputy parliament speaker, said
``there is great potential for expansion of trade and economic
relations between Iran and Iraq,'' IRNA reported.
	   He also stressed the importance of border security, saying
Iranian and Iraqi security officials should meet regularly to
discuss the issue. Iran and Iraq accuse each other of allowing
infiltrators to sneak across their borders for acts of sabotage.

Kuchma celebrates 60th birthday, meets CIS leaders

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma on Sunday welcomed
high-ranking officials from the former Soviet republics to the
Black Sea peninsula of Crimea for his 60th birthday celebration.
	   Among the guests was Azerbaijan's President Geidar Aliev, who
said that he had made the trip to demonstrate his ``great respect''
for Kuchma.
	   Aliev also touched on Ukraine's plans to transport some Caspian
Sea oil from Azerbaijan to the West, saying Ukraine would
``definitely'' have a role in oil transport, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Rybkin also arrived to
congratulate Kuchma. He said he would discuss the planned summit
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, scheduled for mid-September,
with the Ukrainian leader.
	   Rybkin called Sunday's celebration ``not only an event in the
life of one man but an event in the life of friendly, brotherly
Ukraine.'' He voiced hope that Russia's reluctant parliament would
soon ratify Moscow's friendship treaty with Ukraine, signed in 1997
to end years of post-Soviet friction.
	   Meanwhile, in a personal message to Kuchma, Yeltsin stressed
what he called Moscow's strategic partnership with Ukraine, which
``corresponds to the basic interests of the people of Russia and
Ukraine,'' Interfax reported.
	   Kuchma, who is vacationing in Crimea, also received
congratulatory notes from U.S. President Bill Clinton, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, French President Jacques Chirac and other
world leaders.
	   Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze decided to congratulate
Kuchma in person.
	   ``We have a great personal friendship, full mutual understanding
and deep and respectful relationship. I'll try to show this today
both to him and the whole Ukrainian people,'' Shevardnadze said.

Lawyer blames state security service in Serb war crimes suspect's
</HEADLINE>
death &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The lawyer for a Serb war crimes
suspect who was shot to death in a bar brawl claimed in an
interview published Sunday that the Serbian state security service
orchestrated the killing.
	   Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was killed Friday night
by an off-duty Serbian policeman after a dispute in a late-night
bar in central Serbia. He had been indicted by the U.N. War Crimes
Tribunal for atrocities in Bosnia.
	   Police said that Miljkovic insulted the policeman's girlfriend
and that after a heated argument, the policeman shot Miljkovic and
also killed two others in random firing.
	   Miljkovic's lawyer, Tatomir Lekovic, questioned the official
version in an interview with the independent Belgrade daily Dnevni
Telegraf, saying the shooting was prearranged and ``Miljkovic died
because he knew too much.''
	   ``The State Security Service is behind all this. ... He knew a
lot about the Bosnian war and somebody wanted to make sure he never
gets to The Hague (tribunal),'' Lekovic was quoted as saying,
adding that there were previous attempts to kill his client.
	   Miljkovic fought in 1992 as a Serb volunteer, allegedly killing
Muslims and Croats. Later he returned to his native Serbia, the
larger of the two remaining Yugoslav republics, where authorities
have dodged demands to extradite him and several other suspects to
the tribunal based in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   The paper also quoted eyewitnesses who said it was the
policeman, not Miljkovic, who harassed the women and that Miljkovic
died trying to protect her.

<TEXT>
	   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany (AP) _ A C-141 cargo plane carrying
15 critically and seriously injured victims of the Nairobi embassy
bombing arrived Sunday at Ramstein Air Base, where they were met by
medical teams and a squadron of ambulances.
	   Forty ground and medical personnel rushed to meet the plane and
help the 10 Americans and five Kenyans to eight ambulances headed
to the U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl. Most were carried on
stretchers, but several were able to walk, including one woman with
bandaged eyes escorted by two nurses.
	   An Army helicopter waited nearby to fly a critically injured
Kenyan, a U.S. embassy employee, immediately to a neurosurgical
intensive care unit at the University Medical Center in Homburg, 30
kilometers (20 miles away).
	   Lt. Col. Russ Turner, chief medical officer on board, said the
patients endured the 9-hour journey from Nairobi quietly. The
injuries were typical of a bombing attack, he said, including eye
injuries and broken bones.
	   ``Everyone did quite well,'' Turner said. ``They are very
seriously, seriously injured, traumatized mentally as well as
physically.''
	   Flags at the base 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of
Frankfurt flew at half-mast. U.S. Charge d'Affaires Michael Polt
also was on hand to meet the plane, standing in for vacationing
U.S. Ambassador John Kornblum.
	   The C-141, tasked for the mission because it can make the long
journey without a refueling stop, will be loaded with additional
medical supplies, including surgical packets and tubing, for a
return flight to Nairobi later Sunday.
	   The cargo plane was scheduled to return to Ramstein on Monday
with less critically injured patients, said hospital commander Col.
Lawrence R. Whitehurst
	   Another plane carrying U.S. State Department and FBI
investigators, along with medical supplies, departed Ramstein
overnight Saturday for Kenya, base officials said.

Allen, despite triple bogey, wins German Open by a stroke
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAD SAAROW, Germany (AP) _ Australia's Stephen Allen, in his
second year on the tour, fired a 3-under-par 69 Sunday to capture
the German Open by a stroke.
	   The 24-year-old won the dlrs 1.15 million event with a 8-under
280, charging from behind as Spain's Ignacio Garrido let a
three-stroke lead after 13 holes slip away.
	   Garrido, the defending champion, finished tied for second with
England's Mark Roe and Ireland's Padraig Harrington at the dlrs
1.15 million event.
	   Allen survived a triple bogey on the par-3 13th, after his drive
sliced right into a grove of trees and he was forced to hit from
under the branches.
	   ``I thought I was playing for second then,'' said Allen, whose
victory was his first on the tour.
	   Both Roe and Garrido, whose problems began when he double bogied
the short 13th, went one stroke over par on the 17th hole to lose
their chance of catching Allen.
	   Allen's best finish had been second at the Dubai Classic, while
he also had a chance to win at Cannes in April.
	   ``But my head came off there and I shot an 81. I just tried to
stay calm today,'' he said.
	   Garrido, the last of the leaders to finish, had a final chance
to catch Allen on the 18th. But the European Ryder Cup player's
eight meter (24 feet) birdie putt fell short.

Catholics place more crosses at Auschwitz
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Defying Israeli calls for the removal of
dozens of crosses from outside the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz,
Roman Catholic faithful erected five new crosses at the disputed
site over the weekend.
	   Ordinary Catholics have vowed to erect 152 crosses at the site
to commemorate each of the Poles executed there by the Nazis. Over
the weekend, they added five more ranging in size from 1 to 4
meters (3 to 12 feet) to a field of more than 90 crosses, further
escalating tensions in Israeli-Polish relations.
	   Catholic faithful are multiplying the number of crosses outside
the camp to protest efforts to remove a larger, eight-meter
(26-foot) cross that has stood just meters from the camp's wall
since 1988.
	   The cross was the backdrop to a 1979 papal mass, and later was
moved to the site, at the time a Carmelite nunnery, to commemorate
Polish martyrs.
	   Jewish groups have long protested the presence of the larger
cross, visible from the camp's death wall where thousands were
executed, as disrespectful of the Holocaust's Jewish victims.
	   Efforts to resolve the dispute _ pitting Jewish groups
safeguarding the memory Holocaust victims and Poles commemorating
the deaths of citizens executed by the Nazis at the site _ have
made little progress despite years of discussion and mediation.
	   As the field of crosses grew, the Israeli government lodged a
formal appeal last week to remove the religious symbols.
	   The Polish government responded that it did not have the
authority to intervene, saying the property was privately owned and
that the placement of religious symbols was the responsibility of
the Roman Catholic Church.
	   Roman Catholic bishops will meet Aug. 26 at Poland's holiest
shrine, the Black Madonna monastery in Czestochowa, in an effort to
find a solution. However, the church hierarchy appears split.
	   The head of the Polish church, Jozef Glemp, rebuked Israel's
appeal, calling it an ``imposition of foreign will.''
	   But Glemp's deputy, Archbishop Henryk Muszynski took a more
conciliatory tone, saying ``cross must not be used for fighting.''
	   In a step that many hoped would ease tensions, Carmelite nuns
who had long inhabited a convent on the property turned it over to
the state. However, a veterans' group claimed property rights based
on a 35-year-old lease, further complicating the issue.

 &UR; Solid construction may have kept toll low in Tanzania embassy
bombing &QL; 
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The bomb outside the U.S. Embassy
in Tanzania was so powerful that it shook furniture in homes a mile
away.
	   But the solid construction of the Israeli-built embassy may have
prevented the carnage of a similar bomb in Kenya, an official said
Saturday.
	   Another reason was the location _ a quiet tree-lined
neighborhood.
	   The embassy away from the center of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's
laid-back capital of swaying palms and sparse traffic that is
largely free from the congestion that plagues most other major
African cities.
	   In comparison, the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, which was hit only
minutes earlier by another blast, is located on the corner of one
of the busiest intersections in the bustling Kenyan capital.
	   The area around the Nairobi embassy is devastated. A four-story
building next door is now nothing but a pile of ruble, and the
windows and interiors of other buildings nearby are blasted and
blackened. The ground is a sea of shattered glass and twisted
metal.
	   Jim Strickland, an American search-and-rescue expert who was at
the Oklahoma City bombing, said there were distinct similarities
with the scene in Nairobi.
	   ``The perimeter looks a lot like Oklahoma City,'' he said.
	   At least 190 people died in the Nairobi blast, and more than
4,000 were injured. In Dar es Salaam the toll was 10 dead and 74
injured.
	   ``If you walk through the embassy, you will see such devastation
in evey room, it is shocking there were no deaths'' inside, said a
U.S. diplomat in Dar es Salaam, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Eight of the dead worked at the embassy, the other two were in
the cab of a water tanker truck that was servicing the building.
	   The blast occurred in front of the main gate.
	   Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa Sunday toured the scene of
what he called an ``inhuman, evil, despicable'' act.
	   ``These are people who are enemies of our country and of the
United States,'' he said of the unidentified bombers. ``To say they
didn't wish us well is an understatement. And they don't like the
good relations between our two countries.''
	   The National Muslim Council of Tanzania also condemned the
bombing, calling it ``barbaric'' and ``an act of inhumanity.''
	   FBI agents, U.S. counter-terrorism operatives and State
Departent officials began arriving Sunday to investigate into the
bombing. Scores of Marines also were flying in.
	   By late Sunday, more than 100 people were expected.
	   The embassy building was constructed by security-conscious
Israel, which takes extraordinary precautions to protect against
terrorist acts.
	   It housed the Israeli embassy briefly before Israel was forced
to close its embassy in Tanzania _ as well as those in most other
African nations _ after the 1973 Mideast war when African nations
broke diplomatic ties, according to Haim Koren, a spokesman for the
Israeli Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem.
	   Although its sturdiness may have saved lives, the building did
not meet the tough security standards for new U.S. embassies, which
often resemble fortresses.
	   The building is barely 5 meters (18 feet) away from a low
perimeter wall, unacceptable under the new requirements.
	   The American diplomat said all security systems were working at
the time of the blast, which includes closed-circuit cameras atop
the four-story building. It is not known whether the video tapes
survived.
	   The embassy had received no warning or threat, the diplomat
said.
	   Investigators will likely look closely at the water tanker,
which supplied the embassy with water in times of frequent
shortages, because of reports that it concealed the explosives.
	   Although the vehicle's cabin was destroyed, the tanker survived
unscathed despite being torn off and hurled against the embassy
wall.

Lawyer blames state security service in Serb war crimes suspect's
</HEADLINE>
death &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The lawyer for a Serb war crimes
suspect who was shot to death in a bar brawl claimed in an
interview published Sunday that the Serbian state security service
orchestrated the killing.
	   Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was killed Friday night
by an off-duty Serbian policeman after a dispute in a late-night
bar in central Serbia. He had been indicted by the U.N. War Crimes
Tribunal for atrocities in Bosnia.
	   Police said that Miljkovic insulted the policeman's girlfriend
and that after a heated argument, the policeman shot Miljkovic and
also killed two others in random firing.
	   Miljkovic's lawyer, Tatomir Lekovic, questioned the official
version in an interview with the independent Belgrade daily Dnevni
Telegraf, saying the shooting was prearranged and ``Miljkovic died
because he knew too much.''
	   ``The State Security Service is behind all this. ... He knew a
lot about the Bosnian war and somebody wanted to make sure he never
gets to The Hague (tribunal),'' Lekovic was quoted as saying,
adding that there were previous attempts to kill his client.
	   Miljkovic fought in 1992 as a Serb volunteer, allegedly killing
Muslims and Croats. Later he returned to his native Serbia, the
larger of the two remaining Yugoslav republics, where authorities
have dodged demands to extradite him and several other suspects to
the tribunal based in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   The paper also quoted eyewitnesses who said it was the
policeman, not Miljkovic, who harassed the women and that Miljkovic
died trying to protect her.

South Africa 88 for five chasing 219 to win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score: ADDS byline
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ The new ball duo of Darren Gough and Angus
Fraser renewed England's optimism of winning the fifth test and the
series Sunday, reducing South Africa to 88 for five at tea on the
penultimate day at Headingley.
	   Set to make 219 runs to win the match and the series, the South
African top order capitulated soon after lunch to be parlously
placed on 27 for five before Jonty Rhodes and Brain McMillan came
to its rescue Sunday.
	   Rhodes and McMillan, the last two recognized batsmen, took the
attack to England, in a 61-run undefeated stand leaving South
Africa with another 131 runs to win.
	   Rhodes led the way with a fine 45 with five boundaries while
McMillan kept him company with 29, including five fours.
	   Gough has taken 3-10 in nine overs while Fraser has 2-36.
	   South Africa, having lost opener Gehardus Liebenberg before
lunch, lost 3-0 in 22 balls soon after, including Gary Kirsten,
Jacques Kallis and skipper Hansie Cronje.
	   Three overs later Gough, trapped Daryll Cullinan in front of the
stumps for the third lbw decision of the innings.
	   This was after South Africa's own pacemen _ Allan Donald and
Shaun Pollock _ had swept aside England's bottom half in 84
minutes.
	   Resuming the day in control of the test at 206 for four and a
lead of 184, the home side lost 6-34 to be dismissed for 240 in 115
balls.
	   Pollock, who claimed his first five-wicket haul of the series,
5-53 in 35 outstanding overs, sparked the rot, removing the night
watchman Ian Salisbury with the second ball of the day.
	   Donald, who got rid off Graeme Hick and Andrew Flintoff in five
deliveries in his second over, wrapped up the innings by dismissing
Cork and Gough, to finish with 5-71.
	   It was Donald's fourth such haul and took his series tally to 33
wickets at 19.78, a record for South Africa in England.
	   Pollock's morning spell was 10-3-14-2, while Donald's was
9.2-5-14-4.
	   The collapse once again mirrored England's batting weakness this
summer. In the first innings it lost 6-34 in 59 balls and at
Lord's, 6-11 in 71 balls when it slumped to a 10-wicket defeat.
	   Nasser Hussain, who had single-handedly guided the England
second innings, was one of the six victims, cruelly denied his
second century of the series.
	   He was out for 94, driving a Pollock delivery straight to Cronje
at mid off. He had anchored the batting for eight minutes over
seven hours and hit 13 boundaries off 341 searching deliveries.

Catholics place more crosses at Auschwitz
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Defying Israeli calls for the removal of
dozens of crosses from outside the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz,
Roman Catholic faithful erected five new crosses at the disputed
site over the weekend.
	   Ordinary Catholics have vowed to erect 152 crosses at the site
to commemorate each of the Poles executed there by the Nazis. Over
the weekend, they added five more ranging in size from 1 to 4
meters (3 to 12 feet) to a field of more than 90 crosses, further
escalating tensions in Israeli-Polish relations.
	   Catholic faithful are multiplying the number of crosses outside
the camp to protest efforts to remove a larger, eight-meter
(26-foot) cross that has stood just meters from the camp's wall
since 1988.
	   The cross was the backdrop to a 1979 papal mass, and later was
moved to the site, at the time a Carmelite nunnery, to commemorate
Polish martyrs.
	   Jewish groups have long protested the presence of the larger
cross, visible from the camp's death wall where thousands were
executed, as disrespectful of the Holocaust's Jewish victims.
	   Efforts to resolve the dispute _ pitting Jewish groups
safeguarding the memory Holocaust victims and Poles commemorating
the deaths of citizens executed by the Nazis at the site _ have
made little progress despite years of discussion and mediation.
	   As the field of crosses grew, the Israeli government lodged a
formal appeal last week to remove the religious symbols.
	   The Polish government responded that it did not have the
authority to intervene, saying the property was privately owned and
that the placement of religious symbols was the responsibility of
the Roman Catholic Church.
	   Roman Catholic bishops will meet Aug. 26 at Poland's holiest
shrine, the Black Madonna monastery in Czestochowa, in an effort to
find a solution. However, the church hierarchy appears split.
	   The head of the Polish church, Jozef Glemp, rebuked Israel's
appeal, calling it an ``imposition of foreign will.''
	   But Glemp's deputy, Archbishop Henryk Muszynski took a more
conciliatory tone, saying ``cross must not be used for fighting.''
	   In a step that many hoped would ease tensions, Carmelite nuns
who had long inhabited a convent on the property turned it over to
the state. However, a veterans' group claimed property rights based
on a 35-year-old lease, further complicating the issue.

Security beefed up at U.S. Embassy in Riyadh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi authorities have set up
checkpoints and blocked some roads to the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh
following the bombings of two U.S. missions in Africa, security
officials and residents said Sunday.
	   Saudi guards also have been instructed not to allow cars without
diplomatic license plates near the embassy, said a security
official, who was speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   An embassy spokesman said that the mission's own security
measures had been beefed up, following instructions from Washington
to U.S. embassies around the world. Nearly 200 people were killed
in the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday.
	   The bombings were the first major international attacks against
the United States since a June 25, 1996, truck bomb outside a
housing complex in Saudi Arabia killed 19 Americans.
	   Saudi Arabia launched an investigation immediately after the
attack, but it has not disclosed its findings.
	   Saudi Arabia is home to Islam's holiest shrines in Mecca and
Medina, and several Islamic groups have demanded that U.S. and
other Western forces leave the kingdom.

Arsenal outplays Manchester United 3-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEMBLEY, England (AP) _ League champion and FA Cup winner
Arsenal totally outplayed its biggest rival, Manchester United,
Sunday to score a 3-0 victory in the traditional season opener, the
Charity Shield.
	   Marc Overmars, Christopher Wreh and Nicolas Anelka fired the
three goals as the Gunners exposed weaknesses in the United defense
at Wembley, which Arsenal plans to use as its home ground during
this season's Champions Cup competition.
	   ``We've still got the same mentality and that will be the basis
for this year's challenge,'' said Arsenal striker Dennis Bergkamp,
who missed the second half because of a recurrence of a hamstring
problem. ``This is a good start.''
	   Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was encourged by the result.
	   ``This was an unexpected scoreline,'' the Frenchman said. ``It
was important because you never know where you stand before the
championship starts and it was important psychologically.''
	   Thirteen of the 22 starters were in action during the World Cup,
including's Arsenal's Emannuel Petit and Patrick Vieira, who were
on the French lineup who won it.
	   United midfielder David Beckham, cast as a World Cup villain
because his needless expulsion against Argentina led to England's
elimination, was booed by the Arsenal fans every time he touched
the ball. They also chanted ``off, off, off'' as a reminder of his
expulsion at Saint-Etienne.
	   United's England defender Gary Neville was shown the yellow card
in the third minute for hauling down Dutch World Cup star Overmars.
Irish midfielder Roy Keane, returning to the United lineup after
being sidelined for 11 months with a knee injury, was warned by the
referee for some overly robust tackling.
	   Sunday's result in what effectively is a pre-season exhibition
game will give Arsenal plenty of reasons to suggest that Wenger's
team, which downed United twice in the Premier League last season,
could dominate again.
	   But he admits his team still needs to buy again to provide cover
for his strikers, having sold veteran Ian Wright to West Ham.
	   ``I'm not going to name names, but we need a striker because we
are short in numbers if something happens to Nicolas or Dennis,''
Wenger said.
	   ``We also have so many games to play, but who we are going for I
can't tell you because I don't know 100 percent myself at the
moment.
	   ``I'm a little bit concerned because in England there is no
break in the winter and with our being involved in so many
competitions, we will have to be very cautious,'' Wenger said.
	   ``Added to that there is the possibility of injuries and losing
players to international duty, but we have a great team spirit,
they love the club and that will help a lot.''
	   Sunday's game also shows that United's Alex Ferguson has plenty
of work to do both at the training ground and in the transfer
market if the Reds are to regain the title it won four times in the
previous five seasons.
	   Ferguson has already been rejected by AC Milan striker Patrick
Kluivert and is annoyed that he so far not been able to buy Aston
Villa's Dwight Yorke.
	   ``I'm happy with the quality. But when you've got as hard a
season as we have ahead of us then you're going to need a strong
squad,'' said Ferguson who said the result was ``a really bad
scoreline.''
	   Bergkamp saw little of the ball in the opening half hour but
forced the first save of the game with a low, 25-meter (yard) drive
that Peter Schmeichel clutched at the foot of the post.
	   Two minutes later the Danish 'keeper was picking the ball out of
the net when Bergkamp raced down the right and backheeled the ball
into the danger area. With the United defense ball-watching, Anelka
left the ball to Overmars who drove it powerfully into the roof of
the net from just inside the area.
	   The second goal came 12 minutes into the second half when
Overmars pulled apart the United defense with a run down the left,
Anelka helped the ball on to Wreh whose first shot was blocked by
Schmeichel's boot.
	   The ball rebounded to the Arsenal substitute who was surrounded
by United defenders but was able to roll in into an empty net from
16 meters.
	   After United made a series of substitutions, Arsenal hit the
third with 19 minutes to go. Anelka held off a challenge from Dutch
international defender Jaap Stam and fired the ball between
Schmeichel and his near post.
	   United had few chances to hit back but Teddy Sheringham should
have scored a consolation goal nine minutes from the end when he
raced through but prodded the ball well wide with only goalkeeper
David Seaman to beat.

	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Stern John scored two goals, and Robert
Warzycha assisted on two as the Columbus Crew snapped a three-game
losing streak and beat the New England Revolution 6-1 in Major
League Soccer Saturday night.
	   The six goals were a franchise record for the Crew.
	   John scored his first goal in the 32nd minute to give the Crew
(10-11) a 2-0 lead. He scored the Crews' sixth goal in the 84th
minute.
	   Warzycha assisted on John's first goal and on a goal by Brian
McBride in the 41st minute.
	   The Crew got its first goal in the 26th minute by Jason Farrell.
	   The Crew also got goals from Thomas Dooley and Rob Smith in the
second half.
	   The lone goal for the Revolution (7-17) came in the 89th minute
by Raul Diaz Arce.
 &UR; Galaxy 2, Fire 1
	   In Chicago, Steve Jolley's header in the 90th minute lifted the
Los Angeles Galaxy to a 2-1 victory over Chicago on Saturday, for
the Fire's fifth consecutive loss.
	   With a record home crowd of 37,122 on hand at Soldier Field,
Chicago had tied the game 1-1 in the 87th minute, but Los Angeles
avoided a shootout when Jolley took a centering pass from Paul
Caligiuri and netted the game-winner just seconds before the game
ended.
	   The goal allowed the Galaxy (18-6) to widen its lead to 15
points over second-place Chicago (13-10) in the MLS' Western
Conference.
	   Both teams scored on own goals.
	   The Galaxy took a 1-0 lead in the 37th minute when Fire defender
Francis Okaroh attempted to play a header back to Chicago goalie
Jorge Campos. The ball floated over Campos' hands and into the net.
	   Chicago evened the score when Danny Pena of the Galaxy,
attempting to cut off a cross while sliding, knocked the ball
passed goalie Kevin Hartman and into his own net.
 &UR; Wizards 3, Rapids 1
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Mo Johnston scored two goals and Mark
Chung had two assists as the Wizards beat the Colorado Rapids 3-1
Saturday night at Arrowhead Stadium.
	   Johnston, who leads the Wizards with nine goals, scored with
assists from Chung and Preki in the 71st minute. Johnston had the
game-winning goal on a free kick in the 87th minute.
	   Kansas City forward Paul Wright scored on a cross from Chung in
the 90th minute.
	   The Rapids scored first in the opening half. Defender Steve
Trittschuh scored on a header off a long free kick by Chris
Henderson in the 16th minute.

Report: Dresdner bank investment advisor charged with tax fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Investigators have charged a Dresdner
Bank investment advisor with tax evasion, the first prosecution
resulting from a broad investigation into whether banks have helped
clients dodge taxes, the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel reported
Sunday.
	   Prosecutors in Kassel accuse the investment advisor of
transferring money and securities belonging to at least three
clients to Luxembourg to evade payment of a withholding tax on
interest income, the magazine reported.
	   The three clients have already been convicted of tax evasion.
	   Tax fraud investigators recently have shifted their focus to
more than 50 German banks and their employees.

Sudanese army intervenes in fighting between government factions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese army intervened in fighting
between two pro-government factions, whose battles destroyed a
police station and wounded several police officers.
	   Fighting between forces loyal to Riak Machar, head of the
government's Southern States Coordination Council, and Paulino
Matep, another faction leader, erupted at a wedding in Omdurman,
Al-Anbaa newspaper reported Sunday.
	   When police officers tried to stop it, they were beaten and a
nearby police station was burned down in the city, which is across
the Nile River from the capital Khartoum, the newspaper said.
	   The army was called in to restore order, the paper said.
	   The rivalry between Machar and Matep dates back to 1997 when
Machar's candidate defeated Matep's in provincial elections to lead
an oil-rich southern state. The elections were held under a peace
accord signed between the government and some rebel factions once
allied to the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
	   Sudan has suffered from a 15-year civil war in which southern
rebels are seeking autonomy for Christians and animists from the
Muslim-dominated north. An estimated 1.5 million people have died
in the fighting and famines caused by it.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's northern alliance
claimed to have pushed its Islamic opponents out of Mazar-e-Sharif
on Sunday, a day after the Taliban religious militia claimed to
have captured the north's biggest city.
	   The Taliban had said Mazar-e-Sharif was calm Sunday. Reports on
the situation in the city 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of the
Afghan capital could not immediately be independently confirmed.
	   Indian-based Afghan Ambassador Masood Khalili, who has remained
loyal to the president the Taliban ousted from the capital two
years ago, claimed Mazar-e-Sharif residents ``rose and took up arms
and fought along with government soldiers'' to push the Taliban
out. Khalili said Taliban casualties were heavy, but had no details
or information on alliance casualties.
	   A fierce defense of Mazar-e-Sharif had been expected. Its loss
would be a severe blow to an opposition backed into a dwindling
corner of northern Afghanistan, and a boost to the Taliban's
four-year-old campaign to impose their strict interpretation of
Islamic rule on all of Afghanistan.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance was also under pressure Sunday near
Kabul in the Panjshir Valley, losing a few kilometers (miles) of
territory in overnight fighting where ousted military chief Ahmed
Shah Masood has struggled to hold ground since he and President
Burhanuddin Rabbani lost the capital two years ago.
	   Spokesman Wakeel Ahmad Muttakeel, reached by satellite phone at
Taliban military headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar,
said Mazar-e-Sharif was calm and completely under their control
Sunday. But several opposition sources had reported sporadic street
finding before Khalili claimed a victory.
	   Khalili also accused Taliban fighters of killing civilians,
targeting minority Shiite Muslims in particular.
	   Azizullah Shashaq, another coalition representative, said his
forces held the airport on the eastern edge of Mazar-e-Sharif. He
reported fighting near the airport Sunday, and added he had heard
of heavy fighting to the north, in Kunduz province. Shashaq had no
details.
	   Muttakeel, the Taliban spokesman, said his group had captured
Mazar-e-Sharif's airport but were unable to use it, indicating it
remained under fire or contested.
	   Muttakeel also denied Iranian television reports the Taliban
were holding 11 Iranian diplomats in Mazar-e-Sharif. He said the
diplomats' whereabouts were unknown.
	   Neighboring Iran has backed the northern alliance, while
Pakistan, another neighbor, has backed the Taliban.
	   The Taliban, whose name means ``students of Islam,'' emerged in
1994, pledging to bring peace to Afghanistan after years of civil
war. In the areas they control, they have barred girls from school
and confined most women to their homes.
	   In some parts of Afghanistan, the Taliban have bribed military
commanders to surrender or counted on being welcomed by local
residents eager to embrace anyone promising peace or to accept the
Taliban as their ethnic brothers.
	   But Mazar-e-Sharif is inhabited mostly by ethnic Uzbeks and
Tajiks, while the Taliban, like most other Afghans, are Pashtuns.
The Taliban are Sunni, while the Hezb-e-Wahadat militia that calls
Mazar-e-Sharif its stronghold is made up of Shiites. Residents
resented Taliban attempts last year to impose their version of
Islam on Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Last May, the Taliban entered Mazar-e-Sharif at the invitation
of a warlord who had turned on his anti-Taliban allies. The warlord
then turned again _ allegiance-switching has been a hallmark of
Afghanistan's years of civil war _ and the Taliban took heavy
casualties while being driven out.

Netanyahu offers Israeli help investigating embassy bombings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli expert saying Saudi exile most likely
suspect in bombings
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday
offered the help of Israel's famed Mossad and other intelligence
agencies in tracking down the terrorists who bombed U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Netanyahu said early indications were that the bombings were the
result of ``international terrorism centered on Islamic
fundamentalism.''
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior Israeli official
said that exiled Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden, who lives in
Afghanistan, was one of the main suspects in the bombings, and that
Egyptian elements connected to him may also have been involved.
	   Bin Laden has threatened a holy war against U.S. troops in his
homeland and Americans elsewhere overseas and is suspected of
backing terrorist acts around the world.
	   The official would not confirm whether Israeli intelligence
officials would be sent to join the investigation.
	   Israeli army teams were leading search-and-rescue efforts in
Nairobi, and Netanyahu said he had been warmly thanked by telephone
by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and U.S. President Clinton.
	   ``We are prepared to help not only in rescue operations, but
also in international efforts _ in the intelligence field and
others _ to fight this terrorism, which we have faced for many
years,'' Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem.
	   ``Today, perhaps in light of the attack in Kenya, it is
understood how essential a broad international front is.''
	   At a news conference sponsored by Israel's Government Press
Office, terrorism expert Ely Karmon said bin Laden had recently
formed a loose coalition of six fundamentalist groups from Egypt,
Pakistan and Afghanistan.
	   Called the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and
Americans, the group issued a religious ruling calling for Muslims
to act against Americans to prevent the takeover of Islamic holy
places, Karmon said. The wording was similar to that of a
responsibility claim made in the wake of the east Africa bombings.
	   ``I think that it fits very well with all those threats and
religious rulings that were published in Afghanistan and Pakistan
in the past months,'' said Karmon, a research scholar at the
privately funded Institute for Counter Terrorism in Herzliya.
	   ``I think if we want to evaluate who was behind this attack most
of the information points exactly to these groups.''
	   Karmon noted the U.S. State Department on June 12 had issued a
statement indicating bin Laden's threats against American interests
should be taken seriously.
	   Among factors that may have prompted the bombings now, Karmon
said, were U.S. efforts _ reported in Pakistani newspapers _ to
extradite bin Laden from Afghanistan or send in commandos to take
him.
	   He also noted that two days before the latest bombings, the
Egyptian Jihad Group _ a member of the bin Laden coalition _
reportedly threatened U.S. interests, blaming American pressure for
the extradition of three fundamentalist leaders from Albania to
Egypt.

Myanmar government arrests 18 foreigners for `inciting unrest'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with no activists aboard last flight, 7th graf; Trims &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime detained 18
foreigners Sunday for distributing pamphlets the government said
were aimed at inciting unrest.
	   The detentions came a day after the 10th anniversary of a
nationwide uprising against military rule _ which ultimately ended
in a bloodbath _ passed calmly without reports of disruption
anywhere in the country, also known as Burma.
	   Those held included six U.S. citizens, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Philippines nationals and one
Australian, a government official said in a faxed statement.
	   The coalition of pro-democracy organizations that sent the
activists confirmed the nationalities but released the name only of
Jaran Dithachai, a political science professor at Bangkok's Rangsit
University, pending notification of families.
	   Annelyn Deluna, a coalition member, said that all the activists
sent to Myanmar had been arrested. They were handing out ``goodwill
messages'' supporting human rights and democracy and urging people
to remember the uprising 10 years ago.
	   ``We thought there were six who reached the airport, but it
seems that the last time they were seen they were being brought to
an office in the airport,'' Deluna said.
	   None appeared to have been aboard the last Thai Airways flight
of the day from Myanmar, Deluna said. She was hopeful they would be
deported Monday.
	   The government statement said that 18 foreigners ``were
apprehended attempting to incite unrest in Yangon.''
	   ``Foreigners who were distributing the pamphlets in downtown
Yangon were reported to the police by citizens and taken to police
stations for questioning and are being detained while the
investigation continues,'' the statement added.
	   Pamphlets and other seditious material were found in their hotel
rooms, it said.
	   The government identified the organizers as Na Ga Forum Asia
Group, but the activists told The Associated Press that that was
the name of their travel agency. They described themselves as an ad
hoc coalition of pro-democracy groups from six countries.
	   The government said the foreigners arrived on tourist visas
Friday and planned to leave Sunday. No names were released.
	   ``Despite these efforts for agitation, conditions in Yangon,
Mandalay and other parts of the country are peaceful and calm,''
said the statement, referring to the capital and the country's
second-largest city.
	   Embassies had no immediate information about their citizens in
detention. The government would not be legally bound to report
arrests for the first 24 hours, diplomats said.
	   Exile groups and pro-democracy activists had been predicting for
weeks that the people of Myanmar might rise up against the
government Saturday.
	   It was the anniversary of Aug. 8, 1988, when months of
discontent erupted into nationwide protests against military rule.
The government changed leaders but eventually crushed the unrest
with bullets and bayonets. As many as 3,000 people died.
	   But on the anniversary day, the country was quiet, the
government and independent witnesses said. Security was remarkably
light. No demonstrations were confirmed Sunday except the
pamphleteering.
	   Sources close to the opposition National League for Democracy
told reporters in Bangkok that leader Aung San Suu Kyi had ordered
her supporters not to provoke the military.
	   The anniversary came two weeks ahead of an Aug. 21 deadline set
by Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, for the
government to finally convene the parliament elected in 1990.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the vote, but the military
never allowed the parliament to meet. The military has ruled the
country since 1962.
	   ``The people dare not break the laws of the existing
government,'' an opinion piece in government newspapers said.
	   The government stiffened its security detail on the streets
around Suu Kyi's house Sunday after complying with her requests to
withdraw the detachment from her property.
	   Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest or largely confined to
her home for the past decade, recently engaged authorities in a
six-day standoff on a road outside the capital.

Report: Crime most common factor in South African farm killings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Mandela quote, opposition reaction to reports, photo

 &UR; With AP Photo JOH-101 &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ They found the farmer's body
in the bush with a bullet wound to his stomach. The license plates
of his stolen pickup had been carefully placed at his head and
feet.
	   Last week's slaying was the 74th of a South African farmer since
January, and brought the total to 554 since 1994, fueling charges
by the mainly white, conservative opposition parties that the
government of President Nelson Mandela isn't concerned enough about
the victims because of their color.
	   Seeking to end ``the propaganda and falsification,'' Mandela
said he was releasing two long-awaited intelligence reports into
the killings.
	   But the reports, described in weekend news accounts, were
inconclusive. Opposition leaders immediately demanded an
independent investigation, more money for police and commandos to
fight crime and deployment of the army to protect farmers.
	   ``There is a psychosis being created in this country that the
way for land redistribution, the redistribution of wealth, is to
attack the vulnerable,'' National Party spokesman Manie Schoeman
said Sunday.
	   The government and leaders of the African National Congress call
such allegations racially divisive propaganda, and assert they are
doing what they can.
	   ``Why the emphasis on people with white skin, and not the issue
of crime in all South Africa?'' Mandela spokesman Parks Mankahlana
said in a recent interview.
	   The reports said the main motive for the farm murders is
robbery, but do not rule out political reasons. They cited the
``viciousness'' of many attacks, in which women often are raped and
victims beaten, according to The Sunday Independent.
	   ``The attackers do not merely intend to kill the victims but
instead to inflict pain, humiliation and suffering ... . This may
indicate that the attacks are linked to racial hatred and-or sheer
terrorism,'' one of the reports said.
	   Other underlying motives cited were labor disputes and contested
land.
	   The issue has become politically explosive ahead of next year's
elections, and feeds into one of the most deeply charged issues in
South Africa -- land reform.
	   In the background are decades of mistreatment under apartheid of
black farmhands, many of whom still complain of poor conditions and
low wages.
	   Meanwhile, many farmers have armed themselves. They have banded
together into rapid-reaction forces, set up checkpoints and created
emergency radio networks.
	   ``We are approaching the situation where people are being very
frustrated,'' said Manie Schoeman, a spokesman for the National
Party, the former apartheid force.
	   ``Innocent people are going to be killed'' by the armed farmers,
he said.
	   In the latest case, 60-year-old Andre Breytenbach apparently was
surprised Wednesday as he was about to enter the gate to his
Northern Province farm in Soekmekaar, about 400 kilometers (250
miles) northeast of Johannesburg. His pickup, pistol and rifle were
stolen, and the body was found several kilometers (miles) away with
the plates on the ground.
	   The far right Freedom Front Party said the gesture symbolized
``political resentment and hate.''

	   BAD SAAROW, Germany (AP) _ Australia's Stephen Allan survived a
triple bogey Sunday as he charged from five strokes back to capture
the German Open.
	   The 24-year-old Allan, a second-year tour player, won the dlrs
1.15 million event by a stroke, firing a 3-under-par 69 and
finishing at 8-under 280.
	   Spain's Ignacio Garrido, the defending champion, let a
three-stroke lead over England's Mark Roe after the 13th hole slip
away. He was five ahead of Allan.
	   The European Ryder Cup player finished tied for second at 281
along with Roe and Ireland's Padraig Harrington.
	   Allan's triple bogey came on the short par-3 13th, after his
drive sailed left into some thick bushes.
	   ``A gust of wind got up and pulled it,'' said Allan, a
first-time tour winner. ``I thought I was playing for second at
that point, but I was determined not to let one shot ruin my
tournament.''
	   Garrido also ran into trouble on the 13th with a double bogey,
then followed with his second bogey of the day on the next hole.
	   ``Thankfully Garrido let me back in with that double bogey,''
said Allan, whose birdies on the 15th and 16th pulled him even with
the leaders.
	   Roe and Garrido's share of first slipped away when they bogied
the 17th hole while Allan was already in the clubhouse.
	   Scotland's Scott Henderson was three strokes back at 283, while
a pack of six players finished at 284. Germany's Bernhard Langer, a
five-time winner of the event, was at 285.
	   Despite perfect weather, players again stuggled to solve the
tough Sporting Club Berlin course designed by Nick Faldo. Only 24
players finished the event having cracked par.
	   Allan's best finish had been second at the Dubai Classic, while
he also had a chance to win at Cannes in April.
	   ``But my head came off there and I shot an 81. I just tried to
stay calm today,'' he said.
	   Garrido, the last of the leaders to finish, had a final chance
to catch Allan on the 18th. But the European Ryder Cup player's
eight meter (24 feet) birdie putt to tie fell short.
	   Allan took home dlrs 189,000 for his victory.

Serbs try to wrap up offensive

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Moving to crush the last remaining
rebel strongholds, Serb forces reportedly clashed with ethnic
Albanian fighters at several locations in western Kosovo on Sunday.
	   A day after one rebel faction signaled its readiness for talks,
other fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army kept up resistance
and the prospects for peace talks remained uncertain.
	   The Serbs have overrun one KLA stronghold after the other and
sent tens of thousands of civilians fleeing in the past two weeks
in a major offensive in the secessionist province of Serbia, where
ethnic Albanians comprise a vast majority of the population.
	   On Sunday, conflicting accounts from Albanian and Serb sources
both reported fighting focused near the town of Decane, about 90
kilometers (55 miles) west of Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   While the Serbs said about a dozen police checkpoints and units
came under attack and three policemen were wounded in the area, the
Albanians said government forces ``intensified attacks'' against
seven villages held by the KLA.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb forces
targeted civilians who tried to flee their homes and that two men
and two women died Saturday in Decane.
	   Some 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the south, near the town of
Djakovica, Serb forces attacked three KLA villages overnight, the
center said.
	   Even though the Serbs insist the offensive is in the mop-up
phase, the exodus of civilians out of Kosovo has continued.
Albanian TV reported Sunday that about 500 refugees have crossed
into that neighboring country in the past week.
	   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the Serb
offensive has displaced 167,000 people within Kosovo since the
conflict exploded in February, not counting another 64,000 people
who have fled the province. Hundreds have been killed, with
thousands of others remaining in the woods and hills, many of them
without food or water.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook assailed the Serbs on
Sunday for their latest attacks involving civilians, and warned
that preparations for possible NATO intervention are now complete.
He said he was particularly disturbed that the Serbs had set fire
to crops in Kosovo in recent days yo try to ensure that villagers
won't return.
	   ``The events of the last 10 days have been deeply disturbing and
have undoubtedly caused great hardship to many civilians throughout
Kosovo,'' Cook told BBC1.
	   ``This is not a war that either side can win. The only way this
war can be ended is by both sides coming to the table with an
international presence and negotiating a satisfactory
constitutional political settlement,'' he said.
	   A moderate KLA faction has agreed in principle to enter an
alliance with ethnic Albanian politicians in Kosovo, led by Ibrahim
Rugova, Rugova-allied politician Ilaz Ramajli said in the Albanian
capital Tirana on Saturday. But he acknowledged that the KLA as a
whole has not made a final decision on agreeing to talks under
Rugova's leadership.
	   Western diplomats handed both warring sides a proposal Friday
and Saturday, outlining how autonomy might work in Kosovo, which
enjoyed autonomy until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
revoked it in 1989.
	   Milosevic has indicated he would be willing to restore Kosovo's
autonomy, while ethnic Albanians are split on whether to push for
outright independence or hold talks about autonomy.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Top-seed Henrieta Nagyova of Slovakia
won her second title in a row Sunday when she overcame Olga
Barabanschikova of Belarus 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (11-9) in the final of the
dlrs 107,500 Enka Open tournament.
	   Making her first WTA final appearance, 7th seed Barabanschikova
broke to race into a 2-0 lead at the start. But Nagyova, who won
the Polish Open last week, buckled down mid-way through the first
set and won it 6-4.
	   Nagyova lost the second set 3-6, when Barabanschikova, ranked
71th, moved her around the court with a mix of spin and slice
shots.
	   But Nagyova fought back in the third set that ended in a
tiebreaker, which the Slovak won 11-9.
	   Nagyova took home dlrs 17,700 for the title and Barabanschikova
won dlrs 8,350.

U.S. Embassy in Khartoum stops some activities for public
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Sudan, where American
diplomats were ordered to leave in 1996, stopped performing some
consular activities Sunday, an embassy official said.
	   Consular activities will be relayed to the U.S. Embassy in
Cairo, Egypt, the official said. He did not give a reason.
	   U.S. diplomats in Cairo said they had not yet been informed of
the closure or that activities would be referred to them.
	   The United States withdrew its American staff from the embassy
in January 1996 to an office in neighboring Kenya. The move was
made on grounds Sudan could not guarantee the diplomats' security.
	   The decision Sunday followed the bombings of U.S. missions in
Kenya and Tanzania, killing nearly 200 people.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Broken-hearted survivors of the U.S.
Embassy bombing, relatives of those who died and those who came to
help heal the wounded and track down the killers gathered Sunday
for a memorial service for the 11 Americans who died.
	   Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, who suffered minor injuiries in
the Friday blast that rocked the solid, squat embassy in downtown
Nairobi and flattened a building next door, presided over the 1
1/2-hour non-denominational service at her residence attended by
about 200 people.
	   Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said the service was ``largely a
celebration of the people we knew, a service to honor our people,
our colleagues, our friends.''
	   The embassy said 24 Kenyan staff were also killed in the blast
that has so far taken 190 lives.

	   NIGDE, Turkey (AP) _ A minibus crashed into a truck near the
southern Turkish city of Nigde on Sunday, setting off a freeway
pileup that killed at least 18 people and injured 23, the
provincial governor said.
	   Nine vehicles were involved in the early morning crash, which
occurred during heavy traffic on the freeway between Nigde and the
city of Adana, Nigde provincial Gov. Adil Yazar told private NTV
television.
	   Nigde is 215 miles (345 kms) south of Ankara, the capital.
	   In a separate accident on Sunday, two Italians were killed in
southeastern Turkey after their motorcycle skidded off the highway
near the city of Batman because of high speed, the Anatolia news
agency said.
	   Anatolia identified them as Ferrizio Telfa, 36, and Roberta
Pallodini, 29. Italian embassy officials could not immediately be
reached for comment.
	   Batman is 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) southeast of Ankara.
	   Many drivers take to the roads early to escape the scorching
summer heat that often reaches 39 degrees (102 F) during the day in
many parts of the country.

Serbs try to wrap up offensive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with reports of fresh fighting, refugee
flow across Albanian border continues, British foreign secretary
assails Serbs, others; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Moving to crush the last remaining
rebel strongholds, Serb forces reportedly clashed Sunday with
ethnic Albanian fighters at several locations in western Kosovo.
	   A day after one rebel faction signaled its readiness for talks,
other fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army kept up resistance
and the prospects for peace talks remained uncertain.
	   The Serbs have overrun one KLA stronghold after the other and
sent tens of thousands of civilians fleeing in the past two weeks
in a major offensive in the secessionist province of Serbia, where
ethnic Albanians comprise a vast majority of the population.
	   On Sunday, conflicting accounts from Albanian and Serb sources
both reported fighting focused near the town of Decane, about 90
kilometers (55 miles) west of Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   While the Serbs said about a dozen police checkpoints and units
came under attack and three policemen were wounded in the area, the
Albanians said government forces ``intensified attacks'' against
seven villages held by the KLA.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb forces
targeted civilians who tried to flee their homes and that two men
and two women died Saturday in Decane.
	   Some 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the south, near the town of
Djakovica, Serb forces attacked three KLA villages overnight, the
center said.
	   Even though the Serbs insist the offensive is in the mop-up
phase, the exodus of civilians out of Kosovo has continued.
Albanian TV reported Sunday that about 500 refugees have crossed
into that neighboring country in the past week.
	   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the Serb
offensive has displaced 167,000 people within Kosovo since the
conflict exploded in February, not counting another 64,000 people
who have fled the province. Hundreds have been killed, with
thousands of others remaining in the woods and hills, many of them
without food or water.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook assailed the Serbs on
Sunday for their latest attacks involving civilians, and warned
that preparations for possible NATO intervention are now complete.
He said he was particularly disturbed that the Serbs had set fire
to crops in Kosovo in recent days yo try to ensure that villagers
won't return.
	   ``The events of the last 10 days have been deeply disturbing and
have undoubtedly caused great hardship to many civilians throughout
Kosovo,'' Cook told BBC1.
	   ``This is not a war that either side can win. The only way this
war can be ended is by both sides coming to the table with an
international presence and negotiating a satisfactory
constitutional political settlement,'' he said.
	   A moderate KLA faction reportedly agreed in principle to enter
an alliance with ethnic Albanian politicians in Kosovo, led by
Ibrahim Rugova. Ilaz Ramajli, a politician allied with Rugova, said
Saturday in the Albanian capital, Tirana. But he acknowledged that
the KLA as a whole has not made a final decision on agreeing to
talks under Rugova's leadership.
	   Western diplomats handed both warring sides a proposal Friday
and Saturday, outlining how autonomy might work in Kosovo, which
enjoyed autonomy until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
revoked it in 1989.
	   Milosevic has indicated he would be willing to restore Kosovo's
autonomy, while ethnic Albanians are split on whether to push for
outright independence or hold talks about autonomy.

<TEXT>
	   TRABZON, Turkey (AP) _ Floods caused by torrential rains along
the eastern Black Sea coast killed at least seven people and
collapsed scores of houses, the semi-official Anatolia news agency
said Sunday.
	   As many as 50 other people were missing, feared drowned in
rushing rainwater in the village of Beskoy, the worst hit area in
Saturday's flooding where some 50 one-story houses, a mosque and a
school collapsed, the Anatolia said.
	   A military post and 25 houses collapsed in the town of Koprubasi
but there were no casualties there.
	   Trabzon is 750 kilometers (470 miles) northeast of Ankara, the
capital.

Sasser leads U.S. rout of Greece for bronze medal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Jason Sasser scored 23 points and a
makeshift U.S. team routed Greece 84-61 Sunday to capture the
bronze medal at the World Basketball Championship.
	   Jimmy King added 14 points, all in the second half, and Wendell
Alexis had 12 as each of the Americans scored to produce the sort
of rout Dream Teams regularly turned in.
	   But because of the NBA labor dispute, this was a ragtag
collection cobbled together a month ago and made up mainly of
players from the minor-league Continental Basketball Association
and European leagues.
	   The United States went on an early 25-6 run and took a 32-12
lead on a Jimmy Oliver jumper 13:15 into the game.
	   The Americans went ahead by as many as 34 points, at 80-46 with
4:56 left in the game, on a breakaway dunk by King, the former
member of Michigan's Fab Five teams who was the CBA's MVP last
season.
	   Greece showed the after-effects of its hard-fought overtime
semifinal loss to Yugoslavia the night before.
	   Yugoslavia, aiming for a record fourth world title, faced Russia
later Sunday in the gold medal game.
	   Although supported by a sellout crowd of 18,000 at the Olympic
arena, Greece was unable to find the basket. It shot 20-of-55 (36
percent) from the field for the game.
	   Dimitri Papanikolaou led the hosts with 18 points, while
Giorgios Kalaitzis had 15.
	   A loss would have sent the U.S. team home without a world
championship medal for the first time since the 1978 squad finished
fifth.
	   Still, the United States will have to go through qualifying play
to earn an invitation to the 2000 Olympics. Only the world champion
and host Australia receive automatic bids.
	   Greece was jeered off the court at halftime, trailing 48-27.
	   Every American player scored in the first half except King, who
did not take a shot. The hosts, on the other hand, made just
8-of-30 (27 percent) from the field in the opening 20 minutes, and
at one juncture went scoreless for 5:39.
	   In consolation action, Spain beat Italy 64-61 for fifth place,
while Lithuania edged Argentina 77-76 for seventh.

Arsonist set fire to clothes store
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A fire blamed on arsonists badly damaged
a clothes store in a Bahraini city, an official said Sunday.
	   There were no casualties from the fire late Saturday at
Mothercare Stores. The blaze gutted the first floor and caused
slight damage to the second floor of the two-story building.
	   Firemen arrived at the scene quickly and put out the fire before
it spread to other nearby shops in Muharraq, the official said.
	   Shiite Muslim activists campaigning for political and social
reforms have been blamed for numerous arson attacks in the country.
	   More than 40 people have been killed in the violent campaign
since it began in December 1994.
	   Shiites form a slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens but
the Gulf state is ruled by the Al Khalifa family, which belongs to
the mainstream Sunni sect of Islam.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An apparent airplane hijacking ended peacefully at
a Moscow airport on Sunday, hours after the crew found an anonymous
note demanding dlrs 100,000 and threatening to blow up the plane.
	   No ransom was paid. No bomb was found. And no perpetrator was
arrested.
	   The incident began while the East Line TU-154 aircraft was en
route to Moscow from the Siberian city of Tyumen, about 2,400
kilometers (1,500 miles) to the east.
	   Crew members came across a threatening note in the business
section and passed it to the pilots, officials said. According to
the ITAR-Tass news agency, the note warned that ``there is a bomb
on board. We will detonate it if we are not given 621,000 rubles
(dlrs 100,000). We need the money in Moscow.''
	   The note instructed authorities to put the money in five bags
and place them in the airplane's bathroom. It also demanded on
onward flight to another country, officials said.
	   After the plane landed at Moscow's Domodedovo airport, police
and special forces in armored personnel carriers and officials from
the Federal Security Service _ the main successor to the KGB _ were
deployed on the tarmac. But there was no one for them to negotiate
with, since none of the 97 passengers owned up to writing the
ransom note.
	   First women and children were let off the plane. Once the
security forces determined that no one on board was carrying a
weapon, the 70 male passengers were taken inside the terminal for
questioning and all the luggage was searched. Handwriting samples
were being analyzed, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Passengers interviewed by the NTV television station said they
weren't told about the alleged hijacking. They were told the plane
was being held because health officials suspected some passengers
had cholera.
	   Gen.-Lt. Alexander Tsarenko of the Federal Security Service told
reporters that authorities had wanted to ``avoid unnecessary
panic'' by not telling them about the apparent hijacking, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   He also said that the incident didn't qualify as terrorism, but
as ``scandalous hooliganism.''
	   Since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, airport security has
deteriorated, particularly at regional airports. There have been a
number of hijackings on domestic flights, but in most cases the
hijacker has surrendered following negotiations with authorities.

Iran says POW exchange obstacle to better ties with Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran signaled its willingness Sunday to
normalize relations with neighboring Iraq, but said that an
exchange of all remaining prisoners from their 1980-88 war must
come first.
	   Last month, Iran claimed Iraq still held nearly 4,000 POWs and
accused Baghdad of insincerity in trying to resolve the issue. Iraq
and Iran had signed a deal in June to solve the dispute, which has
long stood in the way of better ties.
	   ``Efforts should be made to normalize ties between the two
countries, and as a prerequisite the existing hindrances on the way
should be identified and removed,'' said Hassan Rowhani, secretary
of Iran's Supreme National Security Council.
	   Iran and Iraq ``must strive to release all of the prisoners of
war,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Rowhani as
saying in a Sunday meeting with Iraq's outgoing charge d'affaires
in Tehran, Salah Nouri al-Samarmad.
	   The day before, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein urged Iran to
normalize relations, saying that any step by Tehran to upgrade ties
would be met by ``all cooperation ... from the Arabs, with Iraq in
front.''
	   In April, Iran released 5,584 Iraqi POWs and Iraq freed three
POWs and 316 Iranians it classified as civil law detainees. It was
the largest repatriation of Iranian and Iraqi prisoners since 1990.
	   More than 1 million people were killed or wounded during the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
	   Iraq has accused Iran of starting the war by bombarding border
posts on Sept. 4, 1980. Iran dates the start of the war to Iraq's
movement of tanks across the border Sept. 22.
	   Rowhani, who also serves as deputy parliament speaker, said
``there is great potential for expansion of trade and economic
relations between Iran and Iraq,'' IRNA reported.
	   He also stressed the importance of border security, saying
Iranian and Iraqi security officials should meet regularly to
discuss the issue. Iran and Iraq accuse each other of allowing
infiltrators to sneak across their borders for acts of sabotage.

BayStars beat Carp 14-6 on 8 runs in 15th inning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Central League's front-running Yokohama
BayStars exploded for eight runs in the top of the 15th inning
early Monday and beat the Hiroshima Carp 14-6 in Fukuyama.
	   At 6 hours, 13 minutes, the game, which ended after midnight,
was the third longest in Japanese baseball history.
	   A wild pitch by the Carp's Tsuyoshi Kikuchihara allowed the
winning run to score, and the BayStars added seven insurance runs.
	   The BayStars increased their lead over the Chunichi Dragons to
five games as the Dragons lost 3-1 to the Yomiuri Giants at Tokyo
Dome.
	   Kazuhiro Kiyohara belted two one-run homers for the Giants,
lifting his season total to 18 homers.
	   Giants starter Yusaku Iriki (3-2) struck out nine while giving
up one run over eight innings.
	   Also Sunday, Yomiuri issued a warning to Mariano Duncan, a
former Toronto Blue Jays player, after he reportedly made critical
remarks about the club's management. The Dominican infielder
reportedly complained that he has not played more.
	   The Yakult Swallows defeated the Hanshin Tigers 3-2 at Tokyo's
Jingu Stadium for their fourth straight victory.
	   In the Pacific League, Phil Clark, formerly of the Boston Red
Sox, hit a two-run homer that lifted the Kintetsu Buffaloes past
the Chiba Lotte Marines 5-3 in Chiba.
	   Clark has 20 homers for the season.
	   Knuckleballer Rob Mattson (5-2), formerly of the Mexican League,
held Lotte to one run over five innings for the victory, and
Akinori Otsuka earned his 26th save.
	   Kintetsu remained in second place, 6 1/2 games behind the Nippon
Ham Fighters, who lost 1-0 to the Seibu Lions in Fukushima.
	   Seibu starter Fumiya Nishiguchi (8-9) pitched a complete-game
shutout, giving up four hits.
	   At Kobe, Orix starter Mark Mimbs (1-0) gave up just one run over
five innings to earn his first victory as the Orix BlueWave beat
the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 10-8.
	   Troy Neel, formerly of the Oakland Athletics, contributed a pair
of one-run homers for Orix in the nine-run fifth inning, his 17th
and 18th homers of the year.
	   Luis Lopez, formerly of the Cleveland Indians, hit a one-run
homer for the Hawks. He has 11 homers this season.
	   Mimbs came to Orix from a New York Mets Triple-A team.

Rebels kill three, including town mayor, in Peru's jungle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Shining Path rebels attacked a town in Peru's
northern Amazon jungle, held a ``popular trial'' of its mayor and
executed him in front of his supporters, police said Sunday.
	   Two other civilians died in the Saturday night attack by the
Maoist rebels.
	   A group of rebels attacked a campaign rally for Saposoa Mayor
Cesar Rodriguez that was being held outside Saposoa, 350 miles (570
kms) northeast of Lima, the town's police spokesman said.
	   The rebels ``tried'' Rodriguez in front of his supporters for 1
1/2 hours and shot him, police said. They withdrew into the jungle
after the attack.
	   Simultaneously, 30 rebels attacked a police post and sacked a
grocery store, killing two people, in the jungle-shrouded Huallaga
Valley town of 10,000 people.
	   Peru will hold municipal elections in November. In the past, the
rebels executed mayors and candidates in an effort to disrupt local
elections and create a power vacuum in remote regions.
	   The number of Shining Path attacks has fallen sharply since the
capture of their top leaders in the early 1990s, but rebel columns
still operate in remote parts in Peru's northern jungle and
southern mountain jungle.

Sasser leads U.S. rout of Greece for bronze medal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, detail. EDITS. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Jason Sasser scored 23 points and a
makeshift U.S. team routed Greece 84-61 Sunday to capture the
bronze medal at the World Basketball Championship.
	   Jimmy King added 14 points, all in the second half, and Wendell
Alexis had 12 as each of the Americans scored to produce the sort
of blowout Dream Teams regularly turned in.
	   But because of the NBA labor dispute, this U.S. team was a
ragtag collection cobbled together a month ago mainly with players
from the minor-league Continental Basketball Association and
European leagues.
	   ``We wanted it today. You always set your goals for the gold,''
said U.S. center David Wood, a former NBA journeyman who split last
season between the CBA and Spain, ``but this is the greatest
accomplishment of my basketball career.''
	   Yugoslavia, aiming for a record fourth world title, faced Russia
later Sunday in the gold medal game.
	   The United States went on an early 25-6 run and took a 32-12
lead on a Jimmy Oliver jumper 13:15 into the game.
	   Sasser, a Texas Tech product, had 11 points early in the second
half as the United States put the game away.
	   The Americans took their biggest lead at 80-46 with 4:56 left in
the game on a breakaway dunk by King, who was part of Michigan's
Fab Five teams and the CBA's MVP last season.
	   ``We wanted to push the ball and run,'' U.S. coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``Before the game we talked about what a great
opportunity this was. One game to get a medal.''
	   Greece, also fourth at the 1994 worlds, showed the after-effects
of its hard-fought overtime semifinal loss to Yugoslavia the night
before.
	   ``I think we had maybe the deepest team in the tournament,''
Wood said. ``We're just as fresh today as we were at the start. I
think the Greek stars were just fatigued from the heart-wrenching
loss last night.''
	   Supported by a sellout crowd of 18,000 at the Olympic arena,
Greece was unable to find the basket. It shot 20-of-55 (36 percent)
from the field for the game.
	   Dimitri Papanikolaou led the hosts with 18 points, while
Giorgios Kalaitzis had 15.
	   A loss would have sent the U.S. team home from a world
championship without a medal for the first time since the 1978
squad finished fifth. The so-called Dream Team II won the gold in
1994.
	   Still, the United States will have to go through qualifying to
earn an invitation to the 2000 Olympics. Only the world champion
and host Australia receive automatic bids.
	   Greece was jeered off the court at halftime, trailing 48-27. It
went scoreless for 5:39 at one juncture.
	   In consolation action, Spain beat Italy 64-61 for fifth place,
while Lithuania edged Argentina 77-76 for seventh.

One dead as heat wave sweeps region

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ One man died from overheating and
dozens were rushed to hospital Sunday as temperatures soared past
40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), a 35-year record high for the area,
according to local meteorologists.
	   At a farm in northern Israel, 60 chickens perished in the
scorching heat and health ministry officials issued calls to the
public to drinking water and stay inside air-conditioned rooms to
avoid dehydration.
	   Temperatures have been higher than normal for more than three
weeks. In southern Israel, a record 47 Celsius (118 F) for the day
was recorded. In Jerusalem, the temperature hovered at 41 Celsius
(106 F) and in the coastal Mediterranean city of Tel Aviv, the high
temperatures combined with 90 percent humidity kept most people
inside and away from cloudless skies.
	   In the Palestinian-run city of Jericho, where the temperature
rose to 42 Celsius (108 F), police said a prisoner died from
overheating.
	   Walid Qawasmi, 45, died Saturday night in a Jericho prison cell
where he was being held by Palestinian police on criminal charges.
	   ``He got dizzy at around noon and was transferred to the
hospital, where he was declared dead in the night,'' said the head
of Palestinian intelligence in the West Bank, Brig. Gen. Tawfiq
Tirawi.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said some 80 people had been taken to
hospital with heat stroke Sunday.

Beaches in northeastern Spain suffer jellyfish invasion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PLATJA D'ARO, Spain (AP) _ More jellyfish than usual seem to be
washing up on Spain's northeastern beaches, where officials had to
close two beaches temporarily after at least 300 people were
treated for jellyfish stings.
	   Jellyfish have been turning up particularly on the beaches of
Sant Pol, Platja d'Aro, Sant Feliu de Guixols and Palafrugel, all
in the Catalan Costa Brava coast, a popular tourist destination.
	   Two beaches in Platja d'Aro and Palafrugel were closed Saturday
and reopened Sunday. Swimmers were being warned to stay out of the
infected areas.
	   Warm currents from southern Spanish waters in the Mediterranean
sea are being blamed for the jellyfish invasion, a Red Cross
spokesman said.

Bomb explodes on railroad track, train derailed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A bomb blew up a section of railroad
track in central Sri Lanka, derailing a passenger train that passed
moments after the explosion, railroad officials said Sunday.
	   Most of the 40 passengers escaped with minor injuries, but the
driver and his attendant were seriously wounded in the derailment
Saturday night. The impact of the blast made the engine run off the
track, but most of the cars were not affected.
	   There was no claim of responsibility, but Sri Lankan security
officials had warned of infiltration into the area by members of
the Liberation Tiger of Tamil Eelam, a Tamil rebel group fighting
for the secession of Tamil majority areas in northern and eastern
Sri Lanka.
	   The explosion occurred near Hatton, a tea-growing area in
central Sri Lanka, 150 kilometers (100 miles) east of the capital,
Colombo. The area is home to tens of thousands of Tamil laborers on
tea estates.
	   Tamils in the tea estates, who migrated from India, are not
generally involved in the separatist insurrection, but their area
has witnessed increasing bomb attacks. At least five telephone
exchanges have been damaged in attacks in the last two months.
	   Railroad officials said the impact of the blast damaged tracks,
forcing cancellation of train services on the sector. Sri Lanka, an
Indian Ocean country of 18. 5 million people, has a tiny railroad
system.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Defying Jewish calls for the removal of
dozens of crosses from outside the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz,
Roman Catholic faithful erected five new crosses at the disputed
site over the weekend.
	   The Israeli government and Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial last
week protested the addition of dozens of crosses by conservative
Catholics opposed to efforts to remove a larger, eight-meter
(26-foot) cross that has stood at the site since 1988.
	   Inspired by a conservative Catholic radio station and a former
Solidarity activist and author of anti-Semitic pamphlets, a loose
group of conservative Catholic faithful have vowed to erect 152
crosses at the site to commemorate each of the Poles executed there

victims.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Defying Jewish calls for the removal of
dozens of crosses from outside the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz,
Roman Catholic faithful erected five new crosses at the disputed
site over the weekend.
	   The Israeli government and Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial last
week protested the addition of dozens of crosses by conservative
Catholics opposed to efforts to remove a larger, eight-meter
(26-foot) cross that has stood at the site since 1988.
	   Inspired by a conservative Catholic radio station and a former
Solidarity activist and author of anti-Semitic pamphlets, a loose
group of conservative Catholic faithful have vowed to erect 152
crosses at the site to commemorate each of the Poles executed there
by the Nazis. For them, the larger cross, which formed the backdrop
to a 1979 papal mass, has become a symbol of the Nazis' Polish
victims.
	   Over the weekend, they added five more ranging in size from 1 to
4 meters (3 to 12 feet) to a field of more than 90 crosses.

Huggett beats Polland in another playoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Brian Huggett won a sudden
death playoff against Eddie Polland for the second tournament in a
row Sunday to win the 375,000-pound (dlrs 619,000) Senior British
Open for the first time at age 61.
	   After the two players wound up tied on 283, the Welshman made
par on the first extra hole, the par-4 18th, and Northern Irishman
Polland slid a nine-foot par putt wide.
	   Last week Polland succumbed to the Welshman in a playoff in the
Schroder Senior Masters at Wentworth.
	   ``This is definitely number one in my career. At 61 you don't
expect to hold anything like this trophy,'' said Huggett, a former
Ryder Cup player who has 31 tournaments as a senior but none for
three years.
	   ``I feel for Eddie who is a tremendous player and after beating
him twice he probably doesn't like me too much.
	   ``I nearly threw it away at the 16th and in the end I was lucky
to be in the play-off. To win is wonderful.''
	   Polland carded a 2-under 70 for a four-round total of 283 while
Huggett made 71. They were the only players to card four sub-par
rounds at the Royal Portrush course.
	   In the final round, Polland birdied the 16th and 17th to draw
level with the Welshman who had dropped three shots in the space of
four holes from the 13th. In the end Huggett had to hole a tricky
four foot putt to tie with Polland.
	   Scotland's Brian Barnes finished with a 73 to finish one behind
the two leaders with 284 while Australia's Noel Ratcliffe's 69 gave
him fourth place on 285.
	   England's Tommy Horton, who had a 2-stroke lead going into the
final round, struggled to a 77 and a share of fifth place.

Civilian wounded in south Lebanon shelling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli-allied militiamen shelled suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Sunday, wounding a
Lebanese man, security officials said.
	   Mohammed Merei, 70, suffered shrapnel wounds in his neck after a
mortar shell fired by militiamen of the South Lebanon Army crashed
near his house in Majdal Zoun, a village 12 kilometers (8 miles)
southeast of the port city of Tyre, said the officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The shelling followed attacks earlier Sunday by guerrillas of
the Syrian-backed Shiite Muslim Amal movement on Israeli and
militia outposts in an Israeli-occupied border enclave in south
Lebanon. No casualties were reported from those attacks.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, along with other militias,
has led a guerrilla war to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the
2,500 militiamen from the zone. Israel set up the enclave in 1985
to protect its northern towns from attacks across the border.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Tired of his stinginess and threats to marry
another woman, an Egyptian killed her husband Sunday, stuffed his
body in a duffel bag and set fire to it, police said.
	   Wadad Habib Sabah, 45, paid the son of the building's doorman
50,000 Egyptian pounds (dlrs 14,700) to help her kill her husband,
Fawzy Abdel-Nour, police officials said.
	   The two clubbed Abdel-Nour in the head with a machete and put
his corpse in the bag, which they threw on the roof of the
neighboring apartment building. They then set fire to it, said the
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Sabah then notified the fire department that she had seen a
madman burning objects on the roof. Fire officials, who arrived on
the scene, found only the bag and the corpse.
	   Sabah confessed, saying she killed Abdel-Nour because he had
become stingy and threatened to marry another woman, they said.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian legislators approved
Yasser Arafat's new Cabinet by a wide margin on Sunday, despite
criticism that the Palestinian leader had done nothing to address
charges of widespread government corruption.
	   The vote of support left Arafat free to refocus his attention
from internal politics to the deadlocked peace process with Israel.
	   The legislative council, which is dominated by Arafat's Fatah
faction, approved the Cabinet by a vote of 55-28 with three
abstentions. The new ministers were sworn-in later by Arafat at a
ceremony Sunday night in the Gaza Strip.
	   Placing their right hands on Koran, Islam's holy book, the
ministers said: ``I swear by God to be faithful to the homeland and
to maintain law and institution, the interests of the Palestinian
people and to fulfill my duties as God is my witness.'' Arafat
later convened his new Cabinet for its first session.

Bayern Munich manager says Super League certain in two years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEVERKUSEN, Germany (AP) _ A proposed European Super League
uniting the continent's elite soccer clubs is a foregone conclusion
and will take place in two years, Bayern Munich manager Uli Hoeness
said in an interview published Sunday.
	   ``The concept of the European league is developed to the last
comma. Even if the German football organization or UEFA refuse to
support it, the league will start in two years,'' Hoeness said in
the weekly magazine Focus.
	   Bayern Munich, Germany's wealthiest club, would be one of the
founder members of the proposed league which would embraces
renowned sides across Europe like AC Milan, Real Madrid and
Manchester United.
	   Hoeness said the broad resistance to the proposed league across
Europe will dwindle when the concept is publicized. On Saturday,
the majority of Germany's 36 first and second division clubs
condemned the idea at a meeting.
	   Hoeness said the European league will replace the Champions
League and consist of 16 clubs that can't be demoted, along with 16
others that must qualify for the competition. Up to four clubs
could play from the continent's major leagues.
	   ``Everybody that's complaining now will celebrate if they knew
how much money is coming their way,'' Hoeness said. ``It involves
so much money, it would be negligent not to listen.''
	   Both FIFA and UEFA, soccer's world and European governing
bodies, have warned that clubs and players involved in a breakaway
could be kicked out from international competition.
	   The English Premier League has also threatened to ban any clubs
which join without permission.
	   In Germany, almost the entire German soccer establishment has
blasted the proposed league.
	   ``We're standing before a severe test. We see the danger of a
divide between the European league clubs and the rest of the
national league teams,'' warned Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder, president
of VfB Stuttgart.
	   UEFA has formed a committee that will meet Aug. 25 with
representatives of the 16 clubs expected to be permanent members of
the Super League in hopes of settling the crisis.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila's embattled
government on Sunday accused Uganda of deploying columns of
soldiers and tanks into Congolese territory in support of a rebel
Tutsi uprising in the eastern Kivu region.
	   The government further accused neighboring Rwanda, which it says
instigated the rebellion, of executing Congolese army officers and
rounding up civilians in the region.
	   The charges could not be independently confirmed, but if true,
represent a sharp escalation in hostilities not only between Rwanda
and Congo but now also Uganda.
	   ``Following a counter-attack by Congolese forces at the town of
Bukavu, two columns of Ugandan forces violated the integrity of
Congolese territory,'' Information Minister Didier Mumengi told
reporters in the capital Kinshasa.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda of waging a proxy war in Congo and of
trying to establish a ``Tutsi empire'' in his territory. He now
says Uganda is also fighting on behalf of the Rwandan troops and
Congolese Tutsi rebels.
	   Rwanda has repeatedly denied the charges, but says it will
strike back at Congo if attacked.
	   Mumengi said Congolese government forces fighting in the east
reported at least 10 Ugandan tanks and seven trucks filled with
soldiers heading toward the Bunia, a town just across the Ugandan
border inside Congo.
	   ``The Democratic Republic of Congo condemns these attacks on the
part of Rwanda and Uganda and calls on the Organization of African
Unity and the United Nations to order the withdrawal of these
forces from Congolese territory,'' Mumengi said.
	   He also accused Rwandan forces in the Kivu region of executing
captured Congolese officers and rounding up civilians.
	   Foreign aid workers in the rebel-controlled city of Bukavu have
fled across the border into Rwanda, state-controlled radio in
Rwanda reported.
	   More than 60 foreigners including Americans, Canadians and
Belgians, left the city, the Rwandan report said.
	   In Kinshasa, the government increased security around the
capital, closing all river ports and halting traffic across its
river border with the Republic of Congo.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ An Israeli team searching floor to floor
with rescue dogs found a woman and her son Sunday in a building
damaged in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, a slim ray of
hope as 20 bodies were pulled from the rubble.
	   Using a 150-ton crane, drills and blowtorches, another Israeli
team was trying to free a woman named Rose trapped in a very
difficult spot in a collapsed building adjacent to the embassy.
	   ``I spoke to her at around 10 a.m. (0700 GMT). I just told her
to hold on. We're coming for her and she said, `yes.' But now she's
very weak,'' said Bob Nasser, head of the Kenyan disaster
coordination team at the site.
	   As the American Embassy held a memorial service the 11 Americans
who died, several hundred members of the U.S. investigation team
were ``setting up shop,'' according to embassy spokesman Bill Barr.
	   The official death toll in Friday's nearly simultaneous bombings
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania rose to 209, all but 10
in the Nairobi blast. A total of 4,877 people were injured, but
only about 560 remain hospitalized, the vast majority in Kenya.
	   Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi visited the devastated embassy
site Sunday morning and said there were some leads but did not
elaborate.
	   The Sunday Nation newspaper quoted an unidentified ``security
man'' as saying he saw three Arab-looking men filming the U.S.
Embassy for about 20 minutes, four days before the bombing. He
alerted guards at the embassy, but they brushed him off, the paper
said.
	   Closed-circuit TV cameras were monitoring the parking area
behind the embassy where the bomb went off, but U.S. Ambassador
Prudence Bushnell said she didn't know whether the cameras or film
survived the blast.
	   There have been several differing accounts of how the explosions
occurred Friday.
	   Ocheng Okwach, who works for the Ministry of Environment and
Natural Resources, was quoted in The Sunday Nation as saying he saw
two men who appeared to be Arabs drive a yellow pickup truck to the
back of the embassy and jump out brandishing machine-guns.
	   ``One man ran back into the vehicle as the other sprayed bullets
into the American Embassy,'' Okwach was quoted as saying.
	   Kenyan police superintendent Mike Harries was quoted in The
Sunday Times in London as saying that witnesses saw a pickup truck
drive into the car park behind the embassy and sit there for five
minutes before the bomb went off.
	   The FBI has said its top priority is to determine the explosive
device used and the type of vehicle which carried it to the scene,
which FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi said ``can be like a fingerprint
of who did it.''
	   At Sunday church services throughout Kenya, thousands offered
prayers for the dead and injured. Roman Catholic Archbishop Rafael
Ndingi urged Kenyans to ``forgive the one who is the cause of
this,'' saying retribution is God's business.
	   Kenya's small Muslim community also condemned the bombing and
urged the government to leave no stone unturned to find those who
had so tragically disrupted this peaceful country.
	   In Nairobi, rescue efforts had focused on the badly damaged
embassy building and the adjacent Ufundi Cooperative building,
which collapsed, not the 22-story Cooperative Bank of Kenya
building which although badly damaged remained standing.
	   On Sunday morning, the Israeli team searching the Cooperative
Bank building discovered a woman and her son, who is about 12 years
old, in the caretaker's apartment on about the 20th floor. They
also found a body on the 17th floor.
	   Lt. Col. Ofer Loefler, spokesman for the Isrsaeli rescue team,
said the child was in the building at the time of the explosion and
his mother went in afterwards to find him.
	   ``They stayed up there because they were afraid to come down,''
he said. Earlier, the Red Cross said both mother and son were
caught in the blast.
	   The mother and son, able to walk from the building with rescue
workers, were taken by ambulance to Nairobi Hospital for a checkup.
	   Meanwhile, another Israeli team working in the Ufundi
Cooperative building was still talking to the woman named Rose who
was trapped near the spot where a man, Gaitara Nganga, was pulled
from the rubble Saturday night after 36 hours.
	   ``Her face is burned, but she's talking,''said John Sparrow of
the International Committee of the Red Cross. ``During the past two
days, she developed a relationship with Gaitara. ... They talked
and kept each other's spirits up.''
	   A second woman was also reported to be alive, not far from Rose,
he said.
	   A 64-member emergency search and rescue team from Fairfax
County, Virginia, arrived with four dogs Sunday, and immediately
went to work in the embassy building and other bomb-damaged
buildings nearby.
	   A 10-man French military-civilian unit, including one doctor and
two dogs, also arrived and was taking part in rescue operations.
	   Nasser, the Kenyan rescue coordinator, said he is concerned that
the Israeli team is using compressors which vibrate, and which
might be killing Kenyans still trapped in the rubble.
	   ``It's not good,'' he said. ``There's no proper coordination.
They just do what they do in their country.''
	   He said one of the problems was language _ only a few of the
Israelis speak good English.
	   The Israeli team's phone was temporarily out of service.
	   Miriam Olomula, 38, a clerk-typist for the Ufundi Cooperative
Society who was out of the building at the time of the bomb, was
helping rescue officials identify the bodies of workmates.
	   She was still hopeful that some of the 28 society employees
still missing would be found alive.
	   ``These rescuers have been telling us that there are some people
still talking inside. So I'm hoping that some of them will be our
people,'' she said.
	   But as the hours ticked away, the death toll kept climbing.
	   According to Kenya's National Disaster Center, 164 had died as
of Sunday night. But Barr, the U.S. Embassy spokesman, said this
figure did not include the 11 Americans and 24 Kenyans who died in
the embassy itself.
	   Barr confirmed reports that Consul General Julian Bartley was
missing and that his son, Jay, a university student in San Diego,
California, had been killed in the blast. Scores of Kenyans
employed at the embassy were still unaccounted for.
	   A U.S. C-141 cargo plane flew 15 critically injured victims to
Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Sunday for treatment. Another
flight was planned for Monday.
	   In Tanzania, the death toll rose to 10, including one Kenyan,
but no Americans were killed there, according to officials at the
government-run Muhambili Hospital in Dar es Salaam.
	   Some 200 Americans, including relatives of those who died in the
blast and those who have come to help with the investigation and
rescue operations, attended a 90-minute non-denominational memorial
service at the ambassador's residence.
	   Bushnell presided over the service, which was ``largely a
celebration of the people we knew, a service to honor our people,
our colleagues, our friends,'' Barr said.
	   Ordinary Kenyans also were trying to do something to honor the
dead and assist the survivors.
	   In back of the Cooperative Bank building, scores of young
Kenyans donned plastic gloves and scooped up shards of shattered
glass with pieces of cardboard and plastic plates.
	   ``We've had such a big calamity, we should do something to
help,'' said Anita Shah, 19, who is about to start university. ``It
was an act that should not have been committed and we hope that the
terrorists will pay for it because they've taken so many innocent
lives.''

Water minister tenders resignation after scandal

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's water and irrigation minister
submitted his resignation Sunday following accusations that he was
responsible for polluted drinking water in parts of the capital.
	   State-run Jordan Television did not say if the prime minister,
Abdul-Salam Majali, accepted the resignation, which must also be
endorsed by King Hussein. The monarch, who has the final say in
Jordan, is undergoing cancer treatment in the United States.
	   Hussein summoned the prime minister to the United States earlier
this week and also ordered an investigation of the water scandal,
which shook an already weak government blamed for a mounting
recession in the resource-barren country.
	   In a harsh televised message Friday, Hussein criticized Majali's
Cabinet, but stopped short of saying he would dismiss it. He said
it had failed to crack down on negligent bureaucrats.
	   Residents of the upscale suburbs of western Amman have
complained that water flowing out of taps for three weeks has an
odor and contains worms and larvae.
	   The government denied the water was contaminated. But water
experts have said studies showed that some drinking water contained
worms, which could be dangerous to health.
	   Jordan Television said the minister, Munther Haddadin, asked
Majali to relay his resignation to Hussein. In the meantime, the
minister would remain on leave, the television added.

South Africa chases 34 runs, England needs two wickets to clinch
</HEADLINE>
series &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Darren Gough turned the fifth test on its
head with the vital wicket of Jonty Rhodes as England and South
Africa set up a knife-edge finish at Headingley Sunday.
	   With one day to play, England needs two more wickets to win its
first five-test series win in 12 years while South Africa, 185 for
eight, needs another 34 runs to win its first series in England
since its return to test cricket in 1992.
	   Gough, the local hero, claimed his 100th test wicket _ Rhodes
well caught by Andrew Flintoff for 85 and trapped Mark Boucher lbw
_ as South Africa, set to make 219 to win, recovered from 12 for
four and 27 for five thanks to a century six-wicket stand between
Rhodes and Brian McMillan, who made 54.
	   The series is levelled at 1-1 and either team can win it.
	   Rhodes combined with Brain McMillan to arrest a dramatic top
order collapse with a 117-run stand in 152 minutes after South
Africa was parlously placed on 27 for five just after lunch.
	   But just when South Africa looked like taking control of the
match and the series, the pair fell in the space of 10 overs,
Rhodes' wicket being the key capture, seven overs before stumps.
	   Gough's 5-36 included three top order wickets, part of a 5-27
collapse either side of lunch after England had been bowled out of
240 in its second innings.
	   McMillan, who had managed just five first-class innings before
Sunday, fell four balls after reaching a fine half century, top
edging a hook to wicketkeeper Alec Stewart off Dominic Cork.
	   Rhodes, played a soul-searching 214-minute long innings hitting
10 fours and a six off 147 balls.
	   Pollock, 24 not out and Allan Donald, unbeaten on two after
surviving nine minutes, resume Monday in search of the remaining
runs.
	   South Africa, having lost opener Gehardus Liebenberg before
lunch, lost 3-0 in 22 balls soon after, including Gary Kirsten,
Jacques Kallis and skipper Hansie Cronje.
	   Three overs later Gough, trapped Daryll Cullinan in front, for
the third lbw decision of the innings.
	   This was after South Africa's own pacemen _ Donald and Pollock _
had swept aside England's bottom half in 84 minutes.
	   Resuming the day in control of the test at 206 for four and a
lead of 184, the home side lost 6-34 to be dismissed for 240 in 115
balls.
	   Pollock, who claimed his first five-wicket haul of the series,
5-53 in 35 outstanding overs, sparked the rot, removing the night
watchman Ian Salisbury with the second ball of the day.
	   Donald, who got rid off Graeme Hick and Andrew Flintoff in five
deliveries in his second over, wrapped up the innings by dismissing
Cork and Gough, to finish with 5-71.
	   It was Donald's fourth such haul and took his series tally to 33
wickets at 19.78, a record for South Africa in England.
	   Pollock's morning spell was 10-3-14-2, while Donald's was
9.2-5-14-4.
	   The collapse, once again mirrored England's batting weakness
this summer. In the first innings it lost 6-34 in 59 balls and at
Lord's, 6-11 in 71 balls when it slumped to a 10-wicket defeat.
	   Nasser Hussain, who had single-handedly guided the England
second innings, was one of the six victim, cruelly denied of his
second century of the series.
	   He was out for 94, driving a Pollock delivery straight to Cronje
at mid off. He had anchored the batting for eight minutes over
seven hours and hit 13 boundaries off 341 searching deliveries.

offered the help of Israel's famed Mossad and other intelligence

in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Netanyahu said early indications were that the bombings were the
result of ``international terrorism centered on Islamic
fundamentalism.''
	   Israeli and U.S. officials said that exiled Saudi billionaire
Osama bin Laden, who lives in Afghanistan, was one of the main

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday
offered the help of Israel's famed Mossad and other intelligence
agencies in tracking down the terrorists who bombed U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Netanyahu said early indications were that the bombings were the
result of ``international terrorism centered on Islamic
fundamentalism.''
	   Israeli and U.S. officials said that exiled Saudi billionaire
Osama bin Laden, who lives in Afghanistan, was one of the main
suspects in the bombings. One Israeli official said that Egyptian
elements connected to bin Laden may also have been involved.
	   Bin Laden has threatened a holy war against U.S. troops in his
homeland and Americans elsewhere overseas and is suspected of
backing terrorist acts around the world.
	   The official would not confirm whether Israeli intelligence
officials would be sent to join the investigation.
	   Israeli army teams were leading search-and-rescue efforts in
Nairobi, and Netanyahu said he had been warmly thanked by telephone
by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
	   ``We are prepared to help not only in rescue operations, but
also in international efforts _ in the intelligence field and
others _ to fight this terrorism, which we have faced for many
years,'' Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem.
	   ``Today, perhaps in light of the attack in Kenya, it is
understood how essential a broad international front is.''
	   At a news conference sponsored by Israel's Government Press
Office, terrorism expert Ely Karmon said bin Laden had recently
formed a loose coalition of six fundamentalist groups from Egypt,
Pakistan and Afghanistan.
	   Called the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and
Americans, the group issued a religious ruling calling for Muslims
to act against Americans to prevent the takeover of Islamic holy
places, Karmon said. The wording was similar to that of a
responsibility claim made in the wake of the east Africa bombings.
	   ``I think that it fits very well with all those threats and
religious rulings that were published in Afghanistan and Pakistan
in the past months,'' said Karmon, a research scholar at the
privately funded Institute for Counter Terrorism in Herzliya.

British Foreign Secretary dismisses allegation of plot to kill
</HEADLINE>
Libyan leader

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Sunday that
allegations by a former intelligence agent that Britain plotted the
assassination of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi were ``pure
fantasy.''
	   Cook said that he had investigated David Shayler's allegations,
reported in newspapers this month and in a BBC TV interview aired
Friday, that Britain's Secret Intelligence Service channeled funds
to an Islamic group to kill Gadhafi.
	   Cook said in a BBC TV interview Sunday that he was ``perfectly
satisfied'' that the Secret Intelligence Service, more commonly
known as MI6, had never forwarded any proposal for the
assassination attempt.
	   ``There was no government inspired plan to assassinate Gadhafi.
There was no SIS proposal to do it, and I'm fairly clear there has
never been any SIS involvement,'' Cook said.
	   Britain's foreign intelligence agency can legally carry out acts
abroad which would be outlawed in Britain provided they are
authorized by the foreign secretary.
	   Shayler told the BBC that the SIS channeled about 100,000 pounds
(dlrs 160,000) to an Islamic group to kill the Libyan leader by
planting a bomb under a road on which he was traveling. The BBC
reported that a February 1996 attack on Gadhafi killed several
people, although Gadhafi himself survived.
	   Shayler, who worked for Britain's internal MI5 intelligence
agency from 1994 until 1997, was arrested in Paris on Aug. 1.
London is trying to extradite him to face charges under the
Official Secrets Act. The former agent has threatened to put a
7,000 word dossier on Britain's secret services on an Internet
website.

	   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany (AP) _ During the 9-hour flight to
receive treatment for severe facial injuries suffered in the
Nairobi embassy bombing, Mary Ofisi's enduring thought was, ``The
Lord saved my life.''
	   Others in her office at the U.S. Embassy's financial management
center weren't so lucky. Far from the chaos and destruction of
Friday's blast, Ofisi thought of them: ``Especially them, those in
the same room. Most of them are not alive.''
	   Ofisi was among 15 critically and seriously injured victims of
the Nairobi embassy bombing who were flown Sunday aboard a C-141
cargo plane to Ramstein Air Base, where they were met by medical
teams and a squadron of ambulances.
	   Ten Americans and four Kenyans were rushed into eight ambulances
and speeded past the base headquarters, where flags flew at
half-mast, to the U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl 160
kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Frankfurt.
	   A critically injured Kenyan who worked at the U.S. Embassy was
flown directly by helicopter to an intensive care unite in Homburg,
30 kilometers (20 miles away).
	   The patients flown to Germany sustained serious to critical
injuries typical of a bombing attack, including eye injuries and
broken bones, said Lt. Col Russ Turner, the chief medical officers
on board.
	   ``They are very seriously, seriously injured, traumatized
mentally as well as physically,'' he said.
	   At the hospital, Ofisi told reporters that she heard the blast
from her desk. First one loud one, then two more, not quite as
loud.
	   ``I don't know exactly what happened. But after that, when I
found myself, I was down,'' said Ofisi, a 46-year-old embassy
employee. She recalled hearing screams in the distance, but none
nearby.
	   ``That's when I knew that I was alone,'' she said. It wasn't
long, she said, before an American she couldn't identify found her
and led her out of the building _ then rushed back inside to look
for more.
	   The C-141 that brought the 15 to Germany headed back late Sunday
loaded with additional medical supplies. The cargo plane was
expected to make another trip to Ramstein Monday with more wounded.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ In churches and in a big city park,
Nairobi residents on Sunday mourned the 188 Kenyans who died in the
terrorist bombing of the U.S. Embassy in the Kenyan capital.
	   But there was no sign of resentment towards the Americans whose
diplomatic presence was the target of the Friday blast that gutted
the embassy building and flattened a four-story building next door.
	   ``Pole, we are very sorry for what happened to your embassy,''
said a normally taciturn immigration official, using the Swahili
word to express regret, when an American presented her passport on
arrival at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta airport.
	   Eleven Americans died in the blast. Twenty-four Kenyan embassy
employees were also killed.
	   Roman Catholic Archbishop Rafael Ndingi told worshippers at the
Holy Family Basilica that human beings need to forgive and leave
retribution to God.
	   Although President Daniel arap Moi told reporters Sunday
investigators are following several leads to find the perpetrators
of the attack, he did not elaborate. There were no public reports
of any suspects being questioned or arrested.
	   Police denied an earlier report they had arrested an
Arabic-speaking man near the embassy shortly after the blast.
	   ``When we forgive, we find consolation,'' the archbishop said.
	   Emerging from worship at the Anglican All Saints Cathedral,
James Mathenge, chairman of the Kenya Freedom from Hunger Council,
said the organization was sending its condoleances to Kenyans,
Americans and Tanzanians alike _ all of whom suffered in Friday's
events.
	   Ten people _ nine Tanzanians and a Kenyan _ were killed in a
separate blast Friday at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam in
neighboring Tanzania.
	   Kenya's ties with the United States go back to a time before
independence in 1963 when the government of President John F.
Kennedy began a program to bring young Kenyans to study at American
universities.
	   Throughout the Cold War, and despite periodic U.S. criticism of
the government for human rights abuses and mismanagement of the
economy, Kenya as a nation and Kenyans as people have remained
steadfast in their friendship with the United States.
	   In an editorial, the independent Sunday Nation echoed President
Moi's statement that Kenya has no quarrel with any nation or group,
political or religious.
	   ``To bomb our streets is therefore an impertinent affront to our
country, and one we can neither allow nor forgive. Neither is it
particularly intelligence for anybody to expect Kenyans, or
Tanzanians, to share in their blind hatred for Americans, or for
any other nation,'' the largest newspaper in East Africa said.
	   Sheikh Ali Shee, chairman of the Muslim Council of Imams and
Preachers, told reporters that the blind terror unleashed against
innocent Kenyans was grisly evidence to the world why terrorism
must never be tolerated by the civilized world.
	   But he did suggest that the Kenyan government should advise the
Americans to relocate their embassy away from the busy city center
to minimize casualties in case of similar incidents in the future.

Congo says Uganda invades, accuses Rwanda of war crimes

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo is plunging into war, Laurent
Kabila's embattled government said Sunday, charging that Ugandan
troops and tanks had invaded while Rwandan fighters were executing
captured Congolese officers.
	   The latest charges against Congo's neighbors to the east could
not be independently confirmed, but represent a sharp escalation in
hostilities with Rwanda and now also Uganda.
	   Kabila accuses the Tutsi-led Rwandan government of waging a
proxy war in Congo and of trying to establish a ``Tutsi empire'' in
his territory. His government now says Uganda is also fighting on
behalf of the Rwandan and Tutsi rebels.
	   Tutsi gunmen have captured several key cities in the Kivu region
in eastern Congo, including Goma and Bukavu.
	   ``Following a counter-attack by Congolese forces at the town of
Bukavu, two columns of Ugandan forces violated the integrity of
Congolese territory,'' Information Minister Didier Mumengi told
reporters in the capital Kinshasa.
	   The rebels launched an uprising one week ago that Kabila says
was orchestrated by Rwanda.
	   In Kigali, the Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu has
repeatedly denied the charges, but says his country will strike
back at Congo if attacked. Bizimungu said Saturday that his Ugandan
counterpart, Yoweri Museveni, had also denied any involvement in
the fighting.
	   In addition to the new allegations against Uganda, Congo accused
Rwandan forces of executing captured Congolese army officers and
rounding up civilians.
	   Mumengi said Congolese forces fighting in the east reported at
least 10 Ugandan tanks and seven trucks filled with soldiers
heading toward the Bunia, a town just across the Ugandan border
inside Congo.
	   ``The Democratic Republic of Congo condemns these attacks on the
part of Rwanda and Uganda and calls on the Organization of African
Unity and the United Nations to order the withdrawal of these
forces from Congolese territory,'' Mumengi said.
	   Fearing an escalation in fighting, foreign aid workers in Bukavu
fled across the border into Rwanda, state-controlled radio in
Rwanda reported.
	   More than 60 foreigners including Americans, Canadians and
Belgians, left the city, the Rwandan report said.
	   In Kinshasa, the government increased security around the
capital, closing all river ports and halting traffic across its
river border with the Republic of Congo.
	   Tutsi gunmen with close ties to Rwanda launched a rebellion a
week ago in Congo's eastern Kivu region and vowed to topple
President Laurent Kabila's 14-month-old regime.
	   They also control several small towns in Congo's far west near
the Atlantic coastline about 250 kilometers (150 miles) southwest
of Kinshasa.
	   Talks over the weekend in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, failed to
ease the rising tensions between the feuding African nations, with
Kabila and Bizimungu saying they were prepared for war.
	   Bizimungu accused Kabila of trying to establish a pretext to
attack Rwanda and threatened Congo with a preemptive strike.
	   ``We will not wait for Congo to attack first,'' Bizimungu told
The Associated Press.
	   He said Rwanda had credible evidence that Kabila had been
training at least 10,000 former Hutu soldiers and militiamen in the
southern city of Kamina, and that he planned to use them against
Rwanda.
	   Those rebels were responsible for the 1994 genocide of more than
500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus. The killing
ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in Rwanda in July 1994,
sending the former Hutu government across the border into Congo.
	   Bizimungu again rejected Kabila's charges that 2,000 Rwandan
troops were fighting alongside Congolese Tutsis and advancing from
the east of the country.
	   The worsening situation represents a complete disintegration of
last year's military alliance that brought Kabila to power in a war
against longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Congolese Tutsi fighters, including ethnic Banyamulenge Tutsis
who come from Rwandan ancestry, along with Rwandan forces fought
alongside Kabila in last year's rebel war. Ugandan soldiers were
also believed to be fighting alongside Kabila's forces, although
Uganda has steadfastly denied this.
	   Those same forces now seem intent on bringing an abrupt end to
Kabila's regime.

	   CHARLESTOWN, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) _ Rose Boncamper has heard
all the arguments why her beloved island of Nevis, population
9,000, wouldn't survive as the world's newest country.
	   Too costly, they say. Too tiny to survive in these times of
global economies, global trade alliances, global drug cartels.
	   But with a cheerful insistence that resonates throughout this
Caribbean island, Boncamper, selling fried dough and barbecue
chicken from a stand, says she'll vote ``Yes'' at Monday's
referendum on whether Nevis should secede from its federation with
St. Kitts, population 32,000.
	   ``We would like to take care of our own eternity,'' said
Boncamper, 59, squatting in the shadow of an umbrella to ward off a
blazing sun. ``We want to flap our wings as the eagle does and fly
by ourselves. We know that with everything comes a price.''
	   To the dismay of the islands' federal government, the 15-member
Caribbean Community and even the U.S. State Department, local polls
suggest the referendum could get the two-thirds vote needed to
pass.
	   Few saw it coming.
	   Prime Minister Denzil Douglas' government learned about the vote
on the news July 14 when the Nevis Island Legislature, which
handles local affairs on this 36-square-mile (93 sq. kms) island,
scheduled the referendum. Nevis reluctantly joined St. Kitts after
gaining independence from Britain in 1983.
	   ``We have not had a history of shedding each other's blood,''
Douglas said. ``Indeed, were it not for the (two miles (five kms)
of) water that separates us, there would be no justification for
arguing for secession.''
	   Fearing secession could induce separatist sentiment on other
multi-island nations, the Caribbean Community hinted that an
independent Nevis could have problems becoming a member.
	   Secretary-General Edwin Carrington deplored the ``creation of
yet another micro-, mini-state in our region.''
	   Privately, Caribbean officials say a breakaway Nevis would be
vulnerable to drug cartels, unable to pay international bills and a
liability to a trade bloc that recently accepted impoverished
Haiti.
	   But Nevis Premier Vance Amory argues that Nevis contributes 38
percent of the Eastern Caribbean's dlrs 85 million budget but
receives only 21 percent.
	   Nevisians say they are treated as second-class citizens. And
they complain that St. Kitts' occasional problems with drug
trafficking have unfairly tarnished them.
	   ``This really irks us Nevisians,'' said Charlestown attorney
Mark Brantley. ``We try to keep our noses clean.''
	   Amory argues that Nevis is better equipped than some former
Soviet states for independence, boasting a fledgling offshore
financial industry, a stable currency tied to the U.S. dollar and a
growing tourist industry.
	   Douglas, arguing for the very survival of his nation,
acknowledged that the 1983 constitution allows a secession vote.
But no one, he said, has explained what happens afterward.
	   St. Kitts and Nevis are bound by family, history, trade and
politics, Douglas said. And if Nevis secedes, he says the legal
bills alone over how to divide public property could swamp the
economy.
	   Brantley, however, argues the people of Nevis, the birthplace of
U.S. founding father Alexander Hamilton, are simply exercising
their healthy democracy.
	   ``We contributed to America's independence,'' he said. ``Two
centuries later, America should at least give us a chance to assert
our own independence, knowing that we are not seeking to become a
rogue in the international community.''
	   St. Kitts and Nevis is the smallest nation in the Western
hemisphere. If it secedes, Nevis would become one of the world's
smallest, sharing honors with the Pacific islands of Nauru,
population 9,900, and Niue, population 2,000.

Parliament endorses press law criticized by journalists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN HALABY &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Parliament endorsed a press and
publications law Sunday that was sharply criticized by journalists
as a government attempt to restrict press freedoms.
	   The bill, which imposes fines for criticism of the royal family,
the government and world leaders, will not go into effect until it
is approved by the 40-member, pro-government Senate and by King
Hussein, the ultimate authority in Jordan.
	   The government has defended the law as a move to rein in a media
it believes became increasingly freewheeling and irresponsible
under a relatively liberal press law enacted in 1993.
	   King Hussein has repeatedly warned that his patience was wearing
thin with Jordan's 22 tabloids, many of which are affiliated with
Muslim fundamentalist and leftist groups opposed to his pro-western
style and Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel.
	   Journalists, however, criticized the law as a departure from a
liberalization process introduced by the king in 1989.
	   Suleiman Qudah, chief editor of al-Ra'i newspaper, said the
endorsed law, which dramatically hikes possible fines, ``is in
violation of the infant democratization process in Jordan.''
	   ``There is a consensus among journalists to reject the
repressive legislation,'' he added.
	   The law was approved 37-11 after a heated daylong debate, most
of it closed to the media. Thirty-two deputies in the 80-member
Parliament were absent during the voting.
	   Parliament made minor amendments to the law, which the
government drafted and endorsed in May. The amendments were not
immediately available because most parliamentary deliberations in
the last eight weeks were held behind closed doors.
	   Under the law, a minimum fine of dlrs 50,000 will be imposed on
local and foreign media correspondents who violate vaguely defined
provisions of state security and economic stability.
	   The fine will apply to journalists who publish reports
considered disparaging to the king, his family, world leaders, the
Jordanian army as well as on crimes and cases under investigation
or before courts.
	   Under the law, journalists also must divulge their sources in
court and the government will have more powers to censor the media,
including the confiscation of credentials and closing down media
outlets.

Yugoslavia beats Russia 64-62 for fourth world title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with detail, MVP. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Zeljko Rebraca had 16 points and 11
rebounds as Yugoslavia rallied late to edge Russia 64-62 Sunday and
capture its record fourth World Basketball Championship.
	   Rebraca, who plays for Spanish club Real Madrid, hit two free
throws with 4.7 seconds left to provide the winning margin before a
sellout crowd of 18,000 at Olympic arena.
	   Dejan Bodiroga chipped in with 11 points and 5 rebounds. He was
named tournament MVP, averaging 14.7 points and 4.9 rebounds over
nine games.
	   Sergey Panov and Igor Koudellin had 14 apiece for Russia, which
settles for its second straight silver medal. It lost the title
game to a U.S. Dream Team in 1994, when Yugoslavia was not allowed
to defend its crown because of war sanctions.
	   About 3,000 Yugoslav fans celebrated Sunday's victory in the
arena, with several tossing flares after the final whistle.
	   Earlier Sunday, Jason Sasser scored 23 points as a U.S. team
with no NBAers routed Greece 84-61 to capture the bronze.
	   Russia was undone by cold shooting down the stretch.
	   After taking the lead at 49-45 on Koudellin's layup with 10:41
to play, Russia went 8:21 without a field goal. That allowed
Yugoslavia, the 1996 Olympic runners-up, to move ahead 50-49, its
first lead since 10-7 in the opening minutes.
	   Then Rebraca and Aleksandar Djordjevic, playing with a leg
injury, took over, scoring 11 of their team's last 14 points.
Djordjevic, who had missed his first five shots, did not have a
basket until hitting a 3-pointer with 2:42 left that put the
European champions ahead 53-50.
	   With Yugoslavia ahead 57-56 and 32 seconds to play, Rebraca
blocked Mikhail Mikhailov's shot, one of four rejections by the
2.11-meter (6-foot-11) center. Rebraca then had a put-back and the
closing two free throws as the 1990 world titlists held on.
	   Sergey Babkov, whose 31 points led Russia past the United States
in the semifinals, was held to four Sunday.
	   Russia had taken a seven-point lead when Koudellin's 3-pointer
made it 28-21 with 5:10 before halftime. The guard later made a
steal and scored at the other end to make it 35-30 for Russia at
intermission.
	   It went up again by seven early in the second half, before its
dry spell allowed Yugoslavia to close the gap.
	   In the third-place game, Jimmy King added 14 points and Wendell
Alexis had 12 as each of the Americans scored. Because of the NBA
labor dispute, this U.S. team was a ragtag collection cobbled
together a month ago mainly with players from the minor-league
Continental Basketball Association and European leagues.
	   ``We wanted it today. You always set your goals for the gold,''
said U.S. center David Wood, a former NBA journeyman who split last
season between the CBA and Spain, ``but this is the greatest
accomplishment of my basketball career.''
	   The United States went on an early 25-6 run and took a 32-12
lead on a Jimmy Oliver jumper 13:15 into the game.
	   Sasser, a Texas Tech product, had 11 points early in the second
half as the United States put the game away.
	   The Americans took their biggest lead at 80-46 with 4:56 left in
the game on a breakaway dunk by King, who was part of Michigan's
Fab Five teams and the CBA's MVP last season.
	   ``We wanted to push the ball and run,'' U.S. coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``Before the game we talked about what a great
opportunity this was. One game to get a medal.''
	   Greece, also fourth in 1994, shot 20-of-55 (36 percent) from the
field for the game and trailed 48-27 at halftime.
	   Dimitri Papanikolaou led the hosts with 18 points, while
Giorgios Kalaitzis had 15.
	   In consolation action, Spain beat Italy 64-61 for fifth place,
while Lithuania edged Argentina 77-76 for seventh.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Tired of his stinginess and threats to marry
another woman, an Egyptian killed her husband Sunday, stuffed his
body in a bag and set fire to it, police said.
	   Wadad Habib Sabah, 45, paid the son of the building's doorman
50,000 Egyptian pounds (dlrs 14,700) to help her kill her husband,
Fawzy Abdel-Nour, police officials said.
	   The two clubbed Abdel-Nour in the head with a machete and put
his corpse in the bag, which they threw on the roof of the
neighboring apartment building. They then set fire to it, said the
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Sabah then notified the fire department that she had seen a
madman burning objects on the roof. Fire officials, who arrived on
the scene, found only the bag and the corpse.
	   Sabah confessed, saying she killed Abdel-Nour because he had
become stingy and threatened to marry another woman, they said.

Report: McIver paid for his silence in Cowboys dorm incident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Owner Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys brokered a
high six-figure settlement between wide receiver Michael Irvin and
guard Everett McIver following their recent scuffle, The Dallas
Morning News reported Sunday.
	   A source close to the deal told the newspaper the agreement was
reached to prevent McIver from pursuing criminal charges against
Irvin or publicly discussing the July 29 incident that left McIver
with a deep cut on his neck.
	   Previously, McIver, Irvin, Jones and coach Chan Gailey
steadfastly refused to comment about the scuffle. Gailey would only
describe it as ``horseplay,'' adding, ``We're handling it
in-house.''
	   Jones strongly denied any knowledge of or role in the reported
settlement, according to the newspaper. He confirmed meeting with
McIver's agent for several hours over two days last week, and said
the two players met when McIver returned to training camp
Wednesday.
	   ``I was simply interested in making sure that the media
speculation and media reports didn't affect their relationship as
teammates,'' Jones told the newspaper. ``They have basically
confirmed that any negative feelings are behind them.''
	   Irvin dismissed the report after Saturday's exhibition game
against Oakland. ``Are you crazy, man? Let it go, let it go,'' he
told the newspaper.
	   McIver refused to discuss the incident, and other Cowboys
players, coaches and personnel have been ordered not to comment.
	   The Cowboys were not immediately available for comment Sunday.
	   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said, ``We don't comment on specific
things involving league security. It's a club issue.''
	   The source told the newspaper Irvin wanted McIver's silence
because he faces up to 20 years in prison if he is found to have
violated terms of his four-year probation. Irvin pleaded no contest
to felony cocaine possession in 1996.
	   Irvin reportedly attacked McIver with a pair of scissors in a
dispute over a haircut in a dormitory at Midwestern State
University in Wichita Falls, Texas, where the Cowboys train. McIver
needed stitches to repair a two-inch (five-centimeter) cut on the
right side of his neck.
	   The source compared the incident to ``a street fight.''
	   Dallas County probation officials said they are monitoring the
incident, but authorities in both Dallas and Wichita Falls say they
are powerless unless McIver files a complaint.

Killer admits to attacks on women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A motorcycle courier has confessed
to raping and killing nine Sao Paulo women, a leading news weekly
magazine reported Sunday.
	   Francisco de Assis Pereira, 31, was arrested last week near the
border with Uruguay. At a press conference last week to denied
committing the crimes, which occurred in a wooded park in Sao
Paulo.
	   But Veja, Brazil's leading news weekly magazine, obtained a
transcript of a police-recorded conversation after that conference
in which Pereira said he killed the women.
	   Nine other women who were assaulted in the park but escaped
alive had identified Pereira from composite drawings and
photographs.
	   Pereira fled Sao Paulo and was apparently hiding in Argentina,
but returned to Brazil where he was recognized by a fisherman who
reported him to police. He was arrested last week.
	   Police found a burned identity card of one of the victims in the
plumbing of the company where he worked. They also found Pereira's
diary, in which he described violent feelings toward young women.
	   On Saturday, Pereira returned to the park where the women were
killed and helped police find the body of a ninth victim,
19-year-old Isadora Fraenkel, who disappeared in February.
	   On Sunday, Pereira's parents issued a tearful apology to the
victims and their families on behalf of their son.
	   The killer is believed to have last struck on July 4. The other
murders took place over six months.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of jubilant
Yugoslavs took to the streets, many firing their guns into the air,
to celebrate the country's world basketball championship Sunday.
	   Downtown Belgrade was filled with flag-waving and cheering fans
moments after Yugoslavia beat Russia 64-62 in the final in Athens,
Greece.
	   Shooting into the air is a traditional regional way to celebrate
a victory. Others exploded firecrackers.
	   Rejoicing fans honked car horns and gathered en masse at the
main Republic Square, singing and dancing.
	   The rare world championship sends national pride soaring at a
time of deep trouble, including a years-old economic crunch caused
by international sanctions from the wars in former Yugoslavia as
well as the conflict against ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern
Kosovo province.
	   Present-day Yugoslavia consists of Serbia and much smaller
Montenegro.

FBI report accuses Iran of 1994 bombing of Argentine Jewish Center
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OSCAR SERRAT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ An FBI report has identified Iran
as the main suspect in the 1994 bombing of a Buenos Aires Jewish
community center, Argentina's interior minister said Sunday.
	   The report, which accuses Iran of organizing and financing the
bombing, is ``very important and a ``significant contribution'' to
the ongoing investigation into the attack, said Interior Minister
Carlos Corach.
	   Corach also praised an offer by the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation to examine the DNA of unidentified human remains
found among the debris of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association.
	   The remains are believed to belong to a suicide bomber whose car
carried the explosives that leveled the building on July 18, 1994,
killing 86 people and wounding more than 200.
	   Federal Judge Juan Jose Galeano, who is overseeing the case, is
scheduled to receive the report this week, according to a court
source who spoke on condition of customary anonymity. Galeano has
also been looking into Iranian involvement, although he has
presented no conclusive evidence against the Teheran government.
	   The newspaper Clarin first reported the existence of the report
on Friday, saying a group of 10 FBI experts conducted a 40-day
investigation in the Argentine capital and had delivered its
findings to Corach last week.
	   FBI officials did not immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment Sunday.
	   According to Clarin, the report pointed to the former cultural
attache of the Iranian Embassy in Buenos Aires, Mohsen Rabbani, as
the main suspect.
	   Rabbani left Argentina last year, when his name was mentioned in
Galeano's investigation.
	   Three former policemen and an auto dealer have been arrested in
the case. They are accused of buying the vehicle used in the
bombing, but not directly participating in the attack.
	   In Teheran, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on Saturday denied
any Iranian role in the case.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sure, the Middle East is mostly desert. But
54 C (129 F), with a dose of humidity? Day after day?
	   A heat wave has swept the region, claiming the lives of at least
38 people. Egyptians have taken to working at night, Gulf Arabs
have flocked to pools with chilled water and zookeepers have had to
hose down miserable animals.
	   ``When I go out, I keep my car windows up and the
air-conditioner on full blast, and I make sure I'm going to an air
conditioned place,'' said Yousef Labib, a Cairo cameraman who works
outside with a soaked towel around his head and neck.
	   Across the region:
	   _ Thirty-five people have died in Cyprus, where the heat wave
has brought the hottest temperatures to the eastern Mediterranean
island in 40 years. On Sunday, temperatures hit 43 C (110 F).
	   _ Three people have died in Egypt, where the temperatures have
stayed put at 38 C (100 F) for more than three weeks. Among them
were two brothers, aged 12 and 9, who drowned Sunday when they
tried to swim in the Nile River near Cairo to cool off.
	   _ In the Palestinian city of Jericho, where the temperature hit
42 C (108 F), a 45-year-old prisoner died Saturday from
overheating.
	   Even more widespread are injuries.
	   In Bahrain, 56 men, mostly laborers, were treated for heat
exhaustion Sunday after they fainted while working in temperatures
above 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit).
	   Thirty people were hospitalized in Jordan with sun stroke and
heat exhaustion between Saturday and Sunday as temperatures peaked
at 48 degrees (118 Fahrenheit).
	   At least 1,000 people, many of them elderly, were treated Sunday
in Cyprus, where temperatures are five degrees higher than average.
	   Authorities everywhere are warning people to take precautions.
	   The Health Ministry in Jordan broadcast radio and television
advertisements to warn the elderly, diabetics and people with heart
and kidney problems against leaving their homes.
	   Egyptian radio has regularly warned people to drink lots of
water and simply stay out of the heat. Many construction workers
and street repairmen are working at night to escape the heat, when
temperatures can drop _ in desert fashion _ to 25 C (77 F).
	   At the Cairo Zoo, in the polluted, noisy downtown, keepers have
had to hose down polar bears, elephants and lions. About 100
ambulances are parked around the city for emergency treatment.
	   In Kuwait, where temperatures have hit 50 degrees C (122 F) in
the shade, pools have special gear to chill the water.
	   When will the heat wave break?
	   ``This week,'' said Mohammed Rashad, an official at the Egypt's
Meteorological Authority in Cairo.
	   ``But it will probably hit again a few days later,'' he added.
``This is summer. We cannot change the will of God.''

14 militants killed in fighting with security forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Government troops raided two militant camps
in Kashmir on Sunday and killed eight guerrillas, police said.
	   All eight were members of the Hizbul Mujahideen, one of several
groups who want Kashmir to become independent from India or to
merge with neighboring Pakistan.
	   Police said Ali Mohd Dar, a top militant of the pro-Pakistan
group was among three killed in one raid in Kashmir's summer
capital Srinagar, 625 kilometers (375 miles) north of the Indian
capital, New Delhi. Five others were killed in Anantnag which is
north of Srinagar.
	   Four other militants were killed in two separate encounters in
other parts of Kashmir.

Rafter wins du Maurier Open

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Patrick Rafter became the first player to win the
Du Maurier Open without losing a set Sunday when he beat Richard
Krajicek 7-6 (7-3), 6-4.
	   The 25-year-old Australian had a clean slate in five matches,
and beat Krajicek for only the second time in eight career
meetings.
	   Neither player had a break in the first set, but Rafter won a
tiebreaker thanks to Krajicek's serving struggles. The Dutchman,
who relies on his hard serves, missed three first serves and Rafter
pounced on the second offerings.
	   Rafter looked like he was in trouble in the second set, when
Krajicek broke him to lead 3-1. But Rafter broke right back, then
broke again to go up 5-4 and serve for the match.
	   Rafter, who defends his U.S. Open title in a few weeks, earned
dlrs 361,000. Krajicek received dlrs 190,000.

American Pete Sampras and top-ranked Marcelo Rios of Chile.

Yugoslavia beats Russia 64-62 for fourth world title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS. UPDATES with quotes. TRIMS at bottom. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia showed yet again it plays the
best basketball this side of the NBA.
	   The European titlist captured its record fourth World Basketball
Championship crown Sunday with a 64-62 comeback victory over Russia
as Zeljko Rebraca led the way with 16 points and 11 rebounds.
	   The gold medal joins the ones Yugoslavia won at the 1970, 1978
and 1990 world championships. It was banned from the 1994
tournament because of war sanctions, but has since added two
straight European golds and a silver behind the U.S. Dream Team at
the 1996 Olympics.
	   ``After the embargo we played in four straight finals and won
three times. It's incredible. We have a lot of reason to be very
proud,'' Yugoslav coach Zeljko Obradovic said.
	   ``We had many problems, and players who weren't here. But we got
this again,'' he added, tugging on the gold medal hanging around
his neck.
	   Earlier Sunday, Jason Sasser scored 23 points as a U.S. team
with no NBAers routed Greece 84-61 to capture the bronze.
	   Rebraca, who plays for Italian club Benetton Treviso, hit two
free throws with 4.7 seconds left to provide the winning margin
before a sellout crowd of 18,000 at Olympic arena.
	   Dejan Bodiroga chipped in with 11 points and 5 rebounds and was
named tournament MVP.
	   ``There are 12 MVPs on our team,'' said Bodiroga, a guard who
averaged 14.7 points and 4.9 rebounds over nine games.
	   ``I'm very happy that I was voted MVP but the most important
thing is that we won the world championship and we are No. 1 in the
world.''
	   They did it without Charlotte Hornets center Vlade Divac and
injured former NBA player Predrag Danilovic.
	   Sergey Panov and Igor Koudellin had 14 points apiece for Russia,
which was undone by cold shooting down the stretch and settles for
its second straight silver medal.
	   After taking the lead at 49-45 on Koudellin's layup with 10:41
to play, Russia went 8:21 without a field goal. That allowed
Yugoslavia to move ahead 50-49, its first lead since 10-7 in the
opening minutes.
	   Then Rebraca and Aleksandar Djordjevic, playing with a leg
injury, took over, scoring 11 of their team's last 14 points.
Djordjevic, who had missed his first five shots, did not have a
basket until hitting a 3-pointer with 2:42 left that put the
European champions ahead 53-50.
	   ``At the end, there were two great players, Djordjevic and
Rebraca, who determined who would win,'' Russian coach Sergey Belov
said.
	   With Yugoslavia ahead 57-56 and 32 seconds to play, Rebraca
blocked Mikhail Mikhailov's shot, one of four rejections by the
2.11-meter (6-foot-11) center. Rebraca then had a put-back and the
closing two free throws.
	   Sergey Babkov, whose 31 points led Russia past the United States
in the semifinals, was held to four Sunday.
	   Russia had taken a seven-point lead when Koudellin's 3-pointer
made it 28-21 with 5:10 before halftime. The guard later made a
steal and scored at the other end to make it 35-30 for Russia at
intermission.
	   Russia, which lost to the United States in the 1994 final, went
up again by seven early in the second half, before its dry spell
allowed Yugoslavia to close the gap.
	   In the third-place game, Jimmy King added 14 points and Wendell
Alexis had 12 as each of the Americans scored.
	   Because of the NBA labor dispute, this U.S. team was cobbled
together a month ago mainly with players from the minor-league
Continental Basketball Association and European leagues.
	   ``We wanted it today. You always set your goals for the gold,''
said U.S. center David Wood, a former NBA journeyman who split last
season between the CBA and Spain, ``but this is the greatest
accomplishment of my basketball career.''
	   The United States went on an early 25-6 run and took a 32-12
lead on a Jimmy Oliver jumper 13:15 into the game.
	   Sasser, a Texas Tech product, had 11 points early in the second
half as the United States put the game out of reach.
	   ``We wanted to push the ball and run,'' U.S. coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``Before the game we talked about what a great
opportunity this was. One game to get a medal.''
	   Greece, also fourth in 1994, shot 20-of-55 (36 percent) from the
field for the game and trailed 48-27 at halftime.
	   Dimitri Papanikolaou led the hosts with 18 points.
	   In consolation action, Spain beat Italy 64-61 for fifth place,
while Lithuania edged Argentina 77-76 for seventh.

American Pete Sampras and top-ranked Marcelo Rios of Chile.

Light aircraft pilot dies in air show crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The pilot of a light aircraft died Sunday after
crashing at an air show in Norfolk, eastern England, police said.
	   Witnesses at the Swanton Morley airfield said that the
single-seater aircraft was one of four planes flying in formation
when it plummeted to the ground.
	   Police said the plane crashed away from a crowd of about 3,000
spectators, and that no one on the ground was injured. The pilot
died instantly.
	   ``No aerobatics were involved and the reason for the crash is
not yet identified,'' a spokesman for Norfolk police, speaking on
terms of customary anonymity, said. The name of the pilot, and
details of the plane, were not immediately released by police.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The bomb outside the U.S. Embassy
in Tanzania was so powerful that it shook furniture in homes a mile
away.
	   But the solid construction of the Israeli-built embassy may have
prevented the carnage of a similar bomb in Kenya, an official said
Saturday.
	   Another reason was the location _ a quiet tree-lined
neighborhood.
	   The embassy away from the center of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's
laid-back capital of swaying palms and sparse traffic, is largely
free from the congestion that plagues most other major African
cities.

China blows dikes in attempt to lower swollen Yangtze

 &UR; AP Photos BEJ101-103, AP GRAPHIC CHINA FLOOD 2 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Levees were dynamited along a stretch of the
swollen Yangtze River on Sunday in an effort to divert floodwaters
menacing cities and farmland in central China's Hubei province.
	   Secondary dikes were blown at 12 a.m. (0400 GMT) in Jianli
County, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) upriver from the industrial
center of Wuhan, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. More
solid primary dikes farther back from the river remain intact.
	   Police forced 50,000 residents _ many of them ``reluctant to
move'' _ out of their homes ahead of the flooding, Xinhua said. The
government has promised that residents affected by flood diversions
will be compensated for lost property and crops.
	   Engineers hope the diversion of up to 800 million cubic meters
(28 billion cubic feet) of water into farmland behind the dike will
lower the raging Yangtze's water level by 10-25 centimeters (4-10
inches), Xinhua reported.
	   If successful, the deliberate flooding at Jianli could remove
the need to flood the much larger Jingjiang diversion area farther
upriver, where 330,000 people have already been evacuated to high
ground.
	   At 7 p.m. Sunday, the river at Shashi north of the Jingjiang
diversion area stood at 44.65 meters (147.3 feet), dangerously high
but still below the 45-meter (148.5-foot) mark at which authorities
say they will be forced to flood the area, Xinhua said.
	   Jingjiang was last used to divert the Yangtze in 1954, when
floods killed more than 30,000 people.
	   More than 2,000 people have died nationwide this summer in
floods caused by seasonal rains that arrived a month early and fell
much harder than usual. Millions more have been left homeless due
to dikes collapsing along many parts of the Yangtze and its
tributaries in central and eastern China.
	   Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji inspected flood defenses in Hubei on
Saturday and Sunday, thanking soldiers and area residents for their
efforts to combat the floods.
	   The 2.9 million-strong People's Liberation Army has played a
high-profile role in official reports on the flooding, and Zhu said
the military's hand in fighting floods ``demonstrates once again
that the People's Liberation Army is the Chinese people's own
army,'' Xinhua reported.
	   Meanwhile, soldiers and civilian volunteers plugged a major
breach in the Yangtze dike at Jiujiang city that burst Friday, the
state-owned China Central Television reported.
	   The breach flooded a 4-square-kilometer (1.6-square-mile) area
of the city, but residents were evacuated and no injuries were
reported, Xinhua said.
	   Authorities worry that more of the approximately 30,000
kilometers (18,600 miles) of Yangtze dikes could collapse after
weeks of rain and flooding.
	   Soldiers and residents of riverside communities have kept up
around-the-clock vigils on dikes for weeks, filling cracks and
guarding against undermining by the river.
	   CCTV news showed soldiers in boats rescuing people from trees
and partially submerged homes, but did not say where or when the
footage was taken. Floating bodies were spotted in the countryside
around Jiujiang where dikes burst last week, said photographers who
traveled in the area over the weekend.
	   One woman's corpse lay exposed for three days because residents
were too busy shoring up dikes to transport it to a morgue, they
said.
	   A flood crest, the fourth this year, was heading toward Jiujiang
after roaring through upstream sections of the river in Hubei
province Saturday, Xinhua said. Water levels at Wuhan, an
industrial center in Hubei with 7 million inhabitants, have been
rising slowly since Saturday, it said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Broken-hearted survivors of the U.S.
Embassy bombing, relatives of those who died and those who came to
help heal the wounded and track down the killers gathered Sunday
for a memorial service for the 12 Americans who died.
	   Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, who suffered minor injuiries in
the Friday blast that rocked the solid, squat embassy in downtown
Nairobi and flattened a building next door, presided over the 1
1/2-hour non-denominational service at her residence attended by
about 200 people.
	   Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said the service was ``largely a
celebration of the people we knew, a service to honor our people,
our colleagues, our friends.''
	   The embassy said 24 Kenyan staff were also killed in the blast
that has so far taken 200 lives.

FBI report accuses Iran of 1994 bombing of Argentine Jewish Center
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with FBI declining comment on report. &QL; 
 &UR; By OSCAR SERRAT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The U.S. FBI has identified Iran
as the main suspect in the 1994 bombing of a Buenos Aires Jewish
community center, Argentina's interior minister said Sunday.
	   An FBI report, which accuses Iran of organizing and financing
the bombing, is ``very important and a ``significant contribution''
to the ongoing investigation into the attack, said Interior
Minister Carlos Corach.
	   Corach also praised an offer by the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation to examine the DNA of unidentified human remains
found among the debris of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association.
	   The remains are believed to belong to a suicide bomber whose car
carried the explosives that leveled the building on July 18, 1994,
killing 86 people and wounding more than 200.
	   Federal Judge Juan Jose Galeano, who is overseeing the case, is
scheduled to receive the report this week, according to a court
source who spoke on condition of customary anonymity. Galeano has
also been looking into Iranian involvement, although he has
presented no conclusive evidence against the Teheran government.
	   The newspaper Clarin first reported the existence of the report
on Friday, saying a group of 10 FBI experts conducted a 40-day
investigation in the Argentine capital and had delivered its
findings to Corach last week.
	   An FBI spokeswoman in Washington declined comment on the report
Sunday.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ An Israeli team searching floor to floor
with rescue dogs found a woman and her son Sunday in a building
damaged in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, a slim ray of
hope as 20 bodies were pulled from the rubble.
	   Using a 150-ton crane, drills and blowtorches, another Israeli
team was trying to free a woman named Rose trapped in a very
difficult spot in a collapsed building adjacent to the embassy.
	   ``I spoke to her at around 10 a.m. (0700 GMT). I just told her
to hold on. We're coming for her and she said, `yes.' But now she's
very weak,'' said Bob Nasser, head of the Kenyan disaster
coordination team at the site.
	   As the American Embassy held a memorial service for the
Americans who died, several hundred members of the U.S.
investigation team were ``setting up shop,'' according to embassy
spokesman Bill Barr.
	   The body of U.S. Consul General Julian Bartley, missing since
Friday, was identified Sunday night, said embassy spokesman Chris
Scharf. Bartley was the last missing American to be found and the
highest ranking of the 12 Americans to die in the bombing.
	   The official death toll in Friday's nearly simultaneous bombings
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania rose to 210, all but 10
in the Nairobi blast. A total of 4,877 people were injured, but
only about 560 remain hospitalized, the vast majority in Kenya.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ In churches and in a big city park,
Nairobi residents on Sunday mourned the Kenyans who died in the
terrorist bombing of the U.S. Embassy in the Kenyan capital.
	   But there was no sign of resentment toward Americans, whose
diplomatic presence was the target of the Friday blast that gutted
the embassy building and flattened a four-story building next door.
	   ``Pole, we are very sorry for what happened to your embassy,''
said one of Kenya's normally taciturn immigration officials, using
the Swahili word to express regret when an American presented her
passport on arrival at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta airport.
	   Kenya's ties with the United States go back decades. Before
1963, when the East African nation became independent, the
government of President John F. Kennedy had begun a program to
bring young Kenyans to study at American universities.
	   Throughout the Cold War, Kenya, unlike many of its African
neighbors, remained firmly in the Western camp. Leaders Jomo
Kenyatta and Daniel arap Moi favored a mix of big state enterprises
and private industry.
	   And despite periodic U.S. criticism of the government for human
rights abuses and mismanagement of the economy, the East African
nation has held on to its friendship with the United States.
	   Martin Omondi, a 24-year-old security guard who initially
thought the bomb blast was an earthquake, said it was difficult to
describe how he felt when he learned the target was the U.S.
Embassy.
	   ``Their work is so good to help us,'' he said. ``I feel bad
about this attack.''
	   As several preachers swayed and sang Sunday on a makeshift
platform in downtown Uhuru (Freedom) Park, about 4,000 men, women
and children clapped, prayed and sang songs ranging from the
exultant to the mournful. Their shabby clothes marked them as the
urban poor.
	   People who had just donated blood at a collection center next
door joined them.
	   Roman Catholic Archbishop Rafael Ndingi told worshippers at the
Holy Family Basilica, ``As we pray for our dead, dear brothers and
sisters, we must also forgive the one who is the cause of this,''
he said. ``When we forgive, we find consolation.''
	   Retribution, he went on, is God's business. ``God says:
`Vengeance is mine. Leave it to me, and I'll take care of it.'''
	   Emerging from worship at the Anglican All Saints Cathedral,
James Mathenge, chairman of the Kenya Freedom from Hunger Council,
said the organization was sending its condolences to Kenyans,
Americans and Tanzanians alike _ all of whom suffered in Friday's
events.
	   Abdul Ibrahim, a businessman from the Indian Ocean port of
Mombasa, said he didn't think the bombing would affect Kenya's ties
with the United States, which is a major donor of development and
emergency relief aid.
	   ``There are good relations, and these good relations will
continue,'' he said.
	   In an editorial, the independent Sunday Nation echoed President
Daniel arap Moi's statement that Kenya has no quarrel with any
nation or group, political or religious.
	   ``To bomb our streets is therefore an impertinent affront to our
country, and one we can neither allow nor forgive. Neither is it
particularly intelligent for anybody to expect Kenyans, or
Tanzanians, to share in their blind hatred for Americans, or for
any other nation,'' the largest newspaper in East Africa said.
	   Sheikh Ali Shee, chairman of the Muslim Council of Imams and
Preachers, told reporters that the terror unleashed against
innocent Kenyans was grisly evidence why terrorism must never be
tolerated by the civilized world.
	   But he did suggest that the Kenyan government should advise the
Americans to relocate their embassy away from the busy city center
to minimize casualties in case of similar incidents in the future.

Mallon wins Star Bank Classic in sudden death

<TEXT>
	   BEAVERCREEK, Ohio (AP) _ Meg Mallon won the Star Bank LPGA
Classic when she parred the first hole of a playoff Sunday, then
watched Dottie Pepper miss a 5-foot putt.
	   Pepper fired a 6-under-par 66 in regulation at the Country Club
of the North to tie fellow American Mallon at 17-under par and set
up the playoff round.
	   Two weeks ago, in the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic in Howland, Ohio,
Pepper missed a 4-foot birdie putt that would have forced a playoff
with tournament winner Se Ri Pak of Korea.
	   Mallon had a chance to win the tournament in regulation on the
par 4, 397-yard 18th hole, but a 10-foot birdie putt went just to
the left of the cup.
	   In the playoff, the two matched tee shots off the 18th, but
Pepper's approach shot to the green landed 40 feet from the cup.
Mallon punched her ball within 25 feet, but her putt for birdie
rimmed the cup and she had to settle for par.
	   Pepper left her putt for the win 5 feet short, then missed the
next when the ball broke to the right.
	   A jubilant Mallon tossed her ball into the gallery and then gave
Pepper a hug.
	   ``I didn't play spectacular golf today, but I played good at the
right time,'' Mallon said.
	   Pepper was pleased with her play, but disappointed in the putt
that gave Mallon the victory.
	   ``I was just trying to stare down the left lip, but I just
didn't make a very good putt,'' Pepper said.
	   Mallon and Pepper finished at 199 for the tournament, breaking
the record of 203 set last year by Colleen Walker of the United
States.
	   It was Mallon's first tournament victory since 1996, when she
won the Sara Lee Classic. The former Ohio State player has had nine
top-10 finishes this year in 20 tournaments.
	   Pepper had led the tournament following the first round, but was
overtaken Saturday by Mallon.
	   Mallon began the round Sunday with a one-stroke lead at
13-under. But she was quickly tied when Donna Andrews birdied the
second hole.
	   Both Mallon and Andrews had to contend with fellow American
Julie Inkster, who started at 8-under and had birdies on the first
four holes. She finished the front nine with a tournament-record
29.
	   A birdie on the 10th gave Inkster the lead, but on the par-3,
13th she took a double bogey. That left her in a tie with Andrews
at 15-under.
	   The two were later joined in the lead by a surging Pepper, who
got her third straight birdie on 11. Andrews fell back when she
bogeyed the 12th, and she was replaced as a leader by Mallon, who
birdied the same hole.
	   Andrews finished the tournament in third and Inkster in fourth.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia showed yet again it plays the
best basketball this side of the NBA.
	   The European titlist captured its record fourth World Basketball
Championship crown Sunday with a 64-62 comeback victory over Russia
as Zeljko Rebraca led the way with 16 points and 11 rebounds.
	   The gold medal joins the ones Yugoslavia won at the 1970, 1978
and 1990 world championships. It was banned from the 1994
tournament because of war sanctions, but has since added two
straight European golds and a silver behind the U.S. Dream Team at
the 1996 Olympics.
	   ``After the embargo we played in four straight finals and won
three times. It's incredible. We have a lot of reason to be very
proud,'' Yugoslav coach Zeljko Obradovic said.
	   ``We had many problems, and players who weren't here. But we got
this again,'' he added, tugging on the gold medal hanging around
his neck.
	   Earlier Sunday, Jason Sasser scored 23 points as a U.S. team
with no NBAers routed Greece 84-61 to capture the bronze.
	   Rebraca, who plays for Italian club Benetton Treviso, hit two
free throws with 4.7 seconds left to provide the winning margin
before a sellout crowd of 18,000 at Olympic arena.
	   Dejan Bodiroga chipped in with 11 points and 5 rebounds and was
named tournament MVP.
	   ``There are 12 MVPs on our team,'' said Bodiroga, a guard who
averaged 14.7 points and 4.9 rebounds over nine games.
	   ``I'm very happy that I was voted MVP but the most important
thing is that we won the world championship and we are No. 1 in the
world.''
	   They did it without Charlotte Hornets center Vlade Divac and
injured former NBA player Predrag Danilovic.
	   Sergey Panov and Igor Koudellin had 14 points apiece for Russia,
which was undone by cold shooting down the stretch and settles for
its second straight silver medal.
	   After taking the lead at 49-45 on Koudellin's layup with 10:41
to play, Russia went 8:21 without a field goal. That allowed
Yugoslavia to move ahead 50-49, its first lead since 10-7 in the
opening minutes.
	   Then Rebraca and Aleksandar Djordjevic, playing with a leg
injury, took over, scoring 11 of their team's last 14 points.
Djordjevic, who had missed his first five shots, did not have a
basket until hitting a 3-pointer with 2:42 left that put the
European champions ahead 53-50.
	   ``At the end, there were two great players, Djordjevic and
Rebraca, who determined who would win,'' Russian coach Sergey Belov
said.
	   With Yugoslavia ahead 57-56 and 32 seconds to play, Rebraca
blocked Mikhail Mikhailov's shot, one of four rejections by the
2.11-meter (6-foot-11) center. Rebraca then had a put-back and the
closing two free throws.
	   Sergey Babkov, whose 31 points led Russia past the United States
in the semifinals, was held to four Sunday.
	   Russia had taken a seven-point lead when Koudellin's 3-pointer
made it 28-21 with 5:10 before halftime. The guard later made a
steal and scored at the other end to make it 35-30 for Russia at
intermission.
	   Russia, which lost to the United States in the 1994 final, went
up again by seven early in the second half, before its dry spell
allowed Yugoslavia to close the gap.
	   In the third-place game, Jimmy King added 14 points and Wendell
Alexis had 12 as each of the Americans scored.
	   Because of the NBA labor dispute, this U.S. team was cobbled
together a month ago mainly with players from the minor-league
Continental Basketball Association and European leagues.
	   ``We wanted it today. You always set your goals for the gold,''
said U.S. center David Wood, a former NBA journeyman who split last
season between the CBA and Spain, ``but this is the greatest
accomplishment of my basketball career.''
	   The United States went on an early 25-6 run and took a 32-12
lead on a Jimmy Oliver jumper 13:15 into the game.
	   Sasser, a Texas Tech product, had 11 points early in the second
half as the United States put the game out of reach.
	   ``We wanted to push the ball and run,'' U.S. coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``Before the game we talked about what a great
opportunity this was. One game to get a medal.''
	   Greece, also fourth in 1994, shot 20-of-55 (36 percent) from the
field for the game and trailed 48-27 at halftime.
	   Dimitri Papanikolaou led the hosts with 18 points.
	   In consolation action, Spain beat Italy 64-61 for fifth place,
while Lithuania edged Argentina 77-76 for seventh.

Rafter wins du Maurier Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes, details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Patrick Rafter became the first player in 10
years to win the du Maurier Open without losing a set Sunday when
he beat Richard Krajicek 7-6 (7-3), 6-4.
	   The 25-year-old Australian had a clean slate in five matches,
matching Ivan Lendl's feat accomplished in 1988.
	   Krajicek, who had victories in six of seven matches against
Rafter entering the final, had lived by the serve and volley in his
previous matches against Rafter. Krajicek entered the final leading
the entire du Maurier field with 64 aces but was limited to dealing
10 to Rafter, putting only 59 percent of first serves in play.
	   ``I couldn't punish him on my serve,'' Krajicek said. ``That's a
shame.''
	   Both players held serve their first six times in the first set,
setting up the tiebreaker, where Krajicek began to struggle. Rafter
scored minibreaks all three times Krajicek missed his first serve
to take the tiebreaker 7-3.
	   The Dutchman also struggled on his groundstrokes. His weak
backhand seldom cleared the net and his forehand, usually a terror
to opposing players, faded as well.
	   ``He really destroys me a lot with that forehand and the times
that I did go there I got lucky on them,'' Rafter said. ``I went
there at the right times.''
	   Said Krajicek: ``I count on my forehand more and it really let
me down.''
	   Krajicek broke Rafter to go up 3-1 in the second set, but he
lost his serve the very next game with two consecutive
double-faults that gave Rafter a break. Rafter broke Krajicek again
for a 4-3 lead and the two players traded holds to give Rafter a
5-4 lead. Rafter then held at love to win the set 6-4.
	   ``He was mixing up his serve pretty good,'' Krajicek said. ``He
was all over the place, quick and slow, and it made it a lot
tougher for me.''
	   Rafter, who defends his U.S. Open title in a few weeks, earned
dlrs 361,000 and will move from fifth to third in the ATP world
rankings Monday. He also became the first Australian to win this
event since John Newcombe in 1971, two years before Rafter was
born.
	   Krajicek received dlrs 190,000.

	   SAN JOSE, California (AP) _ David Kramer made seven saves and
five different Clash players scored Sunday as San Jose beat the New
York-New Jersey MetroStars 5-1.
	   Defender John Doyle began the scoring for the Clash (9-14) in
the 20th minute. Braeden Cloutier broke a 1-1 tie in the 60th
minute, when he pounced on a loose ball and beat Tony Meola with a
shot inside the far post.
	   Oscar Draguicevich, Eric Wynalda and Victor Mella also scored
second-half goals for the Clash, who broke the MetroStars'
three-game winning streak. Diego Sonora scored the MetroStars only
goal on a penalty kick in the first half.
	   The MetroStars (12-10) played a man short for the final 18
minutes after Kerry Zavagnin received his second yellow card of the
day.

American balloonist solves burner problem, continues over Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with progress of flight on Sunday. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Balloonist Steve Fossett's attempt to circle
the globe is back on course after correcting a propane burner
problem that caused a small fire.
	   After losing two of four burners that keep the silver-and-white
balloon aloft in a small fire, Fossett was able to douse the flames
Saturday and later fix one of the burners. He suffered only minor
burns.
	   At 2000 GMT Sunday, Fossett's Solo Spirit had covered 2,163
miles (3,480 kms). The balloon was moving eastward over the South
Atlantic at 45 mph (72 kph) between Argentina and South Africa.
	   The 54-year-old Chicago stockbroker took off from western
Argentina late Friday in a bid to become the first balloonist ever
to circle the world. He hopes to complete the 20,000-mile (32,000
kms) course around the Southern Hemisphere _ most of it over
treacherous oceans _ in 14 to 18 days.
	   Fossett was expected to take four days to cross the South
Atlantic toward Cape Town, South Africa. If all goes to plan, he
would then try to fly on to Australia before returning to South
America via the Pacific.

Plane bursts tires landing at Belfast City Airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A British Airways aircraft with
65 passengers and four crew on board burst its four undercarriage
tires on landing Sunday, a spokeswoman for the airline said.
	   Leontia Fetherston said that the emergency services were called
to the plane, a British Aerospace Advance Turbo Prop, after it
braked and came to a halt on the runway at Belfast City Airport.
	   ``No emergency was declared, and the passengers disembarked down
aircraft steps,'' Fetherston said.
	   A Belfast City Airport spokesman, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, said the airport was closed for about three
hours while the aircraft's tires were changed and it was towed from
the runway. Flights to the airport were transferred to Belfast
International Airport.

Yankees beat Kansas 5-4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bernie Williams singled home the tiebreaking run
in the eighth inning as the New York Yankees beat Kansas City 5-4
on Sunday, completing a four-game wipeout of the Royals.
	   New York (84-29) outscored the Royals 41-9 in the sweep,
completing a week that saw the Yankees win seven of eight,
outscoring Oakland and Kansas City by a combined 76-22.
	   The Yankees are 55 games over .500 for the first time since they
finished the 1961 season at 109-53 and are on pace to break the
record of 116 wins set by the 1906 Chicago Cubs. They are 42-8 at
home.
	   Ramiro Mendoza (8-2) pitched 2 1-3 hitless innings in relief of
Andy Pettitte, and Mariano Rivera got three outs for his 30th save
in 38 chances. Scott Service (4-3) took the loss.
	   Scott Brosius homered in the third for the Yankees.
	   In Detroit, Alex Rodriguez hit a tie-breaking, three-run homer
in the seventh as Seattle finished its first ever four-game sweep
of the Detroit.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. failed to homer for the ninth straight game, but
made a spectacular leaping catch in center to rob Detroit's Luis
Gonzalez of a two-run homer. Griffey, the AL's home run leader with
41, was 1-for-5 with three strikeouts, hasn't homered in 42
at-bats.
	   Rodriguez has 35 homers. Edgar Martinez went 3-for-5 with a
homer and two RBIs, and rookie Raul Ibanez also homered for the
Mariners, who have won six of their last seven.
	   Bob Wells (2-2) pitched one shutout inning of relief, and Mike
Timlin got three outs for his ninth save. Sean Runyan (1-3) took
the loss.
	   In Minneapolis, Pat Meares went 3-for-4 with two RBIs as
Minnesota beat Baltimore for its first victory in eight games in
August.
	   Meares raised his average against Mike Mussina (10-6) to .417
(10-for-24), and helped hand the right-hander his second loss in 14
decisions against Minnesota. The loss snapped Baltimore's five-game
winning streak.
	   Dan Serafini (5-4) limited the Orioles to two runs in six
innings, and Rick Aguilera pitched the ninth for his 28th save.
	   B.J. Surhoff and Roberto Alomar homered for the Orioles, who
have connected in a franchise-record 20 straight games. Eric Davis
had an infield hit in the third to extend his team-record hitting
streak to 25 games.
	   In Chicago, Chuck Finley won for the first time since June 30,
allowing only three hits in seven innings as Anaheim beat Chicago.
	   Tim Salmon was 3-for-5 with three RBIs for the Angels, who
snapped a three-game losing streak and had lost seven of nine.
Salmon hit an RBI single in the first, an RBI double in the third,
and his 22nd homer in the fourth.
	   Finley (9-5) was 0-1 with a 3.09 ERA in his last six starts. He
walked five and struck out four, raising his career total to 1,900
strikeouts.
	   James Baldwin (7-5) took the loss.
	   In Toronto, Jose Cruz Jr. hit a two-run homer in the eighth
inning to rally Toronto past Oakland.
	   Carlos Delgado singled to open the eighth off Mike Mohler (3-3)
before Cruz hit his fifth homer over the left-field fence.
	   Paul Quantrill (2-4) got the win with 1 1-3 innings of relief.
	   Mohler (3-3) spoiled a strong outing by A's starter Mike Oquist,
who allowed just one earned run and six hits in 5 2-3 innings.
	   In St.Petersburg, John Flaherty's ninth-inning double drove in
Quinton McCracken from first base as Tampa Bay beat Cleveland.
	   McCracken began the ninth with a single off Paul Assenmacher
(2-5). Paul Shuey gave up the winning shot into the left-field
corner one out later.
	   Jim Mecir (4-2) pitched one inning for the victory.

New president replaces entire armed forces leadership
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana on Sunday
named a new armed forces chief and replaced the commanders of the
army, navy and air force, forming a new military team led by
Fernando Tapias, who had been the army's No. 2 general.
	   The wholesale military purge, announced by Defense Minister
Rodrigo Lloreda just two days after Pastrana took office, follows a
withering offensive last week by leftist guerrillas in which at
least 143 soldiers and police were killed and 133 taken prisoner.
	   The offensive, including the destruction of an anti-narcotics
base, marked the latest in an embarrassing string of defeats in
which rebels have now captured more than 200 security force
members.
	   ``This is what the country needs most to deal with a delicate
security situation and the reconciliation process that are
government priorities,'' the defense minister said in announcing
the new leadership.
	   ``We want to give peace a chance, though this does not mean that
they will neglect their obligations or drop their guard,'' Lloreda
said of the new commanders.
	   Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, highly praised by U.S. officials for
putting the entire leadership of the Cali drug cartel in jail and
an internal anti-corruption campaign, will continue as national
police commander, Lloreda said.
	   In Colombia, the national police are a branch of the military.
	   Tapias, a former army inspector-general and intelligence
officer, faces the difficult task of trying to revitalize an inept
and poorly trained fighting force that has during the
administration of ex-President Ernesto Samper suffered its worst
defeats ever against well-financed and highly disciplined leftist
rebels.
	   Tapias will have to balance that task with Pastrana's No. 1
policy goal: making peace with the rebels.
	   Lloreda also announced these appointments:
	   _Gen. Jorge Enrique Mora Rangel as army chief. Mora was
commander of the army's Fifth Division, based in Bogota.
	   _Gen. Rafael Hernandez as armed forces chief of staff. Hernandez
had commanded a special army unit created in March after rebels
wiped out a batallion in southern jungles.
	   _Gen. Jose Manuel Sandoval as air force chief. He was the No. 2
man in the air force.
	   _Adm. Sergio Edilberto Garcia as navy commander. Garcia was the
navy's deputy commander.

Fernandez wins; teammate Pruett second, Rahal third

	   LEXINGTON, Ohio (AP) _ Adrian Fernandez and Scott Pruett may be
teammates, but that didn't keep them from fighting for first place
like any two other drivers would over in the final 26 laps of the
Miller Lite 200.
	   Fernandez held off his Patrick Racing teammate by 0.247 seconds
Sunday in winning the CART event at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.
It's the first time Patrick has finished one-two since the 1982
Michigan 500.
	   ``It was a very difficult race because I knew Scott was strong
and would have something left for me at the end. Scott determined
the pace of the race, but when he was pushing, I was pushing
harder,'' Fernandez said.
	   Fernandez, who also won at Motegi, Japan, in March, was
victorious for the second time this year and third time in his
six-season career. He averaged 98.428 mph (158 kph) in edging
Pruett by 0.247 seconds. Bobby Rahal was third in his final race on
his home track.
	   ``Adrian never put a wheel wrong all day long, but we gave him a
run for his money,'' Pruett said. ``I was hoping he'd let me by at
the end because he's already won once this year, but he wasn't
going to let that happen.''
	   Fernandez took the lead on the 58th of 83 laps after previous
leader Gil de Ferran pitted, but that was almost unnoticed because
of a spectacular crash involving Michael Andretti on lap 56.
	   Andretti's car went airborne on the track's seventh turn and
flipped at least four times before coming to rest in a sandy runoff
area. He was able to walk away.
	   He was trying to make it through a gap between Mark Blundell and
PJ Jones when Jones moved into Andretti's path because of an
accident involving Alex Zanardi and JJ Lehto. Those two cars
bumped, with the wing from Lehto's car landing in Jones' lap and
causing him to lose control briefly, bringing him and Andretti into
contact.
	   ``I just went for a wild ride,'' Andretti said. ``I was caught
totally off guard. When something like that happens, you just close
your eyes and pray you don't hit anything.''
	   Zanardi, the season points leader, picked up one point by
finishing 12th and didn't lose ground in the driver standings
because his closest pursuers all finished behind him. Zanardi now
has 191 points and his Ganassi Racing teammate, Jimmy Vasser, is
second with 122.
	   Polesitter Dario Franchitti, Vasser and Bryan Herta _ the first
three on the starting grid _ all exited the race on the second turn
of the first lap. Herta and Franchitti bumped after squeezing
together on a narrow part of the course and Vasser ricocheted off
Franchitti, who didn't mince words in expressing his displeasure
with Vasser.
	   ``I can't believe Bryan pulled such a stupid move,'' he said.
``He squeezed me out and kept squeezing till I was on the grass and
we touched.''
	   As Herta saw things: ``I got on the inside of Dario and went
into the corner and I thought I had him cleared. We touched and I
spun. It's really unfortunate because the car was really good.''
	   The first-lap crash, which also eliminated Michel Jourdain Jr.,
put Mauricio Gugelmin, who started fourth, into the lead for the
first 29 laps.
	   Greg Moore moved into the lead on lap 30 after the first round
of pit stops and remained in front through the 52nd lap. He then
pitted and as he was getting under way, his car bumped a right rear
tire being held by a crew member for Andre Ribeiro, parked in the
pit next to Moore's.
	   That caused Moore's car to go over Ribeiro's, damaging the
suspension, ending his day and giving de Ferran the lead for five
laps before Fernandez took it for good.
	   Moore remains in third place in the driver standings with 118
points.
	   Zanardi had a wild day. He was involved in bumping with Lehto
and with Helio Castro-Neves, then in 12th, late in the race and
took a wild, bouncing ride through the grass on the 24th lap after
an unsuccessful attempt to get around Andretti.
	   The first three cars all are Ford Cosworths. Rahal finished a
little more than two seconds behind Fernandez as he moved from 16th
on the starting grid to third and delighted fans who came to cheer
him in his final race on the track most identified with him.
	   Rahal is retiring as a driver at the end of the season after 17
years. His team is based in the Columbus suburb of Hilliard, about
60 miles (96 kilometers) from Mid-Ohio.
	   ``I wasn't sorry to see the checkered flag,'' Rahal said. ``I
wanted to make my last 20 laps at Mid-Ohio the best 20 laps I've
ever driven here. You could get close to them (Fernandez and
Pruett) but you couldn't get by them.''
	   Gugelmin was fourth and Paul Tracy, who started 21st, finished
fifth for the biggest improvement from qualifying.
	   In sixth through 11th respectively were Al Unser Jr., Patrick
Carpentier, Tony Kanaan, de Ferran, Ribeiro and Robby Gordon.
	   Rookie Alex Barron finished 16th in the debut of Dan Gurney's
Eagle chassis, improving his qualifying position by 10 spots.

Indians in southern Mexico demand release of Chiapas prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Indian women built a
pile of wooden machetes, symbolizing the unused tools of their
jailed relatives, in a protest Sunday to demand the release of
Indian prisoners.
	   Each of the 87 machetes piled in the state capital of Tuxtla
Gutierrez beneath an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's
patron saint, bore the name of a prisoner.
	   Some of the are accused common crime, while others were jailed
after police raids earlier this year against maverick township
councils that supported the leftist Zapatista rebels.
	   The women, many wearing traditional embroidered blouses and
accompanied by their children, said there was no-one left to
provide for the families since their menfolk were arrested.
	   ``The `machete strike' is so that authorities can see that since
they jailed our husbands, there is no-one to work the land and
nothing to eat,'' said protester Julia Hernandez.
	   The men jailed in raids on the pro-rebel townships began what
they said would be a month-long hunger strike in two state prisons
on August 2, demanding that charges against them of trespassing and
usurpation of authority be dropped.
	   A governmental human rights commission recently said the arrests
of some of the rebel supporters had been illegal, and recommended
they be freed. The Chiapas state government has yet to comply with
that recommendation.
	   State officials have defended the raids and arrests, arguing
that the township councils are illegal.
	   Leftist Zapatista rebels staged a brief armed uprising in
January 1994, demanding greater democracy and Indian rights.

St. Louis Cardinals defeat Chicago Cubs 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were both kept in
the ballpark Sunday, and John Mabry's pinch-hit homer was the
difference as the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Chicago Cubs
2-1.
	   Neither McGwire nor Sosa, who each homered on Saturday in St.
Louis' wild 9-8 win in 13 innings, got many pitches to hit. Sosa
singled, walked three times and struck out to end the game with a
runner at first. Sosa tied Saturday's game with a two-run homer in
the ninth.
	   McGwire struck out twice and was walked twice, giving him 121
this season. He has 46 homers and Sosa 44 as they chase Roger
Maris' single-season record of 61.
	   The Cardinals swept the three-game series and handed a fourth
straight loss to the Cubs, who entered the day leading the NL
wild-card race by a half-game.
	   Mabry pinch-hit for starter Darren Oliver (1-1) in the sixth and
blasted his eighth homer off Cubs starter Don Wengert (1-1).
	   Jeff Brantley pitched the ninth for his 14th save.
	   In Houston, Shane Reynolds got his 14th win and Billy Wagner
pitched for the first time since being struck in the head by a line
drive as Houston completed a three-game sweep.
	   Moises Alou drove in four runs for the Astros with a two-run
homer and a two-run double. Houston, which has won 10 of 13, hadn't
swept Philadelphia since doing it twice in 1966.
	   Wagner hadn't pitched for the Astros since he suffered a
concussion and cut left ear when he was hit in the left side of the
head by a vicious line drive on July 15 in Arizona.
	   Derek Bell had a two-run triple in a five-run fourth off Matt
Beech (3-9). Beech, who has lost six straight decisions.
	   Reynolds (14-7) improved to 5-1 lifetime against the Phillies
and won for the seventh time in his last nine decisions.
	   In San Diego, Ken Caminiti hit a two-run homer in the fourth
inning to put the Padres ahead and let Sterling Hitchcock off the
hook.
	   San Diego has won four of five and is 35 games over .500 for the
first time.
	   With Steve Finley on with a one-out walk in the fourth, Caminiti
drove an 0-2 pitch from Andy Larkin (3-7) into the right-field
seats for his 21st homer.
	   The shot helped bail out Hitchcock (6-4), who allowed five runs
on three homers in the first three innings. Trevor Hoffman pitched
a perfect ninth for his major league-leading 38th save.
	   Edgar Renteria, Luis Castillo and Mark Kotsay homered off
Hitchcock for the Marlins, who came in ranked next-to-last in the
majors with 76 homers.
	   In Denver, Dante Bichette went 4-for-5 with five RBIs and Darryl
Kile won at home for just the third time this season.
	   Bichette hit his 18th homer and reached 100 RBIs for the fourth
straight year. Colorado trailed 4-1 in the third before scoring
seven runs in the fourth.
	   Kile (8-14) allowed 10 hits and improved to 9-2 in his career
against the Mets, including a no-hitter in 1993.
	   Kile was coming off the shortest outing of his career, 1 2-3
innings at Pittsburgh. The right-hander allowed four runs, walked
three and struck out six in his third complete game this season.
	   Colorado's Larry Walker robbed Mike Piazza of a homer in the
seventh inning with a leaping catch at the right-field wall.
	   Hideo Nomo (5-9) lasted just 3 2-3 innings, giving up seven runs
and eight hits.
	   John Olerud went 4-for-5 and extended his hitting streak to 23
games for New York.
	   In Montreal, Bob Henley's two-run double keyed a five-run,
two-out rally in the seventh as Montreal won for the sixth time in
seven games.
	   Arizona starter Bob Wolcott (1-2) held Montreal to one hit and
faced the minimum 18 batters through six innings, before Terry
Jones singled with one out. One out later, Vladimir Guerrero hit an
RBI double to make it 2-1. After Wolcott intentionally walked Brad
Fullmer, Henley doubled in the go-ahead runs.
	   The Expos added three runs in the eighth on a two-run double by
Fullmer and an RBI single by Henley.
	   Shayne Bennett (5-4) gave up one hit in the seventh for the win
and Steve Kline pitched two perfect innings for his first career
save.
	   In Cincinnati, Leadoff hitter Fernando Vina revived Milwaukee's
offense with a pair of hits and steals as the Brewers rebounded
from consecutive shutouts.
	   Scott Karl (9-6), pitching on his 27th birthday, held the Reds
to five hits in seven-plus innings, steadying a pitching staff that
had allowed 21 runs in the previous two days.
	   Vina singled twice, was hit by a pitch, stole two bases and
scored in the first inning, ending the Brewers' streak of 25
innings without a run. The Brewers lost the first two games of the
series 17-0 and 4-0 and fired hitting coach Lamar Johnson.
	   Steve Parris (1-3) remained winless since June 28.

Gomez captures senior tennis tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLESLEY, Massachusetts (AP) _ Andres Gomez won his first
senior tennis tournament of the season Sunday by defeating Henri
Leconte 7-5, 4-6, 10-3 in the final of the Sprint PCS Champions.
	   The win moved Gomez, the 1990 French Open champion, past Bjorn
Borg and John McEnroe into second place in the Nuveen Masters Point
Standings. He trails top-ranked Jimmy Connors by 275 points going
into this week's Citibank Champions in Purchase, New York.
	   Connors was forced out of the Boston event with a foot injury.
	   Gomez and Leconte battled virtually even through the first two
sets as both stood on the baseline and crushed their groundstrokes
with only a few forays to the net.
	   After they split the first two sets with single service breaks,
Leconte's serve let him down in the Champions Tiebreaker, where the
first player to reach 10 points wins the match. Leconte
double-faulted three times and fell behind 4-0, a deficit from
which he was unable to come back.
	   The win was Gomez's first over Leconte on the senior circuit and
his second in six tries overall.
	   The Sprint PCS Champions is the eighth event on the 1998-99
worldwide senior tennis circuit, which has grown from three events
to 21 since its inception in 1993.

category codes:
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ An Israeli team searching floor to floor
with rescue dogs found a woman and her son Sunday in a building
damaged in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, a ray of hope
as 20 bodies were pulled from the rubble. Using a huge crane,
drills and blowtorches, another Israeli team was trying to free a
woman named Rose in a collapsed building by the embassy. The death
toll from Friday's two bombings at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania has risen to 210, all but 10 in the Nairobi. A total of
4,877 people were injured, but only about 560 remain hospitalized,
the majority in Kenya. (EMBASSY-BOMBINGS)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Levees were dynamited along a stretch of the
swollen Yangtze River on Sunday in an effort to divert floodwaters
menacing cities and farmland in central China's Hubei province.
Secondary dikes were blown in Jianli County, about 150 kilometers
(93 miles) upriver from the industrial center of Wuhan, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported. More solid primary dikes
farther back from the river remain intact. Police forced 50,000
residents _ many of them ``reluctant to move'' _ out of their homes
ahead of the flooding, Xinhua said. Engineers hope the diversion of
up to 800 million cubic meters (28 billion cubic feet) of water
into farmland behind the dike will lower the raging Yangtze's water
level by 10-25 centimeters (4-10 inches), Xinhua reported.
(CHINA-FLOODS)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo is plunging into war, Laurent
Kabila's embattled government said Sunday, charging that Ugandan
troops and tanks had invaded while Rwandan fighters were executing
captured Congolese officers. The latest charges against Congo's
neighbors to the east could not be independently confirmed, but
would represent a sharp escalation in hostilities with Rwanda and
now also Uganda. Kabila accuses the Tutsi-led Rwandan government of
trying to establish a ``Tutsi empire'' in his territory. His
government now says Uganda is also fighting on behalf of the
Rwandan and Tutsi rebels. (CONGO)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Moving to crush the last remaining
rebel strongholds, Serb forces reportedly clashed Sunday with
ethnic Albanian fighters at several locations in western Kosovo. A
day after one rebel faction signaled its readiness for talks, other
fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army kept up resistance and the
prospects for peace talks remained uncertain. The Serbs have
overrun one KLA stronghold after the other and sent tens of
thousands of civilians fleeing in the past two weeks in a major
offensive in the secessionist province of Serbia, where ethnic
Albanians comprise a vast majority of the population.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's northern alliance
claimed to have pushed its Islamic opponents out of Mazar-e-Sharif
on Sunday, a day after the Taliban religious militia claimed to
have captured the north's biggest city. The Taliban had said
Mazar-e-Sharif was calm Sunday. Reports on the situation in the
city 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of the Afghan capital could
not immediately be independently confirmed. Indian-based Afghan
Ambassador Masood Khalili, who has remained loyal to the president
the Taliban ousted from the capital two years ago, claimed
Mazar-e-Sharif residents ``rose and took up arms and fought along
with government soldiers'' to push the Taliban out. Khalili said
Taliban casualties were heavy, but had no details or information on
alliance casualties. (AFGHANISTAN)

Gingrich says U.S. transcends Lewinsky troubles in face of Kenya
</HEADLINE>
bombings

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich says the
United States has transcended its internal turmoil over President
Clinton's alleged affair with Monica Lewinsky, in the face of the
attacks on American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Speaking to reporters Sunday at the start of a weeklong survey
of the Northern Ireland peace process, Irish economic success, and
his own Irish roots, Gingrich, a longtime political opponent of
Clinton, would not comment in detail on the difficulties
confronting the president over the Lewinsky affair.
	   He stressed that the terrorist bombings of American embassies in
Nairobi and Tanzania on Friday were regarded as more important
issues than any of Clinton's personal problems.
	   ``We stand united as one country when faced with dangers, and we
come to Ireland as one country. And our common commitment to
freedom and security and prosperity of democracy transcends any
problems we have back home,'' he said.
	   ``Anyone in the world should recognize that America has a
remarkable ability to rise beyond internal fighting to become one
team and one family when it comes to the world at large.''
	   Gingrich arrived Saturday and is accompanied on his trip to
Ireland by four Democrat and two Republican lawmakers. He will meet
with key players in the new power-sharing Assembly that is the
cornerstone of April's peace agreement.
	   He expects to meet David Trimble, the Protestant first minister
of the new Assembly, and Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn
Fein party.
	   Potentially most controversially, he's scheduled a visit with
the Rev. Ian Paisley, the hard-line Protestant politician who has
refused to meet other visiting Americans and condemns most foreign
visitors as Sinn Fein sympathizers.
	   ``We wanted to make sure that those who are wavering or were
doubting understood that there was only one future that made any
sense _ and that is a future in which the peace process
continues,'' he said.

Forecaster: Australia faces worst economic environment in decades
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia faces its worst international
economic environment in decades as the recovery of its major Asian
trading partners lags behind forecasts, an Access Economics report
said Monday.
	   The respected independent economics forecaster said that while
strong domestic demand in early 1998 had buffered Australia against
external weakness, domestic demand had weakened.
	   ``Asia may cut Australian activity to a crawl by the first half
of 1999,'' said its June quarter five-year business outlook report.
	   The momentum in the economy was ``sufficient for job growth'' to
continue in 1998 and for output growth to exceed budget forecasts
for 1997-98 and 1998-99, the report said.
	   Access Economics said that the budget had assumed 1.75 percent
economic growth among Australia's major trading partners, but it
had cut its projection to 0.40 percent.
	   ``Worry about Japan,'' the report said. ``Moreover, the rest of
Asia is mired in stagflation, with recessions amid currency-induced
inflation.
	   ``With Japan sagging and China not far behind, our major trading
partners are going from bad to worse,'' it said.
	   The report warned of a possible second wave of financial and
economic turmoil engulfing the region and to keep a close watch on
South Korea, which was being pressured by Japanese currency
weakness, rising corporate failures and labor unrest.
	   ``On balance, Australia faces its worst international
environment in decades,'' the report said.
	   Downward pressure on the Australian dollar, domestic demand and
rising labor costs would add to higher prices next year with
underlying inflation expected to pass 3 percent, the report said.

Family, friends mourn father and son killed in embassy bombing
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The father and son were working at the American
Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya _ one a top administrator, the other a
part-time employee _ when a bomb exploded, killing at least 200
people.
	   Jay Bartley, 20, was among the first to be identified. Sunday,
the embassy's consul general, 55-year-old Julian Bartley, was the
latest. At least 12 Americans were killed in the blast.
	   Now, friends and family in New York City are trying to come to
terms with the Bartleys' deaths.
	   ``This is a very difficult time,'' the elder Bartley's daughter,
Edith, said in a statement. The family has asked to be left alone
to grieve.
	   ``On behalf of my family, I would like to extend my deepest and
heartfelt condolences to all family members worldwide who lost a
loved one,'' she said.
	   Julian Bartley grew up in a two-story, red, brick house in the
Queens section of New York, where his mother still resides. He was
born in Jacksonville, Florida.
	   ``They are really upset. His mother was so proud of him. He and
his son used to come together to visit,'' said neighbor Tania
Chapman.
	   Many in the neighborhood remembered Bartley as a soft-spoken man
with an affinity for languages.
	   ``He joined the Peace Corps because he thought it would be a
good way to help people and improve his languages,'' said Peter
Saltz, a former president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, a leading civil rights group, in
Jamaica, Queens.
	   Bartley served in the Peace Corps in American Samoa in 1970
before becoming a foreign service officer. Bartley and Saltz met in
1971 on a five-country tour of Africa's west coast.
	   ``He was getting ready to take the (foreign service exam). He
talked about it constantly on the trip. That's what he really
wanted to do,'' Saltz said.
	   Bartley was stationed in the Dominican Republic, Colombia,
Spain, Israel and Korea before his assignment in Kenya as the
second in command.
	   ``He said he wanted to be an ambassador. He was out for the
betterment of his country,'' Saltz said.
	   In between his many assignments, Bartley also worked as an
adviser on international affairs for Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a
Mississippi Democrat. Telephone calls to Thompson were not
immediately returned.
	   Jay Bartley was following his father's footsteps in the foreign
service, taking a temporary job at the embassy during his summer
vacation.
	   He was a student at the United States International University
in Kenya and had graduated from an international high school in
Kenya in 1997.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Freedom was fleeting in Laurent Kabila's
Congo.
	   His first few weeks in power last year were marked by an
apparent tolerance of criticism from opposition politicians and in
the press. Quickly, that mood shifted and Kabila cracked down.
	   Government purges and random imprisonments, rumors of massacres
and heated ethnic tensions have fed a disaffection that last week
erupted into open revolt against the former rebel leader's
14-month-old regime.
	   Today's rebels pledge to see to Kabila's ouster; short of that,
his leadership has set the stage for a civil war that could spill
over into neighboring Rwanda. The outcome may be catastrophic in
this vast and troubled swath of Central Africa.
	   On Sunday, Kabila accused Uganda of sending soldiers and tanks
into Congo in support of the uprising. The government also accused
neighboring Rwanda, which it alleges instigated the week-old
rebellion, of executing Congolese army officers and rounding up
civilians in the region. The charges could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Rwanda repeatedly has denied it is behind Congo's uprising and
says Kabila is trying to divert attention from disenchantment with
his government.
	   Congolese Tutsis, including the ethnic Banyamulenge, and their
Rwandan allies are on the march in eastern Congo and in the far
west along the Atlantic coastline. They vow to push their way to
Kinshasa, a drive that would mirror Kabila's own rebel advance last
year.
	   Kabila marched into Kinshasa in May 1997 triumphant.
	   ``Today, the applause of those first few weeks has ceased,''
local pollster Olivier Kamitatu said.
	   A bulky, jovial man quick with a smile and an addictive chuckle,
Kabila had conquered the former Zaire's villain dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko. Kabila was the stuff of local folklore: a rebel hero, a
liberator.
	   What went so dramatically wrong in so little time?
	   Since taking power, Kabila's regime has been built on paranoia
that his supporters will turn against him. In recent months, five
Cabinet ministers have been jailed and others sacked.
	   His top military commander James Kabari, a Rwandan known also as
Kabarere, was fired.
	   Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha last week fled Kinshasa to join
the rebel uprising in the eastern city of Goma.
	   Kabila's leadership also has been marred by policies that have
showed little sign of helping the people. Amid myriad promises of
change, few concrete moves have been taken to create jobs,
regenerate a virtually nonexistent economy and rebuild a crumbling
infrastructure.
	   If Mobutu raped and robbed this country of its wealth for 32
years, Kabila, many people in Kinshasa say, has done little to
redress those crimes.
	   Although official statistics are not available, international
organizations and private polling agencies in Congo estimate
unemployment in Kinshasa is 75 percent. Angry young men mill around
street corners.
	   ``You don't need to ask what went wrong,'' says Pierre Eluki, an
unemployed university graduate in Kinshasa. ``What did he do
right?''
	   A poll earlier this year by the private Congolese Office of
Studies, Research and Consulting said only 34 percent of 1,005
people surveyed supported Kabila. A margin of error for the poll
was not provided.
	   Economic progress denied, the Democratic Republic of Congo also
has become a country of ethnic animosities, fueled by the
government's suspicions and propaganda against Tutsis.
	   The very Rwandan and Banyamulenge Tutsi allies that helped bring
Kabila to power are the ones leading the rebellion in the east.
	   In return, Tutsis in Kinshasa are being rounded up by police
while army troops loot their shops and homes in some parts of the
city.
	   Anti-Tutsi sentiments fueled by a new propaganda campaign on
state-controlled radio is just the latest in a string of repressive
moves.
	   In the face of ostentatious wealth for the few and numbing
poverty for the many, Kabila's politics have been a catalyst for
rage.
	   In Kabila's Congo, journalists have been jailed and newspapers
shut. Opposition politics have been banned and defiance is answered
with imprisonment or internal exile.
	   The international community has grown frustrated with Kabila for
his less than diplomatic demeanor. From detaining U.N. officials
and deporting Belgian Embassy staff to snubbing Jesse Jackson,
Washington's special envoy to Africa, Kabila has run roughshod over
his fragile foreign relations.
	   As the United States and several European countries pull their
nonessential diplomatic staff out of Kinshasa, friends for Kabila
are increasingly hard to come by.

Congo says Uganda invades, accuses Rwanda of war crimes

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With his rule in peril, President Laurent
Kabila has accused Uganda of sending soldiers and tanks into Congo
in support of a rebel Tutsi uprising in the eastern Kivu region.
	   The government also accused neighboring Rwanda, which it alleges
instigated the week-old rebellion, of executing Congolese army
officers and rounding up civilians in the region.
	   The charges made Sunday could not be independently confirmed,
but if true, they represent a sharp escalation in hostilities that
threaten to spawn a broader regional conflict.
	   Tutsi gunmen with close ties to Rwanda launched an offensive a
week ago in Kivu, vowing to topple Kabila's 14-month-old regime.
Within the first few days of their uprising, the rebels captured
several key cities near the Rwandan border, including Goma and
Bukavu.
	   They also control several small towns in Congo's far west near
the Atlantic coastline, about 150 miles (240 kms) southwest of
Kinshasa.
	   ``Following a counterattack by Congolese forces at the town of
Bukavu, two columns of Ugandan forces violated the integrity of
Congolese territory,'' Information Minister Didier Mumengi told
reporters in Congo's capital, Kinshasa, on Sunday.
	   Mumengi said Congolese forces reported at least 10 Ugandan tanks
and seven trucks filled with soldiers heading toward the Bunia, a
Congolese town just inside the Ugandan border.
	   The information minister also accused Rwandan troops in the Kivu
region of executing captured Congolese officers and rounding up
civilians, but did not elaborate on the claims.
	   Kabila has recently accused Rwanda of trying to establish a
``Tutsi empire'' in his territory, charges that Rwanda has
repeatedly denied. An edgy Rwanda has vowed to fire back at Congo
if attacked, and more recently has warned of a possible preemptive
strike.
	   In another sign of the growing instability in eastern Congo,
more than 60 foreign aid workers in Bukavu have fled across the
border into Rwanda, state-controlled radio in Rwanda reported
Sunday. They included Americans, Canadians and Belgians.
	   Meanwhile, Congo's government appeared to be gearing up for a
protracted fight: It increased security around Kinshasa, closing
all river ports and halting traffic across its river border with
the Republic of Congo.
	   On Saturday, Kabila met in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, with his
Rwandan adversary, President Pasteur Bizimungu, to forge a peaceful
end to growing hostilities. They were joined by five other regional
leaders but made little progress.
	   In the Rwandan capital, Kigali, Bizimungu accused Kabila of
seeking a pretext to attack Rwanda to distract attention from
domestic threats to his rule. He said Rwanda had credible evidence
of Kabila's training of at least 10,000 former Hutu soldiers and
militiamen in the southern city of Kamina, and his plans to use
them against Rwanda.
	   The Hutu rebels were responsible for the 1994 genocide of more
than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus in
Rwanda. The killing ended when Tutsi-led forces won power in July
1994, sending the former Hutu government across the border into
Congo.
	   The rebellious Rwandan soldiers and Congolese Tutsi fighters _
called Banyamulenge _ backed Kabila last year in his ouster of
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, but they have since grown disaffected.
The Banyamulenge have close ethnic ties with the Rwandan Tutsis.

Dollar rises in Tokyo, Japanese stocks drop sharply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar surged against the yen in early trading
Monday amid pessimism over the recovery prospects for the Japanese
economy and worry about the possibility of Asian currency
devaluations. Tokyo stocks fell sharply.
	   The dollar bought 146.39 yen early Monday, up 0.85 yen from late
trading Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York rate of 146.13
yen late last week.
	   The Japanese yen continued to slump on disappointment with the
first major speech Friday by Japan's new prime minister, Keizo
Obuchi, which contained few fresh policy initiatives to buoy the
anemic economy, traders said.
	   The dollar also rallied against the yen on mounting speculation
among dealers that China will be forced to devalue its yuan, and
Hong Kong will de-link its currency's long-standing peg to the U.S.
dollar.
	   Still, the dollar's gains against the yen may be limited by
speculation the Bank of Japan could intervene to prop up the
sagging Japanese currency, traders said.
	   Those worries were underscored by comments early Monday by
Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the International Bureau at Japan's
Ministry of Finance, who said he was concerned about the weak yen.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, the benchmark 225-issue
Nikkei Stock Average fell 186.56 points, or 1.18 percent, to
15,642.61 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Friday, the Nikkei
index closed down 47.05 points, or 0.30 percent _ the fifth
straight day of losses.
	   ``The market is likely to continue to trend lower this week'' in
the wake of Prime Minister Obuchi's failure to instill confidence
in his administration's economic policies, said Masaru Arai,
general manager at Ryoko Securities Co.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section declined 14.80 points, or 1.20 percent, to 1,210.50. The
TOPIX closed down 1.79 points, or 0.15 percent, on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.170 percent from Friday's close of 1.195 percent,
driving its price up to 112.00 yen from 111.82 yen last week.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ As hope of finding any more survivors of
the embassy bombing in Nairobi dimmed, the focus turned to finding
the architects of the terror.
	   Nearly simultaneous blasts at the American embassies in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, were sophisticated
attacks and suspicion instantly turned to the usual suspects:
Islamic terrorists.
	   The explosions took a terrible toll: At least 200 dead in
Nairobi and nearly 5,000 injured; at least 10 dead in Dar es Salaam
and 74 injured.
	   The powerful blast in downtown Nairobi destroyed a building next
door to the embassy and damaged others blocks away. The damage in
Tanzania was far less because the embassy is in a residential area.
	   On Sunday, Israeli rescuers found a mother and son in a building
near the Nairobi embassy. They were alive and well. But the
rescuers also brought out a dead woman.
	   And at the pile of concrete, steel and glass next door that once
housed a secretarial school, hopes of finding anyone alive were
slim. As night fell, only bodies were brought out.
	   ``Every day that passes, the chances are becoming slimmer and
slimmer,'' said Farid Abdul Kadir, a relief coordinator for the
Kenyan Red Cross.
	   The mother and son in the bank building were lucky. They weren't
hurt, just terrified to come out until rescuers arrived to help
them down the rubble-strewn staircase from the 20th floor.
	   Rescue teams labored into the night with everything from
bulldozers to fiber optics in their quest for life inside the
ruins.
	   Sniffer dogs from the United States, France and Israel padded
over rubble, one with a cut nose from the sea of broken glass.
	   Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi visited the embassy site Sunday
morning and said there were some leads. He did not elaborate.
	   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned
Sunday that it could take a long time to find out who was behind
the attacks. She promised ``appropriate action'' against any
country or person found responsible.
	   The FBI and other U.S. agencies have sent teams to both Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam. If they can figure out what kind of explosives
were used and how, the FBI says it would be like finding the
bombers' ``fingerprints.''
	   The United States is a favorite target of militant Islamic
fundamentalists, such as the exiled Saudi financier Osama bin
Laden, one potential suspect.
	   Another favorite target _ Israel _ on Sunday offered the help of
Mossad and other intelligence agencies.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early signs were that the
attacks were the work of ``international terrorism centered on
Islamic fundamentalism.''
	   The Sunday Nation quoted a man who works for the environment
ministry, Ocheng Okwach, as saying he saw two men drive a yellow
pickup truck to the back of the embassy and jump out brandishing
machine-guns.
	   ``One man ran back into the vehicle as the other sprayed bullets
into the American Embassy,'' Okwach was quoted as saying.
	   It also quoted an unnamed security man as saying he'd seen three
people filming the embassy four days before the attack.
	   The Sunday Times of London, meanwhile, quoted Kenyan police
superintendent Mike Harries as saying witnesses saw a suicide
bomber drive a pickup truck into the car park behind the embassy
and sit there quietly until the blast.
	   Security at the damaged embassy _ now a crime scene that might
yield clues _ was extremely tight. Marines in battle gear stood
guard and black fabric draped the perimeter to obstruct the view
from outside.
	   Survivors of the bombing honored their dead at a private
memorial service Sunday at Ambassador Patricia Bushnell's
residence.
	   A dozen Americans and 24 Kenyans inside the embassy died and
scores were missing.
	   Among the dead were Consul General Julian Bartley and his son,
Jay, a university student at the United States International
University in Nairobi.
	   Ten people died in the Tanzanian bombing, none of them
Americans, hospital officials said.
	   If Sunday was a day for mourning, Monday was for picking up the
pieces.
	   The bombing not only killed, maimed and bereaved. It also
displaced thousands of people from their workplaces.
	   The embassy was moving its operations into the U.S. Agency for
International Development building in a residential area. Hundreds
of people flown in to handle the investigation were setting up
shop.
	   The Kenyan government, meanwhile, had cordoned off four badly
damaged buildings near the embassy, including the 22-story bank
building.
	   Access to six more damaged buildings, including the headquarters
of the national railway, was being restricted, it said.
	   The Kenyan president's office said 4,877 people were injured in
Friday's blast; 560 were still hospitalized Sunday.
	   A U.S. C-141 cargo plane flew 15 badly injured people to
Ramstein Air Base in Germany Sunday and another evacuation flight
was planned for Monday.

Yugoslavia win worlds over Russia; no-name Americans get bronze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece _ Who was prouder?
	   Was it Yugoslavian coach Zeljko Obradovic? His team beat Russia
64-62 for the gold medal Sunday in the World Basketball
Championship and did it _ representing a country still crippled by
war _ without missing stars including the NBA's Vlade Divac.
	   Or was it American coach Rudy Tomjanovich? The much-criticized
Americans _ a composite of minor-league talent assembled in the
last month when the NBA stars were locked out _ won bronze
thrashing Greece 84-61.
	   The gold was a record fourth at the worlds for Yugoslavia. They
might not have beaten an American Dream Team. However, a
full-strength Yugoslavia just might have.
	   ``After the embargo we played in four straight finals and won
three times. It's incredible. We have a lot of reason to be very
proud,'' Obradovic said.
	   ``We had many problems, and players who weren't here. But we got
this again,'' he added, cradling the gold medal hanging around his
neck.
	   Center Zeljko Rebraca, playing where Divac would have, led with
16 points and 11 rebounds. Dejan Bodiroga, the (2.06-meter) 6-9
guard/forward, chipped in with 11 points and 5 rebounds and was
named tournament MVP. Aleksandar Djordjevic, playing with a leg
injury, added seven and took over at the end with Rebraca.
	   Yugoslavia showed again it plays the best basketball outside of
the United States. Following the lifting of war sanctions,
Yugoslavia has won the '95 and '97 European titles, and was second
in the '96 Olympics to Dream Team III.
	   Not only was Divac missing, so was injured former NBA star
Predrag Danilovic and retired center Zoran Savic. Also absent were
two Yugoslavs with Greek passports who weren't allowed to play:
forward Predrag Stojakovic, who will play next season with the
Sacramento Kings, and (2.12-meter) 6-11 center Dragan Tarlac, who's
one of the highest paid players in Europe with Greek club
Olympiakos.
	   Russia, playing with the same core that lost to the United
States in the finals in '94 _ by 46 points _ was led by Sergey
Panov and Igor Koudellin with 14 points each.
	   ``At the end, there were two great players, Djordjevic and
Rebraca, who determined who would win,'' Russian coach Sergey Belov
said.
	   For the Americans, guard Jimmy Oliver jokingly suggested he
would gold plate his bronze medal.
	   ``I'll have my bronze dipped in gold and you guys do the same,''
he told his teammates.
	   The Dream Team might have won gold, but this bronze was
cherished by a cast of hard-working journeymen who have bounced
around the NBA, CBA and European leagues.
	   They dropped the semifinal Saturday to Russia 66-64, blowing a
10-point lead in the final three minutes, but rebounded better than
Greece, which lost to Yugoslavia in overtime 78-73.
	   ``These guys got as much out of what they have as any team I've
been around,'' said Tomjanovich, who has won two NBA titles with
the Houston Rockets. ``They had to do it in a vacuum with very
little media coverage.
	   ``We were the team with the fewest fans here and always in a
hostile situation,'' he added. ``We were always hearing in the
background, `These guys are rejects, those are guys that can't make
it.' And they hung in there.''
	   Largely ignored at home, one Greek paper termed them the ``lint
after the wash.''
	   All 12 scored led by Jason Sasser's 23, 14 from Jimmy King and
12 by Wendell Alexis. Greece, which shot an abysmal 35 percent
overall, was led Dimitri Papanikolaou with 18.
	   ``We're stong individuals,'' said forward Gerard King, who
played in Italy last season. ``Everybody on our team has been
through the rough times. We know what it takes to bounce back and
come out swinging.''
	   David Wood, a veteran 33-year-old veteran of 412 NBA games with
eight different teams, exemplified the character.
	   ``You always want to set your goals for the gold,'' he said.
``But I can't think of anythimg I'm more proud of than this medal.
It is probably the greatest accomplishment of my basketball
career.''
	   U.S. Ambassador to Greece Nicholas Burns, a fervent basketball
fan, even got into the act as he met with U.S. players afterwards.
	   ``They really weren't a team when they got here,'' he said.
``They came together so much. We should really be proud of them.''
	   It was a bitter day for an 18,000 home sellout at Olympic arena
as Greece lost its fifth bronze-medal game in five years _ all on
Sundays _ prompting early editions or Greek newspapers to read
``Pote Tin Kiriaki'' (Never on Sunday), playing off the famous film
starring Greek actress Melina Mercouri.
	   Despite the bronze, the U.S. misses out on an automatic berth in
the 2000 Olympics, which will go to Yugoslavia and host Australia.
The Americans will have to play next spring and summer in
qualifying tournaments, probably using CBA and college talent.
	   In consolation play, Spain beat Italy 64-61 for fifth place,
while Lithuania edged Argentina 77-76 for seventh.

	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Kurdistan exists only as an aspiration. The
Kurds, a resilient mountain people of the Middle East, are divided
by five national borders and even more political factions. Even
outside their stormy corner of the world, unity is elusive. In
Greece, the European beachhead for waves of Iraqi Kurdish refugees
and others, Kurds are fighting Kurds. Some claim it's about
politics. Others insist it's over money. All agree it's violent and
could send ripples through Kurdish communities around Europe.

	   PATRAS, Greece (AP) _ Hamad figures his days are numbered.
	   Maybe he'll dissolve his immigrant smuggling network and join
the other stowaways on ferries bound for Italy. Or perhaps, he
worries, he'll wind up dead.
	   ``It's getting too dangerous. You can fight or flee. I'm getting
tired of fighting,'' said Hamad, one of an estimated 10 Iraqi Kurd
bosses directing the lucrative traffic of illegal immigrants
through the port of Patras _ a hub of a blood-stained turf battle
in Greece pitting Kurds against Kurds.
	   At least one death has been blamed on the clashes and several
refugees have disappeared. They are presumed dead by aid workers,
but no evidence of foul play has been produced.
	   The question puzzling authorities is: Who is provoking the
violence and fear-mongering?
	   Hamad and a broad range of others claim Iraqi Kurds are being
muscled by the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been
fighting since 1984 for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
They believe the PKK is aggressively trying to cash in on the vast
underground economy from immigrant smuggling, where a voyage from
northern Iraq to Italy can cost up to dlrs 10,000 in clandestine
travel and forged papers.
	   Some Iraqi Kurds also claim they've been forced to pay ``PKK
taxes'' and protection money while they wait for political asylum
or a way to reach another EU country.
	   A group of Iraqi Kurds staged a 10-day hunger strike in Athens
in June to demand better refugee reception facilities and call
attention to their claims of mounting violence.
	   ``We try to remain united as Kurds, but here in Greece it's not
so,'' said an Iraqi Kurd leader Abu Ali. ``There are many problems
caused by the Kurds that are not from Iraq.''
	   In a dimly lit room in Patras the serves as one of Hamad's
``offices,'' the smuggler displayed a jagged scalp wound he claimed
came from a beating by PKK strongmen. Five times, the PKK asked for
half of his profits for sneaking Iraqi Kurds onto Italy-bound
vessels, he claimed. ``And five times I refused,'' he added.
	   ``Then I was beaten. I was hit in the head with a pistol
handle,'' said Hamad, who spoke on condition his full name would
not be used. ``Next time maybe they kill me.''
	   But the PKK's regional representative categorically denied any
involvement in pressuring refugees or smugglers.
	   ``The PKK doesn't need money. The PKK would never do something
like this,'' said Kiha Semsi, the PKK's Balkan representative, who
operates in Greece from the offices of the group's political wing,
known as the ERNK.
	   Greek government officials also cast strong doubts about alleged
PKK links to mounting friction among Kurds in Greece.
	   ``It's just mafia versus mafia. That's it,'' said George
Florentis, a special advisor on Kurdish issues to the Ministry of
Public Order.
	   In Greece, the PKK is a sensitive subject with profound
political ramifications. The United States _ which labels the PKK a
terrorist group _ has repeatedly demanded assurances that the PKK
is not active in Greece.
	   If the claims of PKK-sponsored thuggery are substantiated, the
government of Premier Costas Simitis could face strong fallout from
the United States and other allies.
	   Meanwhile, worries mount that Kurdish feuding could escalate in
Greece and spill over to Germany and other nations with large
Kurdish populations.
	   ``The PKK are the overseers of the Kurdish world _ the lords of
the jungle,'' said Dogu Ergil, chairman of the Political Behavior
Department at the University of Ankara. ``The PKK has always
harvested some of the profits from immigrant smuggling. Maybe they
are just trying to take a bigger cut now.''

PATRAS: cut now.''

<TEXT>
	   The Kurdish presence in Greece is a Gordian knot of regional
conflicts and suspicions.
	   The Turkish government regularly accuses Greece of lending
support to the PKK, which draws sympathy from Greeks and many other
Europeans for their struggle against the powerful Turkish military.
	   Opponents of Turkey's attempts to join the European Union have
cited Turkey's offensives against the PKK. About 37,000 people have
died in the 14-year conflict.
	   Greek officials deny all charges of aiding the PKK or tolerating
alleged illegal PKK activities. They blame the allegations on
``propaganda'' from Turkey or rival Kurdish factions.
	   The Turkish Embassy in Athens is equally firm in its denials of
orchestrating any harassment of Kurdish refugees.
	   Internal Kurdish politics also further cloud the picture.
	   The PKK has forged closer alliances with an Iraqi Kurdish group,
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. That could tip the scales against
the Patriotic Union's warring rival, the Kurdistan Democratic
Party.
	   ``We can't even get all the Kurds in Greece to sit in the same
room for a meeting,'' complained a Greek official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``Everyone is out to discredit the other.''
	   Caught in the middle are the refugees.
	   Most have no overriding political objectives. They flee poverty
and unrest in northern Iraq, a semi-autonomous region protected
from Saddam Hussein by a U.S.-led air force since 1991. More than
50,000 immigrants are smuggled into Greece each year, refugee
officials estimate.
	   They arrive, however, in a nation struggling to cope with its
role as a immigrant gateway to Europe.
	   Greek authorities have increased patrols in the Aegean Sea this
summer in an attempt to block immigrant boats before reaching Greek
territory, officials said.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and other groups have
called on Greece to halt the interceptions and deportations.
	   In Greece, only one refugee camp is under government control.
Nearly 1,000 refugees live in three other makeshift areas around
Athens with help from aid groups. The rest fend for themselves in
Athens or head for Patras, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the
west, where groups of Iraqi Kurds live in empty lots and
construction sites overlooking the busy port.
	   The unregulated conditions create a climate ripe for abuses, aid
workers claim.
	   ``These people are just open targets,'' said Tina Ligdopoulou, a
spokeswoman for Volunteer Workers, an aid group.
	    &UR; ___
	   On April 26, anger led to gunshots in Patras. According to
police and Kurdish sources, about 30 Iraqi Kurds confronted a group
of Turkish-speaking men. The Iraqi Kurds accused the men of leading
a campaign of extortion and harassment.
	   At least five shots were fired and an Iraqi Kurdish refugee
later died of leg wounds.
	   ``Just think, these people come all this way to escape violence
and end up in the middle of it,'' said Theoni Angelaris, who
assists Iraqi Kurds in Patras.
	   Dozens of Iraqi Kurds interviewed by The Associated Press
offered a litany of alleged abuses: extortion, being forced to pay
``taxes'' and protection money, beatings and kidnapping for those
who refuse. Immigrant smugglers also claim the are being forced to
pay other racketeers up to half their illegal profits, which
experts say can approach dlrs 100,000 a year for the largest gangs.
	   Most _ but not all _ blame the PKK. The others believe emerging
Kurdish underworld groups are involved. Few of the Iraqi Kurds
would give their name for publication, fearing reprisals.
	   ``They are scared,'' said 28-year-old Marwan Jabar, one of the
few Iraqi Kurds willing to speak openly about the allegations.
``They don't want to be next.''
	   Jabar claims he knows at least two Iraqi Kurds who disappeared
after feuding with the PKK. He believes they are dead, but has no
proof.
	   ``We are caught in battles over politics and money. That's a
dangerous mix,'' said Jabar.

Davenport beats injured Pierce at Toshiba
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ No. 2-ranked Lindsay Davenport
played solid tennis and took advantage of an injury to Mary Pierce
to win her second straight title with a 6-3, 6-1 victory Sunday in
the final of the dlrs 450,000 Toshiba Classic.
	   Davenport, 22, used her powerful ground strokes to control the
pace of the 52-minute match as Pierce was noticeably troubled by a
strained right quadriceps. Pierce said the injury occurred during a
Sunday morning practice session.
	   ``The first couple games I didn't think anything was wrong
because she was serving well,'' Davenport said. ``But as the match
went on you could definitely tell that ... some part of her leg was
bothering her and she wasn't running for balls. That's
unfortunate.''
	   The match was delayed for 18 minutes at 4-3 in the first set
when it rained a little. It was also then that Pierce received her
medical treatment from Corel WTA Tour trainer Sue Fleshman.
	   The unseeded Pierce, sporting a bandage high on her right thigh,
played well early on. But after the resumption of play, she was
clearly not the same player.
	   ``I knew it was going to be difficult from the beginning,''
Pierce said. ``I tried to see what I could do with it, make the
best out of it.''
	   Pierce, 25, won just one game after the rain delay as Davenport
twice broke her serve in the second set to win her third title this
season.
	   The injury affected ``everything'' in her game, Pierce said.
	   ``To play against someone like Lindsay, you need to be at the
top of your game,'' she said.
	   Davenport had all parts of her game working as she hit 28
winners and converted four of her five break points. Pierce did not
register a break chance the entire match.
	   ``As a player, it's a little bittersweet to win a title like
that,'' said Davenport, who has a 5-2 career record against Pierce.
``But there's nothing I can do about it.''
	   Davenport also won the Bank of the West Classic last week,
beating Venus Williams in the final. Ironically, Williams suffered
a leg injury in that match.

Oh, to study in Oxford's hallowed halls _ for a summer, at least
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JENNY E. HELLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OXFORD, England (AP) _ As part of the ultimate English
literature course, Jenny Hudson has talked backstage with
Shakespearean actors, studied rare manuscripts in a centuries-old
library, and visited Canterbury Cathedral, imagining herself a
character in Chaucer's famous tales.
	   For six weeks, Oxford University's Brasenose College, with its
red-tiled roof and tall, gothic windows, has been Jenny's home _ a
sharp contrast to life at the University of Texas at Austin, she
says in a drawl out of sync with the neatly clipped accents around
her.
	   A summer student at the 800-year-old university, she dines at
the heavy, oak tables in Oxford's great halls and sleeps in a bed
occupied during the regular school year by an Oxford undergraduate.
	   Each summer, thousands of students like Jenny travel from more
than 30 countries to study at a university whose list of alumni
reads like its own Who's Who volume, among them U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who studied here as a Rhodes Scholar in 1968-70.
	   The summer program enables Oxford to share its history _ and
also bring in some much-needed cash.
	   The courses are designed ``to make Oxford more accessible and
give opportunities to people who can't be regular Oxford
students,'' says Angus Hawkins, director of international programs
for the university's Department of Continuing Education.
	   Each year, the department welcomes 2,000 students from around
the world, about 1,400 of whom come from North America.
	   While the department may view the summer schools as primarily
educational, for the 36 colleges that make up Oxford University,
the warm-weather visitors often provide the means to finance
building renovations and pay the heating bills for undergraduates
during the year.
	   Oxford is subsidized by the state. But the government's payments
of dlrs 5,700- dlrs 8,400 per student keep the colleges well below
the annual tuition of dlrs 15,000- dlrs 25,000 pulled in by many
private colleges in the United States.
	   British students at Oxford pay only minimal fees for room and
board and just 1,000 pounds (dlrs 1,650) in tuition for their
education each year.
	   ``It's a constant battle. Oxford exists to provide education. It
doesn't exist to upkeep a national monument,'' says Susan Marshall,
bursar for Exeter College. ``But we have these ancient buildings,
and we've got to keep them up.''
	   Foreign undergraduates aren't subsidized and pay tuition ranging
from dlrs 10,395 to dlrs 13,860, depending on their course of
study. Tuition for summer school runs from dlrs 850 to dlrs 1,500
weekly for three- to six-week programs.
	   Assigned to one of Oxford's 36 colleges, students learn to
identify more with their particular courtyards of stone buildings
than with the university as a whole.
	   Oxford's central administrators, unlike the deans and presidents
of American-style universities, have little control over the daily
life of students or the ``tutors'' who teach classes.
	   Instead, each college within the university functions
independently, admitting and housing students, supervising their
courses and hiring teachers. Only at the end of their three years
do students take exams administered by Oxford and receive degrees
signed by the university's head.
	   Similarly for summer school, the individual colleges, not the
university, profit from their international guests and feed and
house them _ as they have since the first American men and women
spent the summer at Oxford in 1888.
	   For some summer programs, colleges such as Exeter and Christ
Church rent their buildings to the university, which administers
courses through the Department for Continuing Education and makes
use of the college's tutors.
	   Other colleges, like Brasenose, Jesus and Balliol, rent their
facilities and staff to American universities that import students
and professors from the United States.
	   Each college lures students by serving as host for a unique
blend of courses and activities. The department offers 32 courses,
some in conjunction with museums, such as the Smithsonian, or
American or Japanese universities. Subjects range from traditional
history, politics or English literature to more specialized areas
like training for diplomats in Bosnia or library studies.
	   Behind Exeter College's medieval turrets and large wooden doors,
professors from British universities around the country bring to
life the greats of English and American literature from Shakespeare
to Toni Morrison in one of the oldest and most popular programs.
	   Marshall, who coordinates housing and meals for Exeter's summer
visitors, says that while the lectures, seminars and 2,000-word
essay written at the end of the course require intensive work,
there is more to studying at Oxford.
	   Being here ``gives students the feeling of history,'' she says.
``This is a place steeped in learning. You feel driven to study.''
	   Christine Goodson, program director for the University of
Florida's summer school at Christ Church College, wants her
students to have leisure time to explore the city and enjoy the
atmosphere of a foreign country.
	   On one of their first nights in Oxford this summer, Goodson's
students followed clues from pub to pub in a scavenger hunt _
sampling the local brew along the way. They also have traveled to
Stratford-Upon-Avon and watched performances at the town theater.
	   ``Everybody wants something different. Some want to be able to
say they studied at Oxford,'' Goodson says, who recruits students
from around the United States, some of them well past college age.
``Other people like to come here to take a class and learn
something new.''
	   And some come to Oxford to escape from their daily routines.
	   Hugh Dyment, a teacher from Bethel, Alaska, who supplements his
pay by working as a fisherman, is working toward a master's degree
in English literature.
	   ``It's a joy for me to go outside,'' he says. ``One day I'm
hauling a net in the Bering Sea, and then I'm here in Oxford.''

`Zonians' lament final days of heaven in Panama
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By NIKO PRICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DIABLO, former Panama Canal Zone (AP) _ The dying days of a
society are always sad, and the Busch beer is only making Gary
Folger more bitter.
	   For two decades, Folger has watched his people hand over their
houses, schools and baseball fields, their broad avenues and
manicured lawns, and flee to the United States.
	   He has watched them dwindle away from thousands in the late
1970s to hundreds today. And he has shudders at the thought that
next year, the few remaining will surrender what is left.
	   ``This was God's country, and it has gone to the dirt,'' says
Folger, 50, a heavy equipment operator.
	   In a Friday night tradition out by his boathouse, Folger is
grilling steaks, selling beer at 50 cents a can and commiserating
with some of the last ``Zonians'' _ a society neither American nor
Panamanian that has populated a lush strip of land along the Panama
Canal since 1903.
	   On Dec. 31, 1999, the United States will turn over the canal and
the last of what once was a vibrant colony.
	   And the Zonians' extinction will be complete.
	   ``It's like your whole life just ending,'' says Lauren Othon, an
18-year-old student drinking beer and tequila shots.
	   Folger, Othon and hundreds of other Zonians young and old are
leaving.
	   They know they can stay, but it will never be the same. The Zone
is the only home they have ever known, and _ especially with many
Panamanians clamoring for the departure of what they call a coddled
gringo elite _ there's little reason to stay in Panama.
	   The Zone began at the beginning of the century, when the United
States built the Panama Canal and got permanent control of the
waterway and a 10-mile (16-kilometer) strip of land on either side,
known as the Canal Zone.
	   The area later filled with military bases, research centers and
residential areas for thousands of Americans who came to work on
the canal. Many of their children were born here, and their
children's children.
	   For them, the Zone was home _ and a good one.
	   Housing was subsidized, as were telephones, electricity and
water. Wages were decent, and jobs on the canal or in the military
were guaranteed to any Zonian who graduated from Balboa High
School. A complete system of U.S. government benefits kept
residents apart from the realities of life in Latin America.
	   ``We had our own police department, fire department,
everything,'' says Jim Fehrenbach, 50. ``When you came across the
border (of the Zone), it was like coming into a whole other
country. It was Utopia.''
	   But in 1977, after more than a decade of violent anti-American
protests in Panama, U.S. President Jimmy Carter signed treaties
committing to a gradual pullout, turning over pieces of the Zone,
and finally the canal, by the end of 1999.
	   Along with the canal and the bases, what he gave away was a
singular society _ a group of people who thought of one another as
family, and interacted little with the Panamanians around them.
	   ``At school there were Panamanians _ they were tuition students
_ but we didn't associate with them too much,'' says Jason
Gomeneck, 21. ``It was mainly the Zonians who hung out together.''
	   And while many Zonians look down at the Panamanians they grew up
next to, there is little love lost among Panamanians either when
the subject of Zonians comes up.
	   ``Those people lived like kings in a foreign land,'' says
Jacinto Gonzalez, an activist against U.S. military bases in
Panama.
	   Carlos Brown, a 70-year-old man who has a sandwich shop near the
border of the zone, is more diplomatic: ``The Zonians live in
comfort, shielded by the military forces of their country, and they
have created a certain dislike among certain Panamanians.''
	   Of course, as in any society, there are great differences among
the Zonians. It is a class-driven society in which the families of
canal administration executives generally find more in common with
upper-class Panamanians than with the canal machinists.
	   But the bulk of the canal workers rarely travel beyond the Zone.
Many take a taxi when they do, unwilling to negotiate the foreign
streets.
	   Most of the Zone is already in Panamanian hands. Panamanian
stores now share the strip-malls with McDonald's, and the
Panamanian government is knocking down Zonian landmarks to build
hotels, highways, shopping malls.
	   ``What gets me is that they don't like to preserve the
culture,'' Fehrenbach says. ``They want to change the street names,
everything.''
	   Brown calls that silly.
	   ``Panamanians will have their own way of using the area,'' he
says. ``The important thing is that they do it in their way _ and
without the presence of the gringos.''
	   Slowly, that is happening. No one counts how many Zonians remain
in Panama, but the number of American employees of the Panama Canal
Commission _ who with their families make up much of the population
_ fell from 2,105 in 1979 to 592 last year.
	   Even so, turning from Panama City's Avenida Arnulfo Arias onto
the former Zone's Morgan Avenue remains a shock.
	   The tenements of the Chorillo neighborhood, which the United
States bombed during its 1989 invasion, are surrounded by piles of
trash, rusting cars on cinderblocks, laundry lines in the
courtyards and barefoot men selling contraband Old Milwaukee beer
from coolers.
	   A block away, the Zone's streets are lined with tidy sidewalks
and towering palms. Manicured lawns give way to handsome
wood-and-concrete duplexes, two or three cars per driveway.
	   Many Zonians are convinced their former haunts are destined to
decay when the Panamanians take over.
	   Folger says that's why he's moving back to the United States
next year for the first time since he was 4.
	   ``I can't wait to get out of here,'' he says. ``In the last five
years this place has been going downhill. These people are going
backwards, not forwards.''

Serbs try to wrap up offensive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Moving to crush the last remaining
rebel strongholds, Serb forces are intensifying their fight against
ethnic Albanian fighters at several locations in western Kosovo.
	   A day after one rebel faction signaled its readiness for talks,
other fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army kept up resistance
Sunday. Prospects for peace talks remained uncertain.
	   The Serbs have overrun one KLA stronghold after the other and
sent tens of thousands of civilians fleeing in the past two weeks
in a major offensive in the secessionist province of Serbia, where
ethnic Albanians comprise a vast majority of the population.
	   On Sunday, conflicting accounts from Albanian and Serb sources
both reported fighting focused near the town of Decane, about 90
kilometers (55 miles) west of Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   While the Serbs said about a dozen police checkpoints and units
came under attack and three policemen were wounded in the area, the
Albanians said government forces ``intensified attacks'' against
seven villages held by the KLA.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb forces
targeted civilians who tried to flee their homes and that two men
and two women died Saturday in Decane.
	   Some 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the south, near the town of
Djakovica, Serb forces attacked three KLA villages overnight, the
center said.
	   Even though the Serbs insist the offensive is in the mop-up
phase, the exodus of civilians out of Kosovo has continued.
Albanian TV reported Sunday that about 500 refugees have crossed
into that neighboring country in the past week.
	   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the Serb
offensive has displaced 167,000 people within Kosovo since the
conflict exploded in February, not counting another 64,000 people
who have fled the province. Hundreds have been killed, with
thousands of others remaining in the woods and hills, many of them
without food or water.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook assailed the Serbs on
Sunday for their latest attacks involving civilians, and warned
that preparations for possible NATO intervention are now complete.
He said he was particularly disturbed that the Serbs had set fire
to crops in Kosovo in recent days yo try to ensure that villagers
won't return.
	   A moderate KLA faction reportedly agreed in principle to enter
an alliance with ethnic Albanian politicians in Kosovo, led by
Ibrahim Rugova. Ilaz Ramajli, a politician allied with Rugova, said
Saturday in the Albanian capital, Tirana. But he acknowledged that
the KLA as a whole has not made a final decision on agreeing to
talks under Rugova's leadership.
	   Milosevic has indicated he would be willing to restore Kosovo's
autonomy, while ethnic Albanians are split on whether to push for
outright independence or hold talks about autonomy.

	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ President Ernesto Perez Balladares
pledged to seek only one extra term if Panamanian voters approve
the possibility of his re-election in an August 30 referendum,
local media reported Sunday.
	   Three weeks before the referendum, Perez Balladares offered to
sign a notarized pledge for just one more five-year term, in an
apparent bid to calm critics of a constitutional amendment that
would strike down the current ban on re-election.
	   His remarks came Saturday, amid an intense campaign by Perez
Balladares for a `yes' vote on the referendum. Polls have shown
that opposition to proposal holds a substantial lead over support
for re-election.
	   The proposal, which Balladares has said is needed to give
continuity to his economic policies, has already been approved by
Panama's congress.

Labor strengthens poll lead as left coalition emerges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The opposition Labor Party has
surged ahead in opinion polls as moves toward a coalition of the
main center-left and leftist parties emerged for the first time in
nearly a decade.
	   The latest poll published Monday puts center-left Labor at 46
percent, nearly 14 percent ahead of the governing National Party.
	   The National Party has slipped back to the 32.6 percent level of
support it enjoyed before last December, when Jenny Shipley became
the country's first woman prime minister, replacing seven-year
veteran Jim Bolger in a party room coup.
	   The surge in Labor's support was matched by a smaller lift for
the leftist Alliance Party, and would mean a clear majority for the
left in a general election.
	   The poll result came after weekend moves to reconcile Labor and
the Alliance, many of whose members split from Labor over economic
and social policy divergence in the late 1980s.
	   Labor leader Helen Clark was given a standing ovation at an
Alliance conference when she spelled out her determination to see
Labor in government with the Alliance after the next election.
	   It was time for the parties to put past differences behind them,
Clark told applauding delegates.
	   ``I believe that we owe it to the people of New Zealand to offer
the change in direction they so badly want _ and we so badly want.
	   ``If your party and mine fight each other all the way to the
next election we will deny New Zealanders the government of change
they want and we want.''
	   The Alliance, which until now has refused to align itself with
Labor, voted unanimously to launch formal coalition talks with the
larger party.
	   The New Zealand Herald-DigiPoll of 700 people taken last week
shows in the past three months the governing National Party has
dropped 5.7 percent, while Labor has picked up exactly double that
support, rising 11.4 percent.
	   The same poll shows the Alliance at 9.7 percent, up 1.2 percent
since May, while support for the rightist ACT New Zealand Party
halved, from 11.8 percent to 5.9 percent.
	   Junior governing coalition partner New Zealand First polled 2.2
percent, up from 1.7, but was consistently below the poll's 3.7
percent margin of error.
	   Clark leads the preferred prime minister field at 24.8 percent,
up from 18.5 percent in May, while Prime Minister Jenny Shipley
polled 22.2 percent, down from 26.8 percent.
	   A governing coalition in New Zealand needs a simple majority of
61 of the 120 seats in the country's single-house Parliament.

Storm warning reissued for rain-pounded Seoul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ After a one-day reprieve, Seoul's 12
million people were warned Monday to prepare for another powerful
rain storm that could bring new floods.
	   The Central Meteorological Observatory reinstated a storm
warning it had lifted a day earlier for Seoul and its surrounding
areas, reporting fronts moving in from the west and south.
	   Seoul and surrounding areas were pounded by more than 1 meter
(39.3 inches) of rain from Wednesday through Saturday, causing
floods and mudslides that killed 165 people and left 66 missing.
	   Among the victims were three U.S. soldiers.
	   Weathermen lifted storm warnings for Seoul Sunday as the frontal
system moved southward. But Monday they said the storm, reinforced
by another low pressure system over the Yellow Sea, was moving back
toward the capital.
	   ``As we have repeatedly said, this rain storm is highly
unpredictable and it's really difficult to make an exact
forecast,'' weatherman Kim Sung-soo said.
	   The new storm was expected to dump up to 15 centimeters (5.9
inches) of rain by Tuesday, Kim said.
	   More than 82,000 people were driven from their homes by last
week's floods and property damage was estimated at up to dlrs 2
billion.
	   The deluge was brought by the same storm system that a week
earlier sent flash floods raging down mountain valleys at the
southern tip of the Korean Peninsula, killing 67 campers and
leaving 29 missing and feared dead.

Dollar edges higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stocks, dollar and bond price &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar edged higher against the yen Monday
morning on worries about recovery prospects for Japan's economy and
persistent economic weakness in Asia. Tokyo stocks fell sharply.
	   The dollar bought 146.14 yen in midday trading, up 0.60 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and marginally higher than its New York rate
of 146.13 yen late last week.
	   Traders said Japanese banks sold the U.S. currency to take
profits, pushing the dollar back from its intraday high of 146.50
yen hit earlier in the morning. The dollar reached an eight-year
high of 146.73 yen on June 16.
	   ``We saw some profit-taking around 146.50 yen,'' said Shuji
Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank in
Tokyo.
	   But the dollar's downside was considered limited Monday as
Japanese investors and overseas players were poised to buy on dips
below 146.00 yen, traders said.
	   The Japanese currency remained vulnerable to selling amid
disappointment with the first major speech Friday by Japan's new
prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, who offered little fresh policy
initiatives to prop up the anemic economy.
	   The dollar also got support against the yen on mounting
speculation that China will be forced to devalue its yuan, and Hong
Kong will de-link its currency's long-standing peg to the U.S.
dollar.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average shed 179.47 points, or 1.13 percent, to 15,649.70 at
the end of the morning session. On Friday, the Nikkei index closed
down 47.05 points, or 0.30 percent _ the fifth straight day of
losses.
	   ``The market is likely to continue to trend lower this week'' in
the wake of Prime Minister Obuchi's failure to instill confidence
in his administration's economic policies, said Masaru Arai,
general manager at Ryoko Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section declined 16.55 points, or 1.35 percent, to 1,208.75.
The TOPIX closed down 1.79 points, or 0.15 percent, on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.170 percent from Friday's close of 1.195
percent, driving its price up to 112.00 yen from 111.82 yen last
week.

Australia: Human rights in China showing positive moves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Human rights in China ``are moving in
the right direction,'' Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
Monday after meeting with senior Chinese officials.
	   Australia and China began the second round of their annual human
rights dialogue on Monday in Canberra.
	   ``There is a long way to go,'' Downer said. ``But all I can say
is that human rights are moving in the right direction in China.''
	   He said many people hold a false stereotype that developing
countries neglect civil and political rights.
	   They also believe that developed countries often overlook the
importance of economic rights in developing countries, he said.
	   ``I am pleased to say that this dialogue proves that stereotype
wrong, at least in the case of our two countries,'' he added.
	   But the Australia Tibet Council said the recent deaths of
Tibetan political prisoners cast doubt on Downer's assurances that
private talks would be more effective than public criticism.
	   Canberra woman Li Wang plans to use the talks to stage a
demonstration in favor of her son, Wang Jian Ping, an Australian
citizen jailed in China for treason.
	   Wang is one of four Australian citizens held by China, including
businessman James Peng.
	   Downer said a range of Australian initiatives that would help
China to advance human rights in legal and other areas would be
announced Tuesday at the conclusion of the talks.
	   Department of Foreign Affairs deputy secretary Kim Jones is
heading the Australian delegation, while the Chinese side is led by
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Yang Jiechi.
	   It is the first visit to Australia for human rights talks by
such a senior delegation, which includes representatives from the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the State
Ethnic Affairs Commission, the Supreme People's Court and the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
	   The inaugural talks were held last August in Beijing.

During troubled times, oil-rich Brunei installs future ruler

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ A wide-eyed, 24-year-old with
a passion for snooker and Bon Jovi was to be installed Monday as
heir to one of the world's richest monarchies.
	   Amid Islamic prayers and martial music, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah
prepared to pass on a bejeweled dagger to his eldest son, Prince
Al-Muhtadee Billah, making him rightful heir of Brunei's throne,
held by the family for more than 500 years.
	   But the royal pomp and pageantry at the 1,788-room palace on the
banks of the Brunei river mask a growing unease in the Southeast
Asian kingdom, which has withstood liberal tides to remain one of
the world's last absolute monarchies.
	   It comes at a time of economic troubles for the oil-soaked
sultanate and an embarrassing family feud brought on by the wayward
financial dealings of the Sultan's younger brother, Prince Jefri,
who is now in self-imposed exile.
	   Prince Jefri was abruptly removed from the controlling positions
of Brunei's flagship company, Amedeo, after a reported dlrs 16
billion loss. He was stripped of his post as head of the nation's
international investment arm, the Brunei Investment Agency.
	   A spokesman for Jefri recently quoted the estranged prince as
saying conservative forces backed by shadowy foreign advisers from
Iran and Libya were tightening their grip on Brunei. The government
quickly denied it.
	   But the rift appears to be widening, as the Sultan, according to
officials, also plans to strip his brother of control over three
large oil wells.
	   ``Everything in Brunei is behind closed doors,'' said Abdul
Latif Chuchu, a former chief of a political party, now banned from
politics for his anti-palace views. ``We don't know what is going
on.''
	   Analysts say economic pains are forcing the royal family to stop
expanding its fleet of Rolls-Royces and Mercedes, its squadron of
private jets and even to quietly sell off some of its prize race
horses.
	   Citizens in Brunei, where officials face jail for disclosing
financial secrets, will likely never know the extent of damage
caused by the failure of Amedeo, which owns the New York Palace
Hotel, London's Dorchester Hotel and Asprey Plc, jeweler to
Britain's royal family.
	   The clock on democracy in this nation of 300,000 stopped in 1962
when parliament was scrapped by royal fiat after Brunei's first
free elections under British administration swept an
anti-monarchist party to power.
	   Since then, a state of emergency has allowed the Sultan to
decree as he pleases. Criticizing royalty borders on treason.
	   In the run-up to Monday's investiture, the palace has attempted
to portray the future ruler as a devout Muslim with the necessary
modicum of modernism.
	   On Sunday, the young prince sat in a gold-domed mosque for
nearly three hours for evening prayers attended by more than 1,000
Brunei men answering the muezzin's call.
	   But official pamphlets have also carried pictures of the prince
playing snooker in a waistcoat and bow tie and posing in a tuxedo
at Oxford University, from where he recently received a degree in
diplomacy.
	   The crown prince's carefree years may be coming to an end as he
joins a royal battle to keep Brunei a fairy tale kingdom where
there is no income tax and education and health care is free.
	   The young prince is already sounding like a statesman.
	   ``Along with me, every single individual in this country has a
vital part to play in propelling Brunei toward a positive future in
the 21st century,'' he said in a recent interview with the local
``Muhibah'' magazine.

	   STAUNTON, Virginia (AP) _ Chemist Hampton Hairfield Jr. never
guessed his love for the Roman Catholic church would lead him to
study 1,000-year-old hallucinogenic drugs.
	   Hairfield and his wife Elizabeth _ chemistry professors at Mary
Baldwin College in Staunton _ became experts in the field of
incense and ancient resins because of an interest in frankincense.
	   The two are trying to determine what type of mind-altering
chemicals prehistoric people living near present-day Santiago,
Chile, might have used.
	   ``I was really in awe to see resin that was in existence before
even Christ walked the earth,'' said Hairfield.
	   Anthropologists say most evidence from this period shows that
hallucinogens were crushed and snorted or ingested by mouth, like
cocaine or LSD is today.
	   The drugs, which came from scrubby trees, were taken by shamans,
or medicine men, to fight off evil spirits and put them into
trances, said Clark Erickson, an associate professor of
anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania.
	   Evidence that hallucinogenic drugs were smoked _ a hypothesis
that the Hairfields are investigating by studying pipes _ could
mark a major shift in the understanding of ancient rituals in the
region, Erickson said.
	   The Hairfields hope to expand the project by analyzing the
plants from which the drugs were derived.
	   The road that led the Hairfields to this archaeological endeavor
began about 15 years ago, in a church pew.
	   It was in a Catholic church that Hairfield began thinking about
why the frankincense burned on special holidays didn't have the
lemon-like fragrance he remembered from his days as an altar boy.
	   ``I wanted to know why it wasn't smelling like it did. It
smelled like burning tires,'' he said.
	   So Hairfield, his wife and colleague Lundy Pentz designed a
simple test to identify resins, the principal ingredient in
incense.
	   Next, they analyzed the frankincense some churches were using
and discovered the churches were ``getting duped,'' Hairfield said.
Manufacturers were substituting a cheaper resin imported from
India, instead of from Somalia and Ethiopia, the customary source
for the resin.
	   As a result, Hairfield and Pentz began manufacturing their own
frankincense, using resins imported directly from Africa. Called
``Resurrection,'' the product is now sold in Virginia and New York.
	   After the team wrote a paper on their findings for a scientific
journal, the Hairfields were asked to analyze residues in Grecian
urns from the 14th century B.C.
	   After three years of chemical analysis, the Hairfields
identified the substance as terebinth.
	   It appears terebinth was burned in huge quantities by ancient
Egyptians during religious ceremonies, archaeologists say. The
discovery could help determine the significance of the resin in
Mediterranean trade.

With little fanfare, the Caribbean island of Nevis considers
</HEADLINE>
independence &QL;

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTOWN, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) _ With a lack of fanfare
entirely appropriate to their reserved ways, residents of the tiny
Caribbean island of Nevis staged a simple road rally for a mighty
goal: independence.
	   ``Do the right thing! Love Nevis!'' blared loudspeakers atop a
pickup truck that, with about 20 other vehicles, made the 25-mile
(40-kilometer) drive around the rocky island urging residents to
vote Monday to secede from Nevis' federation with St. Kitts.
	   Residents cheered ``Yes!'' from the porches of their clapboard
homes set amid the ruins of sugar plantations from the British
colonial era. Others gave the thumbs-up sign and waved at friends
in the caravan.
	   A two-thirds ``Yes'' vote in the referendum could make Nevis one
of the world's smallest nations with a population of 9,000. With
only 6,785 registered voters, results were expected late Monday.
	   ``The people of Nevis want to be in control of their affairs.
That is the issue at hand. There is no other issue,'' Nevis Premier
Vance Amory, the force behind the secessionist movement, told about
150 supporters at a Charlestown rally late Sunday.
	   Amory leads the Nevis Island Legislature, which handles local
affairs on this 36-square-mile (93 sq. kms) island and scheduled
the referendum for independence from St. Kitts, population 32,000.
	   Noting that Nevis already has limited autonomy, Amory dismissed
criticism that Nevis' size could put it at the mercy of the
shifting winds of global trade or, as some fear, global drug
trafficking cartels. Questions about federal police protection,
diplomatic links to international bodies like the United Nations,
and shared tax revenues with St. Kitts will be discussed after the
vote, he said.
	   Like Amory, many Nevisians complain that they are treated as
second-class citizens by larger St. Kitts, and they're committed to
going it alone.
	   ``You have to creep first before you walk. But one of these days
you're going to get there,'' said Edmund Gumbs, 35. ``Still, I
would like us to separate lovingly, with no violence.''
	   The secession threat alarmed the federal government based in St.
Kitts, which with Nevis won independence from Britain in 1983.
Prime Minister Denzil Douglas frets that no one has bothered to
discuss how to divide public property or handle customs,
immigration and territorial issues without unraveling the islands'
complex family, political and trade ties.
	   ``A veritable Pandora's box of problems would come cascading
down on the people of St. Kitts and Nevis,'' Douglas said in urging
a ``No'' vote. ``Let us not fight against the current of history.''
	   Caribbean and U.S. officials have echoed his sentiments, saying
privately that a breakaway Nevis could be vulnerable to drug
cartels, unable to pay international bills and become a liability
to a Caribbean trade bloc that is in the process of welcoming
impoverished Haiti.
	   But Amory _ who embarked on the secessionist drive in earnest in
1996 _ argues that while Nevis contributes 38 percent of the
Eastern Caribbean nation's dlrs 85 million budget, it receives only
21 percent.
	   Amory also argues that Nevis is better equipped than some former
Soviet states for independence, boasting a fledgling offshore
financial industry, a stable currency tied to the U.S. dollar and a
growing tourist industry.
	   ``Small is not an indication of capability,'' he said to polite
applause late Sunday. ``A number of large countries in the world
are a lot worse off.''

Economic crisis to bottom out early next year, minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's battered economy should
start to bottom out in the first quarter of 1999 provided the
government's efforts aren't neutralized by outside developments, a
news report said Monday.
	   In an interview with the Bangkok Post, Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda said Japan's sluggish economy and a devaluation of
the Chinese currency could prolong Thailand's crisis.
	   Whatever happens on the international scene, Tarrin said, the
Thai government will have to move forward with reforms, especially
a restructuring of the crippled financial sector.
	   A package of finance sector reforms is expected to be unveiled
Saturday after consultations with the International Monetary Fund,
the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   Tarrin said at least three of Thailand's 15 commercial banks
would be shut down under the plan. He declined to name the banks,
but said all depositors, creditors and borrowers would be fully
protected.
	   ``A bailout of shareholders, a bailout of bad management ... is
impossible,'' he said in an interview with the newspaper.
	   Widely expected is the merger of three state-run banks _ Siam
City Bank, First Bangkok City Bank and Bangkok Metropolitan Bank.
The fourth state-run bank, Bangkok Bank of Commerce, may be put up
for sale to foreign investors.
	   Thailand's financial system all but collapsed in mid-1998
following political interference in the once independent central
bank, and massive uncontrolled lending and corruption in private
financial institutions.
	   The government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, which came to
power after the crisis erupted, has made financial restructuring a
major priority.
	   Tarrin deflected criticism by the political opposition that
Chuan's government was focusing on helping the rich at the expense
of the poor.
	   ``If we do not try to solve the liquidity problem facing
financial institutions, they will not be able to lend to the real
sector,'' he said. ``Then business will not function and workers as
well as the poor will suffer.''
