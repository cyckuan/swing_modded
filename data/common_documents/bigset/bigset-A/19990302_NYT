 JUSTICE OFFICIAL TO CALL FOR END TO INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW  (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT and DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department will declare on Tuesday that
it considers the independent-counsel law so ``fundamentally
flawed'' that it ought to be scrapped this year, two administration
officials said on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the department's stance on the law, the first
official pronouncement by the Clinton administration on the issue,
will be delivered by Deputy Attorney General Eric J. Holder Jr. on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Holder will tell a House Judiciary Committee panel that the
21-year-old statute is ``too flawed to be renewed'' and so should
be allowed to expire on June 30. The law expires on that date
unless Congress specifically reauthorizes it.
</P>
<P>
   Holder has been leading a group within the Justice Department
which has been studying the independent-counsel issue for Attorney
General Janet Reno, and he is known to have expressed reservations
about the statute. But his testimony four-square against it, which
was reported in Tuesday's editions of The Washington Post, is the
first official, unambiguous stand by the Clinton administration
concerning the law.
</P>
<P>
   Holder will appear before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on
Commercial and Administrative Law, headed by Rep. George Gekas,
R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Gekas was one of the managers of the Senate trial on articles of
impeachment that were a result of accusations made against
President Clinton by the independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Starr
is one of seven independent counsels who have investigated members
of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said through a spokesman on Monday night that it
would have no comment in advance of Holder's testimony, but the two
officials, who are familiar with the debate within the
administration on the counsel law, confirmed the outlines of
Holder's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Holder will declare that not only is there ``no way to
adequately fix'' the law, but that there is no need for it because
the Justice Department can investigate most official wrongdoing
itself, The Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Holder's reasoning, the Justice Department would retain
authority to name special counsels whenever it was determined that
it could be a conflict of interest for the Justice Department
itself to conduct an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The independent-counsel law was a creation of the post-Watergate
era. It was enacted in 1978, when people in Washington and across
the nation recalled how President Richard M. Nixon tried to thwart
investigations into wrongdoing within his administration by
dismissing the first Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald Cox,
in October 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The independent-counsel law was seen as a way around such
deceptions and conflicts of interest. It states that the attorney
general must seek the appointment of an independent counsel when
there is substantial and credible evidence that a crime has been
committed by the president or a number of other government
officials. A panel of three federal judges selects the counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The statute, conceived as a way to prevent a high official from
getting away with high crimes, has come under frequent criticism in
the past two decades. The law's critics, Democrats and Republicans
alike, have complained that some independent counsels have spent
too much taxpayers' money for too long pursuing supposed wrongdoing
that sometimes falls below the Constitution's ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' _ and sometimes trampling on individual rights while
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known independent counsel in recent times was Starr,
whose investigation of Clinton began with probing into long-ago
land deals in Arkansas and turned to Clinton's relationship with a
former White House intern, leading to the president's impeachment
on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   While many Democrats expressed aversion to Starr, earlier
independent counsels have sparked outrage among Republicans.
Independent counsels, for instance, investigated the Iran-Contra
matter in the Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsels' inquiry at the time, and a parallel
investigation in Congress, produced high political and television
drama as they delved into the Reagan administration's sale of arms
to Iran and a diversion of some of the profits to the
anti-Communist rebels in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Other independent counsels have been all but forgotten; at least
one was never even named publicly, so slender were the threads of
evidence in his case. Some independent counsels have spent
considerable time and money looking into matters that did not
appear to threaten the future of the Republic _ whether an aide to
President Jimmy Carter might have used drugs, for instance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before Starr's investigation, the Clinton administration was
more enthusiastic about the statute. Reno spoke strongly in its
favor in the spring of 1993, in the first days of Clinton's
presidency. ``It is my firm conviction that the law has been a good
one, helping to restore public confidence in our system's ability
to investigate wrongdoing by high-level executive branch
officials,'' she told Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was pleading then for renewal of the statute, which had
lapsed in 1992. The law was renewed in 1994, before Democrats lost
control of Congress, for five more years. Those five years are up
this June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has recommended the appointment of several independent
counsels to investigate members of Clinton's Cabinet, but she came
under withering criticism over the past 18 months for refusing to
seek an independent counsel to look into fund-raising abuses in the
Democrats' 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the law has been tinkered with, its language
refined. It has been defended, albeit lukewarmly, within the past
week, in other hearings on the law before the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, headed by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool it, think about it for a while, let the temper of these
times soften,'' Howard Baker said in urging no quick, irreversible
decision. As a former Republican senator from Tennessee and a
member of the Senate Watergate Committee, and later a chief of
staff to President Reagan, he had a rare perspective.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffin B. Bell, an attorney general under Carter and
cochairman with Baker of a national commission studying
governmental separation of powers, had a different view. ``I long
ago concluded that this statute is unworkable for a number of
reasons and represents very poor governmental policy,'' Bell said.

SOMEDAY SOON, RODMAN WON'T BE FUNNY ANY MORE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Oh, it's fine now. The photographers are safe. The
referees aren't worrying about their foreheads. The casino and
wrestling excursions are nothing but dormant demons.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, the other Dennis Rodman will surface. The one
who spurns his teammates, tests their tolerance, pushes their
patience. The one who recedes into a world of self-gratification.
</P>
<P>
   It will happen because it always has, and when it does, what
then?
</P>
<P>
   Good luck, Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the freak show came to town. Pete Sampras was in the
crowd. Mo Vaughn was in the house. All for a glimpse of the purple
cash machine for NBC and the NBA, the glamour boys anointed to save
a league from air-ball apathy.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Lakers survived fatigue, immaturity and the
hurricane force of Luc Longley. And while Rodman didn't start, he
was the main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Seven points and 16 rebounds later, the comic-book tandem of
Rambis and Rodman are 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what?'' Lakers Coach Kurt Rambis said. ``Not only is
he a great defensive player and an unbelievable rebounder, but that
guy knows more about basketball than 99.9 percent of the players on
the planet. I'm so happy the Lakers got him on this ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course he is. For now.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, Rodman gives the Lakers exactly what they need.
Toughness. Rebounding. Outlet passing to ignite the fast break. A
strong defender. But if you think he's the guy who will shut down
Karl Malone in the playoffs, well, you didn't watch the past two
NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think he'll be on his best behavior for the duration
of a short season, you haven't been paying attention. With this
guy, calm can only last so long, conformity gets boring very
quickly, and there can never be an abundance of good times.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's performance, Rodman wasn't in the mood to talk.
He issued a few thoughts to a Suns' official, quickly becoming
Rodman's new mode of communication with the press.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is more fitting than what he recently told ESPN's
Dan Patrick:
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' Rodman said. ``I will keep myself in front of
that damn lens right there as long as I live.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Bulls coach Phil Jackson says Rodman suffers from
Attention Deficit Syndrome. An undying need to be analyzed,
scrutinized, to be the subject of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the cameras caught Rodman and Rambis joking on the
sidelines. What they didn't see was Rodman taking a seat on the far
end of the bench during a timeout, tuning out the head coach.
Combined with missed practices and late arrivals and a few bad
losses, there will come a time when it won't be funny any longer.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three seasons, the Rodman experiment was equally
volatile, but the whole thing worked only because Michael Jordan
and Scottie Pippen would not let Rodman sink the ship. Simply put,
the Lakers don't have such strength of character.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Chicago, Rodman tried. And while everything was swept
under the rug _ the gambling excursions, the missed practices, the
verbal assault on Mormons _ his postseason detour to Detroit almost
broke the Bulls. If you don't remember, it was the day he bolted
town to wrestle with Hulk Hogan while the NBA Finals were reaching
a fever pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In his two successful stops, the two places where he's won
championships, there has been at least two veteran superstars
Rodman deeply respected and a coach that served as a surrogate
father figure.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, there is Shaquille O'Neal, a man who has been
swept four times in his playoff career, and the most frequent
target of Rodman's wrath in the past. There is the 20-year-old Kobe
Bryant, on his path to greatness, hoisting up ill-advised shots at
every turn. And there is Rambis, head coach for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, they are enjoying Rodmania. They are also ripe for an
attack of the Rodmaniac.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal says he forgives Rodman for past insults, saying he's
always wanted a ``thug forward.'' Bryant said he can put up with
anything in exchange for a championship ring. Rambis says he can
relate, once a self-described rebel himself.
</P>
<P>
   They really don't understand. But they will.
</P>
<P>
   It will either happen naturally or Rodman will create the
friction for excitement. It will happen because this is what his
life has become, a mixture of fact and fiction, of shock value and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was doing games for TNT, I was in a taxicab in New York
and the driver was listening to Howard Stern,'' Danny Ainge said.
``They were talking about Rodman's exploits, how he was out until
four in the morning. I get to Madison Square Garden and I run into
Jack Haley and I tell him that I heard they were out until four.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Danny, it's all a bunch of crap. Dennis was in bed
at 11. I was in bed at 11. He just made the whole story up for
drama.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there will be plenty of nights when Rodman ``is'' out
until 4 a.m. Followed by mornings when he doesn't feel like
practicing.
</P>
<P>
   He will explode when the initial embrace has worn off in Los
Angeles and the star-struck town begins to yawn at his hair color.
Or when the Lakers play like children and underachieve. Or if he
doesn't crack the starting lineup soon. Or when he believes he's
being targeted by David Stern and his referees.
</P>
<P>
   It will happen because it always has and who changes at age 37?
</P>
<P>
   What then?
</P>
<P>
   Good night, Lakers. &QL;

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Spurs visit the Rockets tonight in what was expected to be a
game between teams better than a combined .500. But the only sure
thing in the Texas portion of the NBA is the Mavericks, who never
seem to change.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets and Spurs have not slipped that far, but each can
commiserate with its I-10 rival.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, tonight's meeting of the 8-6 Rockets and 6-8 Spurs
can offer the Rockets some welcome relief from a stretch that has
seen them lose five of their past eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets insist they have reason to consider the recent slump
an aberration, citing a lack of depth because of injuries and the
growing pains expected with a lineup that for the past five games
has included just one starter from last season.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley, out for two weeks after arthroscopic surgery to
repair cartilage damage in his left knee, returned to the rotation
Sunday. Antoine Carr returned from his knee injury the day before,
and Rodrick Rhodes could be back sometime this week.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley contends the Rockets' problems can be traced directly to
their injuries. Before his surgery, they were 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right there,'' Barkley said. ``I like our team a lot.
We're going to be good. We've got a lot of good pieces. We were
playing really well before I got hurt. We just have to play like we
were playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were playing well and have since, as impressive
showings against the Suns and SuperSonics, and even stretches
against Vancouver and New Jersey, would indicate. But they have
been sporadic, citing the adjustment to one another required by all
their changes and youth. Even Barkley said it would take another
month for all the pieces to jell.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rudy Tomjanovich says the process has been slowed by
circumstances as much as injuries. The schedule has had the Rockets
playing nine games in 13 days and will not offer more than one day
between games until March 18-19. Thus, Tomjanovich has had to
experiment during games to find what will work best for each player
individually and the Rockets as a unit.
</P>
<P>
   Only in games has he been able to test new combinations and
rotations or find which new players are more comfortable in
specific game situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to find out what I've got,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I've
got to go through the process of having guys out there and figuring
out what's best for this guy or that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the offense has been changing in subtle ways. There
have been times the offense has clicked, most recently to start the
second halves at Vancouver and Los Angeles over the weekend, when
almost every basket came from running the offense and almost every
field goal was coupled with an assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would mean the offense was working,'' forward Matt
Bullard said. ``The guys are looking to the open man and passing
better. We've been working real hard on trying to find our plays
and certain things we can do to get guys comfortable. The coaches
have been doing a fantastic job to get guys doing things they can
do well.''
</P>
<P>
   On other occasions, the offense has become reliant on individual
moves. And the change to a more up-tempo style has been generally
limited to long rebounds grabbed by Scottie Pippen or a few Michael
Dickerson sprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a team that didn't want to run, even the
water-buffalo team I played on,'' Tomjanovich said. ``Those first
couple strides, I see guys trotting instead of busting down there.
I've got to yell, `Run! Get down there! Cross on the break!'
There's never been anybody that just does it on their own. Bill
Fitch, that's one thing that he said: `You have to do that all the
time to wear them (opponents) down. Then, you'll start getting
them.' You might run five times and not see the ball, but you've
got to run on that sixth time.''
</P>
<P>
   Those problems, however, seem relatively minor compared to the
injuries that had removed four players from the planned rotation.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Rockets fret too much, they could always consider the
Spurs, who have been healthy and whose additions were expected to
step easily into familiar roles.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have struggled, however, even moving former Rockets
guard/forward Mario Elie into the starting lineup to add intensity
to a team with a tendency to underachieve without seeming to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to bust on this team all the time for being soft,''
Elie said. ``Now, I hear other guys calling us soft, and I'm on the
team. It bugs me. It doesn't seem to bug other guys, but it bugs
me. I know these guys are talented and all, but talent doesn't
always win in this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to win a championship in this league, you have to
have heart and soul. Talent doesn't always win championships. Blood
and guts do. We have a nice team on paper, but we're missing
something. This is the first team that I've been on that's had no
emotion. Other than me, Malik (Rose), Jerome (Kersey) and Avery
(Johnson), the other guys seem to be just walking around. That's
just the type of guys they are. I'm trying, yelling at guys, trying
to get them pumped up. But it takes a lot out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the luster also has been taken out of this meeting of
the Spurs and Rockets. But both might take a look across the court
to share a little early misery and consider their condition
temporary.

SUNS STUMBLE IN FOURTH QUARTER TO LAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ With a game on the line, nobody has been more
dependable than Rex Chapman for the Suns over the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Even on his worst shooting nights, Chapman has demonstrated a
knack for hitting big shots in pressure situations. But Monday,
that magic escaped him.
</P>
<P>
   And the Los Angeles Lakers, with Derek Harper and Shaquille
O'Neal making the big shots when they counted most, escaped the
Suns, 97-91, at America West Arena with their fourth straight
victory since Del Harris was dismissed as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman had three opportunities to score in the final 2:15 and
came up empty on each as the Suns lost for the fourth time in eight
home games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a guy that's won a lot of games the last
two years,'' Suns Coach Danny Ainge said of Chapman. ``Everyone on
our bench, the coaching staff, every fan knows that. Those things
happen. You can't make them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you this: I'll take those shots every day. And Rex
made the right decisions to take the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't make Chapman feel any better about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to try to explain it away,'' Chapman said. ``I
just blew them. The first one was point-blank. Another one I make
in my sleep it seems like. Our guys executed perfectly, set
screens, everybody did their jobs except the guy shooting the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Chapman wasn't alone. The Suns led by eight points
with 10 minutes to play and couldn't hold the lead. Ironically,
they have made a bad habit of falling behind by double-digits,
forcing big comebacks in many games this season.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they appeared to have control of the game. But the
Lakers reeled off a 12-4 run in a span of three minutes to tie the
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't execute as well in the fourth quarter as we had the
rest of the game,'' Suns forward George McCloud said. ``They're a
club we know we can play with and we know we can beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, with center Luc Longley playing his best game of the
season, did a reasonably good job on O'Neal. He had 25 points and
nine rebounds. And they did it without conceding open shots to the
Lakers' explosive wing players, Kobe Bryant and Eddie Jones, who
combined to make seven of 22 shots.
</P>
<P>
   But Harper killed them, connecting on four of his five
three-point attempts to finish with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pops made some big shots,'' McCloud said of the 37-year-old
Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Suns were in position to win. They led 83-82 and set
up a play during a timeout that included several options, but the
one the Suns wanted was Chapman coming off a screen. It worked
beautifully, and Chapman took the ball to the basket. But he missed
a running scoop shot.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal made the Suns pay, scoring inside. Jason Kidd's 17-foot
jumper put the Suns back up by a point, but when Kidd double-teamed
O'Neal on the Lakers' next possession, O'Neal found Harper spotted
up at the three-point line.
</P>
<P>
   He hit it with 1:08 to play and the Lakers were up, 87-85.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq was getting what he wanted inside, and they kept digging
to try and get back to him (with a double-team),'' Harper said.
``My shot felt good, and fortunately Shaq got it out to me. I had
time to get set, so I was confident I was going to knock it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman missed on the Suns' next possession when O'Neal helped
defensively and made him alter a shot low on the baseline. The Suns
sent Lakers forward Dennis Rodman to the line for a pair of free
throws, and he hit one of two.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Suns set up a play during a timeout, this time with
51 seconds to play. Chapman came off a screen on the opposite side
this time, and again had an open shot. It missed.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said the play was executed ``exactly'' as it was drawn
up except for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't draw it up to be missed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns had a last gasp after Tom Gugliotta's three-point shot,
and a silly foul Harper committed on Kidd behind the three-point
line with 9.5 seconds to go and the Lakers holding a five point
lead. But Kidd hit just one of the three free throws and it was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to say it had to do with the great coaching,''
Lakers Coach Kurt Rambis said. ``But I think Shaq had something to
do with that. Kobe making free throws, and a great defensive effort
by a few people. And I think Dennis probably got a couple of his
rebounds when we needed them.'' &QL;

rejected the Cardinals' two-year contract offer, the team stepped
up negotiations with linebacker Jamir Miller.

<P>
   ``That's a good sign for Wayne'' said Gandy's agent, Neil
Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had offered a two-year deal worth $6 million,
about $400,000 less than Cleveland's two-year contract was worth.
But the Cardinals refused to add a third year for a player who will
be 36 next season.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland offered a $3 million signing bonus. But $4.1 million
of the Browns' offer is in the final year, when Brown knows he
could be released.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the Browns said that Brown objected to such a
disparity between the second and third years and that Cleveland
increased the amount in the second year to pacify Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals offered a $2 million signing bonus but were
willing to give him $4 million in 1999, $500,000 more than the
Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not have been able to compete with them as far as
dollars were concerned,'' said a Cardinals official who asked to
remain unidentified. ``Still, I'm shocked that he made that
decision. For a guy who worked all his career to be on a playoff
contender, to make a decision like that . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days ago, the Browns weren't even in the picture for
Brown, who said he was close to re-signing with the Cardinals. But
the Cardinals couldn't close the deal, and Brown visited Cleveland
last week.
</P>
<P>
   He still talked to Cardinals officials before making his final
decision and reportedly spoke with Coach Vince Tobin and
offensive-line coach George Warhop on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the starting left tackle the past three seasons, joins a
Cleveland offensive line that will be the strength of the team. The
line includes high-priced free agents Dave Wohlabaugh, the former
New England center, and Orlando Thomas, the former Baltimore right
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' talks with Miller's agent, Steve Baker, on Monday
were the most serious in several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along, we've made it known that we want Jamir Miller
back,'' the Cardinals official said. ``We still want him back.
Hopefully, we'll get him back.''
</P>
<P>
   But how hard will they try?
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the team's leading tackler last season, has been waiting
two weeks for the Cardinals to make an offer. It likely will be a
short-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   The only known competition the Cardinals have for Miller is the
Chicago Bears, whom Miller visited last week. But after signing
offensive tackle Blake Brockermeyer to a four-year, $17 million
contract, the Bears are trying to decide whether they still have
enough money to make an offer to Miller. The Bears have only about
$3.3 million in salary cap room available.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said the Cardinals had made it clear that Brown
remained their top choice and that Gandy was only an option if
Brown signed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Steelers are also interested in Gandy, who played
left tackle and right tackle for the Rams. &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
Cardinals backup quarterback Stoney Case, an unrestricted free
agent, visited the Seattle Seahawks last Friday. His former coach
at New Mexico, Mike Sheppard, is the quarterbacks coach of the
Seahawks. Seattle has only one quarterback, Jon Kitna, on its
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Backup offensive lineman Matt Joyce, a restricted free agent,
continues to attract interest from the Minnesota Vikings, who are
deciding whether to make him an offer. The Cardinals could match
any offer but wouldn't receive compensation if they didn't match
it. &QL;

EX-DODGERS EXEC HAS CLASS ACT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM McCONNELL  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Break out the Cliffs Notes. It's now Professor
Fred Claire.
</P>
<P>
   The former Dodgers executive has become a guest lecturer at USC.
Drawing on his 40 years of professional experience in sports, the
62-year-old Pasadena resident is teaching at USC's Annenberg School
of Communication.
</P>
<P>
   His subject: ``Sports Business and Media in Today's Society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a subject to which I can bring a unique perspective,''
Claire said. ``I can draw on my background as a sports editor, as
well as my 30 years with the Dodgers. So far, I've enjoyed it. I
hope my students feel the same.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be too soon to tell if Claire's fling with the world of
academia will develop into a full-time job. It's also too soon to
tell exactly how the former Dodgers executive will be remembered by
the baseball community.
</P>
<P>
   Some see him as a victim _ the first casualty of the Fox regime
at Dodger Stadium. Others say he was a voice of reason crying in
the wilderness that is major-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no bitterness,'' Claire said about being fired by the
Dodgers amid their tumultuous 1998 season. ``I had a great run with
the Dodgers. Now, I am doing something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, you can't take it personally. You have to move on
with your life. It's not my nature to dwell on the past. It was a
business decision, and I can respect that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses change hands; people come and go. The important
thing is, make sure you don't change your principles. I never did
that, nor would I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire says he no longer follows the day-to-day doings of the
Dodgers, and refuses to speculate on how the organization will do
without him. But he admits he would like to return to baseball, if
the circumstances were right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to get back in the game as a general manager,''
Claire said. ``But it would have to be a mutually beneficial
opportunity, a situation where I felt comfortable and had a
reasonable chance of assembling a winning team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, more than half the current teams won't be
competitive in 1999, or any time soon. And that does not bode well
for baseball, let alone my job search.''
</P>
<P>
   While Claire is deeply concerned with the direction of
major-league baseball, he is heartened by the recent NBA labor
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the NBA agreement will be the model for a future
agreement in major-league baseball. I see a real need for both a
salary cap on individual players, as well as teams, and the NBA
agreement does that.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire is convinced that strict salary caps and fully shared
revenues await baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a changing world, and baseball needs to change with the
times. Without change, I'm not convinced that major-league baseball
as we know it will continue to exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene Orza (an executive with the baseball players' union) and
I could debate this for hours. He feels that, historically, there
have always been competitive and non-competitive teams and that is
simply the nature of major-league baseball. I say it has never been
like it is now, where so many organizations have this sense of
hopelessness, this total inability to assemble a winning team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember back in the 1970s, right after free agency became a
reality, someone asked Walter O'Malley how much money it would take
to retain Sandy Koufax, assuming Koufax was still pitching for the
Dodgers. And O'Malley, in his wisdom, said, `Mr. Koufax would be my
partner.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see $100-million player contracts (like the one the
Dodgers gave Kevin Brown), you see we aren't that far from what
Walter O'Malley envisioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Claire says it's wrong for owners to use Fox's Rupert
Murdoch as a whipping boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To blame Fox for the state baseball finds itself in is an
oversimplification,'' Claire said. ``Baseball's problems are much
more complicated than the presence of one particular ownership
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major-league baseball owners must face the fact they need to
work together to solve their problems. Unfortunately, we have a
group of very competitive people _ the owners, the players, the
agents, the union officials _ and they tend to see things in terms
of winning or losing. And none of them want to be perceived as a
loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he ever returns to baseball, Claire is certainly not
about to apologize for his time with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I did a good job,'' he said. ``We were in the middle of
the pack in the 1990s, in terms of revenue streams, yet we managed
to produce winning teams, divisional champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was consumed by the job, totally dedicated to making the
Dodgers a championship team. And you have to be that way to succeed
in professional sports. Now, I can take a step back and do some
other things with my life, such as teach, which I always wanted to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire also isn't ruling out writing a book about his
experiences with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if you know me, you know it won't be one of those
`tell-all' type of things,'' he said. ``That's not my style. But I
believe the 30 years I spent with the Dodgers were a fascinating
time, and I suspect there would be a certain reader interest in my
experiences.''

SAMMY SOSA, SUPERSTAR  
 AFTER HIS MVP YEAR, CUBS PLAYER IS CENTER OF ATTEN TION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. - The circus arrived in Mesa on Monday morning. The
Sammy Sosa circus, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, looking the part of the Pied Piper, led a throng of fans,
reporters and television cameras to different corners of the
Chicago Cubs' training facility at Fitch Park during his first
workout of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   An aerial view of the complex would have shown a glut of fans
and reporters at whatever field Sosa worked. It looked like the
overviews shown during golf tournaments when Tiger Woods
participates.
</P>
<P>
   The signs all around the complex say these are the Chicago Cubs.
But it was Sosa whom fans wanted to see most on this glorious day
in the Valley. For his part, Sosa did not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   He flashed his gleaming smile, the one that captivated a nation
last season, throughout the Cubs' 2{-hour workout. He then signed
autographs for nearly everyone who wanted one before heading into
the clubhouse to meet again with his teammates and eventually with
an eager horde of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa remained humble, even cracking jokes, while discussing his
1998 season, which culminated with him being named the National
League Most Valuable Player on a nearly unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's going to remember '98,'' he said. ``We've got to
put that away, because '99 is now the year. They already paid me
for '98.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's first press conference of the 1999 season was strikingly
similar to the ones he had almost on a daily basis during the final
month of last season. He was engaging and accommodating and seemed
the same genuine self he's been since making his big league debut
with Texas in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any kind of ego,'' said Sosa, who reported to
camp at a slightly bulked-up 222 pounds. ``I'm the same guy. I
showed I don't play for money. I play for myself and the team.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds nice on the surface, but the reality is that Sosa's
life will forever be changed. He is easily recognized wherever he
ventures. He can no longer duck into any establishment and expect
to roam around without being noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa willingly accepts the rewards and celebrity that come from
swatting 66 home runs last season, second in the history of the
game only to Mark McGwire's 70. He welcomed many of the accolades
showered on him during the off-season, notably being invited to
just about every awards ceremony conceivable.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's non-stop winter itinerary has been the cause of some
criticism. There are those who believe he may have run himself into
the ground with a grinding schedule that had him jetting off to far
corners of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   He played a series of exhibition games with major league
All-Stars in Japan and flew off to attend a soiree at Hugh Hefner's
Playboy Mansion in Hollywood. He also made time to help light the
national Christmas tree in Washington, D.C., and attend two parades
in his honor in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   He attended countless banquets, including the players union
awards in Orlando and the ESPN awards in New York. The Dominican
native visited Chicago several times, including for his MVP
announcement, and even attended the State of the Union address, his
favorite stop of the winter, as a personal guest of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He also visited Puerto Rico and Venezuela to receive
humanitarian awards for his efforts to aid Hurricane Georges'
victims in his country.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Henry Rodriguez, Sosa's neighbor a few miles away in
the Dominican Republic, said he never saw Sosa over the winter
except on television. Sosa estimated he slept in his own bed
``maybe two or three weeks'' during the 4{-month off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there will ever be another year like that
again,'' he said Monday. ``I have a lot of memories now. Everything
I did went to the foundation. I have an opportunity to be here and
ask for help. I think I'm doing something great. I'm satisfied with
what God gave me last year. I'm not asking to take the world. I
just want a piece of the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa firmly sits atop a once glorious but now ravaged, Chicago
sports scene, ready to take over as the city's No. 1 sports figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to replace Michael Jordan,'' Sosa said. ``I
don't want to be like Michael. I want to be like Sammy. I want to
be the best. He's the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star right fielder arrived in camp Monday brimming with
enthusiasm and talking about helping to lead the Cubs to their
first World Series appearance since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Several times during his meeting with reporters, Sosa emphasized
that he believes the Cubs are not far from being a World Series
club, how achieving that goal is really all he cares about.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stay together as a family like we did in '98, then we're
going to go a long way in '99,'' Sosa said. ``The goal right now is
to go to the World Series. I'll never forget where I came from. I'm
still hungry.'' &QL;

WOMACK HESITANT TO MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ If you're worth your salt as a middle infielder, you
stand your ground when a runner comes after you at second base with
his spikes high, trying to break up a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack has been in that situation many times. Now he is
standing his ground in a different way. Though he doesn't want to
create any seismic activity for his new team, the Diamondbacks, he
is not overjoyed about what appears will be a move from second base
to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Womack, acquired Friday in a trade with Pittsburgh, had his
first face-to-face meeting with Manager Buck Showalter on Monday
morning before joining his teammates on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both said what we had to say,'' Womack said. ``Although
there were no conclusions, it is important for us to be on the same
page. You can't settle everything in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   That case stated, your rebuttal, Mr. Showalter:
</P>
<P>
   ``He more than likely will be in right field. He understands the
way we feel, the way I feel. It will take a day or so for it to
soak in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that Tony has a lot on his mind. This is a new
organization, this is the first time he's ever been traded, and his
wife is two or three weeks away from giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murph (outfield coach Dwayne Murphy) and I spoke to him. He
presented his thoughts, and they were all good points. It's not a
surprise to him, though, that we want him to play right field. It's
been talked about for a while. But I'm not going to jam anything
down his throat.''
</P>
<P>
   While Showalter said that Womack's athleticism gives him several
options, the skipper has the only vote that really counts, and that
ballot reads: right field.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks had their first intrasquad game Monday at
Tucson Electric Park. Womack did not play. He joined a handful of
veterans on an adjacent field and took some infield practice _ at
second base and shortstop _ and a few swings in the batting cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to get out there, get a few swings in, work on a
few fundamentals and calm down,'' said Womack, who is expected to
be the leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the trade, the Diamondbacks have had a few
inquiries from other teams about Womack. It will be highly
unlikely, however, that he will wind up in another uniform this
season.
</P>
<P>
   One new set of threads will be enough to last him awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I have to get used to,'' he said. ``I felt
comfortable in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen other guys get traded and wondered how I would act
if I ever got traded. In a way, I wanted it to be someone else. But
it's me.''
</P>
<P>
   So the transition begins. It is uncertain whether Womack will
see action in today's intrasquad game at 1 p.m. at the minor league
complex. All the defensive work during batting practice will be
beneficial, but it won't be the same as stepping on the hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the flames flicker at his feet, he will stand his
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is give 100 percent all the time,'' he
said. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: WINNING ON THE ROAD: EASY TO SAY, NOT DO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Basketball is a simple game. Any pro will tell you
that. Such was the case on Monday night in Madison Square Garden.
And Chris Childs, a New York point guard, succinctly explained the
Knicks' 85-78 victory over the Cavaliers on Monday night after two
straight losses on the road. ``Enough,'' Childs said, ``was
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   And Allan Houston, the Knick shooting guard, said, ``We got our
emotional level back.''
</P>
<P>
   And the sage veteran and infrequent Knick center, Herb Williams,
added yet another perspective. ``Cleveland,'' he said, ``missed a
lot of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a matter of sometimes inexplicable record why the home
team generally has such an advantage in basketball. The Knicks have
a 9-5 record over all now _ 2-4 on the road, 7-1 at home. Perhaps
the home advantage has to do with the roar of the partisan crowd
that pumps up the local sweethearts and puts the tourists in a
profound funk that only Jung could plumb; or that the rims and
backboards and floorboards are more familiar, or less; or maybe
it's the difference between home cooking and room service.
</P>
<P>
   But the simple fact of this simple game is that for a team to
win to get to the playoffs and succeed on that level, it must win
on the road. Championship teams somehow find a way to master the
trick. The Knicks coach, Jeff Van Gundy, is aware of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes mental toughness to win on the road,'' Van Gundy said
after the game. ``To date we haven't shown yet. You don't develop
it as a player. You either have it or you don't. At times, we've
used the excuse of being on the road to explain the letdown. We
just need more discipline offensively and defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston and Detroit, in the two games on Friday and Sunday,
the Knicks played as though they were up against Bird's Celtics and
Isiah's Pistons, instead of teams with losing records.
</P>
<P>
   And then on Monday night, just when Cleveland closed a gap in
which they were down by as many as 16 points in the second quarter,
and now made the score 52-50 in the middle of the third period, the
Knicks sprang alive. They went on a 15-2 run. Charlie Ward threw a
beautiful lob pass to Patrick Ewing for a basket. Houston hit a big
three-point shot. Childs fed Ewing. Then came Marcus Camby with a
turnout jump shot and Larry Johnson with a twisting layup that
would have made Chubby Checker proud.
</P>
<P>
   And their defense had something to do with the victory, as well.
`Yeah,'' said Van Gundy, ``we fouled 'em every time they got the
ball.'' The stats confirmed the wry remark: The Cavs shot 43 free
throws to the Knicks' 22. But Van Gundy was also aware that his
team did have some shot blockers in attendance, especially Ewing
and Kurt Thomas, and especially against the suddenly earthbound
Shawn Kemp. Kemp, the Cavs' 6-foot-10 center, is listed at 280
pounds. Maybe one day he will be. Now, he is a decidedly more
portly player than fans have been used to seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to play above the rim,'' said Williams, ``but now he's
more of a post-up player.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was quick to add that he has done very well in
transforming his game, in virtually one season, or since he found
the weight room during the lockout less to his tastes than the
buffet table. He did score 19 points and he did have 10 rebounds,
but down the stretch, he found Ewing and Thomas, particularly,
swatting away his shot attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the game, the Knicks packed their shaving kits for
the trip to Miami, where they play the Heat on Tuesday night. Will
their resolve remain, or will it retreat?
</P>
<P>
   ``In pressurized situations on the road usually true character
comes out,'' said Van Gundy. ``In a few more weeks we'll have a
good idea about the character of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This league is so evenly matched now,'' said Childs. ``We have
to go out there and not lose our composure. When we lost in Boston
and Detroit, we lost our composure. We tried to do it one-on-one.
We have to stay within the concept of getting the ball inside first
_ and shoot jump shots when we're double-teamed and hit the open
man. We were going side-to-side today looking for the open shot. If
we do that, and hold a team to lowscoring, we'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple game. The Knicks just can't let it become quantum
mechanics when they travel. &QL;

TYSON'S MEDICINE USE UNCLEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - After  &UR; Mike Tyson assaulted a television set last
week, questions about his jailhouse tantrum lingered.
</P>
<P>
   One of Tyson's attorneys said Maryland jailers had denied him an
antidepressant drug, Zoloft, which he apparently had been taking
for four months.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no comment from Maryland. With only the
attorney's word, there's room for skepticism. Nothing about Tyson
is ever certain. He's got more spinmeisters than  &UR; President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But assume for a second that Tyson has been taking the drug. The
propriety of withholding medicine is one issue. What if he had been
diabetic? Would the jailers withhold insulin?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's his boxing license. It was restored by Nevada after
a messy hearing, which included a psychological report that deemed
him fit to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Tyson was prescribed Zoloft by the Massachusetts
psychiatric team that had him on its proverbial couch.
</P>
<P>
   A fighter on antidepressant medicine? According to the ``1998''
``Complete Drug'' ``Reference _ A Consumer Reports'' guide, Zoloft
``may cause some people to become drowsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Should we assume today's cornermen are sedating their fighters
with a couple of Valium and telling them to be happy? Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   If, in fact, Tyson has been on antidepressant medication, it
might explain his repeated, profanity-laced outbursts in Las Vegas
during the week before he beat  &UR; Frans Botha.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, he quit taking it as he marshaled his energies
during the days before the opening bell. It was then that he
verbally assaulted television correspondents. Not long after, he
went after the set itself. &QL; 
A recount &QL; 
Here's an argument for posting the judges' scores after each round:
</P>
<P>
   About 10 days after Phoenix middleweights  &UR; Anthony Brown and
 &UR; Roger
 &UR; Jones were judged to have fought to a draw at Midnight Rodeo, the
Arizona State Boxing Commission conducted a recount. Oops, the
addition was faulty. Brown, now 14-6-1, was declared the winner by
a split decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can accept a draw, but to tell me I lost 10 days
afterward,'' said Jones (4-2-1). ``That's unfair.'' &QL; 
Briefly . . . &QL; 
 &UR; Michael Carbajal's comeback victory Saturday night was a first step
in his plans for a 112-pound title. It was hard to judge. Carbajal
appeared to have regained hand speed that was absent in a 1997
loss. But he beat a fighter,  &UR; Jose DeJesus, 35, who appeared to be
in poor condition.
</P>
<P>
   Former International Boxing Federation middleweight champ  &UR; James
Toney will resurface as a cruiserweight Sunday at Celebrity Theater
against little-known  &UR; Onebo Maxine. How far has he fallen? Once,
Toney was a pound-for-pound contender. For Sunday's bout,  &UR; Sione
Asipelli of Mesa was offered as an opponent by Valley manager
 &UR; Steve Eisner. Toney's corner said no, which suggests fear that
Asipelli is too tough.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix attorney  &UR; Pat McGroder has been appointed to a seat on
the Arizona Commission. McGroder represented former Suns center
 &UR; Alvan Adams and former Suns Coach  &UR; John MacLeod.
</P>
<P>
   Promising yet idle  &UR; Fidel Hernandez of Carbajal's gym used to be
a roommate of newly crowned International Boxing Federation junior
middleweight champ  &UR; Fernando Vargas when both were amateurs.
Hernandez said he's going to ask his old roomie for a bout. Might
as well. Nobody else will fight Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tim Kawakami's biography of  &UR; Oscar De La Hoya, ``Golden''
``Boy,'' is on the book stands. It's an insightful look at a
fighter with pound-for-pound rivals but unchallenged popularity. &QL;

RAFTER EASILY STEALS SHOW  
 QUESTIONS TOUGHER THAN HIS FOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - The questions from the ladies in the crowd
were tougher than Australian Pat Rafter's first-round match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you wear boxers or briefs?'' a woman asked Rafter, who beat
American Alex O'Brien, 6-3, 6-4, Monday night at the Franklin
Templeton Tennis Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, voted by ``People'' magazine in 1997 as one of the 10
sexiest men in the world, didn't blush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't wear my G-string. . .but it's whatever I've got,''
Rafter told the adoring fans at the Canadian Pacific Scottsdale
Princess. The questions didn't get any racier. They also had little
to do with aces and double faults.
</P>
<P>
   One fan asked him what he does to relax? Rafter said, ``To have
a bit of dinner and a couple of beers.''
</P>
<P>
   A female fan then shouted, ``Where?''
</P>
<P>
   His brothers, Peter and Michael, got a good laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, 21, made his first trip to the United States, spending
his vacation in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give one member of my family a holiday each year,'' said
Rafter, third youngest of nine children. ``He just turned 21, so he
can drink with the boys.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers also can play golf. ``My (golf) game is getting
good and that's the scary part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter has become Australia's most recognized athlete the past
two years when he was ranked in the top five and won back-to-back
U.S. Opens.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when he plays in a tournament, such as in Scottsdale, he's
a main eventer. He had the featured match Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In three previous trips to Scottsdale, he was on the undercard
and played on the sunshine circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like day matches, personally,'' said Rafter, ranked fifth on
the ATP Tour. ``Being the featured match has happened more and more
and it's going to happen throughout the rest of my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I'm going to deal with all these expectations
and do it (be ranked in the top five) again. It affects you
mentally and physically. I'd like to be back near the top again. I
didn't think I could do it last year and I did it. But it's very
difficult to get motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, seeded second in the Scottsdale event, admires the way
Pete Sampras, the world's No. 1 ranked player who is top seed, has
handled his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete has got to be tired,'' Rafter said. ``He has had an
incredibly tough last year. He has done it (been No. 1) for six
years. No one has been able to do it that long before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always finds something different, something new. He keeps
astonishing guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, meanwhile, had little trouble in advancing to the second
round. He had five aces in the first set and broke O'Brien's serve
in the sixth game.
</P>
<P>
   In the second set, he recorded a service break in the first
game, but then O'Brien broke back. Rafter scored another service
break in the third game and held on to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big relief at the end,'' he said. ``I got tighter and
tighter.''
</P>
<P>
   He had good reason. It was his first singles match since
suffering a knee injury Jan. 22 in the third round of the
Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``My knee is good at the moment,'' Sampras said. ``I've done a
lot of strength work back home at Australia. An MRI showed there
was little wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other night match, fourth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic beat
Aussie Scott Draper, 5-7, 6-4, 6-1. &QL;

SAMPRAS RUEFULLY RECALLS DELGADO

<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -  &UR; Pete Sampras never will forget the last
time he played  &UR; Ramon Delgado of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado knocked the world's No. 1 player out of the French Open
last May in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing about playing him this time is that it will be
on a much different surface,'' said Sampras, who will meet Delgado
in the first round of the Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic tonight
at the Canadian Pacific Scottsdale Princess.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the match was played on clay, which had turned into
mud. Tonight, the match will be on a hard court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone beating you has confidence, but I'm looking forward to
playing him again,'' said Sampras, who lost to Delgado, 7-6, 6-3,
6-4, at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado, ranked 55th on the Association of Tennis Professionals
men's tour, said the victory over Sampras was the biggest of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best thing for me so far and was really important for
the sport in my country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Local ties &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tucson native  &UR; Jim Grabb, a doubles specialist who attended
Scottsdale Saguaro High School, is the new coach of American
 &UR; Justin
 &UR; Gimelstob, who beat  &UR; Thomas Muster of Austria, 6-4, 7-5, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done an excellent job,'' Gimelstob said of Grabb. ``We
play similar styles and get along well. I really respect his
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob's trainer is  &UR; Nick Anthony, an Arizona State
University product, and he is a close friend of Phoenix native
 &UR; Farley Weiss, once a top junior player in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farley is a tennis fanatic,'' Gimelstob said. ``He has taken a
personal interest in my career.''  &QL; 
Bruins backer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob, who will play  &UR; Fernando Vicente in the second round,
hopes to still be in the tournament Thursday because his favorite
college basketball team, UCLA, will play at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   He played two years for the Bruins tennis team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a huge fan,'' he said. ``But it just bums me out that
(guard)
 &UR; Baron Davis kissed the floor Saturday and waved goodbye after two
years. That means he won't be back.'' &QL;

WRONG CALL ON RULE HAS EVANS STEAMED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - An erroneous rule interpretation by officials
contributed to Arizona State's 78-73 loss to California in Oakland
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But if ASU Coach Rob Evans was peeved after the game, he was
even angrier Monday after the Pac-10 tried to own up to the
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed call came in the final moments of the game after
Cal's Carl Boyd was fouled by Jason Patton while rebounding a
missed free throw. After play stopped, Boyd elbowed ASU's Mike
Batiste in the chest. Batiste took a halfhearted swing, and Boyd
did the same. Then the two squared off before teammates restrained
them.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Jerry White called a double flagrant technical foul and
ejected both players. Ryan Forehan-Kelly came off the bench to
shoot free throws in place of Boyd for the Patton foul and made
both. Cal led, 72-68, with 22.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   After huddling, White and umpires Steve Wilson and George
Arredondo awarded the ball to Cal. That shouldn't have happened.
According to the NCAA, on a double technical foul after the
whistle, the ball goes to the team with the possession arrow in its
favor _ ASU in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said that when he tried to point this out to White, he was
pushed slightly and told, ``Go coach your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ASU having the ball and trailing by four, Cal kept
possession, and Geno Carlisle was fouled with 21.4 seconds left. He
made both free throws to give the Golden Bears a safe six-point
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The officials apparently were confused because there is a new
rule that after a double personal foul during play, the ball is
awarded to the team that had possession.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Pac-10 admitted the error. Booker Turner, the
coordinator of officials, said in a printed statement that
``because the double flagrant technical fouls were called during a
dead-ball period, the ball should have been awarded to the team
favored by the possession arrow after the free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 Commissioner Tom Hansen said, ``We regret the error . . .
Our officials are accountable for applying the rules properly, and
there must be consequences when that is not done.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the three officials will not be assigned by the
conference to any games during November 1999. But an irate Evans
noted that the officials, as independent contractors, can work
games for other conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the punishment? But when Rob Evans or (UCLA Coach)
Steve Lavin or (UCLA player) Baron Davis does something, we're
publicly reprimanded, we've got to make a public apology or we're
suspended for a game,'' Evans said, referring to past incidents.
``Where's the equity there?''
</P>
<P>
   Evans also was upset at the Pac-10 statement, which made
incorrect reference to the score, making the mistake appear less
harmful than it was. The statement, later corrected, said ASU
trailed by six points, not four, when Forehan-Kelly made the free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he doesn't believe the mistake cost ASU the game _
the Sun Devils blew an eight-point lead and had 27 turnovers _
``but we had no chance to win'' after it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   During the weekend, Stanford and Cal took a combined 67 free
throws to 19 for ASU. This isn't the first time for such a
disparity, and Evans is frustrated. &QL;

LONGLEY DOES HIS JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Suns are paying 7-foot-2 center Luc Longley an
average of $5.5 million per year over six years to give them a
presence against the Shaquille O'Neals of the world.
</P>
<P>
   He did just that Monday night in the Suns' 97-91 loss to the Los
Angeles Lakers before a sellout crowd that displayed all the
excitement one sees at the grand opening of a pack of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Longley scored a season high 16 points and
corralled eight rebounds, while O'Neal scored 25 points and had
nine boards.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line? O'Neal won the battle and his team the game.
But the point could be made that Longley at least gained a push in
the personal war, because O'Neal wasn't the reason the Suns lost.
</P>
<P>
   The reason pretty much stemmed from getting good looks and the
shots they wanted down the stretch, while displaying an inability
to put the ball in the hole _ or a good-size swimming pool _ at
crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the breaks of the game,'' Longley said. ``It was a fun
game, and we had our looks and chances, and we didn't make them. I
don't think you can cry over spilt milk. We had good shots. They
just didn't go down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played good ball, but we didn't seal the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Longley had 14 of his 16 points in the first half, making 6 of
11 shots, and 10 of those points came in a six-minute stint in the
first quarter. But strangely, he played only 14 minutes in the
first half, while exiting the half with six more points than any of
his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, second-guessers questioned whether Coach Danny Ainge
knows how to use a big center, or if the productive presence of
Clifford Robinson makes it difficult to find more court time for
Longley, who entered the game averaging 23.1 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Longley wasn't one to question his limited usage
while on a first-half roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, in this case I was running out of legs, and Danny
recognized it,'' Longley said. ``It was a sensible coaching move, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal scored 11 of his 25 points after intermission, including
five in the decisive fourth quarter, when the Suns for the most
part disdained double-teaming him. Or perhaps he awakened from the
peaceful slumber he had been taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to have more doubling on him, but the trouble
is, it gives them so many other things,'' Longley said. ``We went a
little bit with single coverage tonight, and he's so strong, I
couldn't really handle him very well down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very strong, and we need to give him different looks.
Hey, we'll get another crack at them in a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Ainge was pleased with the work and the defense the
Suns got from Longley against O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I though he played real good and did a good job on Shaq, plus
he did a good job offensively for us,'' Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Longley has a history of playing well against
O'Neal. Last season with Chicago, he averaged 16.5 points and five
boards a game against the Lakers. &QL;

GM SAYS COYOTES DON'T NEED TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Coyotes can quit wandering the streets and peeking
into phone booths searching for help.
</P>
<P>
   If they're going to get out of the fix they're in _ eight losses
in their past nine games _ they'll have to untie the ropes
themselves and battle the bad guys on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be waiting every day to see if some Superman is going
to come, because Superman ain't coming,'' Coyotes captain Keith
Tkachuk said. ``We've got a good team here. If they want to add
something, great. Until then, I don't want to hear about it, and I
don't want to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Colorado Avalanche acquired All-Star sniper Theo
Fleury from the Calgary Flames, Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith
said his team will probably have to make do with what it has. And
he thinks the Coyotes (30-20-10) are more than qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen very few examples of teams that have added a
player in March that have put them over the top,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith won't necessarily be sitting on his hands as the
NHL's March 23 trading deadline approaches, don't expect a move of
Fleury-size proportions. Smith won't part with young players such
as Shane Doan, Brad Isbister or Daniel Briere, and he won't shell
out a fortune for veterans such as Adam Oates, Mark Recchi or Adam
Graves.
</P>
<P>
   If the Coyotes make a trade, it likely will be a minor one.
There's also a chance they won't make one at all. That's the
message Smith privately delivered to the team a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get up in the morning looking for the sports page,
wondering if you've got a new teammate,'' Smith said. ``We've got a
good enough team to compete with any team in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The players, at least publicly, seemed to be in agreement as
they prepared for tonight's game against the Boston Bruins, the
final game of a brutal seven-game trip in which they have gone a
miserable 1-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've got a good team here,'' right wing Jim Cummins
said. ``We've won a lot of games this year with the guys right here
in this locker room. I don't think guys are waiting for a trade.
Bobby tried to make sure that's not in anybody's head, and I don't
think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a former player, knows it's not an easy sell. Players
know the value of adding someone such as Fleury. They don't care
how it happens and don't consider what effect it could have on the
organization as a whole. They want to win now, not three, four or
five years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith is also smart enough to know he can't squeeze wine out
of lemons. The Coyotes have a bottom-third payroll of about $24
million. Trading away prospects and young players in a
get-rich-quick scheme isn't going to happen here.
</P>
<P>
   At least not until the Coyotes get their own arena. Which begs
the question: If the Coyotes had traded for Fleury, would he have
helped them get their new 20,000-seat arena built?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're still playing on May 18, I don't think it'll hurt our
arena cause,'' Smith said, referring to the upcoming public
referendum vote on the stadium issue. ``But I don't think we can
hinge everything on the arena here. I've talked to Richard (Burke,
the Coyotes' owner) about our agenda and my mandate, and it's not,
`I don't care about next year or the future, let's win the Stanley
Cup this year.' You want to have a strong franchise.'' &QL;

JOHNSON: SHORTSTOP DECISION WILL BE HIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Los Angeles Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone said _ given how 1998 finished _ the shortstop position was
Mark Grudzielanek's to lose.
</P>
<P>
   That might be the case, but Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said
when the time comes to decide between Grudzielanek and Jose
Vizcaino for good, he will do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it be my decision? Yes, it will be my decision,'' Johnson
said Monday. ``Have I made my decision? Maybe. But there could be a
trade. It wouldn't make sense, to me, if we were going to trade an
infielder or a pitcher ... it would be wrong to say this is my
starting five, and then there's a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin is a little more involved than a lot of general
managers, which is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he talked to Grudzielanek and Vizcaino on Sunday.
And though Grudzielanek is expected to be the shortstop when the
Dodgers open Grapefruit League play Friday against St. Louis,
Malone said the job wasn't awarded to Grudzielanek. Malone said he
was simply stating that Grudzielanek, acquired in a high-profile
trade involving Dodgers prospects, had a better finish to the 1998
season _ partly because he was on the field when the season ended.
Vizcaino missed the last few months due to injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no guarantee,'' Malone said. ``The job will go to who
performs the best. It's going to be an organizational decision.
Everybody will have an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins to sign?: Remember Rick Wilkins? The left-handed hitting
catcher who hit 30 homers and batted .303 for the Chicago Cubs in
1993? Well, expect him to join the minor-league pitchers and
catchers when they report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, who lives in Jacksonville, showed up at an open tryout
at Dodgertown on Monday. And the Dodgers brain trust saw enough to
talk contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a guy like that who has major-league experience,
you have to see what they have left in determination, and by their
will and spirit,'' said assistant to the general manager Bill
Geivett, who oversees player development for the Dodgers. ``They're
going to be judged by how much they want it, and he got in a car at
4 a.m. and drove here for this tryout.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's premature to talk about Wilkins making the
major-league roster, an experienced backup catcher is something the
Dodgers desperately need. Add in his left-handed bat and his
experience, and health might be the only question.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Wilkins, 32, split time with the New York Mets and
Seattle but batted .179 in 24 games. However, he had bone chips
removed from his neck in the fall and appears to be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I remember of him is his 30 bombs,'' Malone said. ``It's
really no risk unless Billy and the other (minor-league personnel)
feel he's not healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's absence getting serious: Closer Jeff Shaw remains at his
Ohio home waiting for his wife, Julie, to give birth to their third
child. While the Dodgers have told him not to report until after
the birth, Johnson said it's close to becoming a serious situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he needs to be here at the end of this week,''
Johnson said. ``I'd like to see him here by this weekend,
especially with games starting up.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson did find a comical side to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she's only eight months pregnant,'' Johnson said. ``If
this is the third child, maybe their calculations are off.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Intrasquad games begin today. The one
notable pitcher to be used is left-hander Greg Cadaret, who Johnson
said will work one inning.... Tom Lasorda is expected to arrive
Thursday... Minor-league pitcher Randy Galvez underwent ``Tommy
John'' surgery Monday in Los Angeles.

ANDERSON SERVES UP FLASHBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Diamondbacks left-hander  &UR; Brian Anderson picked up
where he left off in 1998 during the club's first intrasquad game
of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the starters, he had good control but couldn't keep
the ball in the yard. Newcomer  &UR; Greg Colbrunn sent a solo shot deep
to left field that landed near the top of the grass berm at Tucson
Electric Park.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Anderson tied Colorado's  &UR; Pedro Astacio for the
National League lead in home runs allowed with 39, and 26 of them
were with nobody on base.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flashback, Anderson said he felt good while throwing
two innings in the near record heat that hovered in the mid-80s.
His fastball was buzzing a bit faster than that, Manager  &UR; Buck
 &UR; Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to have more pop to it than last year,'' Showalter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am a little faster,'' he said. ``I did a lot of work
during the off-season. I cut down on the body fat a little and feel
stronger, so hopefully, that will help.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a fastball that Colbrunn hit, Anderson said, but a
change-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was over the plate but down, and he went and got it,''
Anderson said. ``He's a good hitter. He makes good adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Another adjustment that the burly Colbrunn will have to make is
in his handshake as he rounds third base, according to third-base
coach  &UR; Brian Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little weak, but I'm sure it will get better,''
Butterfield said. ``Next time, I want to feel it for a couple of
days.'' &QL; 
Chouinard gone &QL; 
In order to make room for trade acquisition  &UR; Tony Womack on the
40-man roster, the team designated right-handed middle reliever
 &UR; Bobby &UR; Chouinard for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard was claimed off waivers from Milwaukee on June 1, and
he was 0-2 in 26 games, including two starts. If he clears waivers,
the Diamondbacks likely will re-sign him and assign him to Triple-A
Tucson. &QL; 
The first time &QL; 
Right-handers  &UR; Brad Penny and  &UR; John Patterson and left-hander
 &UR; Nick &UR; Bierbrodt, the team's three young pitching phenoms, got their
first work in game conditions in the big league camp.
</P>
<P>
   Penny was the most impressive, throwing two hitless innings,
walking one man and striking out two. Patterson gave up a run on
two hits, walked one and struck out two in two innings. Bierbrodt
wasn't as fortunate, giving up three runs on five hits. All three
runs came on a home run by  &UR; Hanley Frias, who is making a bid for
one of the utility infield spots. &QL; 
Let's play another &QL; 
The second of the team's two intrasquad games will be played at 1
p.m. today at the minor league complex on the north side of Ajo
Way, opposite Tucson Electric Park. The game is open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled starters are right-hander  &UR; Armando Reynoso, a
free-agent signee, and non-roster right-hander  &UR; Dan Carlson, who
pitched for the San Francisco Giants' Triple-A affiliate when it
was in Phoenix. &QL;

BASEBALL OFFICE ACQUIRES GEM IN D-BACKS' NELSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While reading the Diamondbacks notes last week, you may have
noticed the item about Ralph Nelson leaving the club to take a job
with the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Even to the most impassioned Diamondbacks fan, it probably meant
very little. After all, Nelson has never won a Diamondbacks game
with a diving catch or a clutch hit. He's never even worn the
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been one of the most valuable members of the
organization, dating to his hiring two full years before the club's
first regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was one of the half-dozen or so front-office people who
routinely worked 16-hour days and seven days a week in the year
leading to the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a big part of this organization, especially with the
expansion draft,'' Manager Buck Showalter said. ``He's a guy you
can always call on to get something done.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he will become a guy the commissioner's office will count on
to straighten out one of the most glaring problems in the game _
umpiring. It's no secret that umpiring has come under intense
criticism the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Missed calls when it matters most, during postseason, have
resulted in the game being tarnished. Like it or not, baseball
needs to take a more proactive approach with its umpires, and Sandy
Alderson, Commissioner Bud Selig's handpicked man to oversee these
changes, is tackling the issue head-on.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business for Alderson, longtime general
manager of the Oakland Athletics who is generally recognized as one
of the sharpest men in the game, was to go after someone he trusts
and could put in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was his first and only choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major League Baseball and Sandy Alderson's gain is the
Diamondbacks' loss,'' said agent Jeff Moorad, who represents
Diamondbacks Matt Williams and Travis Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you lose an experienced mind like Ralph Nelson's,
it's a loss. I think it's a perfect next step for him to join the
commissioner's office. To have Sandy Alderson reach out for you is
the ultimate compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, Nelson played what can arguably be called the
biggest role in the signing of Lee 2{ years ago. Moorad, who had
never dealt with Jerry Colangelo, didn't have a way to gauge the
seriousness of the team's interest when Lee became a loophole free
agent in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Moorad said he had received one cursory phone call from General
Manager Joe Garagiola Jr., but little else. Lee was close to
signing with either St. Louis or the New York Yankees when Nelson
made a call to Moorad, a longtime friend, who was astonished to
learn how seriously Arizona wanted Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Nelson's involvement turned Lee toward the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office plans to take a season to review
umpires before it takes control over them. Currently, each league
has authority over the umpires in its league. You can bet this will
become a sticky issue at some point. You can also bet that Alderson
did not pick someone incapable of handling such duties.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, whose last day with the Diamondbacks will be Friday, is
a former NCAA basketball official. He has been involved in baseball
for more than 20 years, first spending time with the San Francisco
Giants, rising to assistant general manager under the meticulous
and respected Al Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing where this organization is heading, Nelson leaves
the Diamondbacks with a heavy heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked with some of the best people in the game, and I'm
going to work for one of the very best in Sandy Alderson,'' he
said. ``But there is no one in the game that I admire more than
Buck Showalter, and I mean that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going to work harder when you're working for
people you respect and admire. They make a decision and never look
back. It's not like this everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson and baseball are counting on Nelson taking the same
tack with its umpires _ a decision they never want to look back at.
The bet here is that everyone in baseball will be thanking Nelson
one day. &QL;

PAIN OF FATAL ACCIDENT LINGERS FOR D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Back to business, yes. As usual, no. It couldn't be _
it won't be _ for quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Diamondbacks were still dazed by Sunday's car
crash that killed minor league pitcher Ken Robinson. The driver,
minor league pitcher John Rosengren, was booked into Pima County
Jail on second-degree murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see the guys out there, but it's not going to
take the pain away,'' said Tommy Jones, the Diamondbacks' director
of minor league operations, who was watching the big club's first
intrasquad game of the spring at Tucson Electric Park.
</P>
<P>
   A large banner, with white letters on a black backdrop, hung
over the top of the right-field fence and served as a stark
reminder: DRIVING DRUNK WILL PUT YOUR LIGHTS OUT.
</P>
<P>
   Officers investigating the one-vehicle rollover on the city's
northwest side said Rosengren displayed symptoms of alcohol
impairment. A blood sample was taken, but the results won't be
available for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren was released on a $75,000 bond Sunday night, checked
out of the Diamondbacks' minor league hotel and was with his
parents in the Tucson area Monday. He is not allowed to leave Pima
County. His next court appearance will be March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks officials said an autopsy for Robinson is scheduled
for Monday. Robinson was pronounced dead at the accident scene.
Investigators said Robinson suffered severe head trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials said funeral services likely will be held later
this week in Jacksonville, Fla., where Robinson lived with his wife
and 1-year-old son. Mel Didier, special assistant to Diamondbacks
General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr., is expected to represent the
club at the services. Garagiola is in Korea on team business.
</P>
<P>
   The accident brought flashbacks to team President Rich Dozer,
who, shortly after graduating from the University of Arizona in
1979, rolled his truck about five times after he fell asleep at the
wheel on Interstate 10 between Tucson and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cab was crushed, and it took several semi-truck drivers to
lift the truck up so I could get out,'' Dozer said. ``I still don't
see how I survived. I was lucky, very lucky, but these two guys
weren't. It's devastating. Our hearts go out to both families, in
particular the Robinson family.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozer said the club has not suspended Rosengren ``because we
don't know all the facts. He wants to try to take a step back and
get his life in order as best he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Clint Sodowsky wants to help Rosengren. The two were
teammates in the Detroit Tigers' minor league system in 1994 and
1995, and after the 1995 season, they played together in the
Arizona Fall League. They lived in the same apartment complex, and
Sodowsky often drove Rosengren to the park because Rosengren didn't
have a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be judgmental would be very hypocritical for most of us
here. We've all made mistakes,'' Sodowsky said. ``You ache for
Kenny's family, but Rosey needs support, too. I'd like to visit
him, but it probably would be kind of awkward. I'm sure he's
confused and scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know his parents. He's intelligent, very smart. On the
field, he had good stuff, especially for a lefty. He just needed a
little more control. He was working very hard on that. All he
wanted was to pitch in the big leagues, and he was very hard on
himself, as I'm sure he's being very hard on himself right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball has a substance-abuse policy for its
players, but it is not made public under the collective bargaining
agreement. The Diamondbacks have a separate policy and program for
its minor leaguers, coaches and non-field staff. Club attorneys
would not released details, citing confidentiality, but Dozer said
it is wide-ranging and covers many health issues.
</P>
<P>
   The club has a team support coordinator, John Michael, who meets
with players throughout the minor league system each spring and
during the season. He also assists the major leaguers and attends
most home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important,'' Michael said. ``I'm on call 24 hours a
day and usually will go to where the situation calls for me to be.
And if I can't get there, I have a referral list of contacts in the
particular areas.'' &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ If baseball's regular season were cut in half,
Mike Hampton probably would have a Cy Young Award hanging on his
wall.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1997, Hampton won a major-league-best 11 games and had a
sterling 2.53 ERA after the All-Star break. Last season, he won his
first four starts and had seven victories by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the season always seems to get in Hampton's
way. But after seeing how both halves live over two straight
seasons, Hampton believes he has found a solution to putting a
complete year together.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, you tend to go through lapses that last two,
three or four starts,'' the 26-year-old Astros lefthander said.
``Hopefully, I've learned enough so that won't happen again. It's a
big key for me to not only put a full year of consistency together
but to also do it throughout my career. I've been getting better,
and it's time for me to take that next step, take my game to the
next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton enters this spring as the No. 2 starter in the Astros'
rotation behind Shane Reynolds. A control pitcher who doesn't
overpower hitters, Hampton has won at least 10 games in each of the
past three seasons, cramming a majority of the success into one
half or the other. Astros management believes he's capable of
delivering 15 to 17 victories annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been ups and downs,'' manager Larry Dierker said.
``Just like the stock market, there are going to be some down days,
but generally it's been going up the last few years. That's the way
Mike's progress has been, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Not before he took a plunge. Hampton felt like things couldn't
get any worse during the first half of the 1997 season, when he
started 4-7 and his ERA skyrocketed to 5.19. The front office
considered demoting him to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the toughest year I've ever had in baseball,''
Hampton said. ``The first 2{ months I was miserable, and I learned
quite a bit about myself. You start questioning yourself: `Man,
have I lost it? Where's it at?' I think the biggest thing is not to
get out of your game for one minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton proceeded to reel off a career-best seven-game winning
streak that included two shutouts. He went 11-3 following the '97
All-Star break and finished with 15 victories, the most by an
Astros lefthander since Jim Deshaies won 15 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The success continued at the beginning of last season, when
Hampton became the National League's first five-game winner and
went 7-2 through May.
</P>
<P>
   But a strained left groin in mid-June forced Hampton to go on
the 15-day disabled list, and things were never the same. Battling
control problems, he went 3-3 over his final 16 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really knocked his season,'' Dierker said. ``Control is
the key to his success. He has plenty of good pitches, but he
doesn't have any one pitch that just absolutely overpowers hitters.
He relies on control, and when you sit out two or three weeks, it's
hard to fine-tune things.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Hampton has drawn comparisons to Atlanta
lefthander Tom Glavine, who earned his second NL Cy Young Award
last year. Neither has overpowering stuff, with their fastballs
ranging between 86 and 90 mph. They rely on an array of off-speed
pitches to coax batters into ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got at least as good of stuff as Tom Glavine, if not
better,'' Dierker said. ``Which isn't too bad since Glavine won the
Cy Young.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the past two seasons when Hampton worked with veteran
catcher Brad Ausmus, he will have to make adjustments this year
with rookie Mitch Meluskey projected to see a considerable amount
of playing time. Hampton has already begun discussing strategy with
Meluskey this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some adjusting on my part and a lot of
adjustment on his part being in the big leagues,'' Hampton said.
``With Brad out there last year, it took a lot of the equation out
of it, a lot of the thinking process. We worked so well together.
Very rarely did I ever have to shake (off pitches), because we were
thinking so much alike. It's tough to replace that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, however, insists the change may have a positive effect
on the entire pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brad was like having a Linus blanket something that makes you
feel comfortable,'' Dierker said. ``Now, they have to evaluate what
they are doing and why, rather than depend on somebody else to do
it. That could really turn out to make him (Hampton) even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hampton: ``The ultimate decision comes down to me making
the pitch, and it's the pitch I want to throw. If I give up a home
run or make a mistake with that pitch, who's to blame? There's no
one else to look at but myself.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IN the three weeks that passed between encounters by the Rockets
and Lakers at the star-studded Forum, much had transpired. Not the
least of which was the Rockets' having run up enough frequent-flier
miles to earn them all free round trips to Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, that's the neighborhood where the Lakers had
gone to shop for a new power forward and stabilizing influence for
their fractured team.
</P>
<P>
   Word has it that with Dennis Rodman on board, the Lakers' locker
room will now have a cover charge and two-drink minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful what you wish for.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still not a championship team,'' Charles Barkley said
Sunday after the Lakers hung a Rodman tattoo of 106-90 on the
Rockets. ``They're not the next great thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you tell? Well, for one thing, their record (10-6) is
about the same as ours (8-6).''
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: Which team do you like better?
</P>
<P>
   Utah, of course. Trick answer.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to say the Rockets should be all that unhappy
with their current standing in the middle of the Western Conference
pack.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that they have now weathered the most difficult stretch
of this compressed schedule _ nine games in 13 days, seven cities,
three time zones and two countries _ with a respectable, if not
fearsome, 4-5 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that it's going to get a whole lot better the rest of the
way, but I'm sure glad that's over,'' said coach Rudy Tomjanovich.
``We saw some good things and went through some tough stretches. I
can't say that I'm worried or disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because nearly a month into the season, the Rockets are
still fitting all of their parts together like one of those jigsaw
puzzles with 1,000 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley returned to the lineup in LA after having arthroscopic
surgery on his left knee and played like a man who had been off for
two weeks. He labored to get up and down the floor. He did not have
explosiveness in his legs. He missed layups. But give him a couple
of games on a healthy knee to knock the rust off, and the 15
rebounds and 15 or so points a game will return.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Carr, the Big Dawg, also made his belated season debut,
increasing the barnyard element on the Rockets' bench, which
already boasted a Pig (Miller) and a Cat (Cuttino Mobley). The
coming weeks should also see the return of Rodrick Rhodes and
Stanley Roberts, and only then will we see the real team the
Rockets have assembled to make their playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said all along that this was a group that wouldn't
produce our best results until May,'' said Rudy T. ``Even if we
hadn't had all of the injuries, this was going to be a slow
building process because of all the new faces and the lack of
training camp and practice time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see things that I like. But for the most part, they come in
brief flashes. Our guys are still settling in and learning each
other. They have the basics down but not the little things like the
exact comfort zones where different guys like to get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the Rockets could be like tonight's opponent,
their Lone Star cousin Spurs, who are currently dead in the water
at 6-8 with no excuses of significant core changes or injuries to
fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a nagging aspect to the Rockets so far, it is this
troubling habit of too many of their guns constantly deferring to
each other on offense. It is, at times, like watching a bad comedy
skit in which the characters constantly bow and say, ``After you.
No, after you.''
</P>
<P>
   You expect such behavior from rookies. But the truth is that
Mobley, Bryce Drew and Michael Dickerson have not often been shy
about shooting.
</P>
<P>
   It is Hakeem Olajuwon who needs to force himself more often into
his old rhythms. Of spinning this way and that way, of going from
the jump hook in the lane to the Dream Shake on the baseline, of
using one move to set up the next move and getting on rolls that
force the defense to adjust and then open up avenues for his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   It is Scottie Pippen who must stop constantly telling us and
himself that he's no longer playing the triangle offense of the
Bulls. We know the offense is different. Now, go find your spots
and attack them aggressively. Finish off plays. Make layups. Don't
whine. Pippen said Barkley embarrassed himself Sunday, but it is
Scottie who is a tentative 10-for-36 vs. the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, what we know about the Rockets now is what we knew
when the season started Feb. 5. They are a work in progress, still
full of more potential than results.

DAILY NEWS PRINTS PORTIONS OF ABC'S INTERVIEW WITH MS. LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - In a move that compromises the exclusivity of what is
expected to be the biggest television interview of the year, The
Daily News on Tuesday printed large portions of ABC's highly
anticipated interview with Monica Lewinsky, which is scheduled to
be broadcast on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The interview, conducted last month by Barbara Walters, has been
of enormous importance to ABC, which expanded its regular news
program ``20/20'' to two hours from one hour and sold commercials
in the program for as much as $800,000, a figure unmatched for
anything on television but the Super Bowl and the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News acquired a one-hour audio tape of Ms. Walters'
interview with Ms. Lewinsky on Monday through an anonymous source.
It was delivered to Eric Mink, the television writer for the News,
who sought and received confirmation from an ABC news executive
that the tape was authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Mink said on Monday night that the tape did not come though the
mail but was delivered to his desk. It was accompanied by only a
brief printed message describing the tape as the first hour of the
Lewinsky interview.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Murphy, the spokeswoman for ABC News, said on Monday
night that she had confirmed to Mink that the tape did contain
authentic portions of Ms. Walters's interview with Ms. Lewinsky.
She said the tape was ``an unedited portion of the interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murphy would not speculate on how The Daily News might have
acquired the tape. But ABC executives acknowledged on Monday night
that the company has had recent problems with union members. Last
Friday, ABC unilaterally implemented terms of a new contract that
affected union members, including engineers who work in the news
division. That action was bitterly opposed by union members.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murphy did say that lawyers for ABC informed The Daily News
that the paper `'was publishing portions of our interview at legal
risk.'' Ms. Murphy said ABC's lawyers told The News it was
potentially violating copyright laws by publishing material owned
by and under copyright to ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Mink said that lawyers for The Daily News were ``involved all
day in the process'' of writing and editing the story about the
interview, which Mink co-wrote with another Daily News reporter,
Helen Kennedy. The story was not accompanied by a transcript of the
tape, Mink said.
</P>
<P>
   Mink acknowledged that ABC had expressed its unhappiness about
the newspaper's plans to print a story based on the tape, but he
added, ``I don't believe ABC is really concerned. All this does is
create more publicity for their interview. Most of this story has
already been heard anyway, in front of the grand jury.''

LAKERS BEAT SUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ If it takes a village to rear a child, it apparently
takes a few village elders to rear a team of them.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Rambis has the Los Angeles Lakers' head-coach title now,
but he's polling the village for help with his young team, and the
elders delivered both wisdom and points down the stretch Monday to
pace the Lakers' hard-fought 97-91 victory over the Phoenix Suns at
America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven-year-old Derek Harper was buzzing in one ear,
38-year-old Dennis Rodman in the other, and the result was the
Lakers' fourth straight win and third under Rambis' village
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Harper? He called his own play, then hit the 3-pointer that gave
the Lakers the lead for good with 1:08 remaining. Rodman? He was,
get this, telling Rambis when to make !ital!defensive
substitutions!off! in the waning seconds of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis, only a few years older than either of them, listened and
won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just telling him, in certain situations you put
defensive players in, you put offensive players in,'' Rodman said,
``and we did that down the stretch. He's a young coach and I don't
think he thinks on that level yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis is thankful he has coach Worm to turn to.
</P>
<P>
   And when Rodman wasn't directing, he was collecting a
season-high 16 rebounds and seven points, including his first three
field goals of the season. And when crunch time came, the Lakers
down by seven to open the fourth quarter, Rodman was at his best,
delivering six rebounds and five points in the final frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is he a great defensive player and an unbelievable
rebounder,'' Rambis said, ``but I'll tell you what, that guy knows
more about basketball than probably about 99.9 percent of the
people on the planet. He just understands the game. He's always
thinking out there. I'm so happy the Lakers got him on this
ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Lakers are undefeated to date in the post-Del Harris
era and have beaten back-to-back playoff contenders, this was in
most respects not a game for the archives.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers committed 19 turnovers and through three quarters had
shot 42.9 percent _ with Kobe Bryant, Eddie Jones and Rick Fox
combining to go 8 for 28.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Luc Longley _ Luc Longley _ went for a season-high 16
points on them, and Tom Gugliotta gave the Lakers a 20-point,
nine-rebound reminder why they wanted him for their own.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers' own offensive juggernaut had come to a crawl
with a 16-point third quarter that tied their lowest-scoring period
this season. They bounced back with a 36-point fourth quarter _
their highest-scoring of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But it started with defense, usually Rodman's.
</P>
<P>
   And it ended, effectively, with Harper's called shot. The ball
went inside to Shaquille O'Neal, who dished back out to Harper for
the 3-pointer that gave the Lakers the 87-85 edge, just as Harper
scripted it to Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident that I could knock it down, so it worked
out,'' said Harper, who hit 7 of 9, with four 3-pointers, for 18
points.
</P>
<P>
   As for the coaching double-team Rodman and Rambis provided? ``I
think this team was lacking stability,'' Harper said, ``and by
adding the two of us, it definitely helps our team.''
</P>
<P>
   They were steady down the stretch. Rodman provided a free throw
after getting fouled on a defensive rebound. O'Neal grabbed a
defensive board for a long pass to Fox for an easy layup. O'Neal
snatched a loose ball from Jason Kidd and drew another foul and a
free throw. Overall, the kind of night when it was apparent both
teams had played 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a grind-out game,'' Rambis said. ``I thought our team
was tired, their team was tired. Nobody's going to videotape that
(as a) game on how to play beautiful basketball. The guys did what
they had to do late in the game to win.''

BRYANT CREDITS RAMBIS FOR TURNAROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Everyone has a theory on the Los Angeles Lakers'
one-week turnaround, from a team losing three straight to a team
winning four in a row: Dennis Rodman's arrival. The removal of
coach Del Harris. The team meeting after the loss at Vancouver.
Maybe all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   But Kobe Bryant said the key element in the turnaround is new
coach Kurt Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what to do now,'' Bryant said. ``Rambis is very big on
roles.... Everybody has particular roles that were unclear
before.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's referring not just to the interaction among the
starting five but every player, one through 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``From top to bottom, I think everybody is a little more
comfortable,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rambis said he and his coaches haven't really
changed anything, though it seems the messages are getting through
with more regularity now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not telling them anything different now, really, than
what they were hearing before,'' he said. ``And I still think it
was an untimely firing of Del.... It was starting to turn the
corner (during the Vancouver game).... You just gotta believe that
with Dennis coming, things would have turned around for the better,
just like they have now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant firmly believes the coaching change, as much as
Rodman's arrival, did the trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a load taken off our shoulders, because of the
situation we were in. It was a very tentative situation with Del,
we all knew that,'' he said. ``You bring Dennis in here, Del moves
on with his career, it was just, whew. It just lifted a weight off
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Case closed: Rodman was fined an undisclosed sum for arriving 30
minutes late to Saturday's practice, Rambis said, and he hopes
that's the final word on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   At least, of course, until Rodman's next infraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was late for practice, he was fined accordingly, and that's
just the end of it as far as I'm concerned,'' Rambis said testily.
``Everything is fine. We handle those situations internally.... To
me it's just a nonissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Dribbles: Rambis said he hasn't spoken with Harris since he was
fired last week. The two spoke briefly at the time, but a couple of
phone calls to Harris have so far gone unreturned. ``I just wanted
to say a few things to him,'' Rambis said. ``I know it was hard for
him to get fired.... Cotton Fitzsimmons told me a long time ago,
coaches are hired to be fired. So I'm the next Laker coach to get
fired.'' ... Robert Horry, once a starter but now backing up both
forward positions, played just three minutes, his lowest of the
season in a game for which he's been healthy. Corie Blount, who had
been averaging 12 minutes, has gone two games without playing....
The Suns are 8-6 but have yet to beat a team with a winning record
this season.... Lakers backup center Elden Campbell has the flu and
did not travel with the team.

FATE AND A FASTBALL: LOSING DAD LET MESA FIND BIG LEAGUE CALLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Jose Mesa, No. 49 on your Mariners scorecard, is
not sure what number he is on his father's family roster. He might
be the 19th of Narciso Mesa's 25 children. He could be No. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa knows he's the 12th of 15 children his father had with his
mother. He also knows that the only reason he's in America, earning
millions of dollars to pitch the last inning of close baseball
games, is because his father died when Mesa was a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' Mesa said. ``Maybe when I was an old man,
like 20-some years old, I would have started playing, but I would
have been too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard thing that he died, because I had to start
working when I was 9 years old to support my younger three
brothers. But I guess God wanted him to die, because he wanted me
to play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Narciso was physically imposing, just as Jose would become. At
6-foot-3 and at least 200 pounds, he was, in Jose's words, ``a
strong dude.'' He never played baseball, but he'd seen many
Dominican youths become injured doing so. For a man who made a
living through physical labor as a farmer, this was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But the game was alluring to Jose. He and his brothers would tie
up socks and sneak into the streets to play ball. The consequences
were grave if Narciso found out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime that he found me playing baseball, I've got to run or
he'll grab whatever he can grab and whip my ass with it,'' Mesa
said. ``I got to run when I see him coming. I was scared.''
</P>
<P>
   When a stroke killed Narciso at age 44 in 1976, Jose took his
place in the fields, working with the cows, mules and horses,
harvesting the watermelons, bananas and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   At idle moments, he would pick up rocks and hurl them at mango
or coconut trees in the distance. He was keeping his arm limber,
because he finally was free to play ball.
</P>
<P>
   One day, when Mesa was 15, a cousin came roaring by his house on
a motorcycle. It was midday, and Mesa, who had been working in the
fields at dawn, was taking a nap. The cousin told him a scout from
the Toronto Blue Jays wanted to see him, and he'd better hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa threw on his uniform _ he didn't take a shower _ and rushed
to meet the scout, Epy Guerrero, who had a contract ready for
another player. One look at Mesa's arm, and Guerrero forgot the
other guy.
</P>
<P>
   On Halloween in 1981, Mesa began his professional career. The
really scary stuff would happen 16 years later.
</P>
<P>
   MAN ON A MISSION
</P>
<P>
   The man the Mariners signed as their closer was not a closer
last year. He has not been a closer since failing to save the
biggest game of all, Game 7 of the 1997 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners tried to re-sign Mike Timlin, but were shocked when
Baltimore offered him four years and $16 million. So they turned to
Mesa, offering a two-year deal for $6.45 million, with an option
for a third year. Mesa had a three-year offer from his last team,
the San Francisco Giants, but that was to be a setup man.
</P>
<P>
   Believing he has plenty of good years left as a closer, the
32-year-old Mesa chose Seattle. He has lost a mile or two off his
fastball, thrown regularly at 96 mph while saving 46 of 48 games
for the Cleveland Indians in 1995, but he's impressed the M's so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa pumped heat to David Segui in batting practice Monday, and
pitch after pitch, Segui nodded or barked out in approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to be just a straight power pitcher, but he's learned
to move the ball now,'' said Segui, who has known Mesa since their
days as minor leaguers in the Orioles' system. ``The thing that
impresses me most is he's not scared on the mound. He's not
intimidated, he's going to come after you. That's what you want in
a closer. He has a good arm, and he's not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says Mesa must be a wreck after what he has
gone through since December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In order, Mesa has been tried and acquitted on rape charges,
closed out the Indians' AL pennant, blown the save in the last game
of the World Series, lost his closer's job, gotten booed out of
town by Cleveland fans and been traded.
</P>
<P>
   But a crisis of confidence? Not so, said Indians bullpen coach
Luis Isaac.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mental toughness is still there,'' Isaac said. ``I know
him. Sometimes you need a new place, and I think this is going to
be a great place for him. Knowing Jose the way I know him, for him
it's going to be a mission to prove to everyone he still can be a
premier closer in baseball. I think the Seattle Mariners are going
to get the benefit of that.''
</P>
<P>
   NOW, IT'S FAMILY FIRST
</P>
<P>
   Mesa brushes off the confidence question. He is comforted by his
faith _ his knowledge _ that everything happens for a reason. He
uses an analogy of a flat tire. You might think a flat tire is a
bad thing, he said, but how do you know it didn't save you from a
horrible accident just down the road?
</P>
<P>
   As it is with his father's death, Mesa believes his personal and
professional trials in Cleveland the last two years were part of a
larger plan.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, Mesa was found not guilty of charges of rape,
felonious assault, theft and two counts of gross sexual imposition.
He faced up to 20 years in prison and wept in the courtroom after
the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa believes he was set up, and that the circumstances could
have happened to anyone. But he also believes God was telling him
something. The man who grew up surrounded by family needed to focus
on his wife and five children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've changed a lot of things, off the field and everywhere,''
Mesa said. ``You've got to change from that situation. ... You've
got to think about it and think about your family. They're the most
important thing in my life. Anytime that you think you're going to
be away from your family for a long time and stay somewhere else,
it's tough to think like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa still owns a home in Cleveland, but he's trying to sell it.
He hopes to buy a home in Florida, and dreams of his 13-year-old
son, Juan Jose, getting a scholarship someday to the University of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa also has a home in the Dominican, and chose to spend the
whole winter there for the first time in years. He decided not to
play winter ball, and engrossed himself in the lives of his
children. It was, Mesa said, the best time of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He would take his kids with him every morning to an Olympic
sports facility in the Dominican, with six baseball fields, a
track, basketball and volleyball courts to keep them busy while
Jose and a brother worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks into spring training, he said he misses his kids ``so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime that you can spend time with your family every day,''
Mesa said, ``those are the good times that you never regret.''
</P>
<P>
   LOST JOB, NEW HOME
</P>
<P>
   It was Game 7 of the '97 World Series, and Mesa, warming in the
bullpen to hold the Indians' 2-1 lead, never looked better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the same guy that saved 46 games in 1995,''
Isaac said. ``Oh, my God. He was throwing 95-96 (mph), good slider
and two-seamer, his sinker was real good. Something happened
between the bullpen and the mound that I couldn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa allowed a leadoff single, recorded a strikeout, then gave
up another single and a sacrifice fly that tied the game. Both hits
came off the slider, which is not Mesa's best pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your best pitch is your fastball,'' he said, ``that's
what you've got to die with.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans cheered Mesa at the airport, but he skipped the downtown
rally for the AL champs, wanting only to stay in the house.
</P>
<P>
   He thought things would be fine in spring training, when Indians
manager Mike Hargrove assured him the closer's job was his. But on
opening night, against the M's at the Kingdome, Hargrove called him
into his office. Mesa thought he'd been traded, but the news was
worse. Mike Jackson was named closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're used to being a closer and then you lose it and you
stay with the same team, that makes it tougher on you and makes it
harder on your head,'' Mesa said. ``Every time it's the ninth
inning, you know that's your situation and you're not there.''
</P>
<P>
   He was shaky early, then dismal as the season wore on. His
earned run average at Jacobs Field was 7.16, more than four runs
worse than at all other ballparks. Fans booed him incessantly, and
while Mesa downplayed their impact, teammates knew better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're human, it has to bother you,'' said Mariners
infielder David Bell, who spent most of last year with Cleveland.
``... He couldn't do anything (without a reaction), and it's a long
run from the bullpen to the mound with a sold-out crowd so loud and
abusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa said he has no doubt he would still be with Cleveland had
he gotten two more outs that muggy Miami night. But everything
happens for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what keeps me going,'' Mesa said. ``Maybe God wanted me
to go over here, go in against the Cleveland Indians and clinch the
division, maybe go to the World Series and win it with the Seattle
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know. Maybe he didn't want me to win with the
Cleveland Indians. That's what happened. God can provide that.''

BLOATED IOC DUE FOR A SLICE OF HUMBLE PIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ I have no firsthand knowledge of the tawdry bribes
that have plunged the entire Olympic movement into a state of gross
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   If Salt Lake tucked $1.2 million in free plane tickets, ski
vacations and surgical procedures into the pockets of IOC members
and if geishas and antique swords were being doled out in Nagano, I
did not see it.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the Olympics are a public trust, if the Olympics
truly do belong to everyone, I suppose that is why I felt slightly
envious of the lush amenities provided to IOC officials last
February during the 1998 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   While athletes and, yes, lowly journalists were housed in Nagano
apartments with sleeping quarters roughly the size of dog kennels _
albeit exceptionally clean kennels _ the IOC royalty got its usual
first-class suites, gourmet dinners and goodness knows what else.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, I now admit, I walked through the cold streets of
Nagano one night in search of the Kokusai Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Olympics writer Mark Starr of Newsweek, had told me
about the four-star French restaurant housed at the hotel and how
IOC officials were feasting on haute cuisine nightly. After a week
of soba noodles and broiled salmon heads, news like this made me
shudder.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with my Post-Intelligencer American Express card, I was
determined to have a dinner fitting of an IOC member.
</P>
<P>
   The Kokusai was exactly what you would expect. Lots of granite
and marble. Lots of security. Lots of European, African, Asian and
North American Olympic ``family'' members roaming around in
expensive ski jackets and fur coats.
</P>
<P>
   It took no time to determine that the four-star French
restaurant in question was off-limits to anyone who did not rub
elbows directly with Samaranch. I then found myself at the entrance
of the Kokusai's quietly elegant Chinese restaurant, where I
smilingly weaseled my way in for one very sumptuous meal.
</P>
<P>
   I remember feeling not the least bit guilty about my fellow
journalists back at the Main Press Center who were slogging through
another bowl of miso ramen. It was then that I realized I had the
constitutional makeup of an IOC member.
</P>
<P>
   What do fine dinners and luxury hotels have to do with the
Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   That is a very good question, just as it is a good question as
to what free college tuition, Super Bowl parties and profitable
land deals have to do with a city's ability to put on the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has to answer these questions once and for all, or risk
losing its remaining integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, the foxes still are guarding the Olympic hen house.
But Monday, a ray of hope shone on the shamed Olympic movement. A
commission headed by former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
said reform was needed. The IOC will meet March 17 in Switzerland,
where the Olympic organization is expected to deal with its mess.
</P>
<P>
   They had better make it good. And fast.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, with its quaint and quirky sense of self _ I mean it
as a compliment _ there is no issue about what ethical and
practical reforms the IOC and U.S. Olympic Committee must make.
</P>
<P>
   In December, just before the Salt Lake bombshell hit, Seattle
begged out of the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Games, citing
a giant case of Not in My Backyard _ and I mean it as a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is something inherently wonderful about an
Olympics. Despite the daunting task of putting one on, the
monumental effort and risks involved, there is little doubt that
the Olympics is an undertaking many American cities/regions still
eagerly desire.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, I talked with organizers from four of the eight U.S.
cities bidding to host the 2012 Olympics. All agreed that nothing
but good will come out of this round of tawdry revelations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the games still valuable? No question,'' said Nick Vehr,
president of Cincinnati 2012 Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was anybody who wasn't aware of the
high-level entertainment involved in bidding for an Olympics, but
very few were aware of the other inappropriate activity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad the system for hosting something as valued as the
Olympics has eroded. But our view is ... the outcome of this
process will be that cities are awarded the Olympics on a level
playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Bay Area bid coordinator Susan Loder had a
suggestion: ``We hope that in the future the cities that are
selected are done so in a completely objective fashion. It should
almost be like an SAT test,'' Loder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a list of 100 categories and you get 50 points
per category if your city fulfills that requirement. If you have
more hotel rooms than required, your city would get an extra 10
points and so on. Then cities will know exactly how they stack
up.''
</P>
<P>
   With reform suggestions like that, it is more than time to send
the IOC foxes back to their rooms ... with no dinner or geishas or
swords or land deals.

NORTHRIDGE REINSTATES MINOR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Junior guard Greg Minor was reinstated to the Cal
State Northridge men's basketball team Monday after meeting with
the team and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Minor will travel with the team to the Big Sky Conference
Tournament, which starts Thursday night at Ogden, Utah.
Fourth-seeded CSUN (17-11) plays fifth-seeded Montana State (15-12)
at 8:15 p.m. PST.
</P>
<P>
   Rico Harris, who was suspended along with Minor last week for
what CSUN head coach Bobby Braswell termed ``conduct detrimental to
the team,'' did not meet with the team and coaches Monday evening
and remains under suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Minor, who played at Canyon High, had been a key for the
Matadors off the bench the week prior to his suspension. He
averaged 14 points in two games _ a loss to Montana and a win over
Montana State.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Minor had become a steady influence for the
Matadors when he substituted for Markus Carr at point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a 6-foot-9, 250-pound junior forward, has been up and
down this season. He came in as a heralded transfer from L.A. City
College who declared for last year's NBA Draft, then withdrew his
name. He missed six games in December and January with injuries,
came back as a starter, then was benched after a few lackluster
efforts in early February.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions were the first of the season for CSUN. Braswell
suspended five players last year.
</P>
<P>
   Montana State head coach Mick Durham said he agreed with
Braswell's decision to suspend players this late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Braswell's) 100 percent right,'' Durham said. ``If we
have guys who mess up we'll sit them. I don't think in this day and
age we can let the players run the program.''

SONICS NEED MOOCHIE NORRIS TO STEP IT UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the Sonics published their media guides last
week, backup point guard Moochie Norris was noticeably absent from
the player profiles. Because of deadlines during training camp, the
team did not include unproven free agents.
</P>
<P>
   While Norris might have since solidified his place on the roster
_ profile or not _ he still is struggling to prove himself. Norris
is no longer living the rush of a dazzling training camp and his
3-point barrage that leveled Portland in the Sonics' home opener.
</P>
<P>
   That was 10 games ago, and one has to wonder what Norris has
done for his confidence lately.
</P>
<P>
   For the Sonics, Norris' so-so statistics through 12 games might
have been expected. He is still very much a rookie trying to adjust
to the NBA game. However, his 3.2 points, two assists and 32
percent shooting in 12 minutes might signal trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The team is approaching the part of the abbreviated schedule
when it is going to need Norris to step up. The Sonics play 17
games in March, including two sets of three-games-in-three-nights.
</P>
<P>
   Coming are stretches where Sonics coach Paul Westphal will
reluctantly have to rest Gary Payton. The All-Star point guard is
averaging 40 minutes a game _ two minutes more than he played last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's iron-man performances can be traced to two things: He
has more fire than any of his teammates, and the ineffectiveness of
Norris.
</P>
<P>
   That Norris is not a threat on the perimeter is perhaps his
biggest problem. He handles the ball well, and finds teammates, but
opponents are backing off his dribble, daring Norris to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   When Norris does drives the lane, he rarely finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Norris has missed 23 of 31 shots since his 4-for-4 3-point
outburst Feb. 7 against Portland. He's shooting 25 percent over the
past 10 games and has made one 3-pointer in his past eight
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   During last week's loss at Houston, Payton insisted to coach
Paul Westphal that Norris come out of the game late in the fourth
quarter. At practice two days later, Norris heard Westphal bellow,
``You've got to take that shot or I can't play you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics continue to do their part for Norris by imparting
confidence through his meaty role. Now, Norris has to perform.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JUST ASKING
</P>
<P>

</P>

   JUST COUNTING
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With all of the attention given to Vin Baker's free throw
shooting, the efforts of center Olden Polynice have gone unnoticed.
Polynice is shooting 31 percent from the line, hitting 7 of his 22
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Polynice will donate $25,000 to charity if he doesn't
shoot 75 percent from the line this season. Who does he make that
check out to?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are 8-0 when holding opponents under 100 points. But
they are 0-2 when opponents reach the century mark. The Sonics also
are undefeated on Thursdays. However, that doesn't necessarily mean
trouble for the Phoenix Suns, who arrive at KeyArena on Thursday.
The Sonics have yet to play on that day this season.
</P>

   Baker on breaking out his slump: ``I leave the house every day
thinking that this is the day.''
</P>
<P>
   That's better than Dr. Joyce Brothers' advice. She suggested
Baker take a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AND FINALLY
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Perception: Dale Ellis was just 3 of 8 from the field,
missing all five of his 3-pointers at the Alamodome last week. He
almost air-balled a free throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened there,'' he said. ``But this is
really a difficult place to shoot in. The background perception is
ridiculous for basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dish: Ellis didn't have much trouble with the rims during
his two years (1992-94) with San Antonio where he hit 49.9 and 49.4
percent of his shots.

BAKER FINDS HIS GROOVE, LIFTING SONICS PAST KINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Vin Baker finally broke the shackles of hapless
play, Gary Payton manufactured a triple-double and the Sonics
finally shot 50 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   It took all of that and a late defensive surge, but the Sonics
finally escaped ARCO Arena with a 105-102 victory over the
Sacramento Kings Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 60-47 at halftime, the Sonics (9-4) stormed back to win
their second straight game. They also snapped a three-game road
losing streak and avenged a 109-106 overtime loss to the Kings on
Feb. 17 at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who showed signs of breaking out of his funk in last
Friday's 92-82 home win against San Antonio, made sure this night
against the Kings would be different.
</P>
<P>
   He scored a season-high 31 points on 15-for-19 shooting. Baker's
last was a 20-footer at the top of the key with 26.7 seconds left.
The basket put the Sonics ahead 100-96.
</P>
<P>
   It should have sealed the victory.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sonics missed three free throws down the stretch and
clung to a 103-100 lead with 6.7 seconds left. Then, Sacramento
rookie Jason Williams provided an interesting finish.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was fouled by Hersey Hawkins as he attempted a
game-tying 3-pointer. Hawkins thought he fouled Williams before the
shot, but the officials saw differently and sent the Kings'point
guard to the foul line. Williams buried the first two but then
missed the third attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The rebound fell to Payton, who was immediately fouled before
calmy hitting a pair of free throws that iced the victory. Payton
finished with 28 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds for his first
triple-double this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to keep going,'' Baker said. ``In a subtle way, I
wanted to go to overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the way the Sonics shot free throws. They missed 16 of 34
free throws, which was the only reason for the close call.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make our free throws, we win by 10 or 15 points,''
Payton said. ``We've got to understand if we play a better team
than Sacramento, we gotta make free throws and concentrate at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics did tighten their defensive pressure in the second
half. They slowed down Sacramento's transition game and stepped out
on the perimeter shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really got after it on defense,'' Sonics coach Paul
Westphal said. ``I thought we missed some back-breakers in the
fourth quarter, but it was nice to shoot 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker kick-started the Sonics' offense in the first two
quarters, scoring 19 points on 9-for-13 shooting. Even more
impressive was how he asserted himself. Most of his baskets came
from within five feet of the rim, a stark contrast to his first 12
games.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Baker had settled for 18-foot jump shots in the past, he
challenged Sacramento's burly front line all night. Baker mostly
went hard at Chris Webber, who posted 23 points and 14 rebounds in
their first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Baker was the aggressor from the start. He hit four
of his first six shots, which included a backdoor alley-oop dunk
assisted by Detlef Schrempf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat in the hotel and said this has got to be the game,''
Baker said. ``I didn't put any added pressure on myself, and God
blessed me with it. Like I said last game, I'm looking for anything
to kick-start my game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics began the game with their most efficient offensive
effort in several games but broke down, midway through the opening
period. Instead of padding the early lead, Payton was called for
traveling and committed a three-second violation on two straight
possessions. That led to five straight Sonic turnovers, while the
Kings climbed back.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento began to outrun the Sonics and scored easy baskets
off its fastbreak. The Sonics shot 54 percent in the first quarter
but only led 27-25.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied, 29-29, the Sonics fell behind when the
Kings got major contributions from their bench. Predrag Stojakovic
and Jon Barry began to slip 3-pointers past the Sonics defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics eventually fell behind by 13 points at halftime
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento led 62-48 early in the third. However, Billy Owens,
who returned to the Sonics' starting lineup Monday after missing
eight games with a broken pinky, scored nine points in the period,
and the Sonics outscored the Kings 29-20 the rest of the quarter to
get within 82-77.
</P>
<P>
   Payton scored 10 points in the final quarter and Baker added six
_ all in the final three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was feeling comfortable the whole night,'' Westphal said of
Baker. ``He hit some huge shots for us.''

 RIGHT-TO-DIE MEASURE INTRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY  &HT;     By ROBERT B. GUNNISON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Igniting a debate over the right to die, a
California state legislator introduced a bill Monday that would
allow terminally ill Californians to take a prescription pill to
end their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, by Assemblywoman Dion Aroner, a Democrat from
Berkeley, mirrors Oregon's physician-assisted suicide law, enacted
in 1997, which allows terminally ill patients to ask a doctor for
lethal medications.
</P>
<P>
   Aroner said her bill ``will provide people suffering from
terminal illness the peace of mind to know that if their symptoms
become so severe and debilitating, or their pain so great, they
have the choice to end their suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   California voters in 1992 rejected a ballot proposition that
would have allowed physicians directly to help terminally ill
patients die. It was defeated, 54 percent to 46 percent, after a
multimillion-dollar ad blitz largely financed by Catholic
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, a Catholic who _ contrary to
church teachings _ supports abortion rights and the death penalty,
had no comment on Aroner's bill, which will be fought by the
powerful doctors' lobby and Catholic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Introduction of the right-to-die measure comes as the pace of
legislative activity is accelerating. Lawmakers have proposed
measures dealing with topics as diverse as studying the effects of
the state's ``three-strikes, and you're out'' law to outlawing
discrimination at schools based on sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aroner measure is certain to provide some of the most
intense debate and wrenching political decisions of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Hogan, a lobbyist for the California Catholic Conference,
which represents the state's bishops, said her organization would
fight Aroner's bill vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compassion means to `suffer with,' '' Hogan said. ``It's
easier to offer someone relief, which may mean relief from looking
at them suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan also said terminally ill patients concerned about high
medical costs might choose to take the fatal doses. ``It's a whole
lot cheaper for someone to kill themselves than to ask their HMO to
care for them for another six months,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine
last month reported that none of the 23 people in Oregon who
received prescriptions for lethal medications did so for financial
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the terminally ill were more concerned with loss of
autonomy or bodily functions because of their illnesses, according
to the study.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Of the 23 Oregonians who asked for the prescriptions, 15 took the
medication, six died from their original illness and two were alive
as of January 1, the journal reported. Eighteen of the participants
had cancer. Their average age was 69.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; uncx  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Twenty patients were given secobarbital or pentobarbital. Of the
15 who died, death came in an average of 26 minutes, although one
took 111/2 hours to die.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled closely on the Oregon law, Aroner's bill would require
that a physician determine that candidates for the prescriptions be
18 or older, of sound mind and have fewer than six months to live
because of an incurable and irreversible disease.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SUICIDE0 (81762 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  A patient would make a written request for the prescription,
witnessed by two other people. The request could be withdrawn at
any time.
</P>
<P>
   No prescription could be written until at least 15 days after
the original request.
</P>
<P>
   Also opposing the bill will be the California Medical
Association. ``Physician-assisted suicide is the opposite approach
to what we should be taking,'' said CMA lobbyist Scott Syphax.
``There are far more compassionate approaches than to give
government sanction to affirmatively ending one's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Syphax said his organization supported legislation to expand
hospice care and to make it easier for patients to receive
pain-fighting medications.
</P>
<P>
   But Aroner cited polls showing that about two of three Americans
believe terminally ill adults should be able to ask a physician for
medication to end their lives. ``I believe it is finally time to
begin the discussion in California,'' she said.

   A patient would make a written request for the prescription,
witnessed by two other people. The request could be withdrawn at
any time.
</P>
<P>
   No prescription could be written until at least 15 days after
the original request.
</P>
<P>
   Also opposing the bill will be the California Medical
Association. ``Physician-assisted suicide is the opposite approach
to what we should be taking,'' said CMA lobbyist Scott Syphax.
``There are far more compassionate approaches than to give
government sanction to affirmatively ending one's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Syphax said his organization supported legislation to expand
hospice care and to make it easier for patients to receive
pain-fighting medications.
</P>
<P>
   But Aroner cited polls showing that about two of three Americans
believe terminally ill adults should be able to ask a physician for
medication to end their lives. ``I believe it is finally time to
begin the discussion in California,'' she said.

 GORE WARMS UP FOR 2000 CAMPAIGN  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vice President Al Gore, gearing up for his
presidential campaign and already targeted by Republicans,
acknowledged Monday that he may have to ``loosen up'' and change
his buttoned-down image with voters.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Chronicle on his 53rd trip to
California, Gore talked with unusual candor about ``the biggest,
most important state'' and about his unusually reserved public
image, which he said benefits from ``low expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   With Republican Texas Governor George W. Bush set to take the
first formal step toward a presidential run, Gore made sure there
weren't any doubts about his plans. He stopped saying he might run
for president _ and talked about when he runs for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't announced my campaign yet,'' Gore said. ``But when
the time comes, I will seek the judgment of the American people,
not on the basis of the polls, but on the basis of the ideas I
offer and the vision that I present.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made it clear where he plans to spend most of his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is the biggest, most important state,'' he said.
``It deserves the most attention, and I'm going to make sure it
gets it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments came during a packed one-day visit to San
Francisco and Oakland. The vice president held a breakfast meeting
with about 80 CEOs and political leaders at San Francisco City
Hall, then hosted a town hall meeting before 700 community leaders
on welfare-to-work issues in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Gore traveled to Oakland to meet with Mayor
Jerry Brown and African American leaders, while his wife, Tipper,
went to San Jose to attend a session on homeless issues. The Gores
returned to Washington late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed and at ease after a day of meetings and public events,
Gore roared with laughter when shown a bumper sticker that was a
best-seller at last weekend's state Republican convention. It said,
``Nixon in 2000: He's not as stiff as Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I keep that?'' he asked. ``It's a classic.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Gore frankly addressed what many of his strongest
supporters have long talked about _ the need for him to relax his
buttoned-down image and show voters his real persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm constantly being told by my close friends that the sense
of humor they enjoy, and know me by, doesn't come across in my
public appearance,'' Gore said. ``Maybe I'll yet figure out a way
to loosen up. ... I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some things that are hard to change about yourself,''
he said. But, he added with a smile, ``I benefit from low
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore gave a glimpse of that more personal side when he talked
about becoming a grandparent for the first time this summer _ and
how it may make him a different kind of man and politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows you to extend your personal connection with the
future, and feel the impact of policies that may last for
decades,'' he said. ``Becoming emotionally involved with
grandchildren, you can find it much easier to understand the
importance of balancing the long-term consequences of decisions,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also unabashed about his attention to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be here more often than in any other state,'' he said.
``America's future is born every day in California.''
</P>
<P>
   In his public events Monday, Gore won raves from some in
attendance who said he was showing the kind of personal touch
needed in the coming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In his town hall meeting, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium,
the vice president walked around the stage, coaxing stories from
mothers formerly on welfare, and others like Stanton Richardson, a
former welfare recipient who is now a successful insurance agent.
</P>
<P>
   When Richardson almost broke down in tears, recalling how he
found himself and his children without a home in 1993, Gore paused
and said, ``You've really got your heart in this, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   He then posed for photos on stage with a handful of families,
and also delivered a letter to a woman who had a bad fall and
couldn't attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to continue doing what he's doing,'' said San
Francisco Supervisor Leslie Katz, who said she met Gore in 1982 as
an intern for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. ``Holding
one-on-ones, meeting in small groups, talking about issues, that's
important.'' She said Gore increasingly ``seems relaxed and he
really does have a great sense of humor,'' and Democrats now are
itching to hear him declare his campaign off and running.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Gore repeatedly pounded the theme that in
good economic times, ``our challenge is to make certain that no one
is left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulate the whole Bay Area on what you've been doing,''
he told the town hall meeting. ``And I'll be there with you, to go
the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, the vice president played down polls that show
Bush and former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole already running
ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls are unreliable, but I welcome the opportunity to take on
this challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to announce the formation of an exploratory
committee, the first formal step in making a run for the
presidency. Gore formed his own committee earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also addressed criticism _ which Republicans lobbed at him
repeatedly during last week's GOP state convention _ that he wasn't
tough enough on President Clinton's actions and that, indeed,
Clinton was tougher on himself than Gore was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've repeatedly criticized the president's behavior as
indefensible, and everyone knows that he himself has apologized,''
Gore said, adding that Americans are ``beginning to be a little
puzzled as to why the Republican Party cannot seem to let go of
this matter. Wrong as it was, it's in the past. ... A judgment has
been rendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to spend my time addressing the future,'' Gore said.
``It's for others to determine if they want to wallow in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there is a danger that some Democrats might see the
2000 presidential election as a ``slam dunk'' because both
Clinton's polls and the economy are in good shape, Gore nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said. ``I've certainly never regarded any election
as a slam dunk. ... The Republicans have made some unusually
serious mistakes ... but the American people will judge candidates
and the party by what they have to say about the future,'' said
Gore. ``And that's my focus _ the future.''

 &HT;    Decidingly female black electorate growing
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Today, chalk talk for political junkies.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Cathy Cox's office recently released an
analysis of voter turnout in last November's election. We already
know who won and lost, but the study is a useful reality check on
who voted.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted on Election Day indicated African-American
voters made up 30 percent of the total votes cast, a staggering
leap in turnout. The state analysis, which can reference every
ballot cast by race, puts the actual percentage at just under 23
percent. This has a couple of implications.
</P>
<P>
   The information in this report doesn't tell us for whom people
voted. But if we assume Democrat Roy Barnes got 90 percent of the
black vote in this racially charged election, he must still have
received about 41 percent of the white vote to win by his overall
margin of 53 percent, according to the calculations of Bobby Kahn,
Barnes' chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   That's better than the 38 percent of white votes Max Cleland got
in the 1996 Senate race and close to the 42.9 garnered by Zell
Miller in the '94 governor's race. Barnes won with what is becoming
the target split of white votes a Democrat needs in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Alan Secrest said he was not surprised the
original estimates of African-American turnout were way off the
mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exit polls are spectacularly ill-equipped to say what the
racial proportion of an election is,'' Secrest said.
</P>
<P>
   The scaled-back assessment of black voting participation isn't
as dramatic, but it nevertheless is part of an important emerging
political trend.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout among African-Americans in Georgia has been on a slow,
steady rise since the passage of the federal ``Motor Voter'' law,
from 19 percent in 1994 to 21 percent in '96 to 23 percent in '98.
This corresponds with a big increase in the percentage of
African-Americans in the state who are registered to vote, from 49
percent in 1994 to 65 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   As the percentage of black voters has increased, the gender gap
has widened. Women now are 55 percent of all registered voters, but
women account for 60 percent of the registered African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A higher percentage of African-American women also turned out to
vote last November. While overall black voter turnout still lagged
behind white voters, black women voted at a percentage close to the
average for all voters.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Whit Ayres said he didn't think this
trendline can be sustained in the upcoming presidential election
year, without the ``peculiar set of circumstances'' that encouraged
black turnout in the past election. Those include the backlash
against the campaigns of Guy Millner and Mitch Skandalakis, Bill
Clinton's impeachment and a record number of black statewide
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   With white turnout likely to increase in 2000, African-American
participation might not increase as much as a measurable
percentage. But a new black electorate, better educated, more
involved, and at this juncture, one-sidedly female, is beginning to
take shape.

 &HT;    CONMMENTARY: Today's news simply hard to believe
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ When it comes to the news of the day, I
confess I am a victim of lowered expectations and sorely in need of
an attitude adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning I unfurl the daily blab foolishly hoping for some
good news. Maybe a headline proclaiming ``Peace in the Middle
East'' or maybe even a cure for the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   Warily, I scan page one for assurance that Bill Clinton made it
through the night without being accused of assaulting the entire
soprano section of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
</P>
<P>
   More and more I find myself responding to the news with comments
like ``Lord help us,'' and ``Who cares.''?
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   Lord help us: According to the London Times, the U.S. National
Security Agency in Maryland, the espionage entity that analyzes
telephone taps and electronic intercepts picked up from around the
world has issued a ``Furby Alert,'' warning employees to leave
their cyberpets at home lest its computer chip (the one that allows
it to repeat anything it has heard), defect and start blabbing
classified information.
</P>
<P>
   Shall we ask the obvious question, folks? Like, what are we
doing with a spy network that carries their stuffed toys to work?
</P>
<P>
   Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   A 47-year-old wholesale steel distributor from Bucks County,
Pa., paid $255,000 for O.J. Simpson's second-hand Heisman Trophy.
He did it to impress his girlfriend who hadn't been paying much
attention to him lately.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the words of the new owner who has taped his name over
O.J.'s and called in the media for a photo op, his lady is
``totally impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow! Me too! (Talk about a pair of empty suits.)
</P>
<P>
   Lord help us: According to the Detroit Free Press, an
assembly-line worker at DaimlerChrysler AG glass plant in Detroit
was arrested by FBI agents after being identified by her supervisor
as the woman photographed robbing a bank in
</P>
<P>
   Bloomfield Hills. The accused's elegant, designer wardrobe and
sunglasses were her undoing.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? Despite federal prosecutors' pleas to have the
accused armed robber jailed, the judge released her to the custody
of her family in lieu of a $10,000 personal bond - AND - she'll be
back on the job taking orders from the person who turned her in.
Talk about ``labor relations!''
</P>
<P>
   Who cares? Teammate grumbles Rodman is turning Lakers into
traveling circus.
</P>
<P>
   Is it Rodman's purple and gold hair he's objecting to?
</P>
<P>
   Lord help us: The Washington Post writes that the 2000
presidential race is rapidly turning into a ``mammoth spending
spree'' with candidates attempting to intimidate poor folks out of
the running by raising astronomical amounts of campaign funds early
on. Vice President Gore, we're told, plans to ``exploit every
available legal loophole'' to reach his goal of $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   That'd sure feed a lot of hungry folks.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares? Texas Gov. and presidential hopeful George W. Bush
admits to having been a hard-drinking party animal. His daddy and
former president, George, tells us his son was never an alcoholic,
he just can't hold his liquor.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it's going to be from now on, so we'd better get
used to it - declaration followed by confession and contrition.
Ho-hum.
</P>
<P>
   Lord help us: Smilin' Jerry Falwell is out to save the world
from gay Teletubbies. The good reverend has denounced Tinky Winky
because he's purple, because he carries a purse, and because he
wears a triangle on his head.
</P>
<P>
   It must be depressing viewing the world through evil-tinted
glasses. And finally, from Columbus, Ohio: City crews sent out to
remove snow and ice from the Statehouse grounds before Gov. Bob
Taft's inauguration last month
</P>
<P>
   wrecked the joint to the tune of $1 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Snowplows broke 66 granite sidewalk stones and three curbs,
chipped or gouged at least 1,476 feet of curb, uprooted and dented
an anchored trash can, and bent a sign. The city's street
maintenance manager says he isn't aware of any damage.
</P>
<P>
   Nice day's work, guys!
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you folks, it's laugh or perish. If we get serious,
the news will make us nuts.

 &HT;    Weather radios can save lives in event of tornadoes, storms
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If a tornado comes through, even in the
dead of night, a small radio will wake you up, perhaps in time to
seek safety.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service says the radios might have saved lives when
a string of tornadoes tore through Central Florida in February 1998
when most people were asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service hopes to someday have a ``weather
radio in every home, just like a smoke detector, and in all
schools, hospitals and other public gathering places,'' said former
Director Elbert W. Friday Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The radio can be set to continuously play local forecasts. Or it
can be programmed to go off only in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   When the National Weather Service sends out a severe weather
warning the radio beeps loud enough to awaken someone, then
broadcasts the warning. It will broadcast not only weather
warnings, but also other major emergencies, such as wildfires or an
accident at a nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
   In newer models, users can now program radios to receive only
the most local warnings _ sparing Boca Raton residents, for
example, a broadcast of a waterspout off Miami Beach. Forecasters
are now working to break it down even more; splitting Palm Beach
County, for example into nine regions.
</P>
<P>
   Users can also eliminate certain broadcasts; someone who doesn't
boat may not want to hear every marine warning.
</P>
<P>
   The radios can run either on batteries or on house current with
a battery back-up. Deaf or blind people can connect radios to
special devices such as strobe lights, pagers and bed-shakers.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Division of Emergency Management thinks so much of the
devices it handed out 3,200 last year, one for every public school,
and distributed another 10,000 last week to places such as day care
centers and retirement homes. Counties were also given vouchers to
buy more of the $80 radios at a discounted price of $49. The radios
are available from electronic stores, department stores and
catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   In the state, Southeast Florida is second only to Central
Florida in the frequency of tornadoes, said Jim Lushine, warning
coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service's Miami
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a fairly active tornadic season in May and
June,'' Lushine said.
</P>
<P>
   And while South Floridians think less of tornadoes than they do
hurricanes, which they can see coming, hurricanes can spawn
tornadoes or flash floods, even from far away, Lushine said.

 &HT;    Following the herd? That's a common investment mistake authors
say
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My excuse is that I was much younger when I decided to
make my fortune by trading in silver futures.
</P>
<P>
   I have used that dodge for many years now. It still feels as
fresh, and as flimsy, as it ever has.
</P>
<P>
   My first two silver trades were swift, decisive and profitable.
It was the third that separated the sheep from the wool. I lost
more money than I like to recall, and I took my shorn self out of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Now, much too late, I understand a little bit more about why I
got so overconfident/dumb. I found the explanations in a newly
published book on a well-established field of study, behavioral
finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People confidently confuse familiarity with knowledge,'' Gary
Belsky and Thomas Gilovich write in their book, ``Why Smart People
Make Big Money Mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For every example of a person who made money on an investment
because she used a company's product or understood its strategy, we
can give you five instances where such knowledge was insufficient
to justify the investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Belsky and Gilovich don't cover new territory. Instead, they
recount the high points of about 30 years of academic studies in
the field of behavior and investment decisions. But Belsky, a
financial writer, and Gilovich, a psychology professor at Cornell
University, do an uncommonly good job of turning academic work into
everyday good sense. And they have an old-shoe approach that makes
it easy reading.
</P>
<P>
   One objection to the book _ and the entire field of study _
might be that it sometimes seems like an awful lot of gabble to
arrive at obvious conclusions. I want to agree. But I also have to
admit that I learned a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Take the question of overconfidence. The authors outline several
interesting reasons why people develop an unreasonable belief in
their investment ability. But they go on to a better question _ why
people stay overconfident. ``Frankly, we don't learn well enough
from our mistakes,'' they write.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard psychologist Eileen Langer describes this phenomenon
as `heads I win, tails it's chance,' '' say Gilovich and Belsky.
``When things happen that confirm the correctness of your actions
or beliefs, you attribute the events to your own high ability.
Conversely, when things happen that prove your actions or beliefs
to have been mistaken or wrong-headed, you attribute those
disconcerting events to some other cause over which you had no
control. The net result is that you emerge from a checkered history
of success and failure with a robust optimism about your prospects
for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? It does to me. I may be out of silver futures,
but I still buy a strange stock every so often.
</P>
<P>
   The authors also make themselves useful by following each
self-delusion with suggestions on how to overcome it. Most of the
suggestions sound like good old horse sense. But most of us can
benefit, one time or another, from a dose of horse sense.
</P>
<P>
   On another interesting point, the authors review a seven-year
study of the trades made in 10,000 accounts at a discount
brokerage. The study proved that investors are more likely to sell
their winners and hang on to their losers. It also showed that the
stocks the investors sold outperformed the stocks they held by 3.4
percent over the following 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your investments are the flotilla that you hope will carry you
to the shores of a secure retirement over the choppy seas of
life,'' the authors write in a metaphor that will soon get out of
hand. ``Rather than sticking with boats that have proven their
seaworthiness, you routinely abandon ship in favor of dinghies that
have already sprung some leaks. ... No sailor in his right mind
would behave in this fashion, yet many investors do so routinely.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Most people respond much more strongly to investment
losses than they do to gains. Anguish trumps elation. ``The
prospect of selling that losing investment (and the pain associated
with making the loss final) makes them more willing to dig in their
heels and take risks,'' the authors conclude. ``After all, until
you actually sell a losing investment, the drop in price is only a
`paper loss' _ it's not official. Once you sell it, though, it's
real.''
</P>
<P>
   There is much more. Why people freeze up, or turn conservative,
when they are faced with too many choices. Why consumers will pay
more for a given object if they charge it, rather than paying cash.
Why investors mistake a stampeding herd for ``the smart money.''
</P>
<P>
   I look over a lot of personal finance books. Many are
repetitious. Others are get-rich-quick schemes, and some are
downright squirrelly. But this book is worthwhile.

 &HT;    Simple lessons learned in a cemetery
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Long an avid student of Texas history, I've
stumbled upon another one of those folks who wasn't in my
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   He was a wealthy landowner in Fort Bend County during the last
century and part of this one. He got into politics and was elected
sheriff and tax collector, then was elected to the Texas Senate.
While in the Legislature, he backed many education initiatives,
including one bill establishing a state university. He returned to
Fort Bend County, which sits along Houston's southwestern edge and
stayed active in politics and farming until he died in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, while on a trip to Richmond, the county seat, last
year, my family and I stopped at the historic Morton Cemetery. We
find it interesting to explore old cemeteries and talk about the
lives of the people who are buried there. On this visit, we spotted
a state historical marker near two of the graves at this final
resting place of many prominent Fort Bend County families.
</P>
<P>
   The marker, erected in 1992, told about a politician/farmer and
when we were through reading it, my husband turned to my son and
declared, ``You have got to do your history project on this guy.''
Our school requires a yearly history project from all fifth through
eighth graders and families learn to be on the lookout for great
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   So what was it about the life of the man on the marker, which
sounds like that of so many others who helped build this great
state, that would elicit such enthusiasm from a history nut like my
husband?
</P>
<P>
   He was a slave.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Moses Burton was born around 1840 in North Carolina and
brought to Texas by his master, Thomas Burke Burton in 1850.
Against all laws and customs, Burton taught the young slave to read
and write and when slavery ended after the Civil War, he sold to
Walter Moses Burton several parcels of
</P>
<P>
   land.
</P>
<P>
   The former slave, now a wealthy and influential landowner,
entered politics in 1869 when he was elected sheriff and tax
collector of Fort Bend County.
</P>
<P>
   His service in the Texas Senate began in 1874 and ended in 1882.
In 1879, he was instrumental in passing the bill establishing
Prairie View Normal School, now Prairie View A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Burton and his son, Horace, are the only two black people buried
in Morton Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   My son listened to his dad and pursued the project for his
seventh grade year, which is the year Texas schoolchildren study
our state's history. He got an A and we all got a little richer in
our knowledge of black history, which after all is part of what
makes Texas history so rich.

 &HT;    Good intentions don't justify these bills; they're stinkers
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ My time would be better spent if the law required
my son to walk faster.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature should step to it.
</P>
<P>
   When my son's voice changed, so did his gear ratio. Now he has
two speeds: ``slow'' and ``glacial.'' I want Texas to set a minimum
pedestrian speed for able-bodied Texans ages 13-18.
</P>
<P>
   With slouching a concurrent teen condition, Texas also should
declare an ``official body language,'' which would be upright.
</P>
<P>
   Stop me before I go much further. Someone in the state Capitol
is going to take these proposals seriously.
</P>
<P>
   As much as we mean well making requirements for young people, we
can overstep.
</P>
<P>
   Two bills before the legislature are examples of good intentions
gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   The first, by Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, would require
every Texas high schooler to take two years of Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The second, by Tony Goolsby, R-Dallas, would require high
schoolers to do 60 hours of community service to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   I should be singing the praises of both. Having two years of
high school Spanish and 60 hours of community service would be good
for any student. So would walking faster and not slouching.
</P>
<P>
   Texas should stomp these bills to death.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Spanish ought to be fundamental in the Southwest. It's
an argument I've made in my own home many times. It is
geographically self-evident. My son is taking French.
</P>
<P>
   He had his first Spanish in middle school. He knows just enough
to be dangerous. I can see him robbing a Juarez bank with tellers
mulling the warning: ``I've got cheese and I'm not afraid to use
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be to his benefit to be fluent in Spanish, but
requiring two years of Spanish would cause several problems. The
first is the way high schoolers see electives erode under
core-subject mandates. Heap on a few more mandates and there won't
be enough hours in a day for a high schooler to have an education
that suits his or her interests. Requiring two years of Spanish
would virtually erase French, Russian and Latin from Texas
offerings, because only hard-core language students would free up
the time for them.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is an accute lack of qualified Spanish teachers.
Texas is hard pressed to find enough bilingual teachers as it is.
</P>
<P>
   Topping this off is the fact that high school is too late. The
perfect-world solution: Learn Spanish in grade school. With that
underpinning, more students would be inclined to choose two years
of Spanish in secondary school. This is important enough to launch
a state initiative: Spanish from the bottom up. But don't order it
top-down.
</P>
<P>
   Good intention, bad law. Nothing so reflects the combination
than that other bad bill: the 60-hour ``community service''
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each school shall develop a list of approved community service
organizations from which a student may select,'' it says. Red tape
alert. Who on the average high school campus has time to administer
this?
</P>
<P>
   I'm a big advocate of volunteer work. Many youngsters would
benefit under this requirement, and so would agencies. But watch
out for coerced teen-agers slouching slowly toward make-work
opportunities in which they would end up rearranging dust with
leaden sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   As with TAAS drills and TAAS practice tests (even for students
who don't need them), and then three days of the real thing under
state decree, this sounds like one more way for Texas to say, ``We
interrupt your regularly scheduled education for . . . ''

 &HT;    HEALTH BRIEFS: Dealing with death as a part of life
 &HT;    (EDS: This is a compilation of health stories which moved to the
wires this week.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Death does not come easily to doctors. Inevitable as
it is in their line of work, it flies in the face of their
training, purpose, even their egos.
</P>
<P>
   But many social and technological issues, such as
physician-assisted suicide and chemotherapy advances, are forcing
doctors to add end-of-life care to their purview of prevention and
treatment of disease and trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way is the American Medical Association with its new
program, ``Educating Physicians in End-of-Life Care.'' The
organization selected 250 health care and other professionals
across the nation to attend four regional workshops to better learn
how to help terminally ill patients and their families. The AMA
trainees, in turn, will educate their local communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death as failure is how many doctors think,'' said Dr. Russell
K. Portenoy, department chairman of palliative care at New York's
Beth Israel Hospital. ``Our medical model is returning patients to
a state of health.'' Portenoy is one of several doctors leading the
AMA two-year initiative, which is supported with a grant from the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1 million Americans who die annually, only 10 percent die
of an unexpected event such as an accident or sudden onset of
disease. The rest either face protracted fatal illnesses, such as
cancer and muscle-degenerative disorders, or the predictable and
steady decline of aging and its chronic conditions _ diabetes,
heart disease, Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   While more and more hospice centers and home-health care workers
are helping patients in their final days, the AMA wants end-of-life
care, known as palliative care, to begin much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors above all are human beings and they are just as
uncomfortable with this subject as others,'' says Dr. Linda Emanuel
of Chicago's Northwestern University Hospital. ``But patients
expect physicians to introduce the topic of long-term planning for
their condition, and it's often left to others in the medical
system.''
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the End-of-Life project, contact the
Institute for Ethics, American Medical Association, 515 N. State
Street, Chicago, IL 60610; 312-464-4979.

   Minority workers lag in health coverage, study finds
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White workers are far more likely to have health
insurance paid by their employers than blacks or Hispanics,
according to a recently-released study.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund found that 69
percent of white workers were covered by employer-sponsored
insurance, compared with 52 percent of black workers and 44 percent
of Hispanic workers. The study found even wider disparities among
different occupations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A variety of additional barriers may account for the
difference in health care coverage rates between whites and
minorities,'' said Allyson Hall, lead author of the study.
``Certain groups may decline health care coverage not only because
of financial concerns, but also because of differing perceptions
regarding the propensity to become ill and the overall need for
health care coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 18 percent of workers between 18 and 64 were
uninsured in 1997, an increase from 15.7 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, minorities have been more likely than whites to be
uninsured. They often work in industries or in part-time jobs that
do not offer coverage, said Karen Davis, president of the
Commonwealth Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But even among fulltime workers, 37 percent of Hispanics were
uninsured, compared to 20 percent of blacks and 12 percent of
whites.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of workers in manufacturing jobs had
employer-provided health coverage. Whites were covered 85 percent
of the time, compared to 71 percent for blacks and 60 percent for
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Large firms were more likely to provide coverage than small
firms. In firms of more than 1,000 employees, 85 percent of whites
were covered, compared to 76 percent blacks and 72 percent
Hispanics. In companies of less than 100 workers, 63 percent of
whites were covered, compared to 47 percent for blacks and 38
percent for Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Lower wage earners also were less likely to be insured by an
employer. Among workers earning less than $7 an hour, 56 percent of
whites were covered, compared to 47 percent of blacks and 35
percent of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers who are poor, not well-educated, not U.S. citizens,
unmarried, younger or live in an inner city or rural area are less
likely than their counterparts to have employers-based health
insurance,'' the report concluded. ``Most of these characteristics
have a greater effect on minority than white populations.''

 &HT;    Music festival/conference now a teenager
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The music industry calls it ``spring break,'' as
its swarms invade the streets of Austin, Texas, with the
margarita-swilling abandon of collegians in Daytona, Fla. For the
Austin economy, it is ``Christmas in March,'' though local hotels,
clubs and restaurants consider it more like Mardi Gras and the
Super Bowl rolled into one. It is best recognized by the
unpronounceable acronym of SXSW, though it is more properly known
as the South by Southwest Music and Media Conference (by day, and
the South by Southwest Music Festival by night).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one calls it, SXSW will mark its 13th year with this
year's run. From March 17-21, it will present more than 600 musical
acts at 37 clubs and other facilities throughout the city. It
expects to draw some 6,000 conference registrants from across the
country and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1987 as a regional alternative to New York's New
Music Seminar, it has grown into the country's largest and most
significant annual music industry gathering since the mid-'90s
demise of the NMS. The Austin location is a key to its appeal, as
SXSW has been able to capitalize on the city's reputation for
maverick musical creativity and downhome friendliness. From the
kickoff with the annual Austin Music Awards through the closing
softball tournament and barbecue festivities, the event has
retained its regional flavor throughout its boom as a national and
international attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the whole town becomes Musicville, U.S.A., for a
week,'' said Casey Monahan, director of the Texas Music Office for
the state government. ``It keeps Austin in the appointment books of
6,000-plus industry decision-makers every year.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the event has spawned an accompanying film
festival and multimedia conference, preceding and overlapping with
the musical gathering. Still, the musical lineup remains the
primary draw, with SXSW '99 promising Lucinda Williams as keynote
speaker and perennial performer, British guitar legends Jeff Beck
and Robert Fripp in rare club appearances, former Talking Head
David Byrne spinning discs as a club deejay and hundreds of acts
who are unsigned or on independent labels hoping to generate the
buzz of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the recent upheavals in the music industry _
particularly the consolidation of the Polygram and MCA groups, with
labels folded and the dismissal of some 1,300 employees _ this
year's conference might seem more like a job fair, filled with
industry veterans looking for work. It would also appear that the
music lineup might be suffering at the major-label level, a victim
of corporate belt-tightening. In contrast with previous SXSW fests,
which have featured artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Iggy Pop to
Tony Bennett _ this year's seems lighter on big names.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be a lineup that has as much celebrity appeal or
the kind of acts that trendy people look for,'' fest director Brent
Grulke told Chris Riemenschneider of the Austin American-Statesman,
``but our goal isn't to cater to that, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those participating in the event, goals and strategies for
making the most of it are as various as the music the fest
features. In 1994, three schoolboy brothers from Tulsa, Oklahoma,
were driven to the event by their father, and spent the weekend
singing to anyone within earshot, from the lobby of the Four
Seasons hotel to the sidelines of the softball tournament. Though
they'd never even applied for a showcase, they left the conference
with a manager, and were soon selling millions of records as
Hanson.
</P>
<P>
   More typical was last year's approach taken by Hollywood Records
with Austin's Fastball. Using the event to introduce the rising
band to the nation's music media, the label threw an open-bar and
free buffet bash during the hours preceding Fastball's showcase,
thus ensuring a packed house and an enthusiastic reception. The
evening served as a springboard for ``The Way,'' which soon became
a smash over alternative-rock radio.
</P>
<P>
   As founding festival director Roland Swenson has explained,
``This is an opportunity for people in the music business and
regional and national media to meet and share ideas . . . We are a
tool. And either you can figure out how to use us or not.''

A REAL ZERO OF A DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if we didn't already have enough to worry about, what with
the shrinking strike zone and the very real possibility that the
Rev. Jerry Falwell is the ``lost'' Teletubby, we now have to come
up with a name for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   According to an article in USA Today, there is no general
agreement as to what we should call the years 2000-2009. The Double
Ohs? Decade One? The Singles? Yech.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times language columnist William Safire has
suggested calling the first decade of the new millennium the Zippy
Zeros, which suggests to me that Mr. Safire may be a victim of Sick
Building Syndrome or perhaps is simply in need of a long, restful
vacation. (Yo, Bill: The Times early retirement package is very
generous. You may want to check it out.)
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s, for all its failings, at least had the decency to
provide us with an obvious name that was short, easy to pronounce
and lent itself well to newspaper headlines. It is unlikely that
the next decade will show us the same courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   The Two Thousandths? If Dan Rather tries saying that on the
evening news he'll swallow his tongue and his head will explode.
</P>
<P>
   (I know what you're thinking and you should be ashamed of
yourself.)
</P>
<P>
   The best suggestion I've heard so far _ and it is by no means
great _ is The Pre-Teens.
</P>
<P>
   If the next decade is anything like the one we're in now, it
will be unruly, unmanageable and susceptible to the most hideous
trends in fashion and music, just like a real pre-teen. The analogy
is not perfect, however, because I assume we won't have to remind
the next decade 100 times a day to pick up its clothes, get off the
phone or do its homework. Then again, we are headed into uncharted
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I think of it, Uncharted Territory would not be that
bad a name for the next decade, though it sounds a bit ominous and
could just as easily be applied to the decade after that or the
decade after that. Also, it does not fit well in headlines, which
is the main reason decades need a nickname in the first place, as
best I can tell.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice of America, which has an audience of more than 80
million people, is running a contest asking listeners to suggest a
name for the new decade. Entries, so far, include ``The 2KOs'' from
Israel, ``The Pre-Tens'' from Kazakhstan, ``The Digital Decade''
from Zimbabwe and ``Globacade'' from Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Ghana undoubtedly has a lot going for it (abundant sunshine
springs immediately to mind), but its people have a lot to learn
when it comes to naming decades. Can you imagine a car salesman
slamming his palm on the hood of a new car and saying, ``Don't wait
another minute! Come on down and see our Globacade Toyota Camrys!
You'll be glad you did!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I seriously doubt that anyone, least of all me, is
going to come up with a name for the next decade that is going to
meet with everyone's approval. The Zeros is out because it implies
futility, and that's not a healthy way to think of a decade until
you've lived in it awhile, as we have with the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The First Decade of the 21st Century makes up in logic what it
lacks in pizzazz, but headline writers will be tempted to
abbreviate it to FD21C, which is not something I or anyone else
would want to see happen.
</P>
<P>
   Given what we've been through, calling the next decade Not The
Nineties has a certain appeal, but there is always the possibility
that the Two Thousandths will be the '90s all over again, which is
a thought even more depressing than plunking down $20,000 for a
Zippy Zero Dodge minivan.

 &HT;    The guru who begins from within

<TEXT>
<P>
   SILVER SPRING, Maryland _ On the second floor of a drab
red-brick building just outside Washington, spiritual guru Iyanla
Vanzant is the picture of serene success.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bleak and rainy outside. But Vanzant's office at the
Inner Visions Spiritual Maintenance Center is swathed in soothing
purples. Music inspired by the I Ching thrums from a bookshelf
stereo. And Vanzant's warming herself with a cup of herbal tea.
</P>
<P>
   Vanzant seems perfectly at peace, and why not? She's a regular
on TV's ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' Hallmark has turned her daily
affirmations into a line of greeting cards, and her string of best
sellers includes ``Acts of Faith,'' a book many loyal readers call
the black women's Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Her smile and almond-shaped eyes show no trace of Rhonda Harris,
the frightened survivor of a childhood rape, the teenage parent,
battered spouse and welfare mother who once tried to take her own
life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's only this bubbly 45-year-old grandmother with the
melodic mouthful of a name (it's pronounced E-yon-la), and a
nagging question: How did she wind up here?
</P>
<P>
   To get a bead on the curious arc of Vanzant's life, try
following the advice that has become her mantra for the masses:
``You must begin within.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately in this society we're trained to do everything
outside of ourselves,'' says Vanzant. ``But we have to live within
ourselves, to just be. We have to be in love with ourselves. At
peace with ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``finding inner peace'' is a New Age-y cliche, as
Vanzant will admit. What's new about her message is not what
Vanzant is saying, but who's listening.
</P>
<P>
   Vanzant _ whose first name means ``great mother'' in the ancient
Nigerian culture known as Yoruba _ has become an icon for black
women who say she has validated their experiences and given them a
road map out of spiritual despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This society wrote me off. I was a black female, uneducated,
on welfare in the projects with no man. I was nothing,'' Vanzant
says, her voice going from a raspy whisper to cocky, sista-girl
slang that betrays her Brooklyn-born roots. ``I think people are
responding to my work because I look and sound like them, and I'm
saying what their mamas and grandmamas told them when nobody was
listening. Now I'm saying it and being heard.''
</P>
<P>
   With 10 books to her credit, including ``Faith in the Valley,''
``One Day My Soul Just Opened Up'' and ``In the Meantime,'' Vanzant
has touched millions of readers who are responding to her
plain-spoken lessons of hope and healing.
</P>
<P>
   After self-publishing her first book in 1991, Vanzant was
``discovered'' by talk show queen Winfrey last April and is a
sought-after motivational speaker who commands $12,500 for
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Vanzant embarks on a 20-city speaking tour this month, which
includes a sold-out March 20 prayer breakfast at the Cobb County,
Ga. Convention Center hosted by the Hillside International Truth
Center in Atlanta, her adopted church. (The stop will be a
homecoming for her husband, Adeyemi Bandeli, former director the
APEX black history museum on Auburn Avenue in Atlanta.)
</P>
<P>
   There's another ``Oprah'' appearance planned soon, and on March
16, Simon &AMP; Schuster will publish Vanzant's latest book,
``Yesterday I Cried,'' part of a $1.1 million, three-book deal.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Gresham is a typical Vanzant reader. The 56-year-old
Cascade woman was having marital problems and was worried about her
impending retirement when she borrowed a Vanzant book from her
daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iyanla kept me from going berserk,'' says Gresham. ``After
re-reading `One Day My Soul Just Opened Up,' I bought copies for my
beautician who had just lost her mother, and a friend whose husband
had a heart attack. She's helped us put things in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Although black women were her primary audience, Vanzant is
trying to broaden her audience. She has written ``The Soul of a
Man,'' a how-to book on the male perspective that appeals to both
sexes. The words ``for black women,'' which had appeared in earlier
Vanzant titles, won't be used in upcoming books, and future cover
designs will be culturally neutral, less Afrocentric.
</P>
<P>
   Vanzant says that doesn't mean she's selling out. It's a matter
of reaching out to a broader, and in some cases, whiter audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown,'' Vanzant says, getting cozy, tucking her legs
underneath her. ``I used to say I was just a black woman. Now I'm a
child of God. White folks were reading (my books) anyway, so why
would I want to make them feel excluded? This is not about me, this
message is about God.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her childhood, Vanzant says she has been visited by
apparitions _ male and female _ whom she interpreted as God
speaking to her directly.
</P>
<P>
   In her ministry, she espouses a heady potluck of religious
disciplines and denominations, blended into her own stripped-down,
unified theory of spiritual well-being. She has a law degree, and
she's ordained as a priestess in Yoruba culture, a belief system
that recognizes a single creator and hundreds of lesser deities.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging on the walls of her office is an Indian wish catcher,
representing the Native American influences of her paternal
grandmother, who helped raise her, and a yin-yang symbol denoting
the eternal opposites of Taoism. She wears a cloth bracelet bearing
the letters WWJD, an acronym for ``What Would Jesus Do?'' a
catchphrase popularized by young Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Vanzant grew up attending Christian churches, but she has
angered some who say she is bucking traditional doctrine and
drawing others away from the faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got an e-mail telling people to be careful of Iyanla
Vanzant, because she doesn't believe in the devil. Hell no, I don't
believe in the devil,'' Vanzant says. ``You and I are the devil if
we're not in alignment with God. I don't believe that we were born
in sin and I have to suffer just because my mother and father had
the hots for each other. I don't think God is that devious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Barbara King of the Hillside Truth Center in Atlanta
was one of the first Christian ministers to invite Vanzant to speak
before she became a star on the spirituality circuit. Vanzant, who
calls King her ``spiritual mom,'' still visits about three times a
year, packing the pews to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People criticize Iyanla because they don't understand what
she's all about,'' says King. ``What makes her unique is her own
story and how she zeroes in on people with the same challenges.
She's not only lived through a lot of pain, she gives you a process
for coming out of the dungeon of despair.''
</P>
<P>
   For Vanzant, her own journey began in 1953 when she was born in
the back of a New York taxi. Her mother died two years later, and
during Vanzant's unsettled childhood, she and her older brother,
Ray, lived with relatives and a family friends, including a man who
raped her when she was 9.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Damon, was born when Vanzant was only 16. She was
married briefly at 19, and had her first daughter, Gemmia. In 1977
she remarried, this time to Charles Vanzant, the father of her
daughter Nisa, and a man who beat her so badly she was
hospitalized, Vanzant writes. At one point, she swallowed a
potentially fatal overdose of painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   Vanzant reconciled with her second husband, and lied about her
marriage to get welfare benefits. Even though the beatings
continued, she managed to earn a college degree while working as a
drug and alcohol counselor.
</P>
<P>
   One night, as her abuser slept, Vanzant heard a disembodied
female voice telling her to ``get up and get out of here.'' Quietly
gathering her children and packing up their belongings, she left
for good.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of friends and student loans, Vanzant later
earned a law degree in New York, then moved to her family to
Philadelphia where she worked in the public defender's office. Two
years later, the voice again told her to leave. Again she heeded
it.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to feed her children, Vanzant got a job counseling
women on welfare, and almost by accident launched her writing
career.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for weekly seminars with welfare clients, she
compiled tidbits of spiritual, legal and practical advice that grew
from a 32-page pamphlet into a 70-page book, ``Tapping the Power
Within.'' She made the first copies at Kinko's, and peddled them
from the trunk of her secondhand car.
</P>
<P>
   Her work caught the attention of Glen Thompson of Writers and
Readers, a small, black-owned publishing house in New York. The
paperback sold out the first 15,000 copies in about two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was dealing with issues like domestic violence and rape
before most other authors were,'' Thompson said. ``She said things
in her own voice, and her writing was so natural. It flowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still financially strapped, Vanzant agreed to write an
autobiography for Thompson's company, a decision she came to
regret. After submitting the manuscript for ``Interiors,'' Vanzant
had a change of heart, and she asked him not to publish it.
Thompson, who had already paid her an advance, refused.
</P>
<P>
   The book may be the most curious and controversial chapter in
Vanzant's bibliography. It includes little-known details about her
early life told in a wrenching narrative, and stirring words of
prayer. But its author now refuses to mention it by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things I wrote about in that book were not healed, and I
couldn't defend this book'' says Vanzant. ``I gave him his money
back, and he still slapped my picture on the cover and put it out
on the market because he was trying to save his company. But he had
no right to sell my soul in the street like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson declined to discuss the dispute, saying he expects a
settlement to be announced soon. However ``Interiors'' raises other
questions _ about Vanzant's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Among the childhood stories she recounts is a claim that her
father, Horace, was a soldier during the Korean War who was
imprisoned for selling bootleg cigarettes. In order to win an early
release, Vanzant says, he volunteered for a secret mission behind
enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
   He survived and, according to Vanzant, the episode was turned
into a book and 1968 motion picture called ``The Dirty Dozen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absurd, there was no such thing,'' said E.M. Nathanson,
author of the World War II novel on which the movie was based.
``There is not an iota of possible truth to that, it was a latrine
rumor. I think he made it up to impress his daughter, and she
swallowed it whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Nathanson's doubts, Vanzant sticks by the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father lived it, and I know what my daddy told me,'' she
says . ``I don't have the paperwork to prove it, but I know he went
on that mission, and when he came back they discharged him
dishonorably.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanzant's father did more than tell war stories. He convinced
her, as a child, that she was ``ugly and stupid,'' a debilitating
stigma she carried for many years. When he died, Vanzant says, she
forgave him, and she's still learning to accept mistakes she made
with her own children, a subject about which she is brutally
candid.
</P>
<P>
   Around the time ``Acts of Faith'' was published, her son Damon
was arrested for stealing cars and selling drugs in Virginia.
Vanzant is raising the son of her youngest daughter, Nisa, who got
pregnant, dropped out of school, and has spent several years
``trying to find herself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I feel like a hypocrite when my son got locked up and
youngest daughter got pregnant? Absolutely,'' Vanzant says. ``I had
to realize it wasn't about me, it was about them, and their
choices. And their wounds. And their need for healing. I just had
to support them and love them through the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanzant's two oldest children work with her in the building she
bought two years ago to house her spiritual headquarters. Her
husband, a childhood friend, also works in her ministry, and the
couple lives in a half-milli

 &HT;    Neferiti. Venus. Cleopatra. BARBIE!
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ How well does Barbie measure up against
the great beauties of history? Is she able to hold her own against
Nefertiti, Cleopatra, Phryne of Athens, Roxane of Bactria, who
married Alexander the Great and who was said to be the most
beautiful woman in Asia?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, maybe not. Barbie has an advantage over many of the
famous women of antiquity in that we know what she looks like, and
we often don't know what they looked like. But this is a
disadvantage too: The unknown can always be more lovely than the
known.
</P>
<P>
   Women mentioned in the Greek Anthology, a collection of 4,000
poems assembled by Byzantine scholars nearly a thousand years ago,
still glow in lines of exquisite beauty, like these, by Meleager:
</P>
<P>
   ``White violets flower
</P>
<P>
   lilies on hill-slopes
</P>
<P>
   narcissus nodding to rain-showers
</P>
<P>
   And the queen of lovers' hopes
</P>
<P>
   the sweet persuasive rose,
</P>
<P>
   Zenophile, more fair than those
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a single line, brief as a Japanese haiku, can be more
ravishing than a whole row of Barbies:
</P>
<P>
   ``Heliodore's myrrhed brows, wreathed curls, swim in petals ...
''
</P>
<P>
   Who Heliodore and Zenophile were, we know not; but it is perhaps
unfair to pit Barbie against poems.
</P>
<P>
   Here, instead, is a gallery of very old women, each considered
unrivaled in her day, beginning with the oldest of all:
</P>
<P>
   Nefertiti. She was the wife of the Egyptian Pharaoh, Amenhotep
IV, also known as Akhenaten, who reigned from 1353 to 1336 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   She was found at Amarna Dec. 6, 1912, by a German expedition led
by Ludwig Borchardt in the studio of an ancient court sculptor,
named Tuthmosis. Today the exquisite bust of Nefertiti is behind
glass in the Egyptian Museum of Charlottenburg, a suburb of Berlin.
It is the single most famous work of Egyptian art in the world,
about 20 inches tall, missing one in-laid eyeball and with one ear
sadly chipped. It never left the studio: It was meant to serve as a
model for all official portraits of the queen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It embodies our contemporary ideal of beauty: a faultless,
symmetrical face enhanced by make-up tastefully applied to brows,
eyelids and lips; and a long, graceful neck,'' writes Biri Fay in
the official 1984 guide to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the famous beauties of antiquity, Nefertiti is perhaps
closest to Barbie, especially the long, swan-like neck. Where
Barbie falls short, however, is in the mouth. Nefertiti's lips are
closed in exquisite, calligraphic line. Barbie _ at least the newer
versions _ wears her Colgate smile, mouth agape, for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   Venus. The famous Venus of Cnidos, by the Athenian sculptor
Praxiteles, dates to about 364 B.C. and is supposedly modeled after
one of the most famous beauties of Athens, a courtesan named
Phryne, who was the talk of the city. She was said to be so
extraordinarily beautiful that she went about veiled at all times,
except once a year, on the Eleusinian festival. Then she went to
the sea, stripped nude and swam in full view of anyone who cared to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   When she was sued for impiety, she went to court and disarmed
the judges by allowing her lawyer, Hypereides, to open her tunic
and reveal her bosom. The judges were so overwhelmed that they
acquitted Phryne on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The original Aphrodite of Cnidos has been long lost, despite a
claim to have identified her badly damaged head in a Vatican Museum
storehouse in 1971 by archaeologist Iris Love (the New York Times
headline read: Love Finds Aphrodite). The best copy is in a small
room in the Vatican Museum and shows the goddess emerging from her
bath, chastely holding a hand in front of her midriff.
</P>
<P>
   She's a very fleshy lady; you almost want to tickle her stomach
or give her a hug. She is far removed from Barbie's taut,
aerobicized body, much closer to what Chaucer described as the
ideal beautiful woman: ``With buttokes brode and brestes round and
hye ...''
</P>
<P>
   While we are talking of classical sculpture, it is well to
mention that most ``ideal'' sculptures show a very definite,
precise ratio of head-to-body proportion. The ideal, seen in the
Farnese Hercules and the Capitoline Gladiator is 7.5 heads' height.
The Aphrodite of Melos in the Louvre, she of the missing arms, is 8
heads high. This is the upper limit, in antiquity. Beyond that
you've got a monster, a freak.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Barbie is a freak by classical standards. The entire
figurine measures 12.5 inches high and her head is 1.5 inches long.
Barbie is 8.33 heads high. Praxiteles would have kicked her out of
his studio.
</P>
<P>
   Roxane. The Bactrian belle whom Alexander conquered and married
on his march to India in 327 B.C. was said to be the most beautiful
woman in all of Asia. Her name meant ``little star.'' She was won,
almost like a fairy-tale princess, after Alexander's troops scaled
the eyeless, steep Sogdian Rock, where lay the palace of her
father, Oxyartes. The wedding took place in this airy, high
fastness.
</P>
<P>
   No historic portrait of her survives, but a description of the
wedding night, painted by the contemporary Greek master, Aetion, is
still extant: ``He showed a very beautiful bedroom on which Roxane
sat. She was an exceptionally lovely girl, but modestly she looked
down at the ground, feeling shy in Alexander's presence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian Renaissance painter, Sodoma, read this passage and
decided to recreate the painting in the upper salon of the
Farnesina Palazzo in Rome, where it can still be seen today. Of
course Sodoma had no idea what Roxane looked like, but the painting
is so extraordinarily gorgeous that it deserves to be looked at, as
one of the great imaginary recreations of antiquity. In it, Roxane
is an improbable blonde, like Barbie, and a little Cupid is helping
her out of her see-through top.
</P>
<P>
   But any similarity to Barbie stops right after the blond hair.
This is an intensely erotic painting and if you were to substitute
Barbie for Sodoma's Roxane in your mind's eye, you would howl with
laughter. Barbie's blank, plastic bust is no match for Roxane's
ample bosom.
</P>
<P>
   But here again, the parallel is unfair. The real Roxane was just
14 when she married Alexander, 28. She was a little girl by our
standards. She may have really resembled Barbie in her skinny,
juvenile way. But she was almost certainly a brunette.
</P>
<P>
   Cleopatra. Finally, consider one of the most famous,
misapprehended women of antiquity. The French philosopher, Blaise
Pascal (1623-1662), is responsible for a famous witticism: ``If
Cleopatra's nose had been one inch longer, history would have been
utterly different.'' He used the shorthand expression,
``Cleopatra's nose,'' twice in his book of meditations, Pensees, to
stand for the absurd, crazy, minute things on which great events
sometimes hinge.
</P>
<P>
   We have portraits of Cleopatra on coins that show her to be a
very strong-featured, beaky-nosed Eastern Mediterranean type _
Pascal needn't have mocked her; her nose was plenty long already.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on ancient sources, Will Durant, in the third volume of
his Story of Civilization, writes that she was ``more probably
blond than brunette. She was not particularly beautiful, but the
grace of her carriage, the vivacity of her body and her mind, the
variety of her accomplishments, the suavity of her manners, the
very melody of her voice, combined with her royal position to make
her a heady wine even for a Roman general.''
</P>
<P>
   She was 24 when she met Mark Antony, 31 when she clasped the
fatal asp to her bosom in 30 B.C. Black revisionist historians such
as J.A. Rogers have claimed that she was black, but classical
scholar Mary Lefkowitz, in her 1996 book, Not Out Of Africa, has
pointed out that she was almost certainly of Greek, Macedonian
stock. She may, just possibly, have had a black grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie would probably have beaten Cleopatra in a beauty contest,
even in antiquity. But then Cleopatra would begin to speak, and
Barbie would simply fade away. The Egyptian queen had that quality
so mispraised on blind dates: She had personality.

 &HT;    Roman doll in coffin dead ringer for Barbie
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On the morning of May 12, 1889,
construction workers building the new Ministry of Justice building
in Rome, on the right bank of the Tiber River near the mausoleum of
the emperor Hadrian, found a small marble coffin embedded in a
layer of blue clay, 25 feet below street level. It was filled with
water.
</P>
<P>
   It was inscribed simply, with a girl's name: Crepereia
Tryphaena. The eminent Roman archaeologist, Rodolfo Lanciani, was
present at the coffin's opening and describes the scene in his 1893
book, Pagan and Christian Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gazing at the skeleton through the veil of clear water, we saw
the skull covered, as it were, with long masses of brown hair,
which were floating in the liquid crystal. ... The mystery of the
hair is easily explained. Together with the springwater, germs or
seeds of an aquatic plant had entered the sarcophagus, settled on
the convex surface of the skull, and developed into long glossy
threads of a dark shade.''
</P>
<P>
   What set Crepereia Tryphaena apart, however, was not her
remains, or her vegetable hair, but the fact that she had been
buried with her doll, ``an exquisite little doll, carved of oak,
which was lying on the scapula, or shoulder blade.''
</P>
<P>
   The doll was about a foot high, just about the size of a modern
Barbie doll, and its limbs were jointed, like Barbie's. They could
still be flexed, even after so many centuries. The oak had hardened
over the years to the toughness of metal.
</P>
<P>
   It was a figurine of a full-grown woman, with breasts and hips,
and an elaborate hair-do piled up on the head in a style popular
with Roman women from about 150 A.D. forward. It had probably worn
clothes, but these had deteriorated over the centuries. She carried
two gold key rings in one hand, similar to those carried by Roman
housewives, which showed they had full authority over domestic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In short, just like Barbie, Crepereia Tryphaena's doll was
intended to show a grown-up young woman, in the full bloom of
health, with a definite role in life: That of a prosperous
housewife or chatelaine, fully in charge of a large, well-ordered
household. She was not a mere plaything, but an expression of hope
in a happy future, a symbol of fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Lanciani called the doll ``exquisite,'' ``a work of art in
itself. It is modeled in perfect imitation of a woman's form and
ranks among the finest of its kind yet found in Roman
excavations.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry, the style of the inscription and other items in the
sarcophagus help date it to around 200 A.D. Crepereia Tryphaena was
not a Roman noblewoman, but the teenaged daughter of a wealthy
freedman, or ex-slave. A betrothal ring inscribed Philotas shows
she was engaged to be married at the time of her early death to a
young Greek named Philotas.
</P>
<P>
   She wore a myrtle crown, a betrothal crown, around her head, and
its leaves were still preserved.
</P>
<P>
   It was customary for young women to give up their dolls on their
wedding day, dedicating them either to Venus or Diana. But because
Crepereia Tryphaena died before she was wed, her doll followed her
into the grave, whence it emerged nearly 1,700 years later, in far
better condition than its owner. Dolls can be a lot tougher than
little girls.
</P>
<P>
   Just as little girls look to Barbie and hope for the same
radiant glamor and success, with a handsome Ken silent and
supportive at their sides, so Crepereia Tryphaena probably loved
her doll for its promise of happy wedlock with Philotas. Both
Barbie and the ancient oaken doll have a kind of talismanic
quality. They are embodiments of wishful, make-believe joy.

 &HT;    Be mime, baby: Not all couples should talk it over
 &HT;    By Matt Reed
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Relationship experts have dished out the
same advice for years: If you've got a problem with your spouse or
sweetheart, talk it over, clear the air, don't avoid confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with the state pushing marriage-license applicants into
pre-wedding counseling, more Florida couples are bound to try
gabbing their way to happiness.
</P>
<P>
   But silence, it turns out, has been vastly underrated.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at two U.S. universities have found that couples
with excellent communication skills are not necessarily happier
than couples with poor skills. In fact, skilled communicators are
more likely to worsen an unhappy marriage, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be married to a skilled communicator if
things aren't going well,'' says Brant Burleson, a communications
professor at Purdue University. ``They know just where to stick the
knife _ and how to twist it to cause maximum pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Burleson and Dr. Wayne Denton, a psychiatrist at Wake Forest
University, studied 60 couples. Half were determined to be happy;
the other half were deemed ``distressed,'' based on results of
screening tests. The couples came from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
   The happiest of the happy couples had wives with strong
communication skills. The women used those skills to improve their
marriages, researchers found. And among those lovey-dovey couples,
the degree of happiness dropped when the women had poor
communication skills.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``distressed'' couples were a different story. The most
miserable were those with wives considered to be skilled
communicators. Those women, already in damaged relationships, used
language and psychology to inflict more pain, making it worse.
</P>
<P>
   With distressed couples, the less skilled the wife, the less
hurt and angry the husband. That doesn't necessarily mean women
should suffer in silence. It simply means that the less-skilled
women had better chances of fixing their marriages because they
weren't doing more damage, the research found.
</P>
<P>
   And the men?
</P>
<P>
   In both groups, the husbands' communication skills _ whether
good or bad _ didn't seem to affect couples' happiness as much as
the wives. That's because women's ``primary confidantes'' tend to
be other women, research showed. Men, on the other hand, seldom
confide in anyone but their wives, so they have more riding on that
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listen to the talk shows, pretty quickly you might come
to realize that problems happen in relationships because couples
don't communicate enough. The pat answer is, `Talk more,'''
Burleson says. ``The clinical implication here is that
communication-skills training is not the panacea it's been made out
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time you feel conflict brewing, Burleson says, ask yourself
this: ``Do you really want to hurt your spouse? Or do you really
need some `time out' so you can focus on the goals of the
relationship?''

 &HT;    HEALTH BRIEFS: Dealing with death as a part of life
 &HT;    (EDS: This is a compilation of health stories which moved to the
wires this week.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Death does not come easily to doctors. Inevitable as
it is in their line of work, it flies in the face of their
training, purpose, even their egos.
</P>
<P>
   But many social and technological issues, such as
physician-assisted suicide and chemotherapy advances, are forcing
doctors to add end-of-life care to their purview of prevention and
treatment of disease and trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way is the American Medical Association with its new
program, ``Educating Physicians in End-of-Life Care.'' The
organization selected 250 health care and other professionals
across the nation to attend four regional workshops to better learn
how to help terminally ill patients and their families. The AMA
trainees, in turn, will educate their local communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death as failure is how many doctors think,'' said Dr. Russell
K. Portenoy, department chairman of palliative care at New York's
Beth Israel Hospital. ``Our medical model is returning patients to
a state of health.'' Portenoy is one of several doctors leading the
AMA two-year initiative, which is supported with a grant from the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1 million Americans who die annually, only 10 percent die
of an unexpected event such as an accident or sudden onset of
disease. The rest either face protracted fatal illnesses, such as
cancer and muscle-degenerative disorders, or the predictable and
steady decline of aging and its chronic conditions _ diabetes,
heart disease, Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   While more and more hospice centers and home-health care workers
are helping patients in their final days, the AMA wants end-of-life
care, known as palliative care, to begin much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors above all are human beings and they are just as
uncomfortable with this subject as others,'' says Dr. Linda Emanuel
of Chicago's Northwestern University Hospital. ``But patients
expect physicians to introduce the topic of long-term planning for
their condition, and it's often left to others in the medical
system.''
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the End-of-Life project, contact the
Institute for Ethics, American Medical Association, 515 N. State
Street, Chicago, IL 60610; 312-464-4979.

   Minority workers lag in health coverage, study finds
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White workers are far more likely to have health
insurance paid by their employers than blacks or Hispanics,
according to a recently-released study.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund found that 69
percent of white workers were covered by employer-sponsored
insurance, compared with 52 percent of black workers and 44 percent
of Hispanic workers. The study found even wider disparities among
different occupations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A variety of additional barriers may account for the
difference in health care coverage rates between whites and
minorities,'' said Allyson Hall, lead author of the study.
``Certain groups may decline health care coverage not only because
of financial concerns, but also because of differing perceptions
regarding the propensity to become ill and the overall need for
health care coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 18 percent of workers between 18 and 64 were
uninsured in 1997, an increase from 15.7 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, minorities have been more likely than whites to be
uninsured. They often work in industries or in part-time jobs that
do not offer coverage, said Karen Davis, president of the
Commonwealth Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But even among fulltime workers, 37 percent of Hispanics were
uninsured, compared to 20 percent of blacks and 12 percent of
whites.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of workers in manufacturing jobs had
employer-provided health coverage. Whites were covered 85 percent
of the time, compared to 71 percent for blacks and 60 percent for
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Large firms were more likely to provide coverage than small
firms. In firms of more than 1,000 employees, 85 percent of whites
were covered, compared to 76 percent blacks and 72 percent
Hispanics. In companies of less than 100 workers, 63 percent of
whites were covered, compared to 47 percent for blacks and 38
percent for Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Lower wage earners also were less likely to be insured by an
employer. Among workers earning less than $7 an hour, 56 percent of
whites were covered, compared to 47 percent of blacks and 35
percent of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers who are poor, not well-educated, not U.S. citizens,
unmarried, younger or live in an inner city or rural area are less
likely than their counterparts to have employers-based health
insurance,'' the report concluded. ``Most of these characteristics
have a greater effect on minority than white populations.''

 &HT;    The Next Deion? Bailey set to make impact in NFL draft
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Roland ``Champ'' Bailey Jr. had the inscription
``DB-43'' stenciled onto his jersey at the NFL combine last week,
but he didn't need white block printing to distinguish him from the
46 other defensive-back prospects on hand.
</P>
<P>
   His performances have been enough.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, a former University of Georgia player, is being compared
to Deion Sanders and is listed as the No. 1 cornerback by scouts
preparing for the 1999 NFL draft on April 17.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts say Bailey should be selected in the first five picks and
might make an even bigger immediate impact on the league in 1999
than Oakland Raiders cornerback Charles Woodson, last season's
defensive rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's truly a great player, so I guess (the nickname Champ)
fits,'' Pittsburgh Steelers director of football operations Tom
Donahoe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His game is as good as his name,'' Donahoe said. ``When the
ball is in his hands, something is going to happen, and it's going
to be something good. The only question about him is how he's going
to be used at the NFL level. He's so good and such a catalyst that
there is going to be a natural temptation to do too much with
Champ.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has sound techniques and an economy of motion rare for
such a young player. While he might lack the explosiveness of
Sanders, scouts think he will be the most complete cornerback to
enter the NFL since the former Falcons star in 1989. Bailey said he
is flattered by such comparisons but won't permit them to swell his
head.
</P>
<P>
   A strained hamstring, suffered running track this winter, kept
Bailey from challenging Sanders' combine record of 4.28 seconds in
the 40-yard dash.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, few prospects have matched the versatility of
Bailey, a Folkston native. During his final season in Athens, he
averaged 87 plays a game _ on offense, defense and special teams _
and excelled.
</P>
<P>
   Most scouts said the variety of roles at Georgia will enhance
Bailey's draft status. But those same scouts said Bailey should be
be evaluated as a cornerback _ and with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The corner spot has become a glamour position in the NFL and has
outdistanced wide receiver in overall significance. In the last two
drafts, twice as many cornerbacks as wide receivers (12-6) have
gone in the first round. During the '90s, the first round has
included 34 cornerbacks and 26 wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The one-year contract tender for ``franchise'' free-agent
corners has increased to $4.269 million; only quarterback, at $5.88
million, is higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a premium position, and Bailey is a premium player,'' New
England secondary coach Ron Lynn said. ``There aren't many
'shut-down' corners like him who come along very often. Why clutter
up the kid's mind with offensive stuff his first year? To me, you
put him on the corner and let him play.''
</P>
<P>
   With the draft about seven weeks away, most teams rate Bailey as
the third-best prospect, behind Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch and
Texas tailback Ricky Williams. The only defender who might go ahead
of him is Southern Cal linebacker Chris Claiborne.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cincinnati appears to be leaning toward taking a
quarterback with the third overall choice, the Bengals will
consider Bailey to help shore up their secondary. ``He'd be the
least risk,'' Bengals owner Mike Brown said. ``He'd come in and he
would start. He'd be good. Take him first, and you could move on
then in later rounds to helping yourself elsewhere. You'd know you
had a least one 'keeper,' that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he would prefer to spend his rookie season in the
NFL playing cornerback before expanding his horizons. He knows that
the position is daunting, with defenders one completion away from
disaster and disdain. But he said he is ready for the challenge of
trying to stop the league's top receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team I've met with here asks me what I like better, and
I've told them all I want to (play) cornerback,'' Bailey said.
``That's where I feel I can make the most impact for a team right
away. I really don't know what my upside would be (at wide
receiver). With the limited exposure I got there, I played pretty
well. But I really want to focus in that first season on being a
good cornerback.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland coach Jon Gruden, who flirted with the idea of teaching
Woodson a few basic pass patterns last year, agreed that Bailey
should be a one-position performer in 1999. Even in Woodson's
second NFL season, Gruden said, he might not play more than five or
six snaps a game at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a risk in putting him at wideout,'' Gruden said. ``We
want him on the field to be the guy erasing the other team's best
receiver. Champ will be the same, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the cornerbacks invited to the combine this
decade, Bailey is not noted for his trash-talking, and personnel
directors said they found that lack to be refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play with a lot of confidence, but I play calm,'' said
Bailey, who measured with combine officials at 5-foot-11 1/2, 184
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey will work out for NFL scouts in Athens on March 17, and
some might be surprised at his speed. In two meets in which he ran
the 55-yard dash, Bailey was timed unofficially at the 40-yard mark
in under 4.3 seconds. Such timings are unscientific, but they offer
a hint as to how well Bailey might perform for scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already a top five (pick),'' Tennessee Titans general
manager Floyd Reese said. ``If he goes out and runs under 4.4, look
out.''

 &HT;    River waste killing marine life in Florida
 &HT;    By Sally D. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Jet black'' waste from a
citrus-processing plant south of Fort Pierce has been leaking into
the North Fork of the St. Lucie River, killing fish and microscopic
marine life along a 7-mile stretch of the waterway, state officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this has been killing fish since the beginning of
February,'' Department of Environmental Protection scientist Greg
Graves said. ``Nothing can live in that whole stretch of the river.
It has no dissolved oxygen in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The affected area reaches from the junction of Five Mile and Ten
Mile creeks south to Prima Vista Boulevard in Port St. Lucie,
including a section designated as an outstanding Florida waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists last week pinpointed SunPure's Indian River Foods
processing plant on Selvitz Road as the source of the pollution,
Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid waste, a byproduct of the juice-making process, is
usually stored in a canal on a nearby citrus grove, where it is
used in a diluted form for irrigation. But officials said it broke
through a rusted culvert and traveled down another grove's canals
into the river.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a citizen's complaint, DEP river-keeper Dana Fike
and scientist Doug Strom took a boat up the narrow, winding river
and saw the discharge coming from the grove.
</P>
<P>
   The waste, which Graves described as ``jet black,'' may contain
complex sugars that rob the water of dissolved oxygen which most
fish and microscopic marine creatures need to survive. Final test
results on samples of the waste will be available later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Air-breathing fish such as tarpon can survive in oxygen-poor
waters, but dozens of other species die. DEP officials said they
couldn't estimate the number of fish killed. Many of the fish were
eaten by birds and tarpon or sank to the river bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can be done, really,'' Graves said. ``The water moves
back and forth with the tides, and fish that swim into that area
will die. This could go on another month.''
</P>
<P>
   Resident Franklin Lofton, who lives near the place where Five
Mile and Ten Mile creeks converge to form the North Fork, said he
has seen dead mullet and small-mouth bass floating in the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really like to see this river become something other than
a sewer,'' Lofton said. ``Manatees are here with their babies
now.''
</P>
<P>
   An unexplained fish kill in the same area last April could be
linked to the processing plant discharge, Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   John Moulton, DEP's assistant regional director, said the
processing plant could be fined or forced to buy fish to restock
the river, but penalties would not be imposed until bureaucratic
procedures, including warning letters, have been followed. That
could take months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indian River Foods officials responded quickly to stop the
discharge, filling a canal to stop the flow and repairing damaged
culverts, Moulton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a lot of pride in handling our waste,'' plant manager
Larry Gray said Monday. ``As soon as we discovered the leak, we
immediately dammed it off and repaired the culvert. We are very
concerned about this.''

FORGET TAXES; FILL OUT YOUR NCAA BRACKETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Around this time of year comes a matter of paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   It's either that imposing-looking 1998 1040 Forms and
Instruction booklet from the Internal Revenue Service or a blank
bracket for the March Madness office pool.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Tax forms or college basketball? College basketball or tax
forms?
</P>
<P>
   Having made that point, here are a number of ways to prepare
yourself for March Madness by using the vast resources of the
Internet:
</P>
<P>
   General information: At FinalFour.net (www.finalfour.net), users
can get the NCAA-sanctioned lowdown, which is a good thing because
the NCAA has exclusive rights to cybercasts of the games. Other
cool features include archives of cybercasts, updated brackets and
venue information, official NCAA merchandise and a
Shockwave-powered interactive game for young users.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a big-media perspective, college basketball sections
at CBS SportsLine, ESPN.com, Fox Sports and CNN/SI have news
updates, commentary and lots of interactivity (March Madness
contests, polls and chats).
</P>
<P>
   Those who like to woof it up can turn to the college basketball
discussion newsgroup (rec.sport.basketball.college).
</P>
<P>
   Handy software: Does the thought of using office supplies to run
the March Madness office pool bother you? Well, let's say it does.
The 'Net has several software applications that can set up
customized office-pool brackets, which could save pool managers
countless trips to the copier.
</P>
<P>
   Turbo Tourney (www.sidelinesoftware.com) and Tourney Tracker
(www.microfest.com) have Windows-based programs that can automate
your office-pool bracket, which is good news if you're the one
organizing a March Madness pool.
</P>
<P>
   For a fee, the programs will calculate several forms of bracket
scoring, customize reports for contestants and alert them via
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Several free programs are also available for download, including
Hoops Manager '99 (www.netsiteone.com) and Tourney64 Basketball
Pool Manager (www.tourney64.com).
</P>
<P>
   Online contests: While the big-media sites have pick'em
contests, Wall Street Sports has the It's Madness $1 Million
Challenge (www.itsmadness.com). Simply predict the winners of all
63 men's tournament games and you'll be eligible for a $1 million
grand prize _ actually $25,000 per year for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you win $1 million, you'll certainly have to pay
more attention to that 1040 form.
</P>
<P>
   FANTASY ALERT: From the some-folks-have-no-life department, it's
the Fantasy Baseball Experience, live via the 'Net from Tampa, Fla.
The newly formed Fantasy Sports Players Association, a nonprofit
trade organization that wants to protect consumer rights for
fantasy leagues, will be host to this gathering of fantasy
hobbyists beginning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the event will be Baseball Weekly's sixth League of
Alternative Reality draft, which brings together players renowned
for their knowledge of both baseball and fantasy baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy baseball followers can track the draft online through a
Webcast available at Commissioner.com (labr.commissioner.com).
</P>
<P>
   FANTASY II: Yahoo! Sports (sports.yahoo.com) has thrown out the
first fantasy pitch by introducing its Yahoo! Sports Fantasy
Baseball. At the free site, managers can participate in public
leagues or configure a scoring and statistics system for their own
private leagues.
</P>
<P>
   AUDIO CHECK: For those who prefer to hear bull riding over the
'Net, the Professional Bull Riders' St. Louis Open is scheduled to
be cybercast this weekend. The cybercast can be accessed through
the PBR's official site (www.pbrnow.com) or through Broadcast.com.
... All 22 men's and women's games during the Big 12 Conference
tournaments, beginning with women's games tonight, are scheduled to
be Webcast on the Big 12's official site (www.big12sports.com).

 &HT;    FEW TV FATHERS PROJECT POSITIVE IMAGES
 &HT;    440&AMP;add. With TV-FATHERS-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (e)
entertainment categories.

   WASHINGTON _ Father rarely knows best on prime-time television
any more.
</P>
<P>
   Fathers are central, recurring figures on only 15 of 102
prime-time network comedies or dramas, and only four of these
programs portray the dad as both competent and caring, the National
Fatherhood Initiative reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of good dads on TV is especially problematic because
nearly 40 percent of the nation's children do not live with their
biological fathers, and whole communities exist where almost all
the households are headed by single mothers, said Wade Horn,
president of the non-partisan organization that aims to promote
responsible fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``For millions of America's children, the primary daily contact
they have with the idea of a father is the time they spend watching
a father on television,'' the group's ``Fatherhood &AMP; TV'' viewer
analysis concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were based on a five-week review of the prime-time
programming on the ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and WB networks during the
late autumn of 1998. Shows were rated if they met three criteria: a
father was a recurring character, the relationship between the
father and his children was a defining feature, and the father's
children were 18 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   The reviewers _ National Fatherhood Initiative staffers _ found
only 15 programs, or 14.7 percent of the total schedule, that
featured fatherhood enough to be rated. NBC's ``Frasier'' did not
meet the criteria, for instance, because the central character's
son lives across the country in Boston with his mother, and they
are rarely mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 programs were rated as to the the dad's involvement in
family activities, one-on-one engagement with his child, guidance
as a positive role model, competence both inside and outside the
family, and priority of placing his family role first.
</P>
<P>
   The study rated only four programs as portraying fathers
positively: ``7th Heaven'' on WB, ``Promised Land'' on CBS, ``Smart
Guy'' on WB, and ``Two of a Kind'' on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime-time TV and the network bosses have a lot of work to do
to improve the way fathers are viewed and portrayed,'' said Rep.
Joseph Pitts, R-Pa., co-chairman of the Congressional Task Force on
Fatherhood Promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that it is ``unrealistic'' to expect
television programmers alone ``to bear the responsibility for
promoting responsible fatherhood.'' However, it said TV should
portray more ``responsible, committed and responsible fathers'' at
a time when such dads are missing from the lives of millions of
young viewers.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Horn said there has been a dramatic change in television
families over the decades. Gone are most of the wise, loving dads
from '50s and '60s programs such as ``Father Knows Best'' and
``Leave It to Beaver,'' and even '80's programs such as ``The Cosby
Show'' and ``Family Ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's TV families mainly feature dads who are either competent
men but uninvolved parents, like the father on CBS's ``The Nanny''
and Fox's ``That 70s Show,'' or caring, engaged fathers who are
incompetent like Tim ``The Toolman'' Taylor on ABC's ``Home
Improvement.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, fathers and father figures have largely
disappeared from TV families, noted Horn. In the '50s and '60s, the
mother was the one missing from non-intact families on programs
such as ``My Three Sons,'' ``The Andy Griffith Show,'' and
``Bachelor Father.'' Today it is the fathers who are gone on shows
popular with children such as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,''
``Sabrina,'' and ``Jessie.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, when many families watch TV together,
``network television is fatherless,'' the report said. On NBC,
there is only one father on the prime-time schedule, Paul Reiser's
character on ``Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few permissible stereotypes still thriving on
television is the dumb dad like Fox's Homer Simpson, said Horn.

A UNIQUE FLIGHT OF FANCY: AUDUBON AUCTIONING RIGHT TO NAME NEW BIRD
SPECIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Immortality _ at least in birding circles _
will go on the auction block Friday when the Texas Audubon Society
sells the right to name a species of bird recently discovered in
the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Audubon officials described it as ``a subtly beautiful
antshrike,'' a robin-size bird that eats insects.
</P>
<P>
   The bird was discovered last year by Bret Whitney of Austin, who
donated the right to name it.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum bid: $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   It happens Friday at Bass Performance Hall, where the Texas
Audubon Society will host a gala in honor of its 100th birthday,
one of several celebrations planned statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for one committed
auction guest,'' said Catriona Glazebrook, executive director of
the Texas Audubon Society. ``Never before has such a unique
privilege been made available to the public, and the benefit to
bird conservation will be an unprecedented one.''
</P>
<P>
   The highest bidder will have the honor of adding the Latinized
version of his or her name, or any name, to the scientific name for
the new species of thamnophilus antshrike.
</P>
<P>
   Should the winner be named ``Bubba,'' for instance, the bird
could become known as ``Thamnophilus bubbaus.'' The winner also
gets a watercolor painting of the bird and a taped recording of its
song.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bird is extremely nice-looking, especially the female,''
said Noreen Damude, director of bird conservation for the Texas
Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   Damude said 74 percent of the proceeds from the sale will be
used to launch the Important Bird Areas Program in Texas _ an
effort to identify the state's important bird habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know a lot of them, but what hasn't been done is monitoring
and habitat management,'' she said. ``Also, since Texas is 97
percent privately owned, the biggest challenge is getting private
landowners to join in wanting to conserve wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   The other 26 percent of the auction proceeds will be used to
prepare a field guide to the birds of Brazil, where the antshrike
was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Charley Amos of Arlington, president of
Audubon's Fort Worth chapter, said he believes that an area on the
border between Fort Worth and Arlington may deserve classification
and protection as an important bird area, or IBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at the Village Creek Drying Beds, an area at the
intersection of Green Oaks Boulevard and Fielder Road,'' Amos said.
``During migration we counted about 275 different species that use
that area. We would like to get it declared an important bird
area.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Audubon chapter in Texas was formed March 4, 1899, in
Galveston in an effort to save birds whose feathers had become an
important feature in ladies' hats. The Texas Audubon Society now
has 20 chapters with 40,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Amos said the Fort Worth chapter was formed in 1941 and now has
about 1,500 members. Those interested in joining can call him at
(817) 265-9208.
</P>
<P>
   Several people, including Lady Bird Johnson, will be recognized
at the event Friday for their contributions to Audubon. The former
first lady has been invited but is not expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   More than four dozen items will be auctioned, including artworks
by Stuart and Scott Gentling of Fort Worth, air travel, hotel
accommodations, meals, jewelry, symphony tickets, wildlife tours,
gift certificates and various bird accouterments such as feeders,
baths and houses.

WHY WE'RE SEEING DOLLAR SIGNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My sister is a teacher, and one of her students asked this
question: What's the origin of the dollar sign, and why is it the
letter ``S'' with a line drawn through it?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.W., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``$'' sign appears to be a descendant of ``ps,'' an
abbreviation for the Spanish peso.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Adams writes in ``Return of the Straight Dope'' that
Florian Cajori researched the topic extensively for his book, ``A
History of Mathematical Notations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spanish dollar, also known as the `peso de 8 reales,' was
the principle coin in circulation in the United States up until
1795,'' Adams writes. ``As time went by, the P and the S tended to
get mashed together and the result was $.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 18th century, ``$'' began to be used exclusively as
the symbol for the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a big fan of ``Les Miserables'' and I understand there's
a newsletter called ``The Barricade.'' Where can I find this? Also,
will the show be in Texas soon?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.D., Granbury, Texas
</P>

NEW YORK NEEDS TOUGH LAWS, NOT GIULIANI JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Walking by the Albany City Hall Friday, I found
myself wondering, ``Is Jerry Jennings as nutty as Rudy Giuliani?''
</P>
<P>
   So, I stuck my head inside the mayor's office. He was out, but
he came roaring in a few minutes later, preparing to do the local
radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
   What did I want, the mayor demanded?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to have your cops start confiscating the cars of
people they bust on drunken driving charges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you, nuts?'' Jerry Jennings responded. ``Me and the
police are going to serve as judge and jury? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Good answer. But that's precisely what Rudolph Giuliani is doing
in New York City. That's what some other dangerously demented
politicians started doing in Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long
Island, once Giuliani gave them the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy, Rudy, Rudy. What are we going to do with you? You can take
the mayor out of the prosecutor's office, but you can't take the
prosecutor's office out of the mayor. By any yardstick, Giuliani
has been a good mayor for New York City. Sure, he has benefited
from a booming economy. And, sure, the dramatic drop in the city's
crime rate has been mirrored across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But, on balance, Rudy rules. Rightly, he gets credit for
restoring New York City, the world's greatest urban center, to its
past glory. He has presided over the rebirth of Times Square. He
has waged righteous war on the seedier aspects of urban life.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, though, you have to wonder if this guy
doesn't have a screw loose somewhere. If he's not showing up in
drag on ``Saturday Night Live'' or leaping into some pointless
personal dispute with somebody, large or small, he's embarked on
yet another quest to display his relentlessly authoritarian
tendencies _ like his efforts to chase hot dog vendors off the
streets of Manhattan. With Giuliani as mayor, you could get busted
in the Big Apple for scalping low numbers at the deli.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, drunken drivers kill somebody in America every half hour
and injure somebody every minute-and-a-half. Sure, about 42 people
a year are killed by drunken drivers in New York City. OK, the city
cops bust 7,500 people a year for drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   But the way to fix that is to persuade those spaghetti-spined
wusses in the New York Legislature to mandate longer terms for
drunken drivers. Why, for instance, should Michele Tracey, who
drunkenly ran down and killed a 15-year-old girl in Troy, get only
five years in the slammer, as she did Friday? Confiscating the
property of the accused before a judge and/or jury finds them
guilty is no real solution, even though some district attorneys
have done it a few times.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Well, believe it or not, cops and prosecutors do make
mistakes once in a while. That's why we have courtrooms to begin
with.
</P>
<P>
   Under Giuliani's system, anybody wrongly accused will be without
a car until and unless he or she can prove his or her innocence _
not just in criminal court but in a separate civil court
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's plan surely will be challenged, and it might not
hold up. On the other hand it might. This dangerous ground was
broken nicely by letting cops grab the assets of suspected, but
unconvicted, drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, only the Legislature can protect New York state's
residents from the law enforcement excesses of Giuliani and his
misguided imitators. Show some guts, lawmakers. Pass a few laws to
curb this nuttiness.
</P>
<P>
   Stop Rudy before he confiscates again.
</P>
<P>
   And stop the drunken drivers, too.

CAN YOU NAME TEXAS' ORIGINAL VICE PRESIDENT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BUD KENNEDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our ignorance of Texas history has been bared for embarrassing
public view of late.
</P>
<P>
   First, McDonald's published a page of Texas ``facts'' that is so
flawed, it is useful only to wrap burgers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a Dallas newspaper reported that one-third of Texans and
``Tejanos'' can't name anyone who died in the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   Such memory loss is common among Texans who inhaled the Austin
air in the 1970s, or any Texan who has consumed too much Lone Star
beer. That's why this space is reserved today for a Texas
Independence Day history discourse, on one particular bit of
Republic lore.
</P>
<P>
   I know a favorite trivia question that stumps every audience. It
begins: ``Who became the very first president of Texas?'' Somebody
typically guesses Sam Houston, and he was the first ``elected''
president, succeeding appointed provisional President David Burnet.
</P>
<P>
   Most Texans recognize the name Burnet. They know the namesake
city, or the street in downtown Fort Worth, although city signs now
misspell it ``Burnett.'' (Maybe the signs were printed by
McDonald's.)
</P>
<P>
   I have yet to find a Texan, though, who can name Texas' original
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Remember this guy. He's relevant to modern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   When the struggling Republic of Texas was barely days old, the
second-in-command was a Texas settler from Mexico. He had been a
city council member, representative and senator in his native
Merida.
</P>
<P>
   From Day One on March 2, 1836, Texas was built jointly by two
cultures speaking two languages. The state's original No. 2
executive was Manuel Lorenzo Justiniano de Zavala y S enz _ known
as Vice President Lorenzo de Zavala.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a genuine intellectual,'' said Texas historian Margaret
S. Henson of Houston, author of a 1996 biography titled ``Lorenzo
de Zavala: The Pragmatic Idealist.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on: ``He was the best educated man at
Washington-on-the-Brazos,'' where Texans declared independence from
Coahuila and Mexico. ``He was the most experienced politician. He
was a published author who spoke three languages.''
</P>
<P>
   A seminary graduate and political progressive who had ascended
to become secretary of the treasury in Mexico, Zavala was sent on a
diplomatic mission to Paris as unrest began in Texas. A political
enemy of President Santa Anna, Zavala knew he could not return to
Mexico safely and instead returned to land he had bought in
southeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretly, I think he wanted to go back and restore Mexico,''
Henson said. ``But he knew his only hope was in Texas. ... I bet
there was a very interesting conversation when he saw Santa Anna
again after the battle of San Jacinto.''
</P>
<P>
   The final battle was fought April 21 near Zavala's land,
although he was safely hidden away in Galveston. Now, Zavala is
remembered with a historical marker near the San Jacinto Monument,
across from the Battleship Texas.
</P>
<P>
   His 10-month term as vice president ended when he resigned with
Burnet in October, making way for elected President Houston and
Vice President Mirabeau Lamar. Days later, Zavala's rowboat
overturned in the bayou. He fell ill and died Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he must have been depressed at the end,'' Henson said.
``He didn't like Burnet. Burnet didn't give him enough to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``And on the East Coast, he was well-known as this cosmopolitan
thinker.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in Texas, he kept running into discrimination. The Anglos
treated anyone from Mexico like some kind of servant. Even the
other Hispanic leaders didn't trust him, because he was from a
completely different part of Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Henson began studying Zavala when Hispanic
preservationists in Houston asked about his background. As she
recalls, they asked: ``The only Hispanic name around Houston is
Zavala. Can you tell us about him? We don't really know anything
about Zavala.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Texas needs to know more about Zavala.

GOOD HEALTH IS NOTHING TO SNEEZE AT (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``People who feel well are sick people neglecting themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jules Romains, French novelist, poet, dramatist
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what would happen if we spent as much time talking
about our good health as we do talking about our illnesses?
Certainly, I'm concerned about my friends' and family's state of
well-being. If they're going to be hospitalized or undergo
diagnostic tests, I'd like to be aware of it so that I can support
them. But some people are not content being sick alone, they have
to make you sick with them.
</P>
<P>
   I made the mistake of coughing during lunch one day and someone
commented, ``Oh, you're getting that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What stuff?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that awful virus that's going around. Next you'll have a
fever and cough and then you won't be able to walk for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was eating a cracker and it got stuck in my throat,'' I
protested. ``I'm not sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you are,'' she insisted. ``That's how it starts. The same
thing happened to me. You'd better go home and get in the bed right
away. Sometimes, your legs give out while you're driving. You'll
probably crash before you make it to your house. I sure feel sorry
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   I was in bed for two days before my husband said, ``Look, this
is not ER. You are not sick and that woman was not a doctor. Go
outside and get some fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think I'm exaggerating, just try telling a few people
that you're having a root canal next week. You will hear the most
amazing and incredible tales of death and destruction than any
``Star Trek'' episode you have ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   ``My cousin had a root canal and it made her eyes turn blue and
her voice got real deep, like Barry White. Her mother kicked her
out and she traveled with the circus for a while. Now she works in
Jamaica selling mangoes to the tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy at my job got a root canal and he left his wife the
same day. Two days later he was in a car crash and totaled his
sports car. That tooth popped out and now he wears it around his
neck on a gold chain. His wife divorced him too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that this girl had that procedure done and as soon as
she left the dentist's office, an elbow grew out her neck and now
she has to look down all of the time. Her shoes always look great,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing, I say. Simply amazing.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the procedure is, someone has had it before or
they know someone who did and it definitely didn't go well. It
could be a technique that was just invented in Geneva yesterday and
I'm certain someone would say, ``No, my sister had that same
surgery except they went in through her navel and came out of her
nose. And you definitely do not want to be around when she
sneezes.''
</P>
<P>
   We all know that the vast majority of medical procedures are
successful. Sure, there are risks and side effects but science is
truly amazing. However, there was the time that my friend had that
sinus surgery and ... oh, never mind.

STOPPING HATE BEFORE IT KILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VERONICA FLORES  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The conviction of white supremacist John William
King last week for the murder of James Byrd Jr., a black man,
begins to bring closure to a horrific chapter in the nation's
history of race relations.
</P>
<P>
   But the book didn't begin, nor will it end with the King trial,
as a report by the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law
Center demonstrates. According to the report, the number of hate
groups in the country increased again last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hate and intolerance are dark threads deeply woven into our
society's fabric. They give rise to the environment that fostered
King's prejudices and threatens all communities, not just his own
in Jasper, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his writings in the scrapbook of a fellow prison
inmate. In it, King professed, ``We, my Aryan Brother in arms, will
rightfully claim what's ours and in the end our feet will be washed
in the blood of the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The scary thing is that King is only 24. He didn't evolve
overnight into the monster that killed Byrd. Neither did his moral
moorings come loose in a vacuum. King's hate steadily was fed,
tattoos on his body eventually mirroring the thoughts in his head:
a black man being lynched; a Madonna carrying a baby Jesus with
horns; Nazi symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Other events throughout the country and even in Jasper show how
King might have arrived at this point.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana last week, a white man was convicted of a hate
crime for trying to burn two cars belonging to black motorists.
</P>
<P>
   And in Virginia Beach, Va., a 19-year-old man pleaded guilty to
trying to burn a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple.
</P>
<P>
   In Jasper, school officials were haggling with the parents of a
student who, amid the raw feelings surrounding Byrd's death and
King's murder trial, found it fit to wear to class his Confederate
flag belt buckle. The boy's parents called in help from a nearby Ku
Klux Klan group when the boy was suspended for refusing to leave
his buckle at home.
</P>
<P>
   While not murderous acts, they reveal an indifference to
humanity. For these folks, Byrd's brutal death was only a blip on
their screen, if they even bothered to blink.
</P>
<P>
   Whites aren't immune from becoming hate-crime victims, but
groups that hate minorities, Jews and gays far outnumber other
separatist organizations. And, make no mistake, they're hungry for
more recruits. Their new tool, according to the law center, is the
Internet. Cyberspace gives hate groups a forum from which they can
reach not only the traditional working-class white teen-ager, but
increasingly the middle-class youth in suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Along with white power rock 'n' roll music and the ongoing
recruiting efforts of fringe groups, the outreach has bumped the
number of hate groups to 537 from 474 in 1997. The Southern Poverty
Law Center previously recorded a 20-percent increase in hate groups
from 1996 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Take a good look. This is how John William King learned to hate.
Right under our noses. In our back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It's) something that is a virus,'' Jasper County District
Attorney James Gray told jurors in closing arguments last week.
``It's something that's dangerous. It's something that spreads from
one person to another.''
</P>
<P>
   But hate also is something that each of us can stop, if only by
challenging those who espouse it. Byrd's murder is all the
motivation we need.

   They're trying to counteract Darwin and the law of survival of
the fittest. It's survival of the fattest, and the fattest are
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Now the auto industry and federal safety officials are arguing
about how to warn people that certain sport utility vehicles roll
over easily. Come on. We want buyers of sport utility vehicles to
live?
</P>
<P>
   The current warning already fills visors of SUVs. Automakers are
fighting a new graphic that shows a tipping SUV with a passenger
falling out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one looks at these warnings, except as the
defense's Exhibit A when some yuppie sues the manufacturer after a
triple lutz in a Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: Warning labels may cause unhealthy ideological battles
in America.
</P>
<P>
   A group called the Christian Action Network wants to put ``HC''
labels (for ``homosexual content'') on television shows with gay
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers are putting labels on bottles suggesting that wine
may be good for the health. This is opposed by a strange alliance
of Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and do-good liberals who think
reading the labels will send innocents straight to hell or Betty
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Stamped on the side of guns are inscriptions like the following,
found on Berettas: ``Warning: Read instruction manual before
using.''
</P>
<P>
   The manual tells you useful things, like to unload the gun
before cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Do we really want people who clean loaded guns to live? I don't
know about women, but how many red-blooded American males have ever
read an instruction manual before they used anything?
</P>
<P>
   The first time a man looks at a manual is when he can't find a
car's jack, reset a videocassette recorder or put his disassembled
gun back together.
</P>
<P>
   If anti-gun groups really wanted to stop gun sales, they'd
legislate more warnings to be stamped all over firearms, ruining
the blue-steel allure.
</P>
<P>
   Make guns as wordy as ladders, and no one would buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Well, except criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: The number of warnings on a product is in inverse
proportion to the power of the product's lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The ladder lobby isn't as powerful as the gun lobby, so every
surface of a ladder has a sticker saying ``Danger'' and a picture
of a stick figure taking a header.
</P>
<P>
   A Davidson aluminum ladder has six warning labels with 27
warnings, ranging from ``Danger: electrical hazard, watch for
wires'' to ``Face ladder when climbing up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Do we really want people who go up ladders backward to live?
</P>
<P>
   A hardware store is a veritable festival of warning labels.
</P>
<P>
   A tack hammer had a sticker that took up half the handle. It
started with ``Warning: protect your eyes`` and ended with ``Strike
squarely _ avoid glancing blows.''
</P>
<P>
   Like that's going to help if you failed shop in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Super Glue has a useful one. ``Caution: eye irritant. Instantly
bonds skin. See back panel.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, your eyes are bonded shut, but if you could see the back
panel you'd read ``Do not use Super Glue Remover or nail polish
remover in case of eye contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Do we really want people who rub nail polish remover in their
eyes to live?
</P>
<P>
   Warning: Warning labels warn us about all the wrong things.
</P>
<P>
   People with half a brain know not to leave loaded guns within
reach of children and not to stand on the top step of a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't know, they're definitely not going to read some
little sticker _ or be able to read it.

RUSSIA FACES A NEW COLD WAR: SOARING DRUG USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG _ From her seat in the corner of the bar, Kseniya
scans the clients, looking for the trick she'll need to score
within a few hours if she's to pay for her next hit of heroin.
Actually, there is no ``if.'' She has to score, so she will.
</P>
<P>
   It's a slow night at the 777 Bar, a dimly lit cellar dive where
Kseniya and her teenage friends take a break from the subzero cold.
It's a 10-minute walk from the grandeur of the museums and theaters
that make St. Petersburg one of the world's cultural capitals. They
might as well be on another planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, I'm a star,'' Kseniya says in her dreamy drawl.
</P>
<P>
   And a statistic. Kseniya is one of an estimated 3 million
Russian drug addicts, many of them young people from middle-class
families like her own.
</P>
<P>
   That figure represents an astonishing leap since the early '90s,
when addicts numbered in the thousands. Today, Kseniya is part of
an illegal narcotics trade that, according to Russia's Interior
Ministry, has burgeoned into a $2 billion annual industry.
</P>
<P>
   The clock is ticking for her. Russian heroin addicts have a
four-year life expectancy from the moment they get hooked,
according to health officials. That span must be lower for
$2-an-hour prostitutes. Not long ago, Kseniya stabbed a man who
tried to rape her.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, 20-year-old Kseniya should be dead. But she is
savvy. She and her friends know not to call an ambulance when
someone overdoses, because the drivers let junkies die. She has
seen it happen.
</P>
<P>
   They know how to pull each other back from an overdose. She
knows how to shoot up in her groin to keep her arms and legs
unmarked. She knows in which dark passageways and abandoned
apartments to hide. She knows she has to kick this habit and fly
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanna go to Ukraine,'' Kseniya says, distantly. ``I got a
grandmother there. I'm gonna live in the village and milk cows.''
</P>
<P>
   Her attention returns to the bar. There are a couple of stoners
gyrating and screaming along with music by Courtney Love: ``Go on,
take everything, take everything.'' There is her 18-year-old
brother, Igor, who got her hooked on heroin last year and steals
from their mother to pay for his habit. There is Igor's businessman
friend. And the big cop playing the slot machine, within
eavesdropping range.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Menty' are such idiots,'' says Kseniya, using the Russian
slang for cops. She knows him. She knows all the cops, whores, and
drug dealers who work this neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the police sell her heroin they have just shaken down
from some street addict. Sometimes they help find her clients to
help pay for her habit. Sometimes they make her give them for free
what she sells. Recently one fined her 10 rubles, the equivalent of
50 cents, for using profane language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe that? Ten rubles for calling a ment a
jackass,'' Kseniya says, her voice rising as the music stops. The
cop looks over. Time to leave.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   In a basement not far away, Misha huddles in his coat against
the chill. His ``office'' _ a small underground dugout with cracked
wallpaper _ is beneath the Maltsev Market, center of the local drug
trade. Misha, who asked that his real name not be used, is an
undercover police officer, part of a special task force St.
Petersburg police have set up to fight the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Misha sneers at the word ``fight.'' He says, ``We are barely
holding it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the big drug was an opium brew called ``poppy
straw.'' Then Russia's economy collapsed, and, coincidentally, the
heroin supply from Central Asia exploded. Crime groups based in
Tajikistan bring the heroin here, where a local gang handles sales
at the market. The street price of a ``check,'' a small foil
wrapper half the size of a stick of gum, fell from over $6 to 80
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Misha displays a check. Dealers can conceal it easily and get
rid of it fast. Users can swallow it. Unlike poppy straw, which
needs to be cooked, heroin is easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Misha has no idea how many addicts roam the market, but he knows
there are a lot. ``They're usually teenagers. They come from good
families, but they have nothing to do,'' he said. ``They hit the
streets, someone in a group tries it. Then they all try it, then
you have a group of new addicts. It's a terrible situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has enlisted pop celebrities for an American-style public
relations campaign that includes television ads and talk shows
dedicated to the horrors of drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   A tough new anti-drug law passed last year by the Russian
parliament gives police the right to stop and search people who
look as if they are using drugs. According to government figures,
more than 250,000 people were arrested in 1998 on drug charges, up
substantially from 185,000 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   This law has earned the wrath of human rights activists, who say
it targets users rather than dealers and therefore does not get to
the root of the problem. Misha agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids do drugs even though they know they're going to jail,''
he says. ``We have dealers who get out and go right back to work.
As long as there's demand, we won't stop this. This is a problem
with our society. Young people's lives have no structure, no reason
to believe, no ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   Igor, 17, remembers when he got hooked. It was in the fourth
grade, and the substance was glue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then I've guzzled gasoline, eaten mushrooms, swallowed
speed, gulped Valium, smoked hashish, shot poppy straw, and now
heroin,'' Igor says in a raspy monotone at a nameless cafe near the
Maltsev Market. Today, he sells checks and shoots up, often 20
times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Igor walks to the Maltsev Market, a short walk from Nevsky
Prospekt, the elegant thoroughfare laid out by Peter the Great.
Business is brisk. A man with alert eyes and a purposeful gait,
known here as ``Squash,'' darts over to a vegetable vendor and
touches his hand. Squash, a balding man of about 35 in a dark
leather jacket, strides to the entrance of the market, where a
throng of teenagers waits in watch caps and parkas. Most of them
are pale with dark circles under their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Squash walks up to one youth, passes on the tiny check, and
moves on. No money changes hands. That is done elsewhere, when
there are no drugs around. In a minute, Squash has hit them all.
Then two muscular security guards with ``Special Forces'' stitched
into their camouflage jackets chase the kids away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep this place clean of unwanted elements,'' one of them
says, winking.
</P>
<P>
   The police _ the ones who are trying to stop it _ know all about
this system. ``Misha'' knows that he could never get close enough
to Squash to make an arrest in the few moments he actually carries
the heroin. The dealers have too many lookouts who can identify
Misha. And there are so many Squashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We arrest a drug dealer, and there are 20 in line to take his
place,'' says Misha.
</P>
<P>
   The number of cases of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, doubled
in 1998 to 10,483, Vadim Pokrovsky, head of the Russian Center for
AIDS Prevention, told the Interfax news agency this week. Russia's
health minister, Vladimir Starodubov, said last fall that some 90
percent of the country's new cases of HIV were needle users.
</P>
<P>
   Over the protest of some residents, St. Petersburg Governor
Vladimir Yakovlev has supported a program that distributes clean
needles to drug users to prevent the spread of disease.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A block away from the Maltsev Market, psychologist Olga
Timofeyeva hands out needles and does blood tests in a freezing
bus. She has registered 7,000 drug users, about seven people each
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the kids tell me, `If I had something to do, I
wouldn't have started taken drugs,' '' says Timofyeva, 29. ``A lot
of them come from well-off families. Often, when they come on the
bus, you can't tell they are addicts . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Her voice trails off. Timofeyeva's coworkers nervously check to
see that her visitors are not carrying drugs. Some local police
have tried to close the bus down, saying it is a den of drug users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are against us,'' Timofeyeva says.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk away, Kseniya and her friends are back on the
street, stomping their feet in the cold.

WHEN RHETORIC TRUMPS TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's begin with a proclamation that has proven to be a firing
offense in the politically correct environment of 1999 America:
Blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately responsible for the
trafficking of most illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   How dare anyone make such a scurrilous statement? Here's how.
The statistics tumble forth with indisputable authority, in Boston,
in New York, in virtually any city that compiles such facts.
Minorities are overrepresented within the enemy camp in the
never-ending war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   So along comes Colonel Carl Williams, the embattled head of the
New Jersey State Police, to speak the obvious. In an interview
published Sunday, he noted that when President Clinton recently
raised the issue of drugs, he went to Mexico, not England or
Ireland. ``Today, with this drug problem . . . it is most likely a
minority group that's involved with that.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to add: ``If you are looking at the methamphetamine
market, that seems to be controlled by the motorcycle gangs, which
are basically white. If you are looking at heroin and stuff like
that, your involvement there is more or less Jamaican.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing dishonest there, or particularly racist. Even criminal
enterprises are based on trust, and dealers tend to band together
by ethnic groups _ whether Jamaicans, Haitians, Colombians _ to
form distribution groups focused on a single narcotic, such as
cocaine. Recall La Cosa Nostra.
</P>
<P>
   But the ground thundered in New Jersey Monday, and the
reverberations are being felt in Boston. One black New Jersey
legislator, Leroy Jones, called Williams's views ``dastardly,''
``ill,'' and ``sickened.'' Governor Christine Todd Whitman
apparently agreed. She fired Williams, saying, ``His comments today
are inconsistent with our efforts to enhance public confidence in
the State Police.''
</P>
<P>
   Enhance public confidence? What about the matter of fighting
crime?
</P>
<P>
   We have become a society so obsessed with racial and political
correctness that we can't even have an honest, statistically-based
discussion on crime trends if it happens to prove unflattering to
blacks and Hispanics. We have become a society that values words
more than actions, perception more than reality. We have become a
society unintentionally widening the racial divide by our miscast
attempts to bridge it.
</P>
<P>
   By paying lip service to black leaders, Whitman hurt the
communities of color they purport to represent _ in New Jersey, in
Boston, and everywhere else. Where there are criminals, there are
victims, and in minority neighborhoods across the nation, families,
streets, and entire blocks have been ruined by the scourge of
drugs. Will police now believe their jobs are at risk if they seek
to address racially-influenced crime patterns?
</P>
<P>
   It is gospel within law enforcement that black and Hispanic
criminals control the drug distribution networks into most major
American cities, including Boston. In the most recent Drug
Enforcement Agency report detailing patterns in Massachusetts,
agents wrote that ``Colombian violators and Dominican violators
continue to be the primary cocaine distributors.''
</P>
<P>
   Of heroin, the DEA wrote: ``The most prominent distribution
networks are of Dominican, Colombian, Puerto Rican, and Asian
origin.'' Of marijuana, the DEA laid much of the blame on Mexican
nationals operating from Arizona and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Rev. Eugene Rivers of Boston, a black advocate of
personal responsibility, acknowledges the problem within urban
minority groups, saying, ``If it is true that most white-collar
crimes are committed by white men, it is equally true that a
disproportionate number of black men are associated with crimes of
violence and drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to Whitman, we're not supposed to speak these
truths. It is racist. It promotes stereotypes. It engenders ill
will among minority leaders who allow rhetoric to trump reality.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, ironically, Whitman supported Williams amid
accusations that the New Jersey State Police practiced
``profiling'' _ pulling over disproportionate numbers of minority
drivers. Now Williams's logical words are deemed more offensive
than his questionable actions. ``It shows the craven cowardice, the
hypocrisy of political leaders in dealing with issues of race,''
says Boston lawyer Harvey Silverglate.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there's really only one pattern that matters, and
it's not of the criminal, but the victim. Blacks and Hispanics need
disproportionate help, and stereotypes be damned, they should get
it.

   ``His face turned red. He was yelling and screaming,'' Chretien
said in an interview. ``He said he would throw me down the stairs
and kill me.'' Robbins also allegedly threatened to send someone to
Chretien's condominium in Revere and beat him up. Chretien said he
was so concerned about the threat that he asked Revere police to
accompany him back to his condominium.
</P>
<P>
   A similar tale of rage was told by Robbins's former wife,
Barbara, in court papers seeking a restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   On a late-night visit to his wife's condominium on Feb. 11,
1996, Robbins rushed to her upstairs bedroom and jumped her as she
lay in bed, she said. Kneeling on her chest to keep her down, he
held her arms down with one hand and squeezed her nose with the
other hand so she couldn't breathe, Barbara Robbins stated.
</P>
<P>
   One of their sons, called to the bedroom by his mother, broke up
the confrontation. Before Robbins left that night, he ``told my
boys he would have killed me if they weren't there,'' Barbara
Robbins stated in an affidavit seeking a restraining order against
her husband, preventing him from approaching her at home or work.
</P>
<P>
   The order remained in effect until last September. The couple's
divorce was finalized last May.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta was raised in the Edgeworth section of Malden on
Devir Street, near one of the city's showpieces, Devir Park. Always
the biggest kid on the block, Trischitta became a fixture at city
sporting events, but always on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   At Malden High School, from which Trischitta graduated in 1970,
he received varsity letters for managing the baseball, hockey, and
basketball teams. He kept score and watched the clock. It's a role
he kept through his life, refereeing Pop Warner and high school
games, and, as recently as last season, tending to the clock at
Friday night Malden Catholic football games.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta was known as a class clown, a teenager who considered
himself a thespian, choosing theater arts as an elective and
impressing the class with his improvisations of Casey at the Bat.
</P>
<P>
   More than one teacher said they have fond memories of
Trischitta, whose enthusiasm inspired classmates.
</P>
<P>
   But some of his peers, who remember him on the sidelines, said
his constant presence on the periphery, wanting desperately to step
into the center, struck them as pathetic. They called him the `bag
boy' and the `caddy' sometimes, teasing him. But Trixie, they said,
could take a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Trischitta has struggled to control his
weight. At one point he underwent a stomach stapling operation to
remove fat, former coworkers said.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, Trischitta managed the men's baseball team
sponsored by Augustine's restaurant, and spent summer nights under
the lights at Devir Park watching games.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta never graduated from college and made an unsuccessful
run at local politics when he lost a primary election for Malden
city councilor in 1978. That same year he landed a low-level job
working as a teller at the state treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta, who declined interview requests, dabbled in real
estate on the side but let his agent's license lapse. Since the
early 1980s, he earned extra income working as a justice of the
peace, marrying about a dozen couples a year for $100 each. His
wife, Diane, worked part-time as a home health aide, according to
friends. The couple have two young children.
</P>
<P>
   If Robbins was tasting the good life, there is no indication
Trischitta was living luxuriously. He owned a battered and aged
Honda Accord and his wife drove a seven-year-old Ford Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the couple built a home in Stoneham now valued
at $343,400. While the home might seem outside the price range of a
state employee earning $57,000 a year, the cost was offset by
Trischitta's mother selling her Medford home and moving in with her
son, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta seemed most comfortable when he was back in the gym
or at the field, operating the scoreboard and talking with old
friends from his days at Malden High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought John would go into sports administration or
management,'' said Lou Racca, a former coach and teacher at Malden
High School. ``He really loved sports.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those who know both men say they were not friendly in high
school because of the four-year age difference.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, when Malden established a public access
cable channel, Robbins was involved with programming sports events
for the channel. He even had the license plate ``TV 13,'' which was
the channel number for the public access programming.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta also volunteered to help with the cable programming
and friends speculate the pair may have become acquainted then.
</P>
<P>
   Both men also moved in local political circles, although Robbins
was more active with Republicans and Trischitta with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible link to the pair is Robbins's younger brother,
Jerry, who is closer in age to Trischitta. Jerry Robbins has worked
for 1994 Senate candidate John Lakian and as a fund-raiser for
State Senator Richard R. Tisei, a Wakefield Republican, from 1991
to 1993. One Malden businessman said he remembers being introduced
to Trischitta by Jerry Robbins at an event three years ago. Jerry
Robbins declined an interview request.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say both Trischitta and Marty Robbins separately told
State Police who arrested them 10 days ago that they were friendly
with Metropolitan District Commission chief David B. Balfour Jr.
Balfour, a former advance man for President George Bush, has worked
for both Governor Paul Cellucci and former governor William F.
Weld.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Balfour said he recently ran into Marty Robbins
at Cellucci's inaugural in January, but was surprised Robbins would
use his name when arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a drink with him, I've never had dinner with
him, I've never had any business dealings with him, so I was
surprised to hear'' that, Balfour said. He added, ``I don't know
that I know Trixie.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Trischitta said that only recently did Robbins seek
to establish a relationship with Trischitta.
</P>
<P>
   People who grew up with Trischitta and worked with him at the
treasury said they doubt he came up with the alleged scheme to
steal the $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trixie didn't think this up _ trust me,'' said a top aide to
former state treasurer Robert Crane, who hired Trischitta.
</P>
<P>
   But Robbins's mother said she believes ``they want to make my
son a scapegoat.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, however, always had a reputation as someone looking to
be a player in the business world, the same way he was on the
football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always on the make,'' said one lifelong Malden resident
who said he has known Robbins since high school and who asked to
remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had not lived in Malden since the 1970s, Robbins
returned to his hometown last fall and approached city officials,
including Mayor Richard C. Howard, with a proposition: He knew
where there was several million dollars in economic development
funds that the city could get its hands on. He said he could obtain
it for the city for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins told Howard he had gotten into the business of ``asset
location,'' finding public funds in state and federal treasuries
for cities and towns across the country. If Malden would contract
with him he would even consider reducing his usual 33 percent fee
as a favor to his hometown, and get the money that was now sitting
in a state treasurer's account.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard said he soon found out that the money wasn't really
due Malden, and didn't like the complicated contract that Robbins
wanted the city to enter into. A week later, in early October, he
called Robbins and declined his offer.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later Robbins was opening an escrow account at the
BankBoston branch in Lynnfield under the name Cambridge Economic
Development and listing himself as having the sole power to deposit
and withdraw funds. According to prosecutors, he had submitted a
document to Trischitta stating that he had been given the power of
attorney from the Cambridge Economic Development Authority, and the
agency was due the $6.5 million that had been in the Unpaid Check
Fund since 1994.

A SEASON CONDUCIVE TO HEARTFELT WHINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to usage disputes, the message of history is ``Get
over it'' _ some changes will eventually become standard English,
others will disappear, and everyone gets to vote. But even if you
expect to lose in this most democratic of forums, there's no need
to go quietly; everyone's allowed a bit of kicking and screaming,
as long as it doesn't go on too many decades after the majority
decision is clear.
</P>
<P>
   So this week, we're offering a collection of complaints _ not
about the tame bugbears of the waning century, but about usages now
knocking at our door, and not yet guaranteed a place at the table.
Here's a sampling of some recent weeping and gnashing of teeth:
</P>
<P>
   Growing like kudzu: ``Everywhere I turn lately I seem to find
the word burgeoning being used to indicate a growing human
population,'' writes Ginny Luongo of Acton. ``According to my
dictionaries the word burgeon means 1) `to put forth new buds,
leaves, or greenery; begin to sprout, grow, or blossom. 2) To
develop rapidly (not increase), or flourish.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the purists, the new meaning is likely to
blossom; there's just not a clear enough distinction between rapid
plant proliferation and other kinds of speedy growth for the
distinction to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting word: ``Please tell me that I am justified in having my
hackles raised in the presence of . . . conflicted as an adjective
(e.g., `I'm really conflicted about this decision'),'' requests
Matt Norwood of Cambridge. Well, the altitude of your hackles is
your own business, but conflicted is already dictionary-approved,
and probably too useful to die anytime soon. But look on the bright
side: Conflictual, a '60s neologism, still hasn't caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Less than zero: ``Ginger Burr, commenting (to a Globe columnist)
on working with transgender clients, says `The only difference is
that usually we're starting at ground zero,' '' notes Laura
Gustafson of Acton. ``What she means is square one, the starting
point, not the spot above which a nuclear bomb exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm all for keeping these expressions separate, but there's no
chance of limiting ground zero to actual bombing sites; it has
already extended its metaphoric reach to include the site of any
momentous undertaking. That's only to be expected in a language
that speaks of ``explosions'' of fashionable pink, sport-utility
sales, and new sitcoms. Square one sounds like the next step up
from ground zero, probably adding to the confusion, and its image
could blur further as computer games displace board games. Language
conservatives, teach your children Monopoly before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Taste test: Donald C. MacLellan is unhappy about ``the
increasingly common neo-proverb `the proof is in the pudding,'
which, of course, makes no sense.'' The correct version, he says,
is `` `The proof of the pudding is in the eating,' an honored
proverb of long standing.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is, but the saying seems a very good candidate for the
kind of condensation other proverbs and quotations have undergone _
as long as the short form is used properly, to mean something that
can only be judged by sampling it. The proverb was much more apt,
remember, when it was recorded in 1682: A pudding in those days was
as likely to be a steamed haggis as a sweet milk-and-flour dish,
and either would have been made from scratch. Nowadays the pudding
is Jell-O Instant, and the proof is in the ingredients list.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping the gun: ``I am struck with what appears to be the utter
misuse of the word historic,'' writes George Waggoner ``in
reference to meetings or events that are either currently under
way, are in the offing, or have just been completed. For example,
`As the delegates gather here in Washington for this historic
session of the Senate. . . .' My dictionaries offer no definitions
of historic that refer to current events.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all Greece to them: ``Sportswriters . . . keep talking
about Olympus and climbing Olympus in reference to the games,''
writes Sean Kelly . ``Don't they know that the games derive their
name from Olympia in the western Peloponnese where the original
games were played, not Mount Olympus?''
</P>
<P>
   Led astray: ``The weather's not very conducive for this time of
year,'' a local TV reporter told viewers during an unseasonable
period in November. It's not clear what synonym for ``typical'' he
was seeking, but conducive means ``promoting, furthering,'' from
the Latin for ``leading together.'' His choice was at least
conducive to the amusement, if not the edification, of his
audience.

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; CARTER CLAY &QL; 
 &UR; Elizabeth Evans (HarperFlamingo, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Evans (``The Blue Hour'') begins this novel with a scene that is
benignly commonplace and yet, because we know we are on the brink
of tragedy, disturbingly prophetic. It is 1993 and paleontologist
Joe Alitz is lost on the road with his wife, Katherine, and their
12-year-old daughter, Jersey. They are driving back to Arizona
after a visit with Katherine's mother in Florida, and they have
stopped on an isolated roadside to scan the horizon and figure out
where they are. Joe might have asked directions when he first
realized they were on the wrong road. But he is a man who likes to
solve his own problems. Into this tableau comes a Vietnam veteran
named Carter Clay. A loner and an alcoholic, Clay has been trying
to patch his broken life back together, but on the road that day,
Clay is a fallen man. He is drunk. He is distracted. And in a
moment of terrible inevitability, he drives his van into the
Alitzes as they stand on the roadside, looking off into the Florida
grasslands. This disturbing scene sets up a story that is, at its
roots, about simple bad luck and a flawed man's search for
redemption. Joe Alitz is killed. Katherine is brain-damaged. Jersey
is paralyzed from the waist down. Clay, who drives away from the
carnage with just a gash on his head, is dazed by guilt and grief.
A self-imposed penance takes root in his obsession with his crime:
He insinuates himself into Katherine's and Jersey's shattered lives
and attempts to take responsibility for them as a way of saving
them all. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; CLEOPATRA'S PALACE &QL; 
 &UR; Laura Foreman (Random House/Discovery, $35)
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many of them, but it's the underwater photographs
that make this book worth its price. Since the early 1980s,
underwater explorer Franck Goddio has been fascinated by the story
of earthquakes and tidal waves that hit the northern Africa coast
near Alexandria in 365 and ensuing centuries. Alexandria sat on a
geological fault line, and the quakes and other geophysical changes
caused the city's shoreline to disappear beneath the Mediterranean.
In 1992, Goddio set out to locate, map and explore the sunken
portions of Alexandria, which included the palaces of the city's
rulers. This book, an illustrated biography of Cleopatra, is a
companion volume to an upcoming Discovery Channel special on the
search for Cleopatra's Royal Quarter, which has been submerged for
1,600 years. Goddio found jewelry, pottery and an ancient
shipwreck, but the stunning images here are of the statues,
otherworldly figures that rise like ghosts in the murky water. In
one photograph, Goddio in his diving gear stares into the face of a
sphinx believed to be the likeness of Ptolemy XII, father of
Cleopatra. The stone features are remarkably preserved. The eyes
gaze back at Goddio with deep serenity, the lips curve in what
looks like the slightest of smiles. It is a sight to see. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE 20-MINUTE VEGETABLE GARDENER &QL; 
 &UR; Tom Christopher and Marty Asher (Random House, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   This is the second book by Christopher and Asher. The first was
``The 20-Minute Gardener,'' which is now available in paperback
from Random House. We like the first one better. Both are notable
not so much for the tips they offer (or, unfortunately, for the
endless string of anecdotes Tom and Marty tell about themselves) as
for the contagious spirit of the thing, this new
gardening-on-the-run. It's all very easygoing and reassuring.
``Bugs,'' they write, ``are the gardener's equivalent of Vietnam _
they cannot be defeated by sheer firepower. They know the country
better than you do. But you can outsmart them.'' Or ``Nursery
catalogs, while a great pleasure to read, have no relevance to
gardening, unless used as mulch. The magnificent plants described
in and pictured on their pages have never actually appeared on this
planet.'' We notice, however, that one of Tom's and Marty's
``20-Minute Projects'' is the rooting of cuttings from rosebushes,
which requires finding healthy bushes, bagging and labeling the
cuttings, digging a bed and adding peat moss and sand, planting the
cuttings, waiting a month for them to root, then transplanting and
waiting a year or two for them to bloom. Twenty minutes, indeed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SCARS OF SWEET PARADISE &QL; 
 &UR; Alice Echols (Metropolitan, $26)
</P>
<P>
   She was rootless, she was unattached, she was defiant and she
was only 27 when she died. That, and the voice, made the legend of
Janis Joplin and have kept it alive for 30 years. This fine
biography is analytical, intelligently written and deeply attentive
to the social and cultural milieu in which Joplin rose to fame.
It's about drugs, sex, rebellion and rock and roll, and not
necessarily in that order. Echols admits it's sometimes sordid even
to her. ``While I can appreciate the social significance of Janis'
assault on good-girl femininity,'' she writes, ``I'm sure it was
sometimes more appealing in theory than in practice.'' The mythic
Joplin _ ``the tough, raw, trashy broad'' _ was a persona Janis
began inventing as a chubby, acne-plagued teenager in Port Arthur,
Texas, because it gave her a sense of control. And for all of the
hatred she felt for her hometown, she never really shook its hold
on her. ``Janis' rebelliousness,'' Echols writes, ``never entirely
overcame her conventionality.'' &QL;

HONORING A DISHONORABLE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (w and k coding)  
 (For use by New York Times   News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Three men and one woman, united in an artistic
triumph arguably without parallel in the American theater. Three
men and one woman, divided by the experience of evil _ large,
medium, and small. And then united one last time by happy and ugly
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Broadway production of Arthur Miller's protean
``Death of a Salesman'' just happened to open last month as
Hollywood was arranging to give a career Oscar to one of its
trail-blazing directors, Elia Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   Those two occurrences link our cast from the original production
50 years ago: Miller; Kazan, its director; the late Lee J. Cobb
(the first Willy Loman); and the late Mildred Dunnock (the first
Linda). The link, however, is not merely artistic, but political _
the very different brushes each had with the fanatical
anticommunism that drove America crazy during the late '40s, '50s,
and early '60s in an effort to combat a bestial ideology with
enforced conformity and Constitution-shattering cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan's Oscar is properly controversial. He is a gigantic figure
in the performing arts, inextricably linked with the formative
period of Miller's and Tennessee Williams's explosion onto the
stage, and a director of seminal importance to Hollywood's
occasional flirtation with excellence (``Gentleman's Agreement,''
``Viva Zapata,'' ``On the Waterfront,'' ``East of Eden''). He turns
90 this fall, and Hollywood has honored many a less worthy creative
life.
</P>
<P>
   But Kazan is also a pathetically protypical rat-fink of the
anticommunist hysteria, whose self-serving opportunism before the
House Committee on Un-American Activities in April 1952 preserved
his prosperous career without advancing the struggle against
communism an inch; whose name-naming not only was restricted to the
weak or already black-listed; but whose service in the American
inquisition gave it the kind of legitmacy it craved to ruin the
lives of tens of thousands of teachers, writers, directors, and
performers on the basis of their associations and political
beliefs, not any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The exquisite irony of his upcoming honor is the insistence of
the board of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that
it is recognizing his artistic life, not his politics _ an
insistence made more cogent by the board member and Kazan friend
who started all this, veteran actor Karl Malden, who began his
career under Kazan in the 1930s in New York's Group Theatre where
more than one person eventually defamed by him worked.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's assertion that Kazan's art matters apart from his
politics is precisely the point. By blessing the inquisition, Kazan
got to have that life; no one will ever know how many other great
artists never got the chance to develop because of the system his
perfidy helped legitimize.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Miller chose a different path. Kazan decision's to
protect his own career at the cost of others split them deeply.
When Miller's turn before the infamous House committee came in
1956, he refused to talk names on First Amendment grounds,
testifying only about himself. And where Kazan took refuge in
simplistic melodrama to make the informer's case in ``On the
Waterfront,'' Miller took on the hysteria in memorable depth via
metaphor (``The Crucible'') and genuine moral dilemma (``A View
from the Bridge'').
</P>
<P>
   Lee J. Cobb's story is best told in Victor S. Navasky's
encyclopedic account of the Hollywood blacklist, ``Naming Names.''
Cobb held out for two years after the investigators came calling in
1951, during which he went broke and lost his first wife to
alcoholism. Shortly after he cracked and named 20 names, he had a
massive coronary. When Navasky interviewed him in the 1970s, he
showed regret, multifaceted bitterness and sadness. Said Cobb:
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the Mephistophelian mystery that the Reds have
bequeathed to the world is the ability to make one confess without
any truncheon marks on one's head. You start out wanting to keep
your friends. In a totalitarian country they want you to betray
your friends, and you persuade yourself finally it is your duty. On
the tortuous road to that conclusion lie many bleached bones of
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Mildred Dunnock was luckier. Utterly nonpolitical, she couldn't
get work after being named in a right-wing publication as being
friendly with the likes of Miller, Lillian Hellman, and even Kazan
himself. Her husband, a banker, used his connections to get a
retraction. ``It gave me an emotional understanding of being
accused,'' she told The New York Times years later in a clip
Navasky unearthed. ``I felt contaminated, I felt I had leprosy, I
felt I had incriminated my husband, a conventional man.''
</P>
<P>
   They say Malden himself may give the Oscar speech for Kazan this
month. One hopes the applause is scattered and perfunctory, for
this is a dishonorable man.

DECORATIONS ARE ICING ON THE CAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Cake decorating can seem as intimidating as freeway
construction: underpasses, overpasses, cloverleafs, offramps.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you fear your creation will look like Miss Havisham's
sorry mountain of moldering confection in ``Great Expectations,''
an eternal reminder of her wedding that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the truth: No matter how critical you are of your
work, friends and family will think it's beautiful and love every
loop of shell border, handcrafted rose and ``Happy Birthday''
squirted out in piping gel.
</P>
<P>
   Don't picture the sagging tiers that Sleeping Beauty's fairy
godmothers whipped up in mortal fashion. Picture how they looked
after a wave of a magic wand.
</P>
<P>
   With the right tools and some elementary skills, your cake can
be magical, too.
</P>
<P>
   To get a taste for basic cake decorating, we consulted Paulette
Karras, a former lawyer and now an award-winning instructor in the
Wilton method, who teaches at a Michael's store in Mesa, Ariz., and
at Kitchen Classics in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Although Karras has created many breathtaking masterpieces over
the past 30 years, including a stained-glass window featuring St.
Francis of Assisi surrounded by a menagerie of woodland animals,
she says anyone can turn a plain cake into a fancy one.
</P>
<P>
   The key, she says: ``Don't sweat the small stuff. And it's all
small stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, she adds, ``Cake decorators eat their mistakes.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Begin with proper tools &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Spatulas. Flat and offset, for spreading icing.
</P>
<P>
   - A cake leveler. This is a metal frame with a piece of thin
wire stretched between posts for neatly slicing layers of cake or
slicing off the ``dome'' or rounded top of a cake layer.
</P>
<P>
   - Metal decorating tips. These attach with plastic couplers. A
basic kit should contain round tips Nos. 3 and 12, star tips 16 and
21, rose 104, leaf 352.
</P>
<P>
   - Decorating bags. Either ``featherweight'' reusable plastic,
cone-shape bags; disposable plastic bags; or 15-inch parchment
paper triangles you fold into cones.
</P>
<P>
   - Flower ``nails'' for fashioning roses out of icing.
</P>
<P>
   - Cake insulators. Insulated strips of cloth that wrap around a
cake pan to ensure even baking and prevent browning of sides.
</P>
<P>
   - Cardboard cake rounds to hold the layers.
</P>
<P>
   - Plastic turntable. An easy way to turn the cake while
decorating.
</P>
<P>
   - Paper or glassine doilies. Slip one on top of the cake round
before placing layer for a pretty, finished look.
</P>
<P>
   - Toothpicks for dabbing on bits of icing, removing mistakes and
for dying icing.
</P>
<P>
   - Paste colors. Pots of thick dye that won't dilute the
consistency of icing as liquid food coloring will.
</P>
<P>
   - Paintbrushes for bag striping techniques. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Baking a cake for decorating &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brush the bottom and sides of clean cake pans (dark, well-used
pans will bake faster than new, light-color ones) with Karras'
recommended mixture of equal parts flour, vegetable oil and
shortening.
</P>
<P>
   For an angel food cake, follow recipe directions on preparing
pans.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced cooks wrap each pan in an insulated strip, moistened
and held fast with a pin to ensure even baking. These are available
at decorating supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   Tap pan lightly on countertop a few times to release air
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   After baking, level each layer with a cake leveler or long thin
knife to remove the dome. Cool cakes 10 to 15 minutes. Run a thin
knife around the edges of the pan and turn the layers onto a
cooling rack. If you remove the cake from the pan too soon, you
risk breakage. Leave it too long, and it will stick.
</P>
<P>
   Place bottom layer upside down on a cardboard round 1 or 2
inches larger than the layer. Top layer also will be inverted so
you are decorating the ``bottom,'' which is flatter and less
crumbly than the top.
</P>
<P>
   To ``torte'' a cake, which makes a four-layer cake, slice each
layer in half with a cake leveler or a knife. If using a knife,
lightly score the cake evenly around the circumference of the layer
and then slice all the way through.
</P>
<P>
   Or the cake can be marked with toothpicks. Insert toothpicks
into the cake at intervals, making sure they are all placed exactly
midway around the circumference, then slice at the toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   Brush away and discard crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   For tidier decorating, freeze layers overnight. Frozen layers
are easier to handle and generally free of crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   For filling, first pipe a ring of prepared icing around the top
edge of the bottom layer with a No. 12 round tip. This ring
prevents the filling from squirting out between layers. Inside the
ring, spread a layer of pudding, preserves, fruit curds or pie
filling.
</P>
<P>
   Fillings can be made or purchased and should be spread no higher
than the well made by the icing.
</P>
<P>
   To ice the cake, first cover sides, then the top with a generous
amount of icing (see recipe below) using a long, wide spatula.
Don't skimp; the excess will be removed in the leveling process.
When the whole cake has been iced, finish by evening sides and
smoothing the top until sides are straight and top is flat.
</P>
<P>
   Cake can also be iced using a broad, flat icing tip and evened
with a spatula.
</P>
<P>
   For a smoother look, mist the cake lightly with water from a
spray bottle. Or heat a metal spatula in hot water, wipe dry and
gently glide the spatula over the surface of the icing to slightly
melt the sugar and form a glossy seal.
</P>
<P>
   Your cake is ready for its transformation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Decorating &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All decorations should be applied before the border is added.
This prevents smearing the border as you work.
</P>
<P>
   Choose your bag: plastic reusable, disposable or parchment
triangles.
</P>
<P>
   You also can use ready-made icing. Wilton makes tubes of icing
that accommodate metal tips and couplers. Grocery store frosting is
good for icing a cake, but it is too thick for decorating.
</P>
<P>
   Karras is generous about recommending even tubes of store-bought
decorator icing for the beginner. The store supplies the icing; you
bring on the creativity.
</P>
<P>
   To make a parchment bag, place the triangle in front of you on a
flat surface with one corner pointing down. Fold each of the two
top corners down, joining them with the bottom one. Pick up the
folded triangle and form a cone by pulling the three peaks together
until a tight point forms at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Secure the three peaks with tape, or tear slightly in two places
and fold down the notch.
</P>
<P>
   Drop the large half of a plastic coupler well into the bottom of
the bag and then screw the cap half over the paper point. Tear off
the excess paper extending below the coupler. Remove the cap, affix
a tip and screw the cap on tightly over the tip.
</P>
<P>
   To fill a plastic featherweight or disposable bag, place it
point-side down in a tall glass or cup. Fold the sides down to form
a cuff, then fill halfway with icing. Fold the cuff up again and
twist the top to close. For additional security, wrap a twist-tie
around the top. Do not make a cuff on a parchment bag; simply twist
or fold top to close. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Using stencils &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the simplest ways to pretty up a cake is with stencils,
available at supermarkets and craft stores. Use any stencil that
won't absorb grease.
</P>
<P>
   Let frosting set until it's dry to the touch before applying the
stencil, then spray top surface of the stencil with cooking spray
so sprinkled sugars will stick to it and not fall back onto the
cake when the stencil is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Gently place stencil in the center of the cake and sprinkle
evenly over openings with colored sugar, powdered sugar or powdered
cocoa. Or ice over the openings with a contrasting color of
frosting.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully lift stencil away from the cake. &QL; 
Flowers
</P>
<P>
   For drop flowers _ small, basic flowers _ use a star tip.
Lightly touch the tip to the cake surface, squeeze, stop pressure
and lift straight up. For a swirled flower, give the bag a quarter
twist as you squeeze, then lift up.
</P>
<P>
   For flower centers, affix a round tip and drop a tiny dot of
icing inside the center of the flower. Or do three dots, a tiny
circle or a small mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can change your flower by changing the center,'' Karras
says.
</P>
<P>
   Roses are the piece de resistance of cake decorating. Perfect
the rose, and your cakes will look like Monet's garden. As for
lilies, well, they're for the graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   Hold the flower nail by its stem in your left hand (lefties,
reverse this) between thumb and fingertips. Using a No. 12 round
tip, build a small mound of icing in the center of the nail. It
should look like a Hershey's kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Switch to a rose tip; your sales clerk will show you what this
is. Begin applying petals to the rose. Touch the tip, wide end
down, to the mound and squeeze out a small amount of icing to
fashion an arch, looping up and around the side of the mound,
turning the nail as you apply the icing. Apply two more slightly
overlapping arches around the mound.
</P>
<P>
   For the next row, tilt the tip out slightly, and this time apply
five slightly overlapping petals. For the third row, tilt the tip a
little more and apply seven overlapping petals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cut'' the rose from the nail with the tips of a pair of large
scissors slid underneath the base and transfer to the cake surface.
</P>
<P>
   For a tinted rose, dip a small paintbrush in paste color and
draw one stripe up the inside of a decorating bag from the point to
halfway from the top, then carefully fill with icing.
</P>
<P>
   This is called bag striping or brush striping.
</P>
<P>
   When you affix the rose tip to the bag, line up the narrow side
with the stripe. As the petals are squeezed out, their edges will
be tinted. It's easy and looks spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   When you've applied all the flowers you want, add a leaf or two
to each one, including drop flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Karras' rule of thumb is ``every flower needs a leaf. Leaves
make the cake look finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a bag of green icing, affix a leaf tip and make small
leaves with one of the pointy sides of the tip facing down. As you
finish the leaf, lift up so the tip sticks up. This makes it look
more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   When mixing the green icing for leaves and stems, add a little
corn syrup _ about 1 teaspoon for every 1/2 cup of buttercream.
This will ensure that the tip of the leaf comes to a nice point
without breaking off. This same trick works for icing to be used in
writing. The icing will flow more smoothly. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Writing &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When writing a message on a cake, you can use thinned icing or
store-bout piping gel. Using a round tip, make the letters, keeping
your wrist stiff and using your whole arm, not just your hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not writing, you're drawing the letters,'' Karras says.
</P>
<P>
   Your first letter should be a pretty one, so practice your
capitals. End the message with a flourish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Borders &QL; 
 &QL; 
Try these three basic borders: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Using a No. 21 star tip, make a tight zigzag along the edge of
the top of the cake. Always begin borders at the back, so seams
don't show from the front. Repeat border around bottom of cake.
</P>
<P>
   - For a pretty ruffle border, do the same zigzag using a leaf
tip No. 70 or rose tip No. 104.
</P>
<P>
   - The star tip is also used to make a classic shell border,
``the most popular border in all of cakedom,'' Karras says.
</P>
<P>
   To form a shell border, touch the tip to the cake surface,
squeeze, lift up a little and let a short loop roll back down.
Bring the tip down at a slight angle to form the tail of the shell.
Repeat with connected shells evenly around the edge. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BUTTERCREAM ICING &QL;

<HEADLINE>
COYOTES PUTTING NEW SHINE ON HOCKEY IN PHOENIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Early on, when paradise was still a novelty, Bobby
Smith was watching his kids skate, trading glances between the
happenings on the ice and the constant, seductive stream of
sunshine outside the arena doors.
</P>
<P>
   It was another perfect winter's day in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I say to the guy standing next to me, ``How can I be in
here, in a rink, when it's so great out there?' '' said Smith, the
Phoenix Coyotes' general manager, a man who spent 15 NHL seasons
playing in the less-inviting climes of Minnesota and Montreal.
``Then the guy turns to me and says, `Don't worry, Bobby, we've got
330 more just like it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three full seasons into their desert digs, the Coyotes
now are somewhat blase about the blazing sun. Good weather is the
expected. It's also just, well, weather. Though they are now in a
skid, having won only one of their last eight games, the Coyotes
have been far better known this season for their winning hockey
than their strange fit as a franchise rooted in ice seeking fertile
ground among the cacti.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what, though,'' said ex-Bay Stater Jeremy
Roenick, back in the Hub Monday as his Coyotes prepared to face the
Briuns at the FleetCenter, ``I told my in-laws (from Quincy), `You
can keep this weather.' You get spoiled, no question. After a
while, it drifts into your subconscious _ you don't realize how
great it is until you're back in this cold and dreary weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey's efforts to shake the snow from its image began more
than 30 years ago when the Los Angeles Kings and then the Oakland
Seals came aboard as NHL expansion entries. Atlanta and Colorado
(after a two-year try in Kansas City) started up in the '70s, only
to pack up eventually for bigger promises in Calgary and New
Jersey, respectively. The Oakland-based franchise moved to
Cleveland after seven years, the league's first franchise to
transfer since the Ottawa Senators bolted for St. Louis in '34.
Initially, the mix of ice and and nice weather received a tepid
reception.
</P>
<P>
   But in the '90s, the NHL, seeking a broader North American
footprint in hopes of building a wider, richer television contract,
has renewed its dream to bring hockey to the hotlands. Expansion
has taken hold in Miami, Tampa Bay, Anaheim, San Jose, and
Nashville. When the Nordiques couldn't make a go of it in Quebec
City, Denver threw wide its arena doors one more time. The Hartford
Whalers swapped sweaters with North Carolina and became the
Hurricanes. The Minnesota North Stars dropped the North and went
south to Dallas, reborn as the Stars. Prior to their life in the
desert, the Coyotes were Winnipeg Jets. In June, there will be an
expansion draft here in Boston, stocking Ted Turner's Atlanta
Thrashers, who begin play in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   When the NHL commences its 1999-2000 season, 11 of its 28 teams
will be based in warm-weather climes. In the days of the Original
Six, member clubs could relay a snowball from rink to rink. Those
days have melted away, faster than a slush cone on Hollywood
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got in here and I was depressed,'' said Coyotes captain
Keith Tkachuk, another Boston boy who has seen the daylight in the
desert. ``I mean, it was raining out, and it just kept raining. We
never have rain in Phoenix. Boston's nice and everything, and it's
nice to come back here . . . you know, once a year.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes were among the league's elite for much of the first
half this season. Led by a line of Tkachuk, Roenick, and Dallas
Drake, they were jockeying with Dallas and Philadelphia for the top
spot in league standings until injuries began to mount in January
and December. They're now 30-20-10, about to end a two-week road
trip in which they've gone 1-5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing hard right now, but we're not playing smart,''
said head coach Jim Schoenfeld, who spent 39 games behind the
Boston blue line toward the end of his career. ``Some of our guys
are trying to do too much. Before, when things were going well, we
had a healthy roster and everyone had a job description. Our big
guys were scoring. We didn't need our third- and fourth-line guys
to be more than third- and fourth-line guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps looking for an emotional booster shot, the Coyotes have
recalled 6-foot-2-inch tough guy Sean Gagnon _ he of 1,422 penalty
minutes in his first four pro seasons _ from Springfield (AHL) for
the encounter against the Bruins. If the Bruins roll out both of
their hired fists, Ken Belanger and Ken Baumgartner, the Vault
could have a heavyweight edge that hasn't been seen often on
Causeway Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for one guy to carry our muscle game, if
that's what you want to call it,'' said Schoenfeld. ``Sean's been
up and down with us, and we monitor our guys. He's playing well for
Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think we have a team toughness, and that doesn't
mean fighting. It means winning the one-on-one battles in the
corners, winniing the races for loose pucks, and throwing yourself
in front of a shot to block it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, nee Winnipeg Jets, have in Roenick and Tkachuk two
of the game's more talented forwards. When his game is on, Roenick
plays with a darting, fearless abandon, to the point where he's
suffered a couple of serious knee injuries. Tkachuk is the
big-swatting power forward, the former Boston University left
winger who twice has hit the 50-goal plateau.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not really a point guy,'' Tkachuk said earlier this
year, while mending from a broken rib, an injury that continues to
have him wearing a flak jacket. ``I muck in the corners. I get in
front and take my hacks and whacks. I'm not flashy, but I get my
points. Hey, I've scored 50 goals. I don't have to prove that
again. I have to prove that I can win.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes haven't won a playoff round since '87, nearly five
years before Tkachuk joined the franchise following the '92 Olympic
Games. In part, it was postseason failure that led the Jets to
leave Winnipeg, where revenues, already restricted by a small
population base, were diminished annually by the club's poor
playoff performances.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since the Jets bolted, it has become even harder
for Canadian-based NHL clubs to thrive, the imbalance in the US and
Canadian dollars shredding whatever profits Canadian clubs
generate. Today, Molson is considering selling the hallowed
Canadiens, a sure sign that red ink is bleeding all over the red
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have their cash concerns, too, but not like the ones
that drove the Jets south. They play in America West Arena in
downtown Phoenix, a basketball building with some sightlines that
cut off large portions of the ice. They'd like to build their own
arena _ a May 18 vote could give them that go-ahead _ stocked with
the requisite luxury suites and other modern-day bells and
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Will the desert market bear it? Consider: Even in their
ill-fitting arena, the Coyotes have averaged around 15,500 per game
for their nearly three seasons, about 96 percent capacity. It may
be an uncharacteristic fit, but ice sells in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, when you're playing (in Phoenix) you get caught up
in it a little,'' said Tkachuk. ``It's always great outside, and
you're coming to the rink in shorts, and there's always the
opportunity to be out there playing golf and stuff. But
realistically, you have to think, `Why am I here?' You're there to
play hockey and you have to win _ and that's got nothing to do with
the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes aren't the powerhouse they were earlier in the
season, but they're a playoff lock, with a chance to place a desert
rose in the Stanley Cup Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   They just have to get back in touch with their winning ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix is a great place,'' said Smith, standing inside
Matthews Arena Monday, watching his club practice. ``But Anchorage
on a winning streak is nicer than . . .''

FOLLOWING THE BARBARY TRAIL

<P>
   Boston has the Freedom Trail, San Francisco now has the Barbary
Coast Trail.
</P>
<P>
   The trail, a 3.8-mile walk (just a bit longer than the Freedom
Trail) celebrating San Francisco's famous and colorful past, opened
last year. The walk, with 150 bronze markers, allows visitors to
capture the spirit of the eras of the Gold Rush, Comstock Lode, and
the 1906 Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Walking down Market Street today, the center of San Francisco's
financial district, it is hard to imagine that in 1847 this hub was
once the dusty old Mission Trail, a half mile from the center of
town and often blocked by 90-foot sand dunes. Along the route is
the birthplace of the Gold Rush at Portsmouth Square; Hyde Street
Pier, which contains the largest collection of historic ships in
the United States; St. Mary's Cathedral, the oldest Catholic
cathedral west of the Rockies; and T'ien Hou Temple, the oldest
Asian temple in the United States, along with 20 historic sites,
six local history museums, indoor and outdoor pubs, and panoramic
views. The trail is a project of the San Francisco Historical
Society.
</P>
<P>
   Each end of the trail is connected by the scenic Powell-Hyde
cable car line.

   At Okemo in Ludlow, Vt., beginning March 2, it's Two for Two on
Tuesdays. Skiers and riders can rent two pairs of Salomon
SnowBlades for two hours for the price of one; Tuesdays are also a
day for Tune-up and Tuna _ drop off your skis or snowboards for a
tuneup and enjoy a tuna melt sandwich or tuna macaroni salad for
just $12. Thursdays, beginning March 4, are Ladies Days, a special
package of lift ticket and ski or snowboarding lesson is $37,
regularly $75. There's also a special deal for day care, and rental
equipment (for details, call 802-228-1581).

   Pearl Harbor
</P>
<P>
   The beginning and end of World War II in the Pacific have come
together at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. ``Most people gather their
knowledge of World War II from books and movies, limiting their
appreciation for the human reality of what took place here and
throughout the world during the war,'' said Captain Gerald Hofwolt,
executive director of the USS Bowfin Submarine Museum and Park.
``Pearl Harbor puts it all in perspective. This is a place where
visitors can come in close contact with the brave men and women who
chose to serve their country, live, and die, for the cause of
freedom. By combining our efforts, we're helping to give visitors a
more tangible awareness of what it was all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Harbor is not only the site of the USS Arizona Memorial,
but also the USS Bowfin Submarine Museum and Park, and, now, the
Battleship Missouri Memorial. The Arizona was destroyed on Dec. 7,
1941, with a tremendous loss of life. The site now has become a
place of healing and unification.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowfin allows visitors to experience a World War II vintage
submarine and learn of the role subs played in Naval history. The
Bowfin was launched on Dec. 7, 1942, and became a permanent part of
Pearl Harbor in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri just became a part of the harbor on Jan. 29.
Visitors touring the battleship will see the unaltered
``signature'' deck where on Sept. 2, 1945, the surrender of Japan
took place.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the Missouri, call the USS Missouri
Memorial Association at 808-423-2263; for the Arizona, call the

   Exploratorium's 30th
</P>
<P>
   This is the 30th anniversary of San Francisco's Exploratorium,
considered by many to be the world's best science museum. It's also
the museum that changed the notion of what a museum should be. It
was here that the concept of ``hands-on'' and ``interactive''
exhibits began. The Exploratorium introduces people to science by
asking them to examine how they see, hear, and feel _ the basis for
finding out more about the world they live in. Now through Sept.
12, the museum goes to the frogs. Did you know there are 3,000
species of frogs and toads around the world on every continent
except Antarctica? Here you'll learn everything there is to know
about frogs and toads, even see some 75 live frogs representing 20
species.

   Visitors can even get up close in a giant Tub of Frogs or Tub of
Toads. How nice. For information, call 415-561-0363.

ON-LINE AUCTION HOUSE E-BAY UNDER FEDERAL PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Federal officials are investigating the alleged
sale of contraband on the eBay Inc. Internet site, the on-line
auction house has confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate officials said in a statement that the investigation
was launched Jan. 29, when they received requests to provide
records and information ``relating to an investigation into
possible illegal transactions'' on the Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose-based company, which posts items for sale by
individual sellers and allows buyers to bid on those items in an
auction-like setting, disclosed the federal investigation in a
statement released after the close of the stock markets Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been one of the more bullish of the hot Internet
stocks. The company's stock split 3 for 1 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the investigation say the probe is being
conducted by several agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The company had announced on Feb. 19 that it was prohibiting the
sale of firearms on its Web site, citing the difficulty in
determining the legality of those sales.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Chu, an eBay spokeswoman, said the company had been
asked by a federal court not to reveal the nature of the
investigation. ``We've been asked not to disclose any information
in order to protect an ongoing investigation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The probe is the latest in a string of inquiries involving the
site. Last fall, the company disclosed it was being investigated by
an unnamed state attorney general's office for possible seller
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it said it would cooperate with a New York City
Department of Consumer Affairs probe into charges of seller fraud,
primarily regarding sports memorabilia. And Microsoft recently
announced it would begin monitoring eBay for the possible sale of
pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Pursglove, another eBay spokesman, said the Internet
site's recent troubles could be attributed to a ``learning
process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce is so very new,'' said Pursglove, referring to the
label bestowed on Internet-based selling and buying. ``The correct
policies as they pertain to sellers and buyers are still being
formed. We fully intend to meet those challenges as they arise.''
</P>
<P>
   Now claiming to have 2.1 million registered users, eBay was
founded by French-born software developer Pierre Omidyar after his
girlfriend, an avid Pez candy dispenser collector, complained that
there were no good collectible trading sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company was launched in September 1995.

HUMOR FROM THE 49TH STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alaska not only has an abundance of natural resources, it has a
lot of humor, too. Consider these comical comments from tour
guides:
</P>
<P>
   --In Skagway: ``Our average summer temperature is 100 degrees.
That's 40 in the morning and 60 in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   --At the El Dorado Mine in Fairbanks: ``Did you folks bring your
old gold-mining clothes? Well, if they're not your old clothes now,
they will be when you're done!''
</P>
<P>
   --At Denali National Park: ``Yes, there are rest-room facilities
en route. We refer to them as bushes.''
</P>
<P>
   --Everywhere: ``Alaska has four seasons: winter, early winter,
late winter, and next winter.''
</P>
<P>
   --And once more in Skagway: ``Over there is a horse and carriage
that you can ride. We got another of those last year. Now we're no
longer a one-horse town!'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: What is the northernmost capital in the contiguous
United States? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: ``Ukulele'' is Hawaiian for ``little jumping flea.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``You can go to hell; I am going to Texas.'' _ Davy
Crockett. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Freebie: You can walk through a glade surrounded by hundreds of
butterflies, including monarchs, swallowtails, and cabbage whites,
on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Wings Over Hawaii, the state's
only producer of butterflies for release at weddings and other
special occasions, has its visitors' area and gift shop at
Kilohana, a former sugar plantation near Lihue that also contains a
dozen stores and galleries, a restaurant, gardens, and carriage
rides pulled by Clydesdales. For more butterfly information, call
808-2458838 or 888-BUTTERFLI. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Deadly: We learn from the offbeat quarterly Out West that the Death
Valley National Park Visitor Center in eastern California is
coffin-shaped. And when you step outside, you get a fine view of
the Funeral Mountains. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Snappy slogan: Princess Cruises says its land and sea tours of
Alaska are ``designed to give you moosebumps.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
How times have changed: Hollywood was founded in 1888 by a
temperance society with the idea of making it a model community. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Same road, different destination: When Burt Bacharach, Hal David,
and Dionne Warwick collaborated on ``Do You Know the Way to San
Jose?'' nearly 30 years ago, the city in the song was an
agricultural-driven community of 359,000 people. A lot has changed
since then: San Jose is now home to 850,000 souls and is considered
the capital of high-tech Silicon Valley. Today, San Jose also has
luxury hotels, gourmet restaurants, a convention center and arena,
visual and performing arts venues, several professional sports
teams, and attractions for adults and children. One thing hasn't
changed since the song was written, though: LA is still a great big
freeway. (For a free visitors' guide, call 888 SAN JOSE.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Snappy slogan: (posted in Ketchikan, Alaska, which gets a lot of
rain): ``If you can't see the mountain, that means it's raining. If
you can see the mountain, that means it's about to rain.'') &QL; 
 &QL; 
The way it was: The Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World isn't the
first time animals have appeared in a Disney park. When
California's Disneyland opened in 1955, a circus was to be one of
the attractions. But once a herd of llamas got loose and thundered
through the park. Another time, a panther and a tiger broke through
a partition and engaged in a death battle inside their cage during
a parade on Main Street, USA. The circus plan was quietly dropped. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wet wagers: The Tropicana hotel's 295-foot heated swimming pool has
two swim-up blackjack tables. Each can accommodate up to 14
players, who sit on marble stools in hip-deep water. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Olympia, Wash. &QL; 
 &QL;

THE POLITICS OF HILLARY CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Hillary Rodham Clinton headed to town Wednesday,
New Yorkers by the millions wonder if she plans to speak to the
issue of the hour: Will she take the leap and run for Senate?
</P>
<P>
   But there are other questions: What sort of senator would the
first lady be? What does she stand for, how would she vote, what
would she do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Rorschach test,'' the first lady told Esquire magazine
in 1993. She has lived up to the billing ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Is she the ultimate do-good liberal who wants government to
intrude in everything from setting corporate profits to letting
teenagers sue their parents?
</P>
<P>
   Is she a New Democrat moderate, like her president husband,
reconciled to the precepts of a market economy and a trimmed-down
bureaucracy?
</P>
<P>
   Is she a canny pragmatist, her views evolving with experience
and maturation? Or _ a darker way of looking at the same thing _ is
she an opportunist, adapting her positions to fit new ambitions?
</P>
<P>
   She has been described, admired, and scorned as all the above.
And a review of her speeches and writings _ not just during her six
years in the White House, but over the past 30 years, as a
campaigner, a governor's wife, a law professor, and a graduating
college student _ reveals a record that friend and foe alike could
plumb for treasure.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's Republican mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, widely
seen as her most likely opponent, has already dipped his toe in the
pool, criticizing her support of a Palestinian state _ a stance
that could trouble the large number of Jewish voters here.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also said, on CNN's ``Crossfire,'' that a contest
against the first lady ``would be very important nationally _ it
would contrast two very different philosophies of governing.''
</P>
<P>
   The views for which Mrs. Clinton is best known are also the most
controversial _ health care and children's rights. In both cases,
everyone agrees, her beliefs are genuine and passionate, rooted in
the social activism of the Methodist Church and fueled by her years
at Wellesley College in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the student government, class of '69, she
delivered the ``counter-commencement'' address, a rousing speech
declaring that the ``prevailing acquisitive and competitive
corporate life is not for us. We're searching for more immediate,
ecstatic, and penetrating modes of living.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Greenberg, editorial-page editor for the Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette, who covered the Clintons during the president's
years as governor (and who coined the nickname ``Slick Willie''),
sees residual significance in that speech. ``At least since
Wellesley,'' he said in a phone interview, ``there's been a
principled drive toward a collectivist view of society. . . . She
sees a problem and thinks it can be solved by organized society,
from the top down. She's very leery of letting people make their
own decisions. She's afraid they'll make mistaken ones.''
</P>
<P>
   During her White House years, Greenberg said, this view was on
best display in her plan for health-care reform.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1993, in his first month as president, Bill Clinton
named Hillary as head of a task force to devise a system of
universal health insurance. She worked diligently, gave innumerable
speeches, testified before Congress alone and without notes _ and
failed miserably, outfoxed by industry lobbying and a growing
suspicion that her plan was too complex and gave the government too
much power.
</P>
<P>
   Although, in Arkansas, she had successfully led a commission on
education reform _ which recommended and pushed through the state
legislature a 1 percent increase in the sales tax and a requirement
that teachers pass a competency exam _ the health-care debacle
would be her last high-profile political initiative. The
Republicans would surely bring it up again if she ran for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   They might also resuscitate some of her more radical views on
child care, though they would have to dig back a quarter-century to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1973 article in the Harvard Education Review, Hillary
Rodham _ then still going by her maiden name _ criticized the
courts' presumption that children are incompetent to make their own
decisions. She likened the presumption to the view, held by courts
in earlier times, that wives, slaves, and Native Americans were not
entitled to their own views.
</P>
<P>
   She revised this view somewhat in a 1979 article, saying
disputes with children should be resolved by families, not by the
courts, ``in all but the most extreme cases.'' However, she defined
these ``extreme cases'' as ``decisions about motherhood and
abortion, schooling, cosmetic surgery, treatment of venereal
disease . . . and others where the decision or lack of one will
significantly affect the child's future.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1992 Republican convention, Patrick J. Buchanan denounced
these articles and claimed that Hillary Clinton ``compared marriage
and the family to slavery and life on an Indian reservation'' and
that she believes ``12-year-olds have a right to sue their
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's reading was a caricature, but the Harvard sociologist
Christopher Lasch argued in Harper's magazine at the time that he
had a point. ``Hillary Clinton's writings,'' Lasch argued,
``exemplify the view of families that so many working people find
objectionable . . . the politicization of family life.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans were to revive this argument now, Mrs.
Clinton could note _ as did a number of legal scholars seven years
ago _ that she was writing mainly about parents who abuse their
children, or who deny them medical care or schooling on the basis
of religious beliefs that the children may not share.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where universal health care is fairly popular and
child abuse widespread, attacking her on these issues could
backfire.
</P>
<P>
   It could also open a clear line of counterattack for Mrs.
Clinton. She has often spoken against slow and careless foster-care
systems _ and New York City's is among the nation's slowest and
most tragic.
</P>
<P>
   While she is at it, she might criticize Giuliani for a
too-strict anti-welfare policy. Under his workfare program, mothers
must turn their young children over to inadequate day care and go
sweep streets or clean parks rather than stay home. Students on
welfare must also work for their checks, even if it means dropping
out of school.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has declared herself in favor of welfare reform.
However, in her 1996 book, ``It Takes a Village,'' she called for
more government spending on child care. And in many speeches, she
has placed education, including higher education, above nearly all
other social goals.
</P>
<P>
   She might also attack the mayor _ as a federal judge did
recently _ for failing to inform welfare applicants of benefits
they are entitled to receive. In a speech last October at
Children's Hospital in Little Rock, she announced a radio campaign
to ``get the message across to families to take advantage of what
now is available to their children.'' She has also fervently
supported arts and after-school programs, which Giuliani has also
cut.
</P>
<P>
   On still other issues, Giuliani might find the first lady less
liberal than he might expect.
</P>
<P>
   At least as far back as Febraury 1992, in an interview with The
Boston Globe, Mrs. Clinton said she had changed her mind and come
around to her husband's view on the death penalty. ``The death
penalty, though regrettable, is necessary in some form,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``It Takes a Village,'' she came out in favor of charter
schools and giving parents more choice in selecting them _ though,
in speeches, she has still opposed school vouchers. Her book also
advocates urban and rural empowerment zones, reducing business
regulations, and the ``three-strikes-you're-out'' provision of her
husband's crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   Last year she told the graduating class at Harvard Medical
School, ``Let's be clear. As a nation, we have to continue to work
toward universal, affordable, quality health care for every single
American.''
</P>
<P>
   However, at the World Economy Forum in Davos, Switzerland, she
also declared, ``I believe, as we end this century, any doubts
about the effectiveness of organizing our economy along the lines
of a free market have finally been put to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, she added, ``Even those of us who are mindful of
the progress we have made through government recognize that there
are limits to what it can do. We reject the utopian view that
government can or should protect people from the consequences of
personal decisions or that it can legislate complete peace,
harmony, and brotherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, suspects these
pronouncements. ``Something rings tinny in my ear when she says
such things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Max Brantley, editor of the Arkansas Times and a
Hillary admirer, thinks she is sincere. ``People get more
conservative with age,'' he said. ``Idealism gets tempered with
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may take the trench warfare of a campaign, running on
her own and not as a candidate's wife, to unravel the real Hillary.
``She's been in a carefully controlled cocoon for six years,''
Brantley noted. ``She's so guarded, it's hard to get from her
speeches a good fix on what she really feels.''

UNLIKELY PAIR CAUGHT IN WEB OF TREASURY SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALDEN, Mass. _ When Marty Robbins strutted through the halls of
Malden High School, he was envied as a star football player and
honors student, a young man who made it all look easy.
</P>
<P>
   When John Trischitta walked those same corridors, it was behind
the varsity lettermen, carrying a clipboard and clock as the
manager of four varsity sports. Nicknamed ``Trixie,'' Trischitta
was an oversized kid whose humor and pleasant persona helped him
make friends.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three decades after both men graduated from high school,
the unlikely pair stand accused of attempting to steal $6.5
million, the largest attempted theft of state funds in
Massachusetts. It was an alleged scheme striking for its simplicity
and the ease with which it was executed. If not for suspicious
BankBoston tellers, the two men may have gotten away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Although they touched some of the same circles of friends and
acquaintances after high school, the paths of Robbins and
Trischitta rarely intersected. It was only recently that Robbins,
the stellar athlete, made a closer connection with the boy who
carried the equipment bags.
</P>
<P>
   Following a string of failed and allegedly fraudulent business
dealings, Robbins last year began working as an heir finder, a
business where he would search out companies and people who for one
reason or another never received state checks issued to them. For a
cut of whatever was owed, Robbins would alert the company or person
to the uncashed check and tell them how to obtain the funds.
</P>
<P>
   In what was either a bit of serendipity or evidence of a
well-planned conspiracy, the person at the state treasury who
oversaw the millions of dollars in the state's Unpaid Check Fund
was Trischitta.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, according to sources, Trischitta, 47, gave Robbins,
51, exclusive access to the list of those owed the most from the
unclaimed money fund.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last fall, state prosecutors allege Robbins offered a
$50,000 bribe to Trischitta to issue $6.5 million in checks from
the Unpaid Check Fund to a defunct government development
corporation that Robbins fraudulently claimed to represent. Once
the money was safely deposited in Robbins's BankBoston checking
account, Trischitta was to receive one-third of the proceeds,
prosecutors charge.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious BankBoston officials alerted the attorney general's
office after noticing the large deposit in Robbins's checking
account. Earlier this month he tried to withdraw $6.5 million in
cash. Perfunctory controls established by the state to detect such
an alleged scam failed to work.
</P>
<P>
   Now the talk in barber shops and barrooms throughout Malden is
of how Trischitta, forever a stagehand, and Robbins, the leading
man, ended up together in a scandal that has exposed glaring
weaknesses in the management of the state's multibillion-dollar
treasury.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, Robbins Gas on Eastern Avenue was a landmark in the
Maplewood section of Malden. Marty Robbins and his two younger
brothers all worked at the gas station at one time or another, and
it was expected one of the sons would eventually take over the
business from their father.
</P>
<P>
   But Robbins had bigger plans. He co-captained the Golden
Tornadoes football team, a standout lineman who blitzed through the
Medford line for a crucial two-point safety during the Thanksgiving
Day game his senior year. He was a member of the student council
and the German Honor club, and he told other students in the class
of 1966 that he planned on being a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty was the real deal,'' said a former teacher who knew both
Robbins and Trischitta.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins went on to Boston University, where he played football,
joined a fraternity, and graduated with a journalism degree in
1970. In a brief interview last week, Robbins said that he had
considered becoming an investigative reporter but decided to pursue
a career in business instead. He declined to discuss the charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said he worked in a management program for an automobile
manufacturer after college, but he left that job to start a string
of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although several of the ventures ended in bankruptcy and
allegations of fraud, Robbins always enjoyed the trappings of
success and created an impression he was flush with cash, according
to court records and friends.
</P>
<P>
   While his Associated Salvage business was going bankrupt,
Robbins was driving a $50,000 Mercedes 420 SEL leased by the
company. He also kept a Cherokee 235 airplane at the Lawrence
airport and listed a flight instructor as a creditor in bankruptcy
papers. He made trips abroad and owned a vacation condominium at
Loon Mountain in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife, Barbara, was seeking a divorce, she filed a court
memorandum in 1997 alleging her husband was maintaining a high
standard of living despite having declared personal and corporate
bankruptcy in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He currently drives a 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee, lives in a
luxury apartment in Andover; dines out nearly every day; has a
professional cleaner for his apartment and is a current member of
The Thompson Country Club'' in North Reading, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, having sold the couple's Lynnfield home to make ends
meet, she had moved with their three sons into a more modest
condominium in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Robbins stated in the court filing that her husband had
been able to stay afloat financially by securing a line of bank
credit. For collateral, she said, he had used nearly $100,000 in
money that had been placed in three separate trusts set up in the
names of their sons.
</P>
<P>
   Former business partners allege Robbins lived well by scamming
them.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lulay, Robbins's partner in the salvage business,
alleged in a 1990 lawsuit that Robbins manipulated the books of the
company in order to make money for another firm in which Robbins
was the sole stockholder.
</P>
<P>
   Lulay alleged in his suit that Robbins put his three sons, none
of them yet teenagers at the time, on the company payroll even
though they never did any work for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins's mother, Lorraine Miller, said some media accounts have
wrongly portrayed her son as ``the biggest hoodlum going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you something: He is good, deep down,'' she
said, citing his generous gifts to temples and charities, his
volunteer work for B'nai B'rith, and his taking a son to
Jerusalem's Wailing Wall for his bar mitzvah. ``He'd have 100
friends who will vouch for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But court records suggest a darker side to Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1995, Thomas Chretien alleged in court papers
that Robbins threatened to kill him. Chretien was an investor in
Polar Seafood Corp., a company importing fish from Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins was brought into the company by two other investors to
help increase sales, in part because he had connections with large
supermarket chains, Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really didn't do any work,'' Chretien said. ``He always
seemed like a shady character.''
</P>
<P>
   The company continued to be unprofitable and Chretien said he
stopped receiving scheduled payments on loans he made to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1995, Chretien said he went to the company's
offices in Westwood to retrieve equipment he owned. When he
attempted to collect the items, he was met by an enraged Robbins,
according to Chretien and court documents.

<P>
   PHOENIX - Here are some of Paulette Karras' best tips for basic
cake decorating: &QL; 
 &QL; 
- Assemble all your equipment before you begin. &QL; 
- When coloring buttercream icing, make it a shade lighter than you
want the finished product to be, because it will dry darker. &QL; 
- Use pastels rather than dark colors. They are more appetizing. &QL; 
- Do not dye white icing black. It will stain the teeth when eaten.
Instead, start with chocolate icing and then dye it black. This
will require much less color. &QL; 
- Use clear vanilla to produce bright white icing. Regular vanilla
extract will give the icing a brownish or yellowish tint. &QL; 
- For icing that will be used to make leaves, add 1 teaspoon corn
syrup to 1/2 cup buttercream so leaves come to a smooth point. &QL; 
- Fill icing bags only half full. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The young seaman and the mighty battleship came of age
together, when Boston was a teeming Navy port and a determined
nation marched off to war. They steamed together to Casablanca,
where history was made, and later saw fierce action in the South
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Harold Nye, the former seaman apprentice, and the USS
Massachusetts, a decommissioned warship with a storied history,
will be together again for what is likely to be the last cruise the
ship's World War II crew members could ever see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I've always been with that ship,'' the
84-year-old Nye said. ``I don't think there will be very many more
rides for either of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35,000-ton battleship _ built at Quincy's Fore River
Shipyard and now the centerpiece of a tourist attraction in Fall
River _ was sitting in dry dock Monday, as a small army of workers
put the final touches on an $8.5 million overhaul of sandblasting,
replating and repainting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a struggle, but everything turned out fine,'' said
Dan Schaab, general manager of Boston Ship Repair, which plans to
send the mammoth ship on its way back home to Battleship Cove
sometime Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And as a tugboat tows the Massachusetts on its 2 1/2-day journey
home, Nye and other veterans will be on board, hoping for some
stiff winds and rough seas, natural forces that would breathe some
life into the former warship its crew members affectionately called
``Big Mamie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to feel her move again,'' Nye said. ``She's such a
good ship.''
</P>
<P>
   When the battleship Massachusetts was commissioned in May 1942,
Nye was a $32-a-month seaman apprentice, who worked in the ship's
galley from its first shakedown cruise to the day he left the
service four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Nye was aboard when the ship's 16-inch guns, capable of hurling
20 tons of steel more than 20 miles, thundered to life on Nov. 8,
1942, during the North African invasion. The Massachusetts bested
its adversary, the French battleship Jean Bart, in a ferocious
seven-hour engagement.
</P>
<P>
   And Nye was aboard for the first of a series of battles in the
Pacific, where the ship destroyed 18 Japanese aircraft. In all, the
Massachusetts fought decisively in 35 battles and steamed 225,000
miles as a commissioned warship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good hunk of her crew came from Massachusetts,'' said
Strafford Morss, the project manager and the ship's unofficial
historian. ``She did her job and brought her people home safely. No
man was ever lost on the ship due to combat. That is what the crew
members remember. They have a tremendous fondness for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The 680-foot ship, decommissioned in 1947 and stricken from the
Navy's register in June 1962, slowly lost its battle against time.
Big Mamie's steel hull corroded, its original teak deck faded and
cracked and became what Morss called ``an extraordinary jungle
gym'' for marine growth, which had accumulated nearly two inches
thick.
</P>
<P>
   During the four-month overhaul at Boston Ship Repair, more than
300 workers used 3,000 gallons of epoxy and 260,000 pounds of
half-inch-thick steel to reseal a ship whose waterline was damaged
by decades of wind and waves. Until it entered drydock last fall,
the Massachusetts had not been out of the water since the Truman
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you traipse around underneath her, you get to appreciate
just how darn big she is,'' Morss said. ``You get to thinking about
what those fellows at Quincy did as a matter of skill and art. She
came out as a gorgeous product.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, workers applied the last coat of battleship
gray paint, whose final gloss was tempered by Sunday's heavy rains.
But the repair crews are now ready to reattach the ship's anchor,
flood the dry dock, and prepare the old battleship for what will
likely be its last voyage in the life of former crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the first ride, and now I'll have the last ride,'' said
Nye, a Marion native and a member of the museum's board of
directors. ``I'm proud of the ship. I'm proud of what it's done. It
was the first battleship to fire its 16-inch guns in World War II,
and it was the last battleship to do that. We saw a lot of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was astronomical to see its fantail again and to see its
beautiful bow,'' he said. ``I'd forgotten what it looked like out
of the water. It's got beautiful lines.''

IAN MCEWAN TAKES HIS READERS TO THE EDGE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ian McEwan doesn't seem so creepy in the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think he would be, this novelist who has chalked up some
of the most vividly creepy scenes in contemporary literature.
</P>
<P>
   There's the savage betrayal that climaxes ``The Comfort of
Strangers.'' The act of incest in ``Cement Garden.'' The father
losing his daughter in the supermarket and, later, the slow-motion
car crash in ``The Child in Time.'' There's the chopping up of a
body in ``The Innocent.'' The haunted house scene in ``Black
Dogs.'' Most breathtaking, there's the wayward balloon at the start
of ``Enduring Love.'' Finally, there's the hillside rapist and a
witness's chilling passivity that marks the turning point of his
most recent work, the winner of last year's Booker Prize,
``Amsterdam'' (published by Doubleday).
</P>
<P>
   These are terrifying scenes _ McEwan moments, they might be
called _ in which characters move through a dreamlike haze with a
knife-sharp awareness of detail, time seems palpable and prolonged,
events spin out of control, characters are stripped to their core,
and lives are irreversibly transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the author of these tales, by all appearances, is a classic
mild-mannered fellow: 50, soft-spoken, slight of build, with
glasses, thinning hairline, dry humor. His longtime friend and
fellow British writer Christopher Hitchens confirms the impression:
``Ian is the most pleasant guy you'd ever want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   So what about those scenes that mark all of his novels, those
moments of gripping horror? Do they reflect nothing at all in
McEwan's own life?
</P>
<P>
   McEwan, who is passing through New York to promote his new novel
_ which has been on The New York Times bestseller list for six
weeks _ considers the question for no more than a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that some of these things are horrible,'' he says,
``is unimportant. I do love to generate a kind of narrative
intensity. I do like to take my readers to the edge. I like to
generate that sense of danger. I'm interested in finding out how
characters survive, or are shaped by, their destinies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But _ and it seems odd to say this,'' he goes on, ``but the
primary driving force behind these scenes is aesthetic. It's like a
painter using a certain color. I like novels in which something
happens. It's not the only thing one wants in a novel, but I hold
to quite old-fashioned beliefs in the power of the story, our need
for story. Even if we're no longer children, our habits of
narrative are very strong. So,'' he restates the point, ``it's
primarily aesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   He expresses a slight annoyance at the numerous reviews that
describe his work as macabre. ``I see that word `macabre,' '' he
says, ``and I sense somewhere inside me a great yawn. It's idle.
It's lazy. The last really macabre scene was the cutting up of the
body in `The Innocent.' I wrote that in 1988.'' He pauses. ``I've
written plenty of other moods and scenes since.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwan's ``Amsterdam'' _ about two old friends, a composer who
thinks he's a genius and a journalist who knows he's a louse, the
scandals they sire, and the revenge that ensues _ certainly ranks
among his least macabre, though he takes some nasty jabs at his
characters toward the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had such fun writing it,'' McEwan exclaims, smiling. ``I
wrote it in a state of glee. It grew out of my love for certain
kinds of novels in the English comic tradition, the key figure
being Evelyn Waugh. I see it as a version of the comic novel that
does not attempt to be funny at every turn, which I find quite
oppressive, like someone blowing the trumpet in your ear.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwan has always been the least horn-blowing among the British
writers of his generation, a peculiarly cliquish bunch that
includes _ most well known on this side of the Atlantic _ novelists
Martin Amis and Julian Barnes and journalist Hitchens, all of whom
studied together at Oxford in the late 1960s and early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must be the only writer in Britain who did not go to Oxford
or Cambridge,'' McEwan cracks. ``Novel writing is such a democratic
activity, you don't need a lot of money to get started. So it does
seem extraordinary to me _ I mean, to write novels, you need to be
literate and imaginative, but I can't believe that Oxford and
Cambridge have a monopoly on them.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwan went to the University of Sussex, and cannot think of
another writer who did the same. His mother was a chambermaid. His
father joined the army to escape unemployment and ``rose through
the ranks slowly.'' Ian was, practically speaking, an only child.
(He has a half brother and half sister, but they are much older; he
didn't grow up with either.) At age 11, he was sent to a state-run
boarding school, not one of the private institutions that most
British writers attended. The masters who ran it, he recalls, ``had
the old-fashioned left view of taking working-class kids and
turning them into middle-class kids.'' Nearly all his classmates _
poor bright boys from central London _ went on to university.
</P>
<P>
   Sussex was a fairly new campus and, as McEwan puts it, ``had a
wish to redraw the map of learning.'' An English lit major at
Oxford focused on precisely that _ reading English literature, from
``Beowulf'' on up _ while his counterpart at Sussex delved into the
rest of European literature as well.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, at age 21, McEwan read Kafka, and that's when he
knew he wanted to be a writer. ``It seems odd to say this,'' McEwan
muses, ``but Kafka was like freedom to me. It wasn't bogged down in
a documented social world. Knowing nothing about the social world''
_ by which he means the world of high society _ ``I found it
liberating that I could be a writer and not know whether that's a
Louis Quatorze chair you're sitting on. British literature was so
much like an overstuffed chair. Kafka was much more elemental,
stripped down to the basics. It wasn't `Lady Olivia opened the
telegram, screaming with delight.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McEwan fell in with the Oxford-bred literati in the mid-1970s,
when he started attending the Friday lunches organized by a set of
young writers at the New Statesman, including Amis, the magazine's
literary editor at the time; Barnes, who was Amis's deputy; and
Hitchens, a political contributor. When the BBC banned a play that
McEwan had written, Amis, as a tweak to the establishment,
published it in its entirety. Their friendship deepened as a result
_ though McEwan's style has always stood apart: more Continental,
more Kafkaesque.
</P>
<P>
   Kafka's stories also appealed to McEwan for what he calls their
``dark humor,'' and though ``Amsterdam'' is his most explicitly
comic work, the earlier books, too, betray the occasional cocked
eyebrow lurking between the lines, sometimes all too subtly.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ``Enduring Love'' ends with a 14-page appendix
purporting to be a clinical case study _ reprinted from the British
Review of Psychiatry, replete with bibliography and obscure
citations _ about an obsessive-deluded patient who appears to be
the real-life model of a deranged character in McEwan's novel.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, McEwan says, this case study is ``entirely made
up.'' The careful reader will note that the names of its authors,
Drs. Wenn and Camia, form an anagram of McEwan's own name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some reviewer criticized me for following the case study far
too mechanically,'' he says with a mischievous chuckle. ``Talk
about stepping in it. That gave me great pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwan lives in Oxford with his second wife and, occasionally,
his two sons from a previous marriage, which ended in a nasty
divorce. (He wrote a children's book for them, ``The Daydreamer,''
a delightful work that didn't find an audience here.) He loves to
hike, a passion that informs the crucial scene in ``Amsterdam'' _
and another way in which he differs from most British writers, who
tend to be, as he puts it, ``lounge lizards.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls his politics ``soft leftish.'' In the '80s, he wrote an
antinuclear oratorio, titled ``Or Shall We Die?'' His most
critically celebrated novel, ``The Innocent,'' ended with a hope
that the dreams shattered by the Cold War might be rebuilt in the
new Berlin. Five months after finishing that book, McEwan recalls,
the Berlin Wall came crashing down and he rushed to the scene,
spending ``a delirious two days and nights, roaming the city'' _
which inspired the opening of his next novel, ``Black Dogs,'' a
more pessimistic post-Cold War parable.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a Latin jazz tune wafts over the PA system of the
SoHo Grand Hotel lobby. McEwan sways his head and briefly hums
along. ``That's Ry Cooder and the Buena Vista Social Club,'' he
says. ``A group of Cuban musicians. They played in London. Great
stuff.'' He listens some more. ``I've got to get down to Cuba,
before American corporations take it over.'' He pauses. ``Not that
Castro was very brilliant at running things, either.''

HONORING A DISHONORABLE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (w and k coding)  
 (For use by New York Times   News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Three men and one woman, united in an artistic
triumph arguably without parallel in the American theater. Three
men and one woman, divided by the experience of evil _ large,
medium, and small. And then united one last time by happy and ugly
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Broadway production of Arthur Miller's protean
``Death of a Salesman'' just happened to open last month as
Hollywood was arranging to give a career Oscar to one of its
trail-blazing directors, Elia Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   Those two occurrences link our cast from the original production
50 years ago: Miller; Kazan, its director; the late Lee J. Cobb
(the first Willy Loman); and the late Mildred Dunnock (the first
Linda). The link, however, is not merely artistic, but political _
the very different brushes each had with the fanatical
anticommunism that drove America crazy during the late '40s, '50s,
and early '60s in an effort to combat a bestial ideology with
enforced conformity and Constitution-shattering cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan's Oscar is properly controversial. He is a gigantic figure
in the performing arts, inextricably linked with the formative
period of Miller's and Tennessee Williams's explosion onto the
stage, and a director of seminal importance to Hollywood's
occasional flirtation with excellence (``Gentleman's Agreement,''
``Viva Zapata,'' ``On the Waterfront,'' ``East of Eden''). He turns
90 this fall, and Hollywood has honored many a less worthy creative
life.
</P>
<P>
   But Kazan is also a pathetically protypical rat-fink of the
anticommunist hysteria, whose self-serving opportunism before the
House Committee on Un-American Activities in April 1952 preserved
his prosperous career without advancing the struggle against
communism an inch; whose name-naming not only was restricted to the
weak or already black-listed; but whose service in the American
inquisition gave it the kind of legitmacy it craved to ruin the
lives of tens of thousands of teachers, writers, directors, and
performers on the basis of their associations and political
beliefs, not any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The exquisite irony of his upcoming honor is the insistence of
the board of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that
it is recognizing his artistic life, not his politics _ an
insistence made more cogent by the board member and Kazan friend
who started all this, veteran actor Karl Malden, who began his
career under Kazan in the 1930s in New York's Group Theatre where
more than one person eventually defamed by him worked.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's assertion that Kazan's art matters apart from his
politics is precisely the point. By blessing the inquisition, Kazan
got to have that life; no one will ever know how many other great
artists never got the chance to develop because of the system his
perfidy helped legitimize.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Miller chose a different path. Kazan decision's to
protect his own career at the cost of others split them deeply.
When Miller's turn before the infamous House committee came in
1956, he refused to talk names on First Amendment grounds,
testifying only about himself. And where Kazan took refuge in
simplistic melodrama to make the informer's case in ``On the
Waterfront,'' Miller took on the hysteria in memorable depth via
metaphor (``The Crucible'') and genuine moral dilemma (``A View
from the Bridge'').
</P>
<P>
   Lee J. Cobb's story is best told in Victor S. Navasky's
encyclopedic account of the Hollywood blacklist, ``Naming Names.''
Cobb held out for two years after the investigators came calling in
1951, during which he went broke and lost his first wife to
alcoholism. Shortly after he cracked and named 20 names, he had a
massive coronary. When Navasky interviewed him in the 1970s, he
showed regret, multifaceted bitterness and sadness. Said Cobb:
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the Mephistophelian mystery that the Reds have
bequeathed to the world is the ability to make one confess without
any truncheon marks on one's head. You start out wanting to keep
your friends. In a totalitarian country they want you to betray
your friends, and you persuade yourself finally it is your duty. On
the tortuous road to that conclusion lie many bleached bones of
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Mildred Dunnock was luckier. Utterly nonpolitical, she couldn't
get work after being named in a right-wing publication as being
friendly with the likes of Miller, Lillian Hellman, and even Kazan
himself. Her husband, a banker, used his connections to get a
retraction. ``It gave me an emotional understanding of being
accused,'' she told The New York Times years later in a clip
Navasky unearthed. ``I felt contaminated, I felt I had leprosy, I
felt I had incriminated my husband, a conventional man.''
</P>
<P>
   They say Malden himself may give the Oscar speech for Kazan this
month. One hopes the applause is scattered and perfunctory, for
this is a dishonorable man.

RENDELL'S DELIGHTFULLY HORRIBLE `SIGHT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES 
By Ruth Rendell 
Crown, 327 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This intricately structured novel weaves the lives of three odd,
damaged people into a plot drenched with impending tragedy. In this
delightfully horrible story, Ruth Rendell's main characters are on
an unavoidable collision course with catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of ``A Sight for Sore Eyes'' the three live
separate lives in different parts of London.
</P>
<P>
   At age 7, Francine Hill was found mute and soaked in blood,
sitting beside her murdered mother's body. Ten years later she
seems to have put the trauma behind her and has matured into a
lovely young woman. Richard, her guilt-stricken philosopher father,
is overprotective but emotionally distant. Julia, her paranoid,
crank-psychologist stepmother, tries to monitor and control every
aspect of Francine's life, which only makes Francine more naive and
vulnerable to evil.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful, feckless Harriet Oxenholme, thrown over and tossed
out by her rock-star boyfriend, found another meal ticket in
Franklin Merton, a dull, older, prosperous married man. Smitten
with Harriet's glamour, Franklin left his wife. Ten years later
Harriet is begining to lose both her looks and Franklin, and has
taken to scanning newspaper ads to find virile young handymen
willing to provide sex as well as home repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Brex was raised in squalor by benighted parents who never
kissed or cuddled him, rarely even talked to him. Against all
expectations, Teddy attended university and earned a degree in
ornamental art, winning the school's top prize for his work. Teddy
is drawn to beautiful things and will do anything to acquire what
he wants. Since his emotionally deprived upbringing has made him a
sociopath with the instincts of a weasel, ``anything'' includes
murder.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear from the outset of ``A Sight for Sore Eyes'' that the
lives of these three characters will intersect and that nothing
good will come of their meeting _ nothing good except the kind of
engrossingly nasty story Rendell's fans have come to expect from
her.
</P>
<P>
   The highly acclaimed Rendell is sometimes called ``the crime
writer's crime writer,'' though crime reader's crime writer might
be more apt. She's known for her innovative approach to the genre.
Even her Inspector Wexford police procedurals don't conform to
mystery conventions. She also writes more traditional novels under
the name Barbara Vine. In an interview she once said that she
started writing as Vine because she wanted to experiment with a
``more feminine'' approach, to try ``a softer voice speaking at a
slower pace, more sensitive perhaps, and more intuitive.''
Whichever name she writes under, Rendell is both sensitive and
intuitive _ psychologically insightful, brilliant at portraying
character, able to render her creations believably human and
sympathetic, if not always likable.
</P>
<P>
   To write much more about the plot would spoil the pleasure for
the book's readers. ``A Sight for Sore Eyes'' is high-quality
Rendell _ not in a class with her masterpiece, ``A Judgement in
Stone,'' but that's asking a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The novel has a small problem or two. Julia, Francine's evil
stepmother, could have stepped straight out of the Brothers Grimm.
Where did she come from? Why is she so crazy? It's never made
clear. The ending of the novel could be troublesome for some
readers. It's either a neat stroke of irony or a cop-out, depending
on one's point of view. It's probably not giving too much away to
reveal that by the last page, everybody gets what he or she
deserves. (Actually, one gets a lot more than she deserves, but
that's just one reader's opinion.) This is not always the case in
Rendell's books. Sometmes wickedness goes unpunished, or appears to
go unpunished. This seeming moral ambiguity is just one of many
reasons her novels are so consistently interesting.

CUOMO MISFIRES IN SUIT AGAINST BOSTON COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrew, you're no Mario.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cuomo _ the US secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, son of the legendary ex-governor of New York, and Al
Gore loyalist _ greatly irritated the mayor of Boston last month
when he released a report charging the city with systemic
discrimination in its public housing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the HUD secretary is on the losing end of a lawsuit filed
on behalf of a Boston-based energy company. Damages _ monetary and
political _ could be hefty.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 12, the US government quietly conceded liability for
improperly canceling its lucrative contract with Energy Capital
Partners of Boston. The concession is bad news for HUD, the party
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The company's two principals _ Alan M. Leventhal and Fred A.
Seigel _ are not just any Boston businessmen. They are two of the
Clinton administration's biggest supporters, and both are hugely
successful Democratic party fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawsuit, filed in the US Court of Federal Claims, charged
that HUD wrongfully canceled its contract with ECP on the basis of
a Feb. 7, 1997, article in The Wall Street Journal. The Page 1
story suggested that ECP had obtained the contract strictly because
of Leventhal and Seigel's political fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   The government's position was greatly undercut by the language
in the letter of termination sent by Nicolas P. Retsinas, then an
assistant HUD secretary and commissioner of the Federal Housing
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Seigel, dated Feb. 14, 1977, Retsinas wrote:
``While I know that the FHA negotiated and entered into that
agreement solely to assist project residents and reduce taxpayer
risk by strengthening the FHA fund, the mention of the agreement in
the context of the larger Wall Street Journal article potentially
creates the appearance of an impropriety.''
</P>
<P>
   Would HUD terminate a contract on the basis of innuendo, not
because of an actual breach or other unlawful conduct? Apparently
the agency did just that, setting the stage for the suit filed in
November 1997 by Boston lawyer R. Robert Popeo.
</P>
<P>
   Popeo declined comment, referring only to the public record of
the proceedings. Leventhal and Seigel were also unavailable for
comment. They are said to be seeking damages in the $50 million
range.
</P>
<P>
   Ginny Terzano, a HUD spokeswoman, says the agency terminated the
contract because of concerns over the ``appearance of an exclusive
no-bid contract.'' The contract was awarded in September 1996,
after more than a year of negotiations and before Cuomo took over
HUD. Before the bad press, HUD touted the $200 million program to
make federally assisted housing more energy efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morally, it was the right thing to do, although legally, the
contract may have been valid,'' says Terzano now, about the abrupt
contract termination.
</P>
<P>
   Retsinas left HUD a year ago. Cuomo remains in charge of a
federal agency long blasted for fiscal mismanagement, as well as
for letting politics interfere regularly with government business.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming HUD secretary in 1997, Cuomo drew flattering
reviews for admitting the truth about the agency's weaknesses _ he
called it, for instance, a ``poster child for inept government.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he is trying to change the perception and reality at
HUD. But in the case involving Energy Capital Partners, his concern
for political image seems to have gotten in the way of political
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, a trusted adviser to Vice President Al Gore, is vying to
play a major role in Gore's presidential campaign. Just last week,
his dad told an audience at Harvard University that Andrew has
``everything his old man has . . . and he's the next generation.
You should keep your eye on Andrew.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Andrew has the family eloquence and the family arrogance.
Along with that comes an exceptional sense of entitlement that is
often part of the legacy famous men pass on to their sons. The
result: Mario Cuomo remains a hero to many Massachusetts Democrats.
At the moment, his son is out of favor with some of them, including
some key Gore supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo could very well be correct in his critique of the Boston
Housing Authority. The HUD report is based on old data, but the
BHA's historic treatment of minorities is shabby enough to be
suspect, even today. So perhaps Cuomo will proudly stand on
principle and believe it is worth upsetting Mayor Menino, despite
the dominant role he plays in Massachusetts politics.
</P>
<P>
   But going after the likes of Leventhal and Seigel on a
perception that now turns out to be a misperception? That is not
smart policy or politics _ for Andrew Cuomo or for Al Gore.

A MAORI WITH A FACE ONLY A MOTHER COULD LOVE _ AND SHE DOES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHANGAROA, New Zealand _ You've heard of faces that could stop a
clock? Not Hog's. His is as complex and intricate as the insides of
a Swiss watch _ a face that would stop traffic anywhere but New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of face lifts. Hog's has been raised to an artistic
level that may seem bizarre to an alien but is really a throwback
to a prouder time when their country belonged to the natives, the
Maoris, and the English conquerors hadn't yet landed. It is a
warrior's fearsome countenance deeply imprinted and illustrated,
marked by tattoos in a time-honored style that dates back
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A face only a mother could love, huh?'' he laughs loudly.
``Well, she does.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, on you it looks very good,'' says Danielle, another
American visitor to this small town near the tip of the North
Island's east coast, a place known for its sport fishing.

   It is 8 a.m. at the Marlin Hotel, right across the street from
Whangaroa's harbor that is well-stocked with boats whose principal
Pacific Ocean prey is marlin. Several of them, extremely large, one
a striped 440 pounder, float on the walls of the barroom where Hog
is breakfasting and shooting pool, sipping Red Lion lager between
turns at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hog's last name? I don't know, and maybe he doesn't either,''
smiles the publican, Laurie Stephens. ``But he's a good man. Always
obliging when some traveler wants to take his photo. A peacemaker
if some of the boys go a little heavy on breakfast and get
rambunctious.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie's wife, Coleen, says that unbottled breakfast fare is
also available, like eggs and bacon from her kitchen. Sounds good,
and Danielle trades her pool cue for a fork.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlin, a white frame building, has been a utilitarian hotel
(plumbing somewhere down the hall) for more than a century. Zane
Grey, the best-selling American author of Westerns, who rejoiced in
rounding up marlins and swordfish, supposedly slept here during his
quests of the 1920s. The writer of ``Riders of the Purple Sage''
delighted in riding the purpling seas.
</P>
<P>
   Opening early, closing late, the Marlin is a repository for
every fish story ever told. ``Wonder if Grey ever lassoed a marlin,
or used a six-shooter to nail one?'' muses Hog, who claims he did
even better. Hog says he once scared a surfaced marlin to death by
flashing the traditional Maori warrior's ``if-looks-could-kill''
look _ eyes bulging, tongue jabbing venomously _ at the poor
creature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad you didn't bring it in here for me to cook,'' scolds
Coleen ``But maybe a petrified marlin wouldn't taste so good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not's good as another frosty Red Lion,'' Hog says, holding out
his personalized mug for Laurie to re-fill.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive flight from windy, rainy, washed-out beaches and
chilly weather on the west coast had brought us to sunshine on this
side of the territory called Northland. Nevertheless, it was an
eyes-refreshing cross-country drive, the kind my friend, Aurelio,
thrives on at the wheel: skinny, roads twisted through forests of
giant kauris, seemingly virginal territory decked out in husky
ancient ferns, and over the beautiful Parahirahi Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Now there would be one beach after another, deserted or
virtually so, any number of sandy pick-and-play situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, first,'' interjects Hog, ``you can't leave Whangaroa
without climbing St. Paul's. It's our great landmark, our
geological pride with the best view for miles. I'd lead the charge
_ but, uh, it's a mite difficult to climb with a beer in each
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour's walk up the road, then through a pasture inhabited
by horses, brings us to the base of St. Paul's, a steep and lofty
bald knob of rock that springs from the earth without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like into thin hair to me,'' says Danielle. ``A good
place to visit _ by helicopter. If you get there, send me a letter.
Like St. Paul. I'm staying at base camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio scowls. ``Come on, you two. It's only 700 feet, with
lots of footholds. There are supposed to be chains to help you
along the hard parts.'' When it comes to getting high by abusing
only one substance _ her companions _ Aurelio is a champ. But why
do we follow?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because she's got the car keys,'' shrugs Danielle.
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   Grunt . . . clamber . . . quiver . . . moan. . . shinny . . .
pull. . . cling . . . squeeze . . . scrunch . . . slip . . . reach
. . . crawl . . . brace . . . whine . . . scrape . . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that wasn't bad, was it?'' beams Aurelio at the summit.
``Isn't the view'' _ far out to sea and to distant villages and
butte-like Mount Taratara _ ``breathtaking?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lifetaking,'' says Danielle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breathshaking,'' huff I, third to the pinnacle. ``Now, may we
find a beach, please?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Name your flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   There are so many. Matauri Bay, well below the highway, is both
soothing and somber, its waters the tomb of the tragic Greenpeace
ship, Rainbow Warrior. The Warrior's mission was honorable, to
protest French nuclear tests of 1985 in the Pacific north of
Tahiti. But before it could leave Auckland Harbour, the boat was
shamefully blown up by French government agents, the explosion
killing a Portuguese photographer, Fernando Pereira.
</P>
<P>
   Its twisted remains were brought to Matauri, to lie submerged
near the Cavalli Islands, and a sculpted memorial recalling the
awful deed stands on a hilltop surveying the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Adorning the shore of Wainui Bay is a camp ground amid lazy cows
and large, rambling, red-flowering trees called pohutukawas _ ``New
Zealand's `Christmas' trees,'' says a local, Evelyn Lineham.
Farther along, Cable Bay, whose beach is only a few yards off the
road, affords a fine midday swim.
</P>
<P>
   But the late afternoon discovery is divine: Matai Bay, a double
horseshoe divided by a rocky head at the end of a long, jouncy dirt
road on the tip of eastward-lunging Karikari Peninsula. Each arc is
almost a mile long, connected by soft and generous stretches of
straw-toned sand. A camping site hovers above the left, and a few
people are in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but on the right _ nobody. Just sand, and sea of varying
currents and shades of blue. Most of the shoreline is assaulted by
surf, its hoarse voice competing with seabirds for the ear. But the
waves are not too imposing for body-surfing.
</P>
<P>
   However, at the far corner, the ocean calms. A patch of sand
walled by tall boulders is practically a private retreat, opening
to a serene amethyst pool that seems pacifically divorced from the
Pacific. As a scarlet backwall, a gigantic pohutukawa sends its
wandering branches snaking in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   Peel and paddle is Matai's sensual invitation. It's hog heaven.

FEW ISSUES TO BAT AROUND IN THIS CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Camp Tranquility, my guys call it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to my distinguished Boston, Providence,
Worcester, Hartford, and All Points USA colleagues, so? Ever think
perhaps we've all been kind of spoiled over the years?
</P>
<P>
   In a normal major league baseball spring training camp,
five-time batting champions aren't revealed to have had major
extramarital affairs on the eve of spring training. They don't
speak of falling out of trucks or willing themselves invisible.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal major league baseball spring training camp, Cy Young
Award-winning pitchers don't show up late and then strap on
headphones while talking to their new manager.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal major league baseball spring training camp,
slugging, contract-challenged first basemen don't arrive direct
from acquittals in DUI trials and then launch three bombs in their
return game.
</P>
<P>
   All this constitutes falling-out-of-sky news. It constitutes
stories that write themselves. It is all sort of business as usual
for the Boston Red Sox, who, after all, are the only team in major
league baseball history to have a pitcher stabbed to death at a
spring training fish fry (Big Ed Morris, 1932). Spring training
always has had a special cachet around here.
</P>
<P>
   But this year it's a little quiet, which, come to think of it,
is probably how the GM likes it. Mo is about as far away as he
could be, and we know the GM likes that. There are no overt loose
cannons, only closet ones (my lips are sealed, the better to
protect a source or two).
</P>
<P>
   There are no festering personal issues, at least when it comes
to contracts. The key people are all signed up for a while. The
Closer is inked through 2000, plus option. The Shortstop is set
through 2002, with options running through 2004. The Third Baseman
is signed through 2001. The Ace of the Staff is theirs through
2003, plus option. The Knuckleballer is signed through 2000, plus
option. The Veteran Rehab is signed through 2001, plus option.
These six people represent the core of the team. They're all
well-paid, and they all know it.
</P>
<P>
   So scratch contracts as an issue. What we are left with is _ are
you ready? _ baseball. The game between the lines is the issue.
We're just not used to that.
</P>
<P>
   And even here there are really only two major topics of
interest. We all know that Mark Portugal and Pat Rapp are being
conceded the fourth and fifth spots in the rotation beyond Pedro
Martinez, Tim Wakefield, and Bret Saberhagen. We all know that Tom
Gordon is the closer and that Derek Lowe, Jim Corsi, and Mark
Guthrie will set up, and that John Wasdin is close to a lock. That
leaves one pitching job, if that.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that Jason Varitek and Scott Hatteberg will split
the catching, with Mike Stanley ready, just in case. We all know
who will play short and third. We all know that Troy O'Leary will
be the everyday left fielder. We all know that Darren Lewis is the
regular center fielder. We all know that the door is open for Trot
Nixon to take the right field job, but we also know that Damon
Buford is going to play, somehow, some way, and that Lewis will
wind up playing some right, as well.
</P>
<P>
   What we don't know is what's going to happen with the right side
of the infield. There are second basemen up the wazoo, not to
mention a proliferation of 1B/DH sorts. Figuring out what to do
with this bunch should give Jimy Williams something to think about
for approximately 22 hours of every working day between now and the
opener in Kansas City 34 days hence.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think so, anyway, but Williams is not necessarily like
most other managers, and he most definitely isn't like the average
Red Sox writer or fan. What obsesses us doesn't obsess this
tranquil man at all. He's been around baseball too long to worry
about every little thing. In the Jimy Williams world view, things
have a very convenient way of taking care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   We look at Jose Offerman and say, ``Where is he going to play?''
We know that Jeff Frye, Donnie Sadler, and Lou Merloni can all play
second base better than Jose can. That's just a given. We assume
that Williams would like Frye to earn his old job back. We also
assume that Dan Duquette would like to see Offerman play second
because that would make the GM seem less foolish for throwing $26
million at a slap hitter who does not fit the offensive profile of
either a first baseman or a DH. And if he plays first base, that
means Williams wouldn't have both Reggie Jefferson and Stanley in
the lineup at the same time, and Lord knows this team needs all the
thump it can get.
</P>
<P>
   Let's complicate things even more. There are some of us who
wonder why more consideration isn't being given to promote Sadler
to a position of importance on this team. Frye is a better major
league hitter, for sure, but while Frye is a good glove man he is
no Sadler. The young man's range is phenomenal, and if he hits even
a little he will bring almost unprecedented speed to the Boston
lineup. Sooner or later, the Red Sox must figure out what to do
with Sadler, who will turn 24 on June 24. But I assure you Jimy
isn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of stuff that makes a good Red Sox fan's hair
not just hurt, but ache, and ache incessantly. Offerman is an
expensive piece of the puzzle and he just doesn't seem to fit. You
know you want a guy capable of getting on base 40 percent of the
time in the lineup, but where can he play and not kill you? If he
winds up at second, we will know that the manager has lost a power
struggle with the GM. If he plays first, whither either Jefferson
or Stanley? And is any DH who doesn't hit for power worth $6
million a year?
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what? The manager is right. It probably will sort
itself out through some kind of natural selection process. Hey,
it's all good baseball talk, and it's all we've got. I don't know
about you, but I don't need anything else.

SOSA ISN'T ON A POWER TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ Same old Sammy Sosa. Coming off a whirlwind
offseason, the Chicago Cubs slugger may be even more powerful and
more motivated than he was last fall when he battled Mark McGwire
for home run supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa emphasized this Monday, his first day of spring training
with the Cubs. He was smiling. It was satisfying enough that he had
66 home runs, four behind McGwire. And he wouldn't mind being named
the National League Most Valuable Player for a second straight
year. He's hungry enough to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is for the Cubs to get to the World Series,'' Sosa
said at a news conference that seemed more like a gathering of old
friends. ``I want to do my job and put some numbers up. I want to
do what I can to help my teammates and earn their respect. We're a
family and if we stay together and play as a team as we did in
1998, we're going to go a long, long way.''
</P>
<P>
   What was that again?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play on a team where everybody is together and
everybody wants to win and everybody believes in himself, you know
we're going to do much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Many thought that a busy offseason may have worn down Sosa, who
traveled all over America and to Japan with a major league all-star
team. Many a gladiator has fallen victim to the knife-and-fork
circuit. Sosa begged to differ with those who asked. His weight is
222 pounds, 12 more than last year, but the extra bulk was pure
muscle. Sosa was away from his home in the Dominican Republic for
all but two weeks. The requests far outweighed the time he had
available. But Sosa was able to meet the demand. Spring training
will seem like a break for him.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be nice if Sosa and McGwire resume their battle in
1999?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the man,'' Sosa said in a familiar mantra. ``I hope he
has another great year. I say that because for the last three years
Mark has hit over 50 home runs. This is my first time going over
50. I have a lot of respect for Mark McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Sosa appended his remark when it was pointed out that
he was MVP and his team made the NL playoffs, while the Cardinals
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire is still the man,'' said Sosa. ``But I'm the man at
Wrigley Field. That's my house. I can't give that away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to change. I never forget where I came from. No
matter how high or how low I am I want to keep it the same way.
Also, I'm still humble. This is my job. As long as I have a Chicago
Cubs uniform on my back I'm going to play hard every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sosa went through his paces as if he'd been in camp for
weeks. He hit a home run on the second pitch thrown his way in
batting practice. He signed autographs for a half-hour. Finally, he
held separate press conferences for the electronic and print media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll have another year like that in 1999,''
said Sosa. ``But you never know what can happen. Facing McGwire was
great. I think it came at the right time and helped me put up some
big numbers. As for 1999, I don't need to go out and set records
again. Just go out and play the same game, be there for my team, my
teammates, and my manager. Go out and play the game and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa shook as many hands as he could Monday. Teammates were
pleased to see him in camp and already in playing condition. But
nobody felt better than manager Jim Riggleman. Sosa's presence
seems to lift everything and everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried about Sammy,'' said Riggleman. ``Japan was
good. He was playing baseball, which was good. He didn't get tired.
He knows how to take care of himself. I don't give Sammy advice.
He's pretty much in control of himself and his programs. His
responsibility to me is come out and play hard every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his travel schedule, Sosa made arrangements for
private workouts several times. He also lifted weights at home. All
this while overseeing the work of the foundation that bears his
name. Sosa was a major contributor to a relief fund for hurricane
victims in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important,'' said Sosa. ``The hurricane was unbelievable.
It went through my country and it destroyed everything. There were
a lot of people suffering. It's not like here in the US where you
have the opportunity to eat and to get whatever you need. Back
there, you don't have that kind of support. Here, I have the
support of the American people and it saves a lot of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has a lot of memories that will last a lifetime. Hitting
home runs No. 61 and 62 rank high. Having his family in Chicago for
Sammy Sosa Day was another. The best might have been a two-week
break at Christmas, which he spent at home with his wife and
children. It was nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a beautiful wife,'' he said.``My kids, my family. They
understand everything. They understand I am in a situation where I
can't say no to people. She talks to me everyday and supported me
100 percent. I've been blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa had only one request before he stopped talking. Don't
compare him to Michael Jordan, the retired Chicago Bulls superstar
who still rules the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will replace Michael Jordan,'' said Sosa. ``Besides, I
don't want to be like Mike. I want to be like Sammy Sosa. And
whatever Sammy Sosa gives is because he works hard. I'll play my
game. I want to be the best.''

ARGENTINA, RISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So Carlos Menem of Argentina Monday abandoned his plans to press
for a third term as president of Argentina. That's good. The
flamboyant 68-year-old, who over the past eight years has
skillfully led Argentina back to democracy and economic stability,
would have had to badger the Supreme Court he mostly appointed for
permission to seek a third consecutive term _ a possibility
expressly forbidden by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Menem also has as much as acknowledged as a nonstarter his
surprise proposal last month to abandon the Argentine peso to use
US dollars exclusively throughout the economy. That's good, too, at
least for now.
</P>
<P>
   For however desirable a spreading monetary union in Latin
America eventually might be, the ground has not been prepared for
it to succeed. Much work remains to be done. That was the message
that Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini brought to Boston last week.
There were few who disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Giavarini is the man who presumably would serve as finance
minister should his Alliance defeat Menem's Peronist party in the
autumn elections. Formerly he was treasurer of Buenos Aires,
population 20 million. (The city's mayor, Fernando de la Rua,
leader of the liberal Alliance, is leading comfortably in the
polls.) The very fact that Giavarini is touring global financial
centers, working on regulatory issues and making plans makes an
important point about Argentina's success in narrowing its
differences of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap used to be very wide,'' he says, holding up his hands.
``Now it is 10 degrees, 12 degrees, 15 degrees. These are
manageable differences.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the best news of all. The last eighteen months have seen
one casualty after another among the the world's fastest growing
new market economies _ and never mind Japan, which remains sunk in
a stubborn slump. Thailand, Indonesia, Korea, Russia and most
recently Brazil have suffered major currency crises and
corresponding bitter recessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine economy has shrunk, too _ but without the
exaggerating effects of a currency crash, thanks to the
government's policy since 1991 of converting pesos to dollars on
demand. With nearly 60 percent of bank deposits in Argentina
denominated in dollars and greenbacks circulating freely throughout
the cities, Argentinos have been untroubled by the soaring
inflation and capital flight that have plagued other transition
economies.
</P>
<P>
   Automated teller machines dispense dollars and pesos
side-by-side. Long-term contracts such as mortgages routinely are
denominated in dollars, says Giavarini.
</P>
<P>
   So why the sudden proposal to eliminate the peso altogether and
cede much of the right to run the Argentinian economy to the US
Federal Reserve Board, through a series of agreements on bank
supervision, deficit finance and layoffs?
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways of viewing the dollarization proposal,
Giavarini replies. One view is that it is an opportunity to enhance
Argentina's reputation. ``If somebody else devalues, you double
your bet on the dollar and put yourselves at the other end of the
deal _ or so the argument goes'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The other view paints dollarization as a panacea _ a seemingly
technical measure that might precipitate deep changes in the
Argentinian banking system and fiscal and monetary regimes. If that
were the government's purpose, then the plan was presented in a
decidedly ``untidy'' manner, Giavarini says. No wonder Fed chairman
Alan Greenspan has nixed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Monetary agreement with the United States is a distinct
possibility, Giavarini says; so is a regional central bank, much
like the European Central Bank that is now in the early stage of
producing a pan-European currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   But such measures take time _ and they involve costs. Four or
five years is not too soon to be aiming for some form of
dollarization, says Giavarini.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the constant stream of meetings: Davos one week,
Washington and Boston the next, then off to Basel and Tokyo. Among
the many nations around the world playing catch-up, Argentina is
among those with good news.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Lynn Deas had hoped to trump.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when she went to Orlando, Fla., to play in the national
bridge championships in December, she could endure only half a
session of cards before suffering a relapse.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the former world champion bridge player has been in
St. Peter's Hospital in Albany, waging her latest battle against
myasthenia gravis, a rare and chronic neuromuscular disease that
weakens the voluntary muscles of the body, including ones that
control eye movements, eyelids, chewing, swallowing, coughing and
facial expression. Today, 2 1/2 years after her original diagnosis,
Deas is no longer able to walk, sit, feed herself or play cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I used to travel around the country and the world,''
Deas said. ``It's terrible. You get dehumanized. I'm just ready to
go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Deas, 46, returns to her home, or goes to a nursing home
for rehabilitation, is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't kept Deas from organizing events from her
bedside to raise more research money for a disease that few people
know much about.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 35,000 Americans affected by MG are believed to
suffer from a type of the disease described as autoimmune. In those
cases, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys
special proteins on the muscle, known as receptors.
</P>
<P>
   When those receptors are healthy, they receive nerve impulses
from the brain that tell the muscle to contract. When those
receptors are damaged, the response of the muscle to nerve impulses
is poor and weakness occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is a failure to communicate,'' said Dr. Charles
Thornton, clinical director of the University of Rochester
Neuromuscular Disease Center at Strong Memorial Hospital in

<P>
   Yet another, extremely rare type of MG is congenital, when the
disease is believed to be triggered by a genetic defect in
neuromuscular transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers, however, still aren't sure what causes most people
to develop MG. Although it can strike at any time, MG tends to
affect women most often in their child-bearing years and men most
often in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   One common source of frustration for people with MG is that the
disease affects everyone differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unpredictable,'' Thornton said. ``It changes from day to
day.'' And because the symptoms tend to come and go, it's often
difficult to diagnose, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been progress in treating MG. ``Before 1960, when
there weren't any effective treatments, about 30 percent of people
who developed MG died from it,'' Thornton said. ``Today we expect
almost everyone to survive and their symptoms to be under excellent
control or adequate control. Many patients now go into remission.''
</P>
<P>
   Medications are usually aimed at boosting the nerve signals to
the muscles or at targeting the immune system. In some cases,
physicians are using the same type of anti-rejection medications
used in transplant patients to try to prevent the immune system
from attacking the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   A common surgical treatment is to remove the thymus gland, an
organ involved in the development of the immune system. For reasons
that are unclear, the thymus gland becomes unusually large in
people with MG.
</P>
<P>
   On a daily regimen of drugs, Deas is hopeful she'll soon go into
remission. Or in the very least, be stable enough to go home to her
husband and seven dogs. Until then, she's imagining her next trump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'll be able to walk in August,'' she said.

SUFFOLK TO GET AN EARLY START ON THE DUBAI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If you're an early riser, Suffolk Downs is the place to
be March 28. That's the date of the $5 million Dubai World Cup,
which has an 11:15 a.m. EST post, and Suffolk intends to run a live
10-race program that will alternate with the five-race World Cup
card from Nad Al Sheba. Gates will open at 9 a.m, the Dubai card
will begin at 9:30, and live racing will commence at 10. Final post
at Suffolk is set for 3 p.m. Suffolk is the only track in the
country that will race its own card in conjunction with the races
in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Suffolk staged a similar morning program for the
inaugural World Cup and, with money pouring in from simulcasting
sites, established a then-record total handle of $2,359,863. The
first World Cup was run on a Wednesday, making that Suffolk handle
even more amazing, while this year's renewal will be on a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates an opportunity to do much better than we normally
would on a Sunday,'' said Suffolk vice president Lou Raffetto. ``I
don't think it will be a windfall for us, but it's a chance to make
more, and we're going to take advantage of it. The early post will
be a help to our simulcast patners who would otherwise have
difficulty opening early for races from a foreign country that are
spaced far apart. Filling the void in this manner is also a service
to our on-track customers who come out early to see the World Cup
simulcast.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nad Al Sheba card is worth a total of $6.2 million in purses
and also includes the Dubai Turf Classic, the Dubai Duty Free, the
Nad Al Sheba Sprint, and the Nad Al Sheba Mile.
</P>
<P>

   Silver Charm lined up

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Dubai World Cup is expected to feature defending champion
Silver Charm, who will race next in Saturday's $1 million Santa
Anita Handicap, Puerto Madero, who finished second to Skip Away in
last year's Massachusetts Handicap and is also headed for the Big
'Cap, and Victory Gallop, who won the 1998 Belmont Stakes. Silver
Charm has been assigned highweight of 124 pounds for the Santa
Anita Handicap, run at 1 1/4 miles, while Free House, winner of the
San Antonio, was given 123, and Puerto Madero, who defeated Silver
Charm in the Donn Handicap at Gulfstream, will carry 122. Next in
line is Event of the Year, winner of the Strub Stakes, at 119;
Malek, 118; Dr. Fong, 117; Behrens, 115; Budroyale, 114; Lord
Grillo, also 114, and Don't Blame Rio, 112. Richard Mandella, who
trains Puerto Madero, Event of the Year, and Malek, reportedly will
hold Malek back and enter his other two standouts. Malek, who was
fourth in last year's World Cup, is scheduled to return to Dubai .
. . Elliot Walden, who trains Victory Gallop, is going to avoid a
confrontation with Real Quiet, who defeated Victory Gallop in the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness. Walden had indicated that he would
send his charge against Bob Baffert's top 4-year-old in the New
Orleans Handicap at Fair Grounds Sunday but entered him in an
allowance race at Gulfstream Wednesday instead. ``We intend the
allowance race as a prep for the Dubai World Cup,'' said Walden.
``We are sorry not to be going to the Fair Grounds, but we have to
do what is in the best interest of he the horse.'' The allowance
race is at a mile and one-16th against four foes, and Victory
Gallop will be ridden by Jerry Bailey, who is slated to become his
regular rider. Neither Real Quiet nor Victory Gallop has started
this year, and Walden apparently decided a dramatic duel in a
graded stakes race was too much, too soon for his charge.

   The victory by Behrens in the Grade I, $350,000 Gulfstream Park
Handicap Saturday gave a boost to the MassCap. Raffetto stays in
close touch with James Bond, who trains Behrens, and there is a
very good chance the 5-year-old son of Pleasant Colony will come to
Suffolk for the $600,000 event May 29. Bond supported the MassCap
in '97, sending up Will's Way, who ran third behind Skip Away and
Formal Gold. That contest highlighted an outstanding card that
established the current Suffolk handle mark of $5,867,419. Behrens
had run second, between Puerto Madero and Silver Charm, in the
Donn, and he captured the Gulfstream Park Handicap with authority
under Jorge Chavez. The Santa Anita Handicap is obviously too close
for Behrens, who has earned $1.2 million, and he will start next in
either the Oaklawn Handicap April 3 or, if he needs more rest, the
Pimlico Special May 8. Behrens, who won the Pegasus and was second
in the Travers at age 3, had an injury-plagued 4-year-old campaign
and did not win a race. ``I know he's a good horse,'' said Bond.
``I just don't think he got the respect he deserved as a
3-year-old. He's had three races here and he won't go in both the
Oaklawn Handicap and Pimlico Special. He loves this track, and our
main goal is to be here for the Breeders' Cup (Nov. 6).'' . . . The
Kentucky Derby picture heated up over the weekend with three
talented sophomores giving excellent accounts of themselves. Most
eye-catching was the determined victory by Desert Hero in the
$200,000 San Rafael at Santa Anita Sunday. The San Rafael, a Grade
II contest, was only the second start of Desert Hero's career, but
the 10-1 shot tallied despite being checked at the eighth-pole and
yanked to the outside by Corey Nakatani. Desert Hero, who is
trained by Wally Dollase, still got up in time to beat Prime
Timber, one of Baffert's talented 3-year-olds, by a neck. Finishing
fifth, but beaten only a length, was the previously undefeated
filly Honest Lady. A son of 1993 Derby winner Sea Hero, out of
Multiply, an Easy Goer mare, Desert Hero debuted just three weeks
ago, winning a maiden race by more than 6 lengths. ``I felt he
could be a Derby horse because he does everything right,'' said
Dollase, who had to delay Desert Hero's debut for three months
because of an infected hoof. ``He's a fast, intelligent horse
that's bred to go long. I think if he had a cleaner trip, he would
have won fairly handily.'' Also drawing attention were Lemon Drop
Kid and Menifee, who won allowance races at Gulfstream Saturday in
their 3-year-old bows. Lemon Drop Kid, who is trained by Scotty
Schulhofer, won the Belmont Futurity last year, and is headed for
the Blue Grass at Keeneland April 10. Menifee, who is trained by
Walden and is 3 for 3, will go in the Rebel at Oaklawn March 20 or
the Gotham at Aqueduct March 21 . . . Rowland Hoyt, the host of
Suffolk's in-house TV handicapping show, known affectionately as
``paddock prattle,'' has accepted a job with Racing Network, a
24-hour satellite service based in Philadelphia, which launches
March 8. Racing Network will cover more than 30 tracks, including
Suffolk and Rockingham Park. Hoyt, 27, known for his dubious wit,
will be a studio host.

   The National Museum of Racing has announced its list of nominees

Wayne Lukas, Neil Drysdale, and Mandella; jockeys Russell Baze,
Earlie Fires, and the late Jack Westrope; contemporary horse, male,
A.P. Indy, Precisionist, and Exceller; female, Dance Smartly,
Miesque, and Winning Colors; and horse of yesteryear, Bald Eagle,
Bowl of Flowers, and Gun Bow. A panel of 130 racing writers and
broadcasters vote for the Hall, with results to be announced during
Kentucky Derby Week . . . Banshee Breeze, the champion 3-year-old
filly of '98 trained by Carl Nafzger, made a smashing seasonal
debut with a powerful victory in the $200,000 Rampart Handicap at
Gulfstream Park Sunday. Ridden by Bailey, Banshee Breeze defeated
Glitterowman by more than 6 lengths in the time of 1:42 4/5 for the
mile and one-16th. Timely Broad, trained by Mike Petro and ridden
by Nick Petro, who used to campaign in New England, was a distant
third. ``I never cracked my whip,'' said Bailey. ``She's awesome.''
. . . The Baffert Brigade was back in action Sunday, as undefeated
Exploit, the winter book favorite for the Kentucky Derby, worked a
mile in 1:37, and outstanding filly Excellent Meeting went 6
furlongs in a best-of-the-day 1:12, both at Santa Anita. Exploit is
heading for San Felipe March 13, and Excellent Meeting for the
Santa Anita Oaks the following day.

HUGE APPETITE FOR RETAIL STOCKS PROPELS TWEETER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Steven Syre and Charles Stein  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Stone is courting an entirely new crowd of well-heeled
customers these days. All sales should be this easy.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, the president of Tweeter Home Entertainment Group of
Canton, Mass., knows all about pitching customers on high-end
consumer electronics. Now Tweeter itself is a darling to
institutional investors with huge sums to invest and a powerful
appetite for retail stocks. Their interest has helped propel
Tweeter stock, which has more than tripled in five months.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund managers and other big investors began buying retail
stocks in volume two years ago, starting with large, well-known
names like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Dayton Hudson Corp., and Home
Depot Inc. Since then, demand has seeped down to midsize and even
smaller niche retailers with a good story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   The driving forces haven't changed in two years. Customers are
working and willing to spend. Price pressure on manufacturers
benefits the retailers. Now, more institutional investors are
looking for companies like retailers that are relatively insulated
from uncertain world markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your customer is flush and your cost of goods sold are going
through the floor,'' said Ben Hoch, manager of the John Hancock
Growth fund, which invests about 20 percent of its money in
retailers. ``If you're a typical retail company, it's the best of
all worlds. It's off to the races.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend has turned retail stocks into one of the market's
stealth top performers. Measure the 39 industry sector funds
operated by Fidelity Investments for performance over 1997 and 1998
and you won't find the winner investing in computers, health care,
or electronics. Fidelity Select Retailing was the champ, earning
106.6 percent over the two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big retailers, shares of both Wal-Mart and Home Depot
are up 230 percent over the last two years. Dayton Hudson and drug
chain Walgreen Co. have both tripled in value. Selected smaller
retail companies are on a similar trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   Tweeter is the quintessential niche stock with a story to tell.
Like other home entertainment retailers, including the much larger
Best Buy Inc., Tweeter has an entirely new generation of products
to sell thanks to the digital consumer electronics explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liken it to the early '80s, when the CD player was
invented, the VCR was a new medium and the camcorder became more
portable,'' said Stone. ``New products will drive this industry for
five or even 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tweeter shares, which went public last summer, bounced from an
October low of 10 5/8 to a high of 38 3/4 two weeks ago. The stock
finished Monday at 37 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Not all retailers have been embraced so lovingly by big
investors. Despite the powerful tide of institutional money washing
over retail stocks, distinct choices are apparent everywhere.
Wal-Mart, not Sears. Staples Inc., not Office Depot Inc. Best Buy,
not Circuit City Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story has to be good,'' said Edward G. Riley, chief
investment officer at BankBoston Corp. ``The market still
differentiates.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether it is reaching a top. Ideal economic
conditions and other positives have already been factored into the
prices of favored retailers. How much more can there be? The answer
isn't so obvious, say fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure you can say things can't get any better than
this, therefore it's over,'' said Fidelity Select Retailing manager
Ramin Arani. ``We've seen times in the past when companies have
grown returns for long periods, longer than people expected.''
</P>
<P>
   What is obvious? The stock prices of favored retailers, as
measured by price-to-earnings multiples, have increased faster than
the rest of the market and have become that much more expensive
since the rally began.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the big retailers have undergone so-called ``multiple
expansion'' for the last two years. Home Depot, which sold for
about 20 times earnings at the start of 1997, now trades at about
45 times profits. Wal-Mart shares have gone through a similar
price-earnings inflation over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Even other midsize retailers have become more expensive in
relation to their profits. Staples has expanded its price-earnings
multiple about fourfold in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Higher price multiples reflect increased optimism for individual
companies. But they are also a symptom of more investors chasing a
limited number of shares, driving up the price of the bet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors like Arani say higher stock-price multiples are
sustainable, and can go even higher, as long as companies continue
to improve performance.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the money moved into retail, it will head off and
find a new home when those favored companies run out of ways to
grow.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anything for a buck: Advent International, the Boston-based
private equity firm, is leading a $125 million recapitalization of
Dollar Express Inc. Advent said it will invest $33 million for a
``significant minority interest'' in the retailer that sells all
products in its stores for $1.

RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS WAIT FOR DEREGULATION PAYOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ When Massachusetts's electric deregulation law took
effect a year ago Monday, it was heralded as one of the most
progressive in the nation. Besides calling for a 10 percent
reduction in utility bills in 1998 plus another 5 percent cut
starting September 1999, the law overturned more than 90 years of
monopoly control by utilities. It was expected to usher in an era
when consumers would have a choice of electricity provider.
</P>
<P>
   But the competitive rush hasn't happened. Expectations that
alternative providers would scramble to serve residential customers
have yet to materialize. Most consumers probably won't see another
significant break in prices for close to two years, although
businesses, nonprofit organizations, and municipalities are
starting to get lower prices from alternative providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The residential market is a tough nut to crack,'' said Janet
Gail-Besser, chairwoman of the Massachusetts Department of
Telecommunications and Energy. ``I think this first year is a
transition where competitors come in to learn our rules for doing
business here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meaningful competition that will benefit consumers with lower
electric rates is still a long way off,'' said Rob Sargent, energy
program director at Masspirg, a consumer watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Massachusetts Electric Restructuring Act of 1997,
investor-owned utilities sold off their power generation plants,
leaving them only in the regulated ``wires'' business _
transmission and distribution. That opened up opportunities for
alternative providers, many from out of state, to start marketing
directly to residential and business customers.
</P>
<P>
   But these new competitors have shunned residential customers for
a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   They waited for results of a November ballot initiative that
threatened to repeal deregulation. Instead, the law was upheld with
overwhelming voter support.
</P>
<P>
   New providers also have held back because the initial electric
rates set under the deregulation law were too low _ below the cost
of producing power. Those rates, known as the ``standard offer,''
represent the deregulated portion of the electric bill that is
intended to cover the cost of electricity generation.
</P>
<P>
   The standard offer pricing was conceived in late 1996, when
electric generation rates were low because of plentiful power
supplies in New England. The rate was 2.8 cents per kilowatt hour
in March, climbing to 3.5 cents today, 3.8 cents in 2000 and 2001,
and 4.2 cents in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of generating electricity today is between 3.2 cents
and 3.6 cents. So today's 3.5 cent standard offer price makes it
uneconomical to market to individual residential customers,
although some providers have found it worthwhile to begin selling
to businesses and institutions who use large volumes under
multiyear contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the current wholesale price of electricity and
ancillary costs for delivering power, in order to reach into the
residential customer base, you need to go above 4 cents per
kilowatt hour'' on the standard offer, said Stephen Remen, managing
director of Boston-based National Energy Choice, which claims to
have formed the state's largest energy buying or aggregation
business.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of deregulation has materialized sooner for
businesses and institutions because providers find it more
economical to market to large users.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Health and Education Facilities Authority, a
quasi-public financing agency, has signed up 280 nonprofit
customers, including Boston College, in a buying cooperative
offering rates below the standard offer.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of big businesses, including John Hancock
Mutual Life Insurance Co., have arranged their own low-price deals.
The Massachusetts High Technology Council and National Energy have
arranged buying pools for their members. National Energy does not
expect to begin aggregating residential customers until 2002, when
the standard offer reaches 4.2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that Massachusetts, which appeared to be in
the lead for restructuring its electric utilities, did not develop
a robust market as quickly as some expected,'' said Bobbi
Kates-Garnick, executive vice president of Boston-based New Energy
Ventures East, an alternative energy provider in Philadelphia and
Greater New York.
</P>
<P>
   Kates-Garnick is betting the rise in the Massachusetts standard
offer rate in the coming years will bring more alternative power
providers. Her firms plans to enter the Bay State later this year,
but only to reach business customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still expensive to serve the retail customer in
Massachusetts, because the standard offer today is not high enough
to cover the costs of sending a bill and providing customer
services,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   One group that hopes to be the first to offer its residential
and business customers a five-year savings plan is the Cape Cod
Compact. Representing 20 towns and 180,000 customers on Cape Cod,
Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket, the aggregation group _ 54
percent residential _ solicited alternative energy providers
earlier this year and will open sealed bids on March 12, according
to Scott Ridley, a Compact senior consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the group tried unsuccessfully to attract alternative
energy providers, when the standard offer was around 3.2 cents per
kilowatt hour for electric power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shooting for a September 1999 start date with an
expectation that the winning bids will come in below today's 3.5
cent rate and climb up, yet stay below the standard offer,'' said
Ridley.
</P>
<P>
   For the utility industry, deregulation has brought huge changes.
Not only did the law prompt major utilities to sell their aging
power generation facilities to out-of-state buyers, they also
embarked on a wave of mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Masspirg maintains residential customers will not see
significantly lower rates because the cost savings and operating
efficiencies from the pending mergers, such as the union of Boston
Edison and Commonwealth Energy Co., do not benefit ratepayers.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Medicare, increasingly seen by health-care specialists as
expensive and out of touch with modern medical realities, is facing
the most sweeping changes since its creation in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   With the program expected to outstrip its funding as soon as
2008, creating pressure for an overhaul within the next decade, an
advisory commission is on the verge of recommending reforms to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have today doesn't cover serious needs of senior
citizens,'' said Senator John Breaux, a conservative Democrat from
Louisiana and chairman of the advisory commission. ``In addition,
the program's going broke.'' The panel's recommendations are
expected within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key changes being contemplated:
</P>
<P>
   --Injecting market competition into the process to bring greater
cost controls and flexibility into the government-run program.
</P>
<P>
   --Asking seniors, particularly wealthier ones, to pay more out
of their own pockets for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   --Raising the age of eligibility to 67 from 65.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are massive, politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare is one the nation's most popular and sacred programs,
insuring more than 39 million senior citizens and disabled
Americans. It funnels $210 billion a year to the nation's
hospitals, nursing homes, doctors, and other providers. Many of
them rely on Medicare for a significant portion of their business,
and would be hit with lower Medicare payments under the Breaux
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this have political risk to it? Absolutely,'' Breaux
acknowledged recently in an interview. ``But the alternative is no
change. If that happens, the program will go broke.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it's not the first time Medicare has been revamped.
Most recently, the program underwent fiscal surgery in 1997 with
the federal Balanced Budget Act, which sliced $112 billion from
projected Medicare spending over five years.
</P>
<P>
   But Medicare specialists say those measures were a mere
Band-Aid. What's needed to rescue Medicare, they say, is radical
restructuring, the details of which are being hotly debated on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balanced Budget Act is child's play compared to what we're
discussing now,'' said Stuart Altman, a professor of health policy
at Brandeis University in Waltham and a member of the Medicare
advisory panel, formally called the Bipartisan Commission on the
Future of Medicare. ``Even with the Balanced Budget Act, Medicare
is scheduled to go bankrupt by 2008 and could reach a deficit of up
to $2.6 trillion by the year 2030.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much of the rhetoric in Washington may not lead to
actual change. But the pressure to act now to prevent Medicare's
predicted bankruptcy is one that politicians say they cannot
ignore. The group with potentially the most clout in Washington is
the Medicare commission, whose report will set the stage for a
Herculean struggle in Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   To avert financial disaster, Breaux has forwarded a proposal to
the Medicare commission. The only broad plan being considered, it
attempts to harness the power of market competition to lower cost
and improve quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   The plan preserves traditional fee-for-service Medicare, which
reimburses doctors and hospitals for their services. But seniors
also would be able to choose among competing private managed-care
plans that provide benefits identical to the traditional Medicare
program. Elements of competition would be introduced in both the
traditional program and the private plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be just your grandfather's old Medicare,'' said
Altman. ``It could change substantially and be less open than what
we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Medicare would have the power to selectively
contract with hospitals and doctors and engage in bidding for
contracts. Patients undergoing complex medical procedures could be
funneled into specific ``centers of excellence,'' rather than have
the broad range of hospitals available today, said Altman.
</P>
<P>
   Beneficiaries of both traditional Medicare and private plans
would be required to pay a fixed percentage of the overall
premiums, say 12 percent, while the government would pick up the
rest. Seniors currently pay no premium for hospital bills, but pay
25 percent of the premium for Medicare coverage of doctors' bills,
home health care, and other outpatient services. Seniors would also
be given incentives to choose lower-cost plans.
</P>
<P>
   Private insurers would be paid according to a national weighted
average of the cost of traditional Medicare, plus the average price
of all bids submitted by private plans. This payment mechanism sets
this apart from the way Medicare currently pays health maintenance
organizations, which get 95 percent of average costs incurred by
Medicare fee-for-service. In addition, payments would be adjusted
for geographic differences in the cost of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthier seniors would pay a higher premium _ up to 15 percent
more _ than moderate-income beneficiaries, while most low-income
seniors would pay nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for the eligibility age to be gradually
raised from 65 years to 67, the same age increase scheduled for
Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Payments to hospitals and doctors would take a hit, going down
by at least $57 billion over 10 years, according to estimates
released last week by the US Health Care Financing Administration,
the agency that runs Medicare. And subsidies to teaching hospitals,
currently $3 billion a year, would be taken out of the Medicare
program and become a separate item in the national budget.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial package is having difficulty winning the
support of liberal Democrats on the Medicare commission. Critics
point to what they say are three basic flaws in the Breaux plan.
The first is that market forces cannot guarantee savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because somebody says there's competition doesn't mean
it's going to produce any savings,'' said Representative John
Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and member of the Medicare commission.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the plan is likely to result in higher cost for
seniors who remain in the traditional fee-for-service plan, a
second major criticism of the Breaux proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My major concern is that this could make traditional Medicare
unaffordable for seniors,'' said Bruce Vladeck, a commission member
who until 1997 ran Medicare under the Clinton administration.
``Premiums are already a stretch for some seniors, and under this
plan, they would go up much more.''
</P>
<P>
   When compared with a scenario without any reform, premiums for
traditional Medicare could be 18 percent to 30 percent higher under
the Breaux plan, according to estimates of the Health Care
Financing Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Breaux plan does not make a prescription drug
benefit available to all beneficiaries. The lack of drug coverage
is seen by many as Medicare's biggest shortcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Drug coverage has become a key topic in the commission's debate,
one that could make or break the commission's fragile coalition. To
produce a report, Breaux needs the approval of 11 out of 17
commission members. He has 10. To get the last vote, Breaux has to
persuade swing voters Altman and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, dean of the
Haas School of Business at the University of California at
Berkeley. Both Tyson and Altman have insisted that a final proposal
contain prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans say they want drug coverage, they are fearful
that a broad benefit would be too costly. In an effort to appease
both parties, Breaux last week proposed to require all ``medigap''
supplemental plans, purchased by seniors to pay for what Medicare
does not, to cover a limited amount of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he offered to expand eligibility for Medicaid,
which covers drugs, to seniors who are at or below 135 percent of
federal poverty guidelines, up from 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux's offering did not satisfy Tyson and Altman, who continue
to insist that all beneficiaries should have drug coverage, not
just those who buy medigap policies or are poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (the Breaux drug proposal) is adequate,'' said
Tyson. ``You want everybody to have access'' to drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the White House has proposed its own answer to
Medicare's fiscal woes. President Clinton, in his State of the
Union address last month suggested using 15 percent of the federal
budget surplus to shore up Medicare and help pay for a prescription
drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has refrained from commenting on the Breaux
proposal, Senator Edward M. Kennedy has openly criticized it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These regressive proposals are unacceptable,'' said the
Massachusetts Democrat. ``They'll add billions of dollars in health
costs for senior citizens already hard pressed to make ends meet.
They'll jeopardize the survival of teaching hospitals. The scheme
will force millions of elderly Americans out of Medicare and into
HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Representative Bill Thomas, a Republican from California
and a commission member, expressed hope that the group can agree on
a set of reforms that would shape any effort in Washington to
change Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've moved a very long way,'' Thomas said. ``You have
Democrats offering a market structure. You have Republicans talking
about prescription drugs and a subsidy for low-income
beneficiaries. I think that's pretty good.''

   SYPHILIS _ WASHINGTON _ It's not completely clear whether it was
carried by truck drivers or crack cocaine dealers, but an epidemic
of syphilis appears to have swept down I-95, at least the North
Carolina part of it, in the first half of the 1990s. Researchers
from the University of North Carolina report that the rate of
infection by the sexually transmitted disease in rural counties
along the interstate highway was similar to what is normally seen
only in big cities. The best guess as to the cause is that the
crack cocaine trade at opposite poles of I-95, Miami and New York,
gradually spread along the the interstate and the syphilis epidemic
followed. But you can't rule out truckers and prostitutes, authors
say. (Nesmith, Cox Washington Bureau). 15.

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Today, chalk talk for political
junkies. Georgia's Secretary of State Cathy Cox's office recently
released an analysis of voter turnout in last November's election.
We already know who won and lost, but the study is a useful reality
check on who voted. Exit polls conducted on Election Day indicated
African-American voters made up 30 percent of the total votes cast,
a staggering leap in turnout. The state analysis, which can
reference every ballot cast by race, puts the actual percentage at
just under 23 percent. This has a couple of implications. (Baxter,

   WEATHER-RADIO _ If a tornado comes through, even in the dead of
night, a small radio will wake you up, perhaps in time to seek
safety. The weather service says the radios might have saved lives
when a string of tornadoes tore through central Florida in February
1998 at a time when most people were asleep. ``Our goal is to
someday have a NOAA Weather Radio in every home, just like a smoke
detector, and in all schools, hospitals and other public gathering
places,'' Elbert W. Friday, Jr., former Director of the National
Weather Service, said in a statement. (Kleinberg, Palm Beach Post)

SENATOR ACCUSES WINERIES OF MANIPULATING DIET GUIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sen. Strom Thurmond has accused senior
government officials and a California wine industry association of
conspiring to manipulate government nutritional guidelines to
promote the sale of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, R-S.C., sent letters to the inspectors general of the
Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of
Agriculture, asking them to investigate possible improper contacts
between the San Francisco-based Wine Institute and government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not interested in outlawing alcoholic beverages or in
legislating morality,'' Thurmond said Monday. ``I am interested in
protecting the sanctity of public policy and in making certain that
the government does not get in the business of promoting or
endorsing a product that has been linked to some very serious
health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond said he believed the Wine Institute put tremendous
pressure on government officials working with an advisory committee
that changed the government's approach to wine between its 1990 and
1995 dietary guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   He said he suspected ``inappropriate influence played a
significant role in drafting of the 1995 version,'' which had a
much more favorable view of the possible health benefits of wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flabbergasted,'' said Wine Institute President John De
Luca, who was identified by Thurmond as the source of much of the
allegedly inappropriate pressure. ``Senators are not supposed to
use the tax code and agencies of government to pursue personal
vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   De Luca said the revision of the nutritional guidelines was done
in the open and the revisions were widely supported by scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of anything that's been more out in the open,
more debated,'' De Luca said. ``I guess the question is, who's the
one politicizing this?''
</P>
<P>
   Before the new version of the guidelines, the government's
position was that drinking alcohol had ``no net health benefit''
and ``consumption is not recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   Some health studies have indicated that limited consumption of
red wine can reduce the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines now point out that alcoholic beverages,
particularly wines, have been used historically to enhance the
enjoyment of life and meals.
</P>
<P>
   The portion of the guidelines about the possible health benefits
of moderate alcohol consumption has been moved from the end of the
1990 version to the top of the 1995 version.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines also dropped references to alcohol's ``drug
effects'' and a footnote underscoring that booze can be fattening.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond blamed Dr. Phillip Lee, then the director of the U.S.
Public Health Service and a friend of De Luca, for deleting the
note about drug effects and wants investigators to demand an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants Lee, now head of the Institute for Health Policy
Studies at the University of California at San Francisco, to reveal
the extent of his communications with De Luca and the Wine
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, whose father had a small vineyard in California's wine
country, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond introduced legislation last week to overturn a ruling
by the Treasury Department that would permit vintners to label
their bottles with a suggestion that consumers consult their own
doctors or the government's nutrition guidelines about possible
beneficial health aspects of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The Wine Institute is a public policy advocacy association
representing 450 wineries and affiliated businesses in California.

ACCOUNTANTS FIND TAX LAW GOOD FOR BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Daunted by deductions and confused about credits,
taxpayers are expected to seek help for filing their income tax
returns in higher numbers this year.
</P>
<P>
   How many more won't be determined until after the April 15
filing deadline has passed and returns are tallied, tax preparers
said. But early indications are that more people will seek help,
ironically enough, because of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the changes from the law went into effect last year, and
so are just showing up during the current filing season. Individual
taxpayers are complaining to accountants that the relief measures
simply make the returns more difficult to complete, at least in
this first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax simplification ... wasn't,'' said Beth Kissinger, a
certified public accountant in Schenectady, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Individual taxpayers are trying to read the instructions to
understand the new tax treatments of child care credits, education
credits, individual retirement accounts and other financial events,
she said. But they often find instructions baffling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're throwing up their hands and looking for a
professional,'' Kissinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen an increase in people,'' agreed Katie Doran, a CPA
and partner at Teal, Becker &AMP; Chiaramonte in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the new tax provisions _ such as the child care
credit and educational credits _ disappear at certain income
levels, Doran said. That further confuses people.
</P>
<P>
   Even some ``borderline people'' who have fairly uncomplicated
returns ``this year don't feel comfortable,'' said Greg Lurie, who
runs his own CPA firm in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the newcomers will get a professional to do their
returns this year and then return to doing their taxes by
themselves by following the new format _ until the tax law changes
again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other new clients will become longtime customers once they get
used to the convenience of having a preparer do the work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of people who will want individual help will start
coming in this month, Doran and others said.
</P>
<P>
   Tax preparers generally cope with the uptick in business by
working 12- or 14-hour days, and sometimes by working weekends.
Some larger firms, such as the 50-person office in which Doran
works, also hire skilled seasonal help to work just during tax
season, often people who return year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers seeking help can find a variety of different kinds of
people willing to file returns.
</P>
<P>
   Chain tax preparation outfits, such as H&AMP;R Block, often train
staff internally. Chains often gear themselves toward individuals
with simpler returns and regularly hold weekend and evening hours.
</P>
<P>
   The average tax preparation cost from H&AMP;R Block last year was
$78.50, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   An established CPA firm may charge $250 or more, Lurie said. A
certified public accountant must hold a four-year degree and
complete additional training beyond that, Doran noted.
</P>
<P>
   Fees for tax preparation services are deductible but subject to
limits. A taxpayer must itemize deductions to get this break.

</P>
<P>
   From the cab of an 18-wheeler, safety has a different look.
According to federal statistics, passenger-car drivers are cited
far more often than truck drivers when the two kinds of vehicles
are involved in fatal crashes. We ride with a trucker to get his
point of view on how car drivers can help avoid fatal encounters.
(WILL INCLUDE PHOTOS OF TRUCKERS ON THE JOB.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRUCK-SAFETY ADVOCATES: Truck-safety advocates say that
statistics are misleading; the keys to reducing highway deaths are
lighter, better-maintained trucks and expert, rested drivers.

   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT: SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST(Available by 2 p.m., Thu., March
4) &LR;  &QL;
</P>

<P>
   &UR; FOOD: GUMBO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A pot of gumbo attracts like a magnet. It pulls you to smell the
smokiness of the dark brown roux, to dip in a spoon and bite into a
succulent chunk of sausage or a tender shrimp, to sip the hearty
broth and feel the tickle of pepper at the back of the throat.
</P>

   &UR; WHEELS: '99 MERCURY COUGAR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's an oft-heard complaint in the car biz, the way the
different models can seem to look a lot alike. So we tend to notice
when one breaks the mold like Mercury has done with the '99 Cougar.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY: COOKIES AND COMPUTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People love cookies and milk. People hate cookies and computers.
Harmless though they might be, most Internet users have a knee-jerk
reaction to anyone or anything trying to gather information about
them. The notion that merely typing in a Web address opens up the
opportunity for companies to find out anything at all about them is
distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   (INCLUDES A 3-COLUMN COLOR ILLUSTRATION OF CARTOON COMPUTER
USERS INTERFACING WITH A GIANT COOKIE)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH ISSUES: The Internet carries ads for a burgeoning and
largely uncontrolled industry of ``information brokers'' who, for a
fee, will reveal the most intimate details of someone's life, right
down to that birthmark on their backside or ancient records of
psychological treatment.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS: Those who think the generation gap is marked
in distance with PCs _ with the young on one side of the chasm and
older folks on the other _ should take a look at a book from Intel
that hopes to bridge that gap. (INCLUDES PHOTO OF BOOK JACKET)
</P>

investigative crime reporter two decades ago, when he was Norman
Mailer's chief researcher for ''The Executioner's Song,'' the

   Debilitating fatigue affects roughly four of every five cancer

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOCUS: TRUCK-SAFETY (Available by 2 p.m., Fri., March 5) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the cab of an 18-wheeler, safety has a different look.
According to federal statistics, passenger-car drivers are cited
far more often than truck drivers when the two kinds of vehicles
are involved in fatal crashes. We ride with a trucker to get his
point of view on how car drivers can help avoid fatal encounters.
(WILL INCLUDE PHOTOS OF TRUCKERS ON THE JOB.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRUCK-SAFETY ADVOCATES: Truck-safety advocates say that
statistics are misleading; the keys to reducing highway deaths are
lighter, better-maintained trucks and expert, rested drivers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT: SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST(Available by 2 p.m., Thu., March
4) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A preview of the South by Southwest music conference in Austin,
Texas. Now into its 13th year, SXSW has become firmly established
as the most well-attended national music conference in the country.
A look at what the event means to the record industry, the
participating bands, the host city and the fans who come to hear
the music.
</P>
<P>
   Will include photos of bands scheduled to perform; the most
popular venues.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: PHANTOM MENACE COUNTDOWN: A two-column graphic,
``Countdown to `Star Wars,''' outlining the number of days
remaining until ``The Phantom Menace'' opens.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: VIDEO REVIEWS: ``Ever After'' Grade: B+. ``Sick.'' Grade:
A.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CD REVIEWS: Sawyer Brown's ``Drive Me Wild,'' XTC's
``Apple Venus,'' Julian Lennon, ``Photograph Smile''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NASCAR (Available by 5 p.m., Thu., March 4) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a week off, the Winston Cup circuit returns to action in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: NASCAR NOTES
</P>
<P>
   WITH: WINSTON CUP STANDINGS
</P>
<P>
   WITH: BUSCH GRAND NATIONAL STANDINGS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOOD: GUMBO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A pot of gumbo attracts like a magnet. It pulls you to smell the
smokiness of the dark brown roux, to dip in a spoon and bite into a
succulent chunk of sausage or a tender shrimp, to sip the hearty
broth and feel the tickle of pepper at the back of the throat.
</P>
<P>
   (INCLUDES COLOR PHOTO OF GUMBO IN A PAN PLUS COLOR PHOTO OF A
PALETTE SHOWING THE THREE COLORS OF ROUX.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: RECIPE: Chicken and Sausage Gumbo.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CYBERSPICE: Sure, we Yanks have our varied pauses that
refresh, and happy hours abound, but they don't come close to
equaling the civilizing, meditative, revitalizing, reflective
ambience of taking tea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHEELS: '99 MERCURY COUGAR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's an oft-heard complaint in the car biz, the way the
different models can seem to look a lot alike. So we tend to notice
when one breaks the mold like Mercury has done with the '99 Cougar.
</P>
<P>
   (INCLUDES 2 COLOR PHOTOS SHOWING THE EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR OF
THE NEW MERCURY COUGAR.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: AT A GLANCE: Facts about the 1999 Mercury Cougar.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: THE MECHANIC: Does the size of a car battery make any
difference in the way your car runs?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY: COOKIES AND COMPUTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People love cookies and milk. People hate cookies and computers.
Harmless though they might be, most Internet users have a knee-jerk
reaction to anyone or anything trying to gather information about
them. The notion that merely typing in a Web address opens up the
opportunity for companies to find out anything at all about them is
distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   (INCLUDES A 3-COLUMN COLOR ILLUSTRATION OF CARTOON COMPUTER
USERS INTERFACING WITH A GIANT COOKIE)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH ISSUES: The Internet carries ads for a burgeoning and
largely uncontrolled industry of ``information brokers'' who, for a
fee, will reveal the most intimate details of someone's life, right
down to that birthmark on their backside or ancient records of
psychological treatment.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS: Those who think the generation gap is marked
in distance with PCs _ with the young on one side of the chasm and
older folks on the other _ should take a look at a book from Intel
that hopes to bridge that gap. (INCLUDES PHOTO OF BOOK JACKET)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY: The Year 2000 problem is a subject that has
received enough ink to float a battleship. But there are still
smart people out there who are mixed up about its impact.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL: BANFF, ALBERTA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skiing is just the beginning of the snow-season pleasures that
await in crystal-blue Banff, Alberta. (INCLUDES TWO COLOR
PHOTOGRAPHS OF POPULAR SITES IN BANFF)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRAVEL TIPS: Things to do when traveling to Banff.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: DESTINATIONS: If you can't decide which ports of call to
make, choose the world. A world cruise is not only possible, but
becoming affordable.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRAVEL BRIEFS: The new National Center for Popular Music
has opened in Sheffield in northern England. The center was created
to inform visitors about the history and impact of pop music.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOOKS: SOUL SURVIVOR: A LOOK AT RAY CHARLES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the new book ``Ray Charles: Man and Music,'' Charles is shown
to have found success with his trademark blend of blues and jazz,
breaking the color barrier without compromising. (INCLUDES AN
OUTSTANDING 3-COLUMN LINE-ART ILLUSTRATION OF RAY CHARLES AT THE
PIANO BY PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING CARTOONIST MIKE LUCKOVICH)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: Lawrence Schiller made his mark as an
investigative crime reporter two decades ago, when he was Norman
Mailer's chief researcher for ''The Executioner's Song,'' the
Pulitzer Prize-winning study of Utah killer Gary Gilmore. Now
Schiller, in his customary fascinating-but-exhaustive way,
addresses the 1996 Christmas-night slaying of JonBenet Ramsey.

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, March 3:
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-MEAT (New York) _ Bruce Aidells and his collaborator,
Denis Kelly, has spent nearly a decade studying the state of meat
in America to produce ``The Complete Meat Cookbook,'' published
last November by Houghton Mifflin. Not only does it secure his
image as a man unafraid of meat, even in these vegetable-revering
times, but it also is rife with heretical ideas. ``Meat has changed
in America,'' he said. ``We need to change the way we cook it.'' By
Molly O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   MEAT-MARINATE (Undated) _ Since the earliest days of recorded
history, and maybe even before, humans have marinated their food,
steeping meat, fowl and fish in some combination of liquid _
usually oil or acid _ and seasonings. At first, there were
practical reasons: Tough meat needed to be made tender, it needed
to be preserved, and, with humans ever attuned to improving their
lot, it needed to be flavored. But from ranch to refrigerator,
almost everything has changed about meat and the way it is treated
today. Everything, that is, except marination. By Eric Asimov.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   WINE-MICROWAVE (New York) _ A new question is creeping into wine
service in New York: How do you want that cooked? For many years,
Americans have confounded the rest of the world by drinking their
white wines too cold and their red wines too warm. Sommeliers no
longer hesitate when diners ask that a luscious Corton-Charlemagne
be plunged into an ice bucket. They just do it. It's easy. Red wine
poses a different problem. If it arrives at the table with slight
chill, and the diners want it the temperature of a blood
transfusion _ fast _ the sommelier must resort to wiles, and the
wiliest wile of all, it turns out, is the microwave oven. By
William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-NOTES (Undated) _ News and notes on food and dining. By
Florence Fabricant
</P>
<P>
   SWEET-POTATO-EATING-WELL (Undated) _ The column: On that
nutritional powerhouse, the sweet potato. By Marian Burros.
</P>
<P>
   With recipe.
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLE-COOKING (Undated) _ The column: The easiest roast duck _
high heat &AMP; fast. By Mark Bittman.
</P>
<P>
   With recipe.
</P>
<P>
   TAPIOCA (Undated) _ The stuff of puddings goes savory on new
menus. By Melissa Clark.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   MASTER-CHEF (Undated) _ The column: on ``everything tuna,''
crusted like a bagel with all kinds of seeds. By Rick Moonen.
</P>
<P>
   With recipe.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-MICHELIN (Undated) _ An interview with the main Michelin
man. By Florence Fabricant.
</P>
<P>
   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The ccolumn: the fine art of spitting. By
Frank J. Prial.
</P>
<P>
   (Eds, there will be no WINE-TASTINGS this week.)
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Food questions answered. By Melissa Clark.
</P>
<P>
   We expect to move all Living Section stories by early evening
with a ``d'' category code, unless otherwise indicated.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Adding another bathroom leaves me
flushed
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ I went shopping with my wife yesterday,
shopping for commodes, not something I do every day.
</P>
<P>
   But what it is, we're adding a bathroom, just what we need now
that the children are grown and gone.
</P>
<P>
   You can't have too many bathrooms. At last count, we had but
four and a half, two and half in the main house, one in the garage
apartment and one in the little house where I work, a semi-chicken
coop my wife likes to call the cabana.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows how we made it so long with so little.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, we'll soon have facilities fit for a king. Indeed, the
commodes we looked at are the Royal Flush designer series, his and
hers, situated back to back and separated by a partition, which is
the way she wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   Fine with me, but I'd preferred both of them facing forward,
like seats on a train, which makes more sense, everybody going in
the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   She'll have her own tub, too, one of those ancient, claw-footed
monsters with gold fixtures, something she found at a home show a
couple of years ago and priced accordingly _ ever how many dollar
bills it'd take to fill it to overflowing, best I could figure.
</P>
<P>
   I like showers myself, and I'll have one all to myself in the
new bathroom, a big boy model that measures four-feet square, which
should allow easy access. A smaller one would have been cheaper,
but if there's anything I hate it's having to slather myself with
goose grease getting in and out of a shower.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have dueling sinks as well, side by side, atop huge
pedestals, creamy white and also with gold fixtures. I always knew
something would eventually sink me. Little did I guess that it'd be
sinks.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing the bathroom won't have is the one thing I really
wanted, the fixture that dares not speak its name, a male
engineered type of facility, preferably the floor model style that
stands a good five feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, it could be the antique kind, just like we had
in the boys room of the old Central Ward Elementary School, which
probably hardly would have ever overflowed at all.
</P>
<P>
   For my part I was willing to compromise. I told her we could
have it decorated with gold fixtures if that what she wanted, the
splash guards, too. She wouldn't even discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, maybe in the next bathroom we add.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The young seaman and the mighty battleship came of age
together, when Boston was a teeming Navy port and a determined
nation marched off to war. They steamed together to Casablanca,
where history was made, and later saw fierce action in the South
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Harold Nye, the former seaman apprentice, and the USS
Massachusetts, a decommissioned warship with a storied history,
will be together again for what is likely to be the last cruise the
ship's World War II crew members could ever see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I've always been with that ship,'' the
84-year-old Nye said. ``I don't think there will be very many more
rides for either of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35,000-ton battleship _ built at Quincy's Fore River
Shipyard and now the centerpiece of a tourist attraction in Fall
River _ was sitting in dry dock Monday, as a small army of workers
put the final touches on an $8.5 million overhaul of sandblasting,
replating and repainting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a struggle, but everything turned out fine,'' said
Dan Schaab, general manager of Boston Ship Repair, which plans to
send the mammoth ship on its way back home to Battleship Cove
sometime Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And as a tugboat tows the Massachusetts on its 2 1/2-day journey
home, Nye and other veterans will be on board, hoping for some
stiff winds and rough seas, natural forces that would breathe some
life into the former warship its crew members affectionately called
``Big Mamie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to feel her move again,'' Nye said. ``She's such a
good ship.''
</P>
<P>
   When the battleship Massachusetts was commissioned in May 1942,
Nye was a $32-a-month seaman apprentice, who worked in the ship's
galley from its first shakedown cruise to the day he left the
service four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Nye was aboard when the ship's 16-inch guns, capable of hurling
20 tons of steel more than 20 miles, thundered to life on Nov. 8,
1942, during the North African invasion. The Massachusetts bested
its adversary, the French battleship Jean Bart, in a ferocious
seven-hour engagement.
</P>
<P>
   And Nye was aboard for the first of a series of battles in the
Pacific, where the ship destroyed 18 Japanese aircraft. In all, the
Massachusetts fought decisively in 35 battles and steamed 225,000
miles as a commissioned warship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good hunk of her crew came from Massachusetts,'' said
Strafford Morss, the project manager and the ship's unofficial
historian. ``She did her job and brought her people home safely. No
man was ever lost on the ship due to combat. That is what the crew
members remember. They have a tremendous fondness for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The 680-foot ship, decommissioned in 1947 and stricken from the
Navy's register in June 1962, slowly lost its battle against time.
Big Mamie's steel hull corroded, its original teak deck faded and
cracked and became what Morss called ``an extraordinary jungle
gym'' for marine growth, which had accumulated nearly two inches
thick.
</P>
<P>
   During the four-month overhaul at Boston Ship Repair, more than
300 workers used 3,000 gallons of epoxy and 260,000 pounds of
half-inch-thick steel to reseal a ship whose waterline was damaged
by decades of wind and waves. Until it entered drydock last fall,
the Massachusetts had not been out of the water since the Truman
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you traipse around underneath her, you get to appreciate
just how darn big she is,'' Morss said. ``You get to thinking about
what those fellows at Quincy did as a matter of skill and art. She
came out as a gorgeous product.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, workers applied the last coat of battleship
gray paint, whose final gloss was tempered by Sunday's heavy rains.
But the repair crews are now ready to reattach the ship's anchor,
flood the dry dock, and prepare the old battleship for what will
likely be its last voyage in the life of former crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the first ride, and now I'll have the last ride,'' said
Nye, a Marion native and a member of the museum's board of
directors. ``I'm proud of the ship. I'm proud of what it's done. It
was the first battleship to fire its 16-inch guns in World War II,
and it was the last battleship to do that. We saw a lot of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was astronomical to see its fantail again and to see its
beautiful bow,'' he said. ``I'd forgotten what it looked like out
of the water. It's got beautiful lines.''

   PHOENIX -
</P>
<P>
   1945 _ In the beginning, there was Mattel, founded by Ruth and
Elliot Handler.
</P>
<P>
   1957 _ Ruth conceives of an adultlike doll for little girls to
play with and emulate. Her design is based on Lilli, a sexy German
doll marketed for men.
</P>
<P>
   1958 _ The first dolls are made in Japan, with measurements as
attractive as they are unrealistic, thus paving the way for
generations of eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   1959 _ The doll debuts at a New York toy show. It is called
Barbie, after Ruth's daughter, Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   1960 _ Barbie is widely available in strapless black- and
white-striped bathing suit, retailing for $3. Other outfits are Gay
Parisienne, Roman Holiday, Suburban Shopper, Baby Doll nightie and
Wedding Day dress, hitting upon every little girl's dream possible.
Right?
</P>
<P>
   1961 _ Ken is introduced. The good news: Barbie finally has a
date. The bad news: His hair comes from a can of paint.
</P>
<P>
   1963 _ Midge, Barbie's best friend, arrives. She's neither as
tall nor as attractive _ probably why they get along so well.
</P>
<P>
   1964 _ The family grows with Skipper, Barbie's little sister.
Where was she for the past five years? An orphanage? Foster home?
Inside the juvenile-justice system? No one is talking, certainly
not Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   1965 _ Barbie receives bendable legs, making basketball a lot
easier to play.
</P>
<P>
   1966 _ Francie, Barbie's mod cousin, pops in, as do Todd and
Tutti, the tiny twins. Mattel swears Todd and Tutti are Barbie's
sister and brother. Ken isn't talking.
</P>
<P>
   1967 _ Barbie's face is made more youthful for the pop culture.
Twist and Turn Barbie arrives and can swivel at the hips. Barbie is
joined by the Twiggy doll, the only doll that can make Barbie look
fat.
</P>
<P>
   1968 _ Talking Barbie arrives. Ken stays silent. Good Ken. Say
``Cheerio'' to Barbie's British chum, Stacy. She is joined by
Barbie's American chum, Christie, the line's first Black doll.
</P>
<P>
   1969 _ P.J. is introduced.
</P>
<P>
   1970 _ Friend Jamie arrives. Barbie gives Mr. Blackwell
nightmares with her granny dress, prairie look, California Girl tan
and disco togs. Then, Stacy vanishes.
</P>
<P>
   1971 _ Barbie gets a horse, Dancer. Wheee! Only a year later,
Dancer winds up at the glue factory. Or the recycling bin for
plastics.
</P>
<P>
   1972 _ Friend Steffie arrives, but Jamie disappears. Foul play?
</P>
<P>
   1974 _ Barbie's 16. Or so Mattel swears, saying she was born in
1958. Or was she lying about her age for the cool Sweet 16 parties?
</P>
<P>
   1976 _ More plastic surgery. Barbie receives a wide smile and
sun-streaked hair. She also is buried in a bicentennial time
capsule to be opened in 2076, as long as someone remembers. Kelley
disappears, and not into that time capsule.
</P>
<P>
   1978 _ Cara vanishes, the fourth of Barbie's friends to
disappear in eight years. And no one raises a plastic eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   1980 _ Beauty, an Afghan, strays into the Barbie world.
</P>
<P>
   1981 _ Dallas (the horse, not the show) gallops onto the scene.
</P>
<P>
   1982 _ Beauty has pups. No, you may not ask about the father. A
year later, the pups vanish with Mom. No one notifies the ASPCBA
(American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Barbie's Animals).
</P>
<P>
   1983 _ Fluff the kitten and Honey the pony join the household.
Barbie's new pal Tracy arrives.
</P>
<P>
   1984 _ Barbie joins big biz with suit, briefcase, etc. It's not
clear what she does. Like Ken.
</P>
<P>
   1985 _ The poodle Prince arrives. If he doesn't sell, he will be
the poodle formerly known as Prince.
</P>
<P>
   1986 _ Barbie joins Diva, Dee Dee and Dana in an all-girl band,
Barbie and the Rockers.
</P>
<P>
   1988 _ Barbie joins Bopsy, Belinda and Becky in an all-girl
band, Barbie and the Sensations. The Rockers sue for breach of
contract. Meanwhile, say ``Hi'' to Teresa, Barbie's first Hispanic
friend.
</P>
<P>
   1990 _ Welcome Kira, Barbie's first Asian friend.
</P>
<P>
   1991 _ Famous designers make clothes for Barbie, who's about the
size of most supermodels. 1992 _ Barbie's running for president. No
mention of a running mate. Ken? A plastic soda bottle?
</P>
<P>
   1995 _ Kelly, Barbie's baby sister, joins the family, although
Barbie's parents haven't been seen or heard from in 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   1997 _ Share a Smile Becky is Barbie's first friend in a
wheelchair. Barbie gets a silicon implant: Talk With Me Barbie has
a computer chip so she can chat intelligently about parties and
dream dates.
</P>

 TALKS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CRAVEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - She sits rigidly on a chair in her Malibu home. Her
eyes are fixed forward in an unblinking stare.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is because she's in deep thought. Or focusing on her
future.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it is because she is plastic and has no eyelids.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie will be 40 years old in a week, and while she's been
everything from an astronaut to a rock star and has fit into tiny
bikinis and designer gowns, she has yet to blink.
</P>
<P>
   Never has. Never will. But certainly would like to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it too much to ask to be able to rest my eyes, even for a
few seconds or two?'' asks Barbie, sitting down for a rare
interview while her Supervising Companion (she hates the term
``owner'') is at preschool.
</P>
<P>
   She cannot believe it's been 40 years since she debuted as a
teenage fashion model. Most people might be upset missing their
childhood (``I was born a 16-year-old, so I was a teen with no life
experience''). Not Barbie. The advantages of being a
mass-merchandised doll more than make up for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My skin is still smooth, I never have to shave, and I look as
young as I did four decades ago,'' Barbie says. ``Every woman I
know would kill to be me.''
</P>
<P>
   With Barbie in such a good, though slightly catty, mood, we
indulged in a question-and-answer session about life at 40:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any midlife fears?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I'm so scared to gain a gram because my clothes wouldn't
fit, and I'd have to buy a whole new wardrobe. But for some reason,
I start thinking maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing. That, in
fact, it would be a very, very good thing. It's just a feeling I
get. I can't really explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What still annoys you after all these years?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Have you ever woken up from a deep sleep and your head is
twisted around, and you're looking behind you? It's not painful.
Just a little disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   A: What's your biggest achievement?
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Oh, in 40 years, I've done so many things it's almost
impossible to say. Like that time I was an astronaut, though I
don't recall ever going into space. Or training for a mission.
Still, it was a great outfit. But my greatest advance, really, came
in 1967, when I was given knees. I can't tell you how having
bendable legs really changes your world. Until then, I had this
awkward, stiff-legged walk. It was so military or something. And
Ken gave me real strange looks, as if he should talk. He didn't get
knees until much later. At least I think so. I wasn't really paying
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Speaking of Ken, how have you and he managed to remain an
item for so long?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``It's called `packaging.' It is what the great and wise
Mattel has chosen for me. Who am I to argue? Sure, there have been
a few action figures over the years who have caught my eye, but
most are from a totally different world. Hasbro. It would never
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you at all different now from 1959?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``People think I haven't changed much in 40 years, but they
are so wrong. I have way more clothes now, so many I can't fit them
all in my Malibu Beach House (which, by the way, doesn't overlook a
beach but the rear end of a Baby Wet `N' Go. I can't really explain
it). And I've come to value my friends, at least the ones who
remain in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could change one thing about your life, what would it
be?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I don't want to be mean, but I must be blunt here since
this is the first time I've been able to speak my mind in 40 years.
At least if I had a mind. Anyway, I'd rid the world of every little
brother that's ever been. Do you think I like being handled by
sticky fingers that can totally wreck a good hair day? Do you think
I enjoy having my head ripped off and thrown under the bed? Do you
think it's fun watching the kid give your precious designer gown to
the dog? I'll tell you, if I bought myself, the first accessory
would be a Malibu Armored Safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've done more than most dolls twice your age, but are
there any regrets?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Well, there was that Disco Glitter period in the '70s which
still makes my Fashion Sense tingle. I can't even think about
polyester without retching, at least if I were capable of any
biological functions, like that disgustingly awful Baby Burp 'N'
Spit, as if base gastrointestinal achievements were something to be
proud of. But that's another story. There was also that ill-timed
affair with G.I. Jimmy or John, or whatever his name was. Joe, yes,
that's it. I guess I could still feel badly about that unfortunate
incident with the flamethrower, but if Ken didn't know how it
worked, he never should have picked it up in the first place. Good
thing for plastic surgery, is all I can say.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about people who still say that, despite your career
advances, you are an anachronistic doll whose attitudes and
measurements remain stagnant in a pool of political incorrectness?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``People want me to be politically correct? Hey, I'd settle
for being anatomically correct. But you can't have everything.
Yet.'' &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - ``Do you want it or not?'' my mother asked on the
other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because if you don't want it, I have no problem throwing it
away. The closer our moving day comes, the less sentimental I get.
And if you think I'm bluffing, the dumpster in the alley is lined
with the yellowing satin of my wedding dress. So you see, hauling
your old Barbie Country House to my new home really holds very
little appeal for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She was serious. My parents were moving from our family home,
and everything _ especially my stuff _ was tagged and 15 feet from
the trash.
</P>
<P>
   Although as an adult I'm not a fanatic about the doll I played
with as I was growing up, I hold on to a certain affinity for
Barbie. Barbie did things then that I couldn't in a household of
five, such as watching her favorite television show (``Little House
on the Prairie'') every week, using the bathroom whenever she
wanted, and opening the fridge and finding two leftover pieces of
pizza right where she had left them.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I decided that Barbie (I) needed her (my) very own
pad, and I spotted it at the Happiness House toy store for $10. It
didn't have an elevator, just three rooms and swinging saloon doors
into the kitchen, but I knew it would more than suffice. Emptying
the dishwasher at a dime a pop, I needed almost six months to save
up the $10 to bring the Country House to my bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie and I escaped to this vinyl paradise _ with the images of
furniture, pets and plants pasted to the walls in 2-D _ whenever my
younger sister recorded over my cassette of favorite songs I had
taped from the radio; whenever my mother's passion for ``Monday
Night Football'' overrode the fact that at the very same time, the
Ingalls were watching the School for the Blind burn down; and
whenever my other sister ate the two leftover pieces of pizza with
my name written into the tin foil wrapped around them.
</P>
<P>
   The Country House is where Barbie would run, throw herself on
the bed and have a cow without her mother grounding her or making
her friends go home. It's also the same place where Barbie felt
sexy and wore a tube-top dress made from one of my old socks and a
rubber band. Barbie was a symbol of what I could be, eventually:
independent and living in a house with no rent, no parents and no
apparent income. In this world, when Barbie's mom called on the
phone, sometimes Barbie hung up on her.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie wasn't as much of an influence to me as she was an
escape, although it's not like I had a childhood like Sybil's. My
childhood was fine, and Barbie just gave me my own space. I never
thought, however, that I would become her when I grew up or hit
middle school. How could I be Barbie when I wasn't even Skipper?
</P>
<P>
   Who, in all honesty, really thought they were going to be Barbie
when they grew up? In a completely non-scientific survey involving
several friends of mine in their late 20s and early 30s, none of us
woke up on our 18th birthday and wondered where the 17-inch waist
and the pink Corvette were. I had bendable knees. That was close
enough for me.
</P>
<P>
   I had already figured out in fourth grade that Barbie was a
something of a fraud when I tried to walk around for a whole day on
tiptoe. As I hobbled down the hall with a gripping charley horse in
each calf, my mother shot me a look as she was hauling out the
laundry and said, ``I'm not going to hurt your feelings by telling
you that you look like an idiot. But I will tell you that if you
lose your balance and break any of my crystal, you're really going
to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbie didn't set me up for a self-image fall, although in
hindsight, she could have done things that made me feel better
about myself as a preteen. I wonder who I would be now if Mattel
had introduced Acne Barbie, whose face would suddenly turn all red
and splotchy.
</P>
<P>
   As I got older and began to take on the qualities I had given to
Barbie, I gradually lost interest in her. Barbie was slowly
replaced with lip gloss and diaries. Sometime during the transition
from elementary to middle school, Barbie got stuffed into my
closet, next to the abandoned Holly Hobbie dolls and the Sunshine
Family, whose husband, years before, had had a fling with Barbie
when she appeared one day at his office, unannounced and wearing
the tube-top sock dress.
</P>
<P>
   Although I liked Barbie as a kid, I'm not one of those people
who have cleared out a bedroom and built shelves to accommodate a
collection of her. I won't call that silly, simply because I'm sure
that I collect things that other people consider silly. But as for
the Barbie debunkers, those who counter that Barbie is an
unrealistic image _ I say, well, just relax. Of course she is. The
world is unrealistic. Nothing in the world is the way we want it to
be; it's all an illusion. Things I buy from the Eddie Bauer catalog
don't look on me the way they do on the brunette on Page 45. My
spinach and ricotta rolls don't turn out the way they're delicately
pictured in Marcella Hazan's cookbook. Even a paint technique
doesn't come out the same way as it does on the Ralph Lauren color
chip. If Barbie looked real _ if she looked like me, or if she
looked like you _ no one would buy her. We don't want Barbie to be
us. We want Barbie to be who we're not.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Barbie sat in the closed-up Country House
with her furniture and cat painted on the walls, collecting dust
and avoiding the leers of the Sunshine Family dad and the shameful
stares from the mother. The next time I remember seeing Barbie was
during the early '80s, when I decapitated both her and Ballerina
Barbie. With a red marker and a razor blade, I transformed the
smiling heads into the images of Annie Lennox and Cyndi Lauper, and
with some minor surgery involving thin wire, they became earrings.
</P>
<P>
   I subsequently lost the Ballerina Barbie/Cyndi Lauper head in a
bar, and the Annie Lennox head became a hanging ornament from the
rearview mirror of my first car. She swung and bobbed there through
three car accidents, two boyfriends and the eventual move out of my
parents' house. I piled clothes, records and my stereo into the
back seat but left the Country House on the top shelf of my closet.
I hadn't seen it for 17 years until the day my mother called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you now, I will throw that thing away,'' my mother
repeated. ``The Barbie Country House is going . . . going . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it,'' I conceded, as I imagined my husband doubled
over with laughter when I brought it home. I could tell him I
planned to sell it for hundreds of dollars at the online auction. I
could tell him that I was saving it for his niece.
</P>
<P>
   Or I could ignore his laughter, set it up in my bedroom, and,
whenever I wanted to use the bathroom and he was in it, I could
throw my headless Barbie on her bed and quietly, oh so quietly,
have a cow. &QL;

MAKING GAMES COME TO LIFE  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO IS BEING SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN SIDENER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A medieval king in deep contemplation lifts a bishop
from the chess board.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the animation playing on Paul Denigris' computer at
Rainbow Studios in Phoenix, a single soldier moves across the
terrain outside the castle.
</P>
<P>
   Another chess piece moves. More soldiers reposition themselves
until before you know it, the castle is under siege and catapults
are hurling flaming payloads over stone walls.
</P>
<P>
   An epic battle, complete with legions of foot soldiers and
cavalry, culminates in a close-up of the ruler's face as the life
passes out of him and the king piece tumbles from his limp hand.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who follows the march of 3D computer animation toward
the grail of photo-realism, the video clip is clearly a significant
stride. The herky-jerky motions that too often characterize human
movement in computer animation are gone. Instead, the legs that run
and arms that swing swords are fluid and lifelike. The close-up on
the dying leader's face shows meaningful expression.
</P>
<P>
   The video clip, which will be the opening segment in the next
version of Microsoft's Age of Empires strategy game is one of
several video-game projects under way at the central Phoenix
animation studio, including a sequel to its Motocross Madness,
published by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Motocross Madness is on its way to selling a million copies and
has been named racing game of the year by two computer gaming
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an honor,'' said Earl Jarred, CEO of Rainbow
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   The game also was singled out for praise by Bill Gates at Comdex
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to games, the studio is producing a full-length
animated movie and animation for educational videos and prototype
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In the ever-quickening pace of computer animation, there is no
time to rest on your 3D laurels. Today's cutting-edge becomes next
month's industry standard. Jarred is barely finished beaming over
the Age of Empires video when he heads off to flaunt a gaming
project that he promises is even more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   In Age of Empires, Rainbow Studios is doing the opening
animation, but in the new project, working title Max, the studio is
doing the entire game. Jarred and his crew of animators, producers,
artists and engineers have set a concise but weighty goal in Max _
give the interactive part of the game the same level of cinematic
animation as the opening video. When the player steers the
rough-and-tumble protagonist into a brawl or a shootout, the idea
is to have the animation as smooth and seamless as in the intro to
Age of Empires, which was painstakingly assembled frame by frame.
</P>
<P>
   The game is being written for the next generation of game
consoles and PCs. Computer-animated scenes and figures are made up
of thousands of tiny polygons. Max is being designed with the
assumption that game consoles in a couple of years will be able to
render 55 million polygons per second. That's 10 times the speed of
the Sega Dreamcaster, due out in this country this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow Studios has 47 employees, including three with doctoral
degrees, one in robotics, one in engineering and one in pure math.
</P>
<P>
   Jarred credits the company's games group president, Mark
DeSimone, the math Ph.D., with the technical vision behind the
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``My partner is the resident technical guru who makes it all
happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Rainbow Studios facilities on Seventh Street is an
800-square-foot motion capture booth. The room is used to record a
person's motions and translates them into 3D figures. A model dons
a data suit containing up to 32 sensors. A clear globe hanging from
the ceiling creates magnetic fields. When the model moves his or
her arm, the computer records those movements along three planes,
up and down, east and west and north and south.
</P>
<P>
   The computer then translates those movements to a 3D model of
the same proportions. The glorified stick figure then mimics the
recorded movements. A demonstration of this technology can be seen
at www.rainbo.com, the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Using 3D animation programs, the figure can be given the shapes
and textures of a monster, a hero or a villain. A sample of this
process also can be seen at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The motion capture not only grabs an accurate picture of
movements; it also greatly speeds the animation process. If the
equipment is set to grab images at 30 frames per second, then a
10-second motion contains the foundation for 300 frames. Those
frames would have to be created manually otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden contraption sitting on the motion-capture stage
resembles a souped-up saw horse. At first glance, it appears to be
a horse from the Age of Empires video. It turns out to be the
motorcycle for Motocross Madness. Riders were recorded leaning
forward, back and to the side, mounting, dismounting and tumbling.
Artists and animators then added helmets and racing suits, and put
the riders in the game.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden substitute was used because the metal of the motorcycle
would have distorted the magnetic fields of the motion-capture
process.
</P>
<P>
   The company's engineers have developed a facial-motion camera
that records the movement of small facial muscles and are working
on a data glove that will record the movements of fingers and other
parts of the hand. Currently, face and hand movements must be
created frame by frame.
</P>
<P>
   Animation is a time-consuming affair. Six studio employees spent
six months on the Age of Empires video segment. Motocross Madness
took 15 studio employees two years to complete, and that doesn't
count the Microsoft employees who worked on the project.
</P>
<P>
   The sequel to Motocross Madness is expected to be out in about a
year. One of the big changes for the next version is the addition
of trees. A sneak preview of the work-in-progress shows the once
barren landscape studded with trees for riders to dodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking of adding a duck function,'' says designer Rob
Rinard. ``If you come to a low-hanging branch, you can duck under
it. If not, you'll get clotheslined.'' &QL;

SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS FEDERAL CARJACKING LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Upholding the federal carjacking law, the Supreme
Court ruled Tuesday that criminals who use weapons to steal
vehicles are violating that law even if they do not mean to hurt
anyone inside the autos.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-2 decision, the high court rejected the argument of a New
York man who said he was innocent of carjacking because he would
have used his gun only if any of the victims had given him a ``hard
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law states that to be guilty of carjacking a person must
steal a vehicle by ``force and violence'' with the ``intent to
cause death or serious bodily harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois Holloway argued that he had no intention of causing
bodily harm to the drivers and passengers so long as ``everything
went smoothly,'' and, therefore, he was not guilty of carjacking
under the federal statute.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court majority, Justice John Paul Stevens said
Congress, which passed the law in 1992 after a spate of vicious car
thefts, meant to make carjacking illegal even when only the threat
of violence was used to steal the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that when a person points a gun at someone else while
stealing their car ... that entails a serious threat of violence
and that the driver has no idea if the criminal is serious or
not,'' Stevens said as he announced the decision.
</P>
<P>
   He said that to accept Holloway's argument would mean that the
carjacking law could apply only to those cases in which the
carjacker's ``sole and unconditional purpose at the time he
committed the crime was to kill or maim the victim.'' He said that
ruling would be ``clearly at odds'' with what Congress intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in the unusual carjacking does the criminal intend to
harm even if the driver or passenger doesn't resist,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Stephen G. Breyer joined in the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The court's most conservative justices, Clarence Thomas and
Antonin Scalia, disagreed with the majority.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually personal opinion, Scalia said a carjacker had
killed the father and nearly killed the mother of a friend in an
incident after the car had already been handed over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not at all implausible that Congress should direct its
attention to this particularly savage sort of carjacking where
killing the driver is part of the intended crime,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said that a simple reading of the Black's Law Dictionary,
which defines the word intent as ``a state of mind in which a
person seeks to accomplish a given result through a course of
action,'' shows that the carjacking law cannot apply to Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holloway intended to steal the car; he did not intend to harm
anybody,'' Scalia wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He added that if Congress had meant to ``cast its carjacking net
so broadly, it could have achieved that result by defining the
crime as `carjacking under threat of death or serious bodily harm,'
rather than intent.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Holloway was sentenced to more than 50 years in prison
for his part in a carjacking ring that sold parts of stolen
vehicles dismantled in a Queens ``chop shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that on at least three occasions in the fall of
1994, Holloway confronted motorists with a gun and demanded that
they surrender their car keys.
</P>
<P>
   When one man hesitated, Holloway punched him in the face.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge who presided over Holloway's trial told jurors
they could find the required intent if they thought Holloway would
have seriously hurt victims who did not comply with his demands.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Holloway's
conviction, ruling that such a common-sense interpretation was
valid despite what it called the law's somewhat ambiguous language.

   AMERICAN-MEAT (New York) _ Bruce Aidells and his collaborator,

in America to produce ``The Complete Meat Cookbook,'' published
last November by Houghton Mifflin. Not only does it secure his
image as a man unafraid of meat, even in these vegetable-revering

   MEAT-MARINATE (Undated) _ Since the earliest days of recorded
history, and maybe even before, humans have marinated their food,
steeping meat, fowl and fish in some combination of liquid _

practical reasons: Tough meat needed to be made tender, it needed
to be preserved, and, with humans ever attuned to improving their
lot, it needed to be flavored. But from ranch to refrigerator,
almost everything has changed about meat and the way it is treated
today. Everything, that is, except marination. By Eric Asimov.

   WINE-MICROWAVE (New York) _ A new question is creeping into wine
service in New York: How do you want that cooked? For many years,
Americans have confounded the rest of the world by drinking their

longer hesitate when diners ask that a luscious Corton-Charlemagne
be plunged into an ice bucket. They just do it. It's easy. Red wine
poses a different problem. If it arrives at the table with slight
chill, and the diners want it the temperature of a blood
transfusion _ fast _ the sommelier must resort to wiles, and the
wiliest wile of all, it turns out, is the microwave oven. By

   WASHINGTON _ It's not often Ricky Williams gets tackled
single-handedly.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the Heisman trophy winner found himself on his
backafter a scuffle with the Cat in the Hat.
</P>
<P>
   A laughing Williams recovered in time to delight about 20
children with a rendition of ``Green Eggs and Ham,'' to promote a
National Education Association reading program.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me what my hobbies are and I say being around kids.
So for me, this is a lot of fun,'' said Williams, who hopes some
day to teach second grade.
</P>
<P>
   The event was one of thousands held Tuesday as part of the
second annual Read Across America. On what would have been Dr.
Seuss' 94th birthday, Williams honored the legendary author by
topping his trademark dreadlocks with red and white Cat in the
Hat-style head gear.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and NEA President Bob Chase took turns reading the part
of Sam. Eventually, the children joined in and finished each
sentence in unison.
</P>
<P>
   Eight-year-old Corrisma Walker said the book ``had good rhymes''
and taught her about taking chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone made green eggs and ham, I would try them,'' she
said, with a nod of determination.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he was inspired and challenged as a child by his
younger sister, Rebecca, who was at his same reading level despite
being a year and a half younger.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite childhood book was ``Where the Wild Things Are,''
by Maurice Sendak.
</P>
<P>
   Although several of the children had never heard of the
University of Texas football star until Tuesday, they turned into
fans in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fast reader,'' said 7-year-old Robert Walker.

 &HT;    A TRUCKER'S LIFE: DOWN THE ROAD WITH HAL T. BURKS
 &HT;    Repeating a story first moved Tuesday, Feb. 23 in (a) national
and (l) lifestyle categories for release Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD _ Daylight was fading over the tranquil Mississippi
pastures as Hal T. Burks steered his 18-wheeler down Highway 78
toward Tupelo and reflected on the two great loves of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pretty wife's name was Demetra,'' he said. ``One time early
in our marriage, I had just gotten home from two weeks on the road
when the doorbell rang and she got a delivery of roses. There was a
card that said 'To Demetra With Love,' but no signature.''
</P>
<P>
   After some chit-chat about other matters, his wife asked flat
out if he wasn't curious about who sent the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'No. Should I be?' Well, she thought I ought to,''
Burks recalled. ``She had sent them to herself to make me jealous.
We laughed about those roses for years. That was the only time she
ever tried to get me to quit driving. She knew how much I loved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal T. and Demetra had been married for 24 years and had reared
three children to adulthood before she died in 1997 of
complications from a liver disease. ``I'd been planning to retire
when I was 55 to be with her,'' said the 51-year-old long-haul
driver. ``Now I'll just keep on trucking.''
</P>
<P>
   Many motorists _ ``four-wheelers'' in the lingo of citizens'
band radio _ wonder about the nation's 3.75 million commercial
truck drivers like Burks. Romanticized in songs like ``Six Days on
the Road'' and ``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses,'' they are
often portrayed as cowboys of the interstates. But safety activists
sometimes depict them as tattooed death on wheels _ fatigued or
drugged-out renegades riding 80,000 pounds of speeding jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   For a reporter riding with Burks through five Southern states,
though, the stereotypes vaporize like the exhaust from his white
Freightliner. He drinks more bottled water than coffee, for
instance, and listens to books on tape as much as to country music
radio and CB gab. As for recreation on the road, ``give me more
than a 12-hour break and I'll find a golf course,'' Burks said.
</P>
<P>
   From his M.S. Carriers headquarters in Memphis to truck stops
across America, folks call him ``Hal T.'' His truck has his name on
the door, 10 forward gears, a 430-horsepower engine and a roomy cab
with a refrigerator and bunk beds. It gets about six miles to the
gallon of diesel fuel. There's also a company-installed engine
governor that restricts his speed to a maximum 65 miles per hour
and a Qualcom satellite hookup that lets his dispatcher track him _
within 20 feet _ anywhere on the continent. The system permits
instantaneous two-way communications through a computer on his
dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   Burks is hardly a typical trucker. Over the past two decades or
so, he has driven 2.8 million miles _ that's nearly six trips to
the moon and back _ without having an accident. In 1997, the
American Trucking Association, which represents most of the major
carriers, selected him as an America's Road Team Captain. These
dozen drivers are picked because of their performance test scores,
safety record and flair for public relations. They represent the
trucking industry for 18 months, and then a new team is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Driving east on I-20 through the Alabama night, Hal T. Burks
shifted gears and spun his stories.
</P>
<P>
   The ``T.'' stands for Travis. He was one of 14 children born in
a farm family outside Memphis. ``I never heard my parents argue,''
he marveled. Whenever there were differences, ``they'd go park by a
cornfield and have what Mama called 'loud reasoning'.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his schoolmates was the sister of singer Jerry Lee Lewis,
and he regularly visited the Killer's Memphis home during his
boyhood. Burks dropped out of high school in the 12th grade. ``My
downfall was my '59 Ford convertible _ black with red trim
interior,'' he recalled. ``I couldn't stand to sit in class and see
that car sitting in the parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after leaving school, though, he was driving an olive
green ``deuce-and-a-half'' _ a 2.5 ton military truck. He earned a
high school equivalency diploma in the Army and served a tour in
Vietnam. After his discharge, he was working at a Jackson, Tenn.,
truck stop owned by his sister and brother-in-law when he was
struck by a yearning to drive a big truck down the road. Since
then, he has hauled cargo through 48 states _ all but Alaska and
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like driving any time,'' he declared. ``And it's great to
wake up in a different place every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was close to midnight when he backed his trailer up to a
loading dock at a warehouse in Duluth, Ga., filled out his log
book, and settled into the lower bunk to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Federal transportation law lets truckers drive for 10 straight
hours, but then forces them to take an eight-hour break before
starting again. Practically every minute is chronicled in the log
book, and the Qualcom system provides computerized documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Paychecks are determined by mileage. Long-distance drivers who
operate company trucks usually earn between 28 and 35 cents per
mile. Drivers who use their own rigs to haul company cargoes earn
more per mile, but also must pay for gas and upkeep of their
trucks. The average truck driver makes $35,000 a year, according to
the American Trucking Association.
</P>
<P>
   To keep their expenses down and maximize their mileage, drivers
usually sleep their eight hours in their truck cabs rather than in
motels. They park in truck-stop lots or roadside rest stops or, if
possible, at the destination of their cargo. Drivers typically stay
on the road for two-week stretches, finding out where to pick up
and deliver the next load only after dropping off the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   Around 8 a.m., Burks notified his dispatcher that the Duluth
cargo, huge spools of wire, had been unloaded. Shortly afterward, a
message popped up on the computer screen to pick up a loaded
trailer at the M.S. Carriers depot in Atlanta and drive it to
Orlando. After hash browns, eggs and sausage at a Waffle House, he
drove to the depot, where the empty trailer was replaced with a
full one. The Freightliner was soon headed south on I-75.
</P>
<P>
   Passing miles of piney woods and palmettos, Burks allowed that
the road can get lonely. For years, he called his wife and kids
every day that he was away.
</P>
<P>
   Separations from family ``are the main reasons that a lot of
drivers quit,'' he said. ``You can't sit home and make money in the
trucking business. It takes a good woman to put up with a trucker.
She has got to be it all _ plumber, carpenter, sometimes mama and
daddy. Most of them can't handle all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are increasingly more women behind the wheel,
more than 90 percent of long-distance drivers are male.
</P>
<P>
   Burks looks back fondly on an 18-month period when he drove his
own rig. ``I took my pretty wife with me on the road,'' he
recalled. ``We had a great time. But I didn't like spending my days
off working on my truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Now M.S. Carriers provides him with a new truck every couple of
years and maintains the vehicles. A new Freightliner costs $80,000
to $100,000, and the Memphis-based carrier has about 2,500 on the
road. A trailer costs another $20,000 or so. In addition to its own
rigs, M.S. Carriers contracts with 700 to 800 owner-operators.
There are a few bigger carriers, but not many.
</P>
<P>
   The trucking business is booming. The industry employs about 9
million people _ including 3 million drivers _ and there is a
national shortage of 80,000 drivers, according to the American
Trucking Association. About 82 percent of the nation's freight
revenue goes to trucking firms, and the business has grown by 20
percent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Burks faced an hourlong wait for a shower at the TA Truckstop
near the intersection of I-75 and the Florida Turnpike near
Wildwood, but wait he would. A day and a half had passed since he
had left his home in Humboldt, Tenn., and driven to company
headquarters in Memphis to begin this two-week run. It was time to
clean up and change clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The shower was free with a $50 fuel purchase or $6 without.
Truckers got a clean blue towel and matching washcloth and a key to
a private tiled bathroom with shower stall, lavatory and toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a wait in the evening'' as truckers fill the
parking lots for the night, explained Burks. ``The best time to get
a shower at a truck stop is early in the mornings.''
</P>
<P>
   But this day's drive has not yet ended. After the shower and a
supper of liver and onions, he was back behind the wheel _ heading
east on the Turnpike to Orlando. Time spent at truck stops doesn't
count against the 10-hour driving limit.
</P>
<P>
   Burks' CB handle is ``Double Trouble,'' but he listens more than
talks in the conversations that crackle over the airwaves. One
night, though, he talked to the driver of Dolly Parton's tour bus.
``He told me to look at his back window when he passed,'' Burks
said. ``There was ol' Dolly waving at me. Sometimes you'll see
country music singers and their crews eating in truck stops in the
middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the food and sassy waitresses that pull truckers _
and bands' tour buses _ to truck stops, but also the huge parking
lots and 24-hour services. It's hard to pull a big rig up to a
McDonald's drive-in window.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Orlando are nearly deserted as the Freightliner
arrives around 11 p.m. Burks follows the directions on his Qualcom
computer screen to find his destination warehouse. He backs up to a
loading dock, enters the time in his log book, and is quickly
asleep in the bunk. He is awakened at 6 a.m. by a banging on the
cab door. A warehouse supervisor told him to move to another bay to
be unloaded immediately. Wiping the sleep from his eyes, he
complied.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor pointed to a room with coffee and an adjoining
bathroom where drivers can wash their faces and brush their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Before 8 a.m., the trailer was empty and Burks sent the news to
his dispatcher. Minutes later came orders to pick up a load about
50 miles away and drive it to Greensboro, N.C. Often, Burks does
not know what he is hauling. A load is a load. And a driver can't
make money in a parked truck. Breakfast will come somewhere down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Hal T. Burks was rolling again.

 &HT;    SAFETY ADVOCATES WANT TIGHTER TRUCKING REGULATION
 &HT;    With TRUCK-SAFETY. For release Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With more people being killed in crashes between
passenger vehicles and big rigs, some consumer groups and members
of Congress are blaming the federal agency responsible for
maintaining truck safety.
</P>
<P>
   The critics charge that the Transportation Department's Office
of Motor Carriers (OMC) has been lax in enforcing safety
regulations on commercial motor vehicles. The alarming results,
they say, are more defective trucks on the roads and more fatigued
drivers falsifying their required log books in order to evade
federal limits on time behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``OMC has not been doing a good job,'' said Rep. Frank Wolf,
R-Va., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on
transportation. ``The office has become too cozy with the trucking
industry, which it is supposed to be regulating.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf recently held a hearing on his proposal to move OMC from
Transportation's Federal Highway Administration to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   That agency ``is charged with the responsibility of overseeing
the safe operation of the nation's highways,'' Wolf said, while the
Federal Highway Administration has a broader mission that includes
construction of interstate roadways.
</P>
<P>
   Among the witnesses at Wolf's hearing was Bonnie Pierce, an Elm
City, N.C., mother who told how her son Terry, a high school
wrestler, and his teammate were killed in a head-on crash with a
fatigued truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why was the tired trucker who killed my son still on the road
after 16 hours?'' she asked. ``The answer is simple. The federal
Office of Motor Carriers is incapable of enforcing safety
regulations and the Federal Highway Administration is incapable of
implementing new, more effective regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The trucking industry and safety advocates agree that it's time
to change the 65-year-old driving limits _ which generally require
eight hours off the road after 10 hours behind the wheel _ to force
drivers to get more rest. The Federal Highway Administration is
developing a proposal for new hours-of-service regulations.
</P>
<P>
   There could be disagreement between the truckers and consumer
groups, however, on what the hours should be.
</P>
<P>
   Walter McCormick, president of the American Trucking
Associations, which represents the major carriers, also agrees with
the safety activists that there should be more inspections of
commercial trucks and tougher penalties on carriers who put unsafe
big rigs on the roads. McCormick has proposed doubling the current
$100 million in federal funding for roadside inspections.
</P>
<P>
   However, Todd Spencer, vice president of the Owner-Operator
Independent Drivers Association, believes that pushing for more
inspections is ``a very narrow focus'' in seeking improved truck
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``How often trucks are inspected has little to do with how well
a driver is trained or with the economic coercion imposed upon
drivers to make impossible deadlines,'' Spencer testified recently
in a congressional hearing on truck safety.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to requiring truckers to pass the tests needed to
obtain a federal Commercial Drivers License, he said training and
an on-the-road apprenticeship should be required. He said the
independent truckers he represents also need regulations protecting
them from shippers who effectively force them to break safety laws
to meet their delivery schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drivers who refuse are blackballed by the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry critics want several other reforms:
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring commercial trucks to have on-board satellite
tracking systems that record their speed and position, making it
impossible for drivers to fake their log-book entries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mandating on-board ``black boxes'' like those in airlines that
would determine causes of crashes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring trucks to have engine governors that limit their
speed.
</P>
<P>
   The truckers and some safety advocates agree that states should
opening more roadside rest stops and lengthen stay limits so
drivers will have places to pull over and sleep. Many states now
limit truckers to two hours in a rest stop.

<P>
   Hal T. Burks eased his big Freightliner to the left lane of I-75
as a shiny red Ford pickup came barreling down an on-ramp near the
Georgia-Florida line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the law obligates trucks to move over and let them
on,'' complained Burks, who drives an 18-wheeler for M.S. Carriers.
``But sometimes I can't because there's traffic in the lane beside
me. Then a lot of times the four-wheeler will squeeze in right in
front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a recipe for tragedy. According to a Cox Newspapers
computer analysis of federal highway safety records, the most
common fatal accident involving a large truck and a car comes when
the car pulls in front of the truck and the larger vehicle can't
slow down in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we have 18 wheels with tread doesn't mean we can
stop on a dime,'' explained Burks.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths in car-truck crashes _ overwhelmingly of car drivers _
are on the rise, and the trucking industry's safety record is under
congressional scrutiny. But the Cox analysis found that police
investigators are three times more likely to cite car drivers for
driving errors that contributed to an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers suggest that the biggest opportunity to save lives
may be teaching car drivers how to stay safe around trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Cox examined 1997 data from the federal government's Fatal
Accident Reporting System (FARS) showing that in fatal crashes
involving cars and large trucks, the investigating police at the
accident scene cited the car drivers 2,381 times for deficiencies
such as ``failure to keep in proper lane,'' ``drowsiness'' or
``reckless driving.'' They cited truck drivers 679 times.
</P>
<P>
   In fatal crashes where drinking was a factor, the FARS data
show, 15 percent of the car drivers had an alcohol blood content
over the most common legal limit of .10 percent. By comparison,
fewer than 1 percent of the truck drivers had that much alcohol in
their systems.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing the same FARS data, the General Accounting
Office (GAO), the investigating arm of Congress, reached a similar
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Errors by car drivers were reported in 80 percent of the
crashes, while errors by truck drivers were reported in 28 percent
of the crashes,'' said Phyllis Scheinberg, the GAO's associate
director for transportation issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gordy Wright, a spokesman for Georgia State Patrol, said
statistics from his state tell the same story. Of 121 fatal wrecks
involving large trucks in Georgia in 1997, the car driver was cited
nearly two-thirds of the time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox analysis found that the most common fatal crash scenario
came when both truck and car were driving in the same direction
during daylight in good weather, and the truck hit the car either
at an angle or from the rear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anecdotally, that is what I would have said about the
situation even without the computer study,'' said Major Ken Howes,
a spokesman for Florida State Patrol. ``I've been on the highway
patrol for over 20 years, and the vast majority of truck drivers
I've come into contact with are professional, very careful drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you're driving an 80,000-pound rig down an interstate
highway and a car abruptly changes lanes in front of you and then
hits the brakes, you can't stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
cautions that the contributing driver factors cited by
investigating police ``can only be suggestive about why truck
crashes occur'' and ``cannot be used to determine causation or
fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The factors ``are based on the officer's judgment at the scene
of the accident _ his observations and discussions with
witnesses,'' said Dave Longo, a spokesman for the federal Office of
Motor Carriers (OMC). ``They are not an absolute causation
determination, because they are not made with the benefit of a more
thorough investigation and accident reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Highway safety advocates disparage the data in stronger terms.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are ``a bunch of malarkey,'' said Joan Claybrook,
director of CRASH, or Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways.
``It's become a canard _ heavily promoted by the trucking industry
_ that car drivers are responsible for most of these (fatal)
crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   The car drivers are usually killed, and when police arrive to
investigate, ``the only one talking is the truck driver,'' said
Claybrook. So the account of the accident is likely to be biased,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the same pattern of driver factors was found in a study
of crashes where both the truck driver and car driver survived, the
GAO's Scheinberg testified at a House hearing on truck safety last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Car driver errors were cited in 74 percent of the crashes,
compared to 35 percent for truck driver errors,'' she noted in
written testimony. ``This finding lends some support to the
hypothesis that, compared to truck drivers, car drivers contribute
more to fatal crashes between large trucks and cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Donaldson, senior research director for Advocates for
Highway and Auto Safety, argues that data from fatal crashes is not
comparable to data from non-fatal crashes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute on one statistic: Regardless of who caused
the accident, occupants of a car, van or sports utility vehicle are
much more likely to be killed in a crash with a big rig than is the
truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox analysis showed that of the 5,355 people who died in
crashes involving a large truck in 1997, about 87 percent were
occupants of the passenger vehicles. The death toll, up 213 from
the previous year, marks a continuing slow increase.
</P>
<P>
   After the toll reached 5,679 in 1988, it fell to 4,462 in 1992,
only to begin climbing again as traffic increased.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, car drivers were four times more likely to die in these
crashes than were the truck drivers _ 2,613 car drivers compared to
646 truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in deaths has spurred demands from highway safety
advocates for more federal inspections and regulation of trucking.
Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., has charged that the agency responsible for
enforcing truck safety _ the Office of Motor Carriers _ has not
done its job and should be moved from the Department of
Transportation to the independent NHTSA.
</P>
<P>
   But Donaldson also agreed that the danger to car passengers in
truck accidents needs to be hammered home by the trucking industry
and government licensing agencies. A public education campaign
should be waged to inform car drivers ``that their chances of
survival are extremely remote'' in a crash with a big rig, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burks agreed that if the drivers of ``four-wheelers'' realized
how likely they are to be killed or injured if hit by a truck, they
wouldn't try to squeeze in front of a big rig trying to maintain a
safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to continue to educate drivers on sharing the road,''
said Walter McCormick, president of the American Trucking
Associations (ATA), the group that represents many of the major
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The ATA and the U.S. Department of Transportation have begun a
``No Zone'' campaign to publicize the areas surrounding a moving
truck where motorists are in danger. The safety advocates say the
effort is ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Driving down I-75, Burks pointed to the mirrors outside his cab
windows and protruding from both sides of his hood. ``If the
mirrors are properly adjusted,'' he said, ``the only truly blind
spot on a truck is directly in the rear.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even a window in the bottom of the passenger door on
his truck so he can see cars directly on his right.
</P>
<P>
   The trucking industry contends that it is being unfairly
maligned in the safety debate.
</P>
<P>
   As the total truck mileage on the nation's highways has risen 77
percent since 1980, the fatal crash rate per 100 million miles
traveled has been cut in half, McCormick told Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than moving the Office of Motor Carriers, McCormick
testified, the trucking industry would support setting up a
separate federal agency to oversee its operations, with a
relationship like the Federal Aviation Administration has with
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   From the cab of his Freightliner, Burks dismisses the debate as
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Having driven 2.8 million miles without an accident, the
51-year-old driver takes safety seriously. Burks is a 1997
America's Road Team Captain _ selected by the trucking industry as
one of its safest drivers. He insists that both the government and
the industry have taken steps to ensure that commercial truckers
are safer than the average motorist on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Burks points out that truck drivers are required to earn a
federal Commercial Driver's License with more rigorous requirements
than the licenses held by most motorists. Federal law also requires
truck drivers to stop and rest for at least eight hours after
driving for 10 hours, and to record their periods of driving and
rest in a log book.
</P>
<P>
   Burks' employer, M.S. Carriers of Memphis, Tenn., is one of the
largest companies in the business. Like many of its peers, the
company invests heavily in safety equipment and training.
</P>
<P>
   On the dashboard of Burks' Freightliner is a computer connected
to a satellite positioning system that allows his dispatcher to
track him anywhere on the continent. This Qualcom system provides a
wealth of information _ the truck's speed, fuel consumption, idling
time, and rest periods. This data eliminates the possibility of a
driver cheating on the written log book.
</P>
<P>
   A Qualcom spokesman said about 230,000 long-distance, irregular
run drivers like Burks have satellite tracking systems tying their
trucks to dispatchers in the United States. Similar communications
systems such as cellular are also increasing in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The system ``can even show when a driver might be tailgating''
because it records how many times and how hard he hits the brakes,
said Burks.
</P>
<P>
   The 430-horsepower engine of Burks' truck also has a governor
that limits his speed to a maximum 65 mph.
</P>
<P>
   When he is not on the road, Burks is an instructor at the M.S.
Carriers driving and safety academy in Memphis. New drivers undergo
four weeks of schooling before going out on the road with a veteran
driver as a trainee.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of driving without an accident, M.S. Carriers
gives its drivers a ring with a blue stone in the middle. For the
next four years without an accident, a small diamond is added in
each corner. After 10 years, a big diamond goes in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appraises at about $3,500,'' said Burks, showing the ring
to a rider.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks to high school drivers education classes and other
groups to convey the trucker's viewpoint on to regular motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to share the highway,'' he explains.

 &HT;    SAFETY ADVOCATES WANT TIGHTER TRUCKING REGULATION
 &HT;    With TRUCK-SAFETY. For release Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With more people being killed in crashes between
passenger vehicles and big rigs, some consumer groups and members
of Congress are blaming the federal agency responsible for
maintaining truck safety.
</P>
<P>
   The critics charge that the Transportation Department's Office
of Motor Carriers (OMC) has been lax in enforcing safety
regulations on commercial motor vehicles. The alarming results,
they say, are more defective trucks on the roads and more fatigued
drivers falsifying their required log books in order to evade
federal limits on time behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``OMC has not been doing a good job,'' said Rep. Frank Wolf,
R-Va., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on
transportation. ``The office has become too cozy with the trucking
industry, which it is supposed to be regulating.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf recently held a hearing on his proposal to move OMC from
Transportation's Federal Highway Administration to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   That agency ``is charged with the responsibility of overseeing
the safe operation of the nation's highways,'' Wolf said, while the
Federal Highway Administration has a broader mission that includes
construction of interstate roadways.
</P>
<P>
   Among the witnesses at Wolf's hearing was Bonnie Pierce, an Elm
City, N.C., mother who told how her son Terry, a high school
wrestler, and his teammate were killed in a head-on crash with a
fatigued truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why was the tired trucker who killed my son still on the road
after 16 hours?'' she asked. ``The answer is simple. The federal
Office of Motor Carriers is incapable of enforcing safety
regulations and the Federal Highway Administration is incapable of
implementing new, more effective regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The trucking industry and safety advocates agree that it's time
to change the 65-year-old driving limits _ which generally require
eight hours off the road after 10 hours behind the wheel _ to force
drivers to get more rest. The Federal Highway Administration is
developing a proposal for new hours-of-service regulations.
</P>
<P>
   There could be disagreement between the truckers and consumer
groups, however, on what the hours should be.
</P>
<P>
   Walter McCormick, president of the American Trucking
Associations, which represents the major carriers, also agrees with
the safety activists that there should be more inspections of
commercial trucks and tougher penalties on carriers who put unsafe
big rigs on the roads. McCormick has proposed doubling the current
$100 million in federal funding for roadside inspections.
</P>
<P>
   However, Todd Spencer, vice president of the Owner-Operator
Independent Drivers Association, believes that pushing for more
inspections is ``a very narrow focus'' in seeking improved truck
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``How often trucks are inspected has little to do with how well
a driver is trained or with the economic coercion imposed upon
drivers to make impossible deadlines,'' Spencer testified recently
in a congressional hearing on truck safety.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to requiring truckers to pass the tests needed to
obtain a federal Commercial Drivers License, he said training and
an on-the-road apprenticeship should be required. He said the
independent truckers he represents also need regulations protecting
them from shippers who effectively force them to break safety laws
to meet their delivery schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drivers who refuse are blackballed by the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry critics want several other reforms:
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring commercial trucks to have on-board satellite
tracking systems that record their speed and position, making it
impossible for drivers to fake their log-book entries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mandating on-board ``black boxes'' like those in airlines that
would determine causes of crashes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring trucks to have engine governors that limit their
speed.
</P>
<P>
   The truckers and some safety advocates agree that states should
opening more roadside rest stops and lengthen stay limits so
drivers will have places to pull over and sleep. Many states now
limit truckers to two hours in a rest stop.

 &HT;    A TRUCKER'S LIFE: DOWN THE ROAD WITH HAL T. BURKS
 &HT;    Repeating a story first moved Tuesday, Feb. 23 in (a) national
and (l) lifestyle categories for release Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD _ Daylight was fading over the tranquil Mississippi
pastures as Hal T. Burks steered his 18-wheeler down Highway 78
toward Tupelo and reflected on the two great loves of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pretty wife's name was Demetra,'' he said. ``One time early
in our marriage, I had just gotten home from two weeks on the road
when the doorbell rang and she got a delivery of roses. There was a
card that said 'To Demetra With Love,' but no signature.''
</P>
<P>
   After some chit-chat about other matters, his wife asked flat
out if he wasn't curious about who sent the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'No. Should I be?' Well, she thought I ought to,''
Burks recalled. ``She had sent them to herself to make me jealous.
We laughed about those roses for years. That was the only time she
ever tried to get me to quit driving. She knew how much I loved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal T. and Demetra had been married for 24 years and had reared
three children to adulthood before she died in 1997 of
complications from a liver disease. ``I'd been planning to retire
when I was 55 to be with her,'' said the 51-year-old long-haul
driver. ``Now I'll just keep on trucking.''
</P>
<P>
   Many motorists _ ``four-wheelers'' in the lingo of citizens'
band radio _ wonder about the nation's 3.75 million commercial
truck drivers like Burks. Romanticized in songs like ``Six Days on
the Road'' and ``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses,'' they are
often portrayed as cowboys of the interstates. But safety activists
sometimes depict them as tattooed death on wheels _ fatigued or
drugged-out renegades riding 80,000 pounds of speeding jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   For a reporter riding with Burks through five Southern states,
though, the stereotypes vaporize like the exhaust from his white
Freightliner. He drinks more bottled water than coffee, for
instance, and listens to books on tape as much as to country music
radio and CB gab. As for recreation on the road, ``give me more
than a 12-hour break and I'll find a golf course,'' Burks said.
</P>
<P>
   From his M.S. Carriers headquarters in Memphis to truck stops
across America, folks call him ``Hal T.'' His truck has his name on
the door, 10 forward gears, a 430-horsepower engine and a roomy cab
with a refrigerator and bunk beds. It gets about six miles to the
gallon of diesel fuel. There's also a company-installed engine
governor that restricts his speed to a maximum 65 miles per hour
and a Qualcom satellite hookup that lets his dispatcher track him _
within 20 feet _ anywhere on the continent. The system permits
instantaneous two-way communications through a computer on his
dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   Burks is hardly a typical trucker. Over the past two decades or
so, he has driven 2.8 million miles _ that's nearly six trips to
the moon and back _ without having an accident. In 1997, the
American Trucking Association, which represents most of the major
carriers, selected him as an America's Road Team Captain. These
dozen drivers are picked because of their performance test scores,
safety record and flair for public relations. They represent the
trucking industry for 18 months, and then a new team is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Driving east on I-20 through the Alabama night, Hal T. Burks
shifted gears and spun his stories.
</P>
<P>
   The ``T.'' stands for Travis. He was one of 14 children born in
a farm family outside Memphis. ``I never heard my parents argue,''
he marveled. Whenever there were differences, ``they'd go park by a
cornfield and have what Mama called 'loud reasoning'.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his schoolmates was the sister of singer Jerry Lee Lewis,
and he regularly visited the Killer's Memphis home during his
boyhood. Burks dropped out of high school in the 12th grade. ``My
downfall was my '59 Ford convertible _ black with red trim
interior,'' he recalled. ``I couldn't stand to sit in class and see
that car sitting in the parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after leaving school, though, he was driving an olive
green ``deuce-and-a-half'' _ a 2.5 ton military truck. He earned a
high school equivalency diploma in the Army and served a tour in
Vietnam. After his discharge, he was working at a Jackson, Tenn.,
truck stop owned by his sister and brother-in-law when he was
struck by a yearning to drive a big truck down the road. Since
then, he has hauled cargo through 48 states _ all but Alaska and
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like driving any time,'' he declared. ``And it's great to
wake up in a different place every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was close to midnight when he backed his trailer up to a
loading dock at a warehouse in Duluth, Ga., filled out his log
book, and settled into the lower bunk to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Federal transportation law lets truckers drive for 10 straight
hours, but then forces them to take an eight-hour break before
starting again. Practically every minute is chronicled in the log
book, and the Qualcom system provides computerized documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Paychecks are determined by mileage. Long-distance drivers who
operate company trucks usually earn between 28 and 35 cents per
mile. Drivers who use their own rigs to haul company cargoes earn
more per mile, but also must pay for gas and upkeep of their
trucks. The average truck driver makes $35,000 a year, according to
the American Trucking Association.
</P>
<P>
   To keep their expenses down and maximize their mileage, drivers
usually sleep their eight hours in their truck cabs rather than in
motels. They park in truck-stop lots or roadside rest stops or, if
possible, at the destination of their cargo. Drivers typically stay
on the road for two-week stretches, finding out where to pick up
and deliver the next load only after dropping off the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   Around 8 a.m., Burks notified his dispatcher that the Duluth
cargo, huge spools of wire, had been unloaded. Shortly afterward, a
message popped up on the computer screen to pick up a loaded
trailer at the M.S. Carriers depot in Atlanta and drive it to
Orlando. After hash browns, eggs and sausage at a Waffle House, he
drove to the depot, where the empty trailer was replaced with a
full one. The Freightliner was soon headed south on I-75.
</P>
<P>
   Passing miles of piney woods and palmettos, Burks allowed that
the road can get lonely. For years, he called his wife and kids
every day that he was away.
</P>
<P>
   Separations from family ``are the main reasons that a lot of
drivers quit,'' he said. ``You can't sit home and make money in the
trucking business. It takes a good woman to put up with a trucker.
She has got to be it all _ plumber, carpenter, sometimes mama and
daddy. Most of them can't handle all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are increasingly more women behind the wheel,
more than 90 percent of long-distance drivers are male.
</P>
<P>
   Burks looks back fondly on an 18-month period when he drove his
own rig. ``I took my pretty wife with me on the road,'' he
recalled. ``We had a great time. But I didn't like spending my days
off working on my truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Now M.S. Carriers provides him with a new truck every couple of
years and maintains the vehicles. A new Freightliner costs $80,000
to $100,000, and the Memphis-based carrier has about 2,500 on the
road. A trailer costs another $20,000 or so. In addition to its own
rigs, M.S. Carriers contracts with 700 to 800 owner-operators.
There are a few bigger carriers, but not many.
</P>
<P>
   The trucking business is booming. The industry employs about 9
million people _ including 3 million drivers _ and there is a
national shortage of 80,000 drivers, according to the American
Trucking Association. About 82 percent of the nation's freight
revenue goes to trucking firms, and the business has grown by 20
percent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Burks faced an hourlong wait for a shower at the TA Truckstop
near the intersection of I-75 and the Florida Turnpike near
Wildwood, but wait he would. A day and a half had passed since he
had left his home in Humboldt, Tenn., and driven to company
headquarters in Memphis to begin this two-week run. It was time to
clean up and change clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The shower was free with a $50 fuel purchase or $6 without.
Truckers got a clean blue towel and matching washcloth and a key to
a private tiled bathroom with shower stall, lavatory and toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a wait in the evening'' as truckers fill the
parking lots for the night, explained Burks. ``The best time to get
a shower at a truck stop is early in the mornings.''
</P>
<P>
   But this day's drive has not yet ended. After the shower and a
supper of liver and onions, he was back behind the wheel _ heading
east on the Turnpike to Orlando. Time spent at truck stops doesn't
count against the 10-hour driving limit.
</P>
<P>
   Burks' CB handle is ``Double Trouble,'' but he listens more than
talks in the conversations that crackle over the airwaves. One
night, though, he talked to the driver of Dolly Parton's tour bus.
``He told me to look at his back window when he passed,'' Burks
said. ``There was ol' Dolly waving at me. Sometimes you'll see
country music singers and their crews eating in truck stops in the
middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the food and sassy waitresses that pull truckers _
and bands' tour buses _ to truck stops, but also the huge parking
lots and 24-hour services. It's hard to pull a big rig up to a
McDonald's drive-in window.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Orlando are nearly deserted as the Freightliner
arrives around 11 p.m. Burks follows the directions on his Qualcom
computer screen to find his destination warehouse. He backs up to a
loading dock, enters the time in his log book, and is quickly
asleep in the bunk. He is awakened at 6 a.m. by a banging on the
cab door. A warehouse supervisor told him to move to another bay to
be unloaded immediately. Wiping the sleep from his eyes, he
complied.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor pointed to a room with coffee and an adjoining
bathroom where drivers can wash their faces and brush their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Before 8 a.m., the trailer was empty and Burks sent the news to
his dispatcher. Minutes later came orders to pick up a load about
50 miles away and drive it to Greensboro, N.C. Often, Burks does
not know what he is hauling. A load is a load. And a driver can't
make money in a parked truck. Breakfast will come somewhere down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Hal T. Burks was rolling again.

 &HT;    STUDY FINDS DRIVERS, NOT TRUCKERS, MAKE MOST FATAL ROAD ERRORS

Washington and (a) national categories for release Sunday, March 7.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hal T. Burks eased his big Freightliner to the left lane of I-75
as a shiny red Ford pickup came barreling down an on-ramp near the
Georgia-Florida line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the law obligates trucks to move over and let them
on,'' complained Burks, who drives an 18-wheeler for M.S. Carriers.
``But sometimes I can't because there's traffic in the lane beside
me. Then a lot of times the four-wheeler will squeeze in right in
front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a recipe for tragedy. According to a Cox Newspapers
computer analysis of federal highway safety records, the most
common fatal accident involving a large truck and a car comes when
the car pulls in front of the truck and the larger vehicle can't
slow down in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we have 18 wheels with tread doesn't mean we can
stop on a dime,'' explained Burks.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths in car-truck crashes _ overwhelmingly of car drivers _
are on the rise, and the trucking industry's safety record is under
congressional scrutiny. But the Cox analysis found that police
investigators are three times more likely to cite car drivers for
driving errors that contributed to an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers suggest that the biggest opportunity to save lives
may be teaching car drivers how to stay safe around trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Cox examined 1997 data from the federal government's Fatal
Accident Reporting System (FARS) showing that in fatal crashes
involving cars and large trucks, the investigating police at the
accident scene cited the car drivers 2,381 times for deficiencies
such as ``failure to keep in proper lane,'' ``drowsiness'' or
``reckless driving.'' They cited truck drivers 679 times.
</P>
<P>
   In fatal crashes where drinking was a factor, the FARS data
show, 15 percent of the car drivers had an alcohol blood content
over the most common legal limit of .10 percent. By comparison,
fewer than 1 percent of the truck drivers had that much alcohol in
their systems.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing the same FARS data, the General Accounting
Office (GAO), the investigating arm of Congress, reached a similar
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Errors by car drivers were reported in 80 percent of the
crashes, while errors by truck drivers were reported in 28 percent
of the crashes,'' said Phyllis Scheinberg, the GAO's associate
director for transportation issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gordy Wright, a spokesman for Georgia State Patrol, said
statistics from his state tell the same story. Of 121 fatal wrecks
involving large trucks in Georgia in 1997, the car driver was cited
nearly two-thirds of the time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox analysis found that the most common fatal crash scenario
came when both truck and car were driving in the same direction
during daylight in good weather, and the truck hit the car either
at an angle or from the rear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anecdotally, that is what I would have said about the
situation even without the computer study,'' said Major Ken Howes,
a spokesman for Florida State Patrol. ``I've been on the highway
patrol for over 20 years, and the vast majority of truck drivers
I've come into contact with are professional, very careful drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you're driving an 80,000-pound rig down an interstate
highway and a car abruptly changes lanes in front of you and then
hits the brakes, you can't stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
cautions that the contributing driver factors cited by
investigating police ``can only be suggestive about why truck
crashes occur'' and ``cannot be used to determine causation or
fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The factors ``are based on the officer's judgment at the scene
of the accident _ his observations and discussions with
witnesses,'' said Dave Longo, a spokesman for the federal Office of
Motor Carriers (OMC). ``They are not an absolute causation
determination, because they are not made with the benefit of a more
thorough investigation and accident reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Highway safety advocates disparage the data in stronger terms.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are ``a bunch of malarkey,'' said Joan Claybrook,
director of CRASH, or Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways.
``It's become a canard _ heavily promoted by the trucking industry
_ that car drivers are responsible for most of these (fatal)
crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   The car drivers are usually killed, and when police arrive to
investigate, ``the only one talking is the truck driver,'' said
Claybrook. So the account of the accident is likely to be biased,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the same pattern of driver factors was found in a study
of crashes where both the truck driver and car driver survived, the
GAO's Scheinberg testified at a House hearing on truck safety last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Car driver errors were cited in 74 percent of the crashes,
compared to 35 percent for truck driver errors,'' she noted in
written testimony. ``This finding lends some support to the
hypothesis that, compared to truck drivers, car drivers contribute
more to fatal crashes between large trucks and cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Donaldson, senior research director for Advocates for
Highway and Auto Safety, argues that data from fatal crashes is not
comparable to data from non-fatal crashes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute on one statistic: Regardless of who caused
the accident, occupants of a car, van or sports utility vehicle are
much more likely to be killed in a crash with a big rig than is the
truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox analysis showed that of the 5,355 people who died in
crashes involving a large truck in 1997, about 87 percent were
occupants of the passenger vehicles. The death toll, up 213 from
the previous year, marks a continuing slow increase.
</P>
<P>
   After the toll reached 5,679 in 1988, it fell to 4,462 in 1992,
only to begin climbing again as traffic increased.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, car drivers were four times more likely to die in these
crashes than were the truck drivers _ 2,613 car drivers compared to
646 truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in deaths has spurred demands from highway safety
advocates for more federal inspections and regulation of trucking.
Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., has charged that the agency responsible for
enforcing truck safety _ the Office of Motor Carriers _ has not
done its job and should be moved from the Department of
Transportation to the independent NHTSA.
</P>
<P>
   But Donaldson also agreed that the danger to car passengers in
truck accidents needs to be hammered home by the trucking industry
and government licensing agencies. A public education campaign
should be waged to inform car drivers ``that their chances of
survival are extremely remote'' in a crash with a big rig, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burks agreed that if the drivers of ``four-wheelers'' realized
how likely they are to be killed or injured if hit by a truck, they
wouldn't try to squeeze in front of a big rig trying to maintain a
safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to continue to educate drivers on sharing the road,''
said Walter McCormick, president of the American Trucking
Associations (ATA), the group that represents many of the major
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The ATA and the U.S. Department of Transportation have begun a
``No Zone'' campaign to publicize the areas surrounding a moving
truck where motorists are in danger. The safety advocates say the
effort is ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Driving down I-75, Burks pointed to the mirrors outside his cab
windows and protruding from both sides of his hood. ``If the
mirrors are properly adjusted,'' he said, ``the only truly blind
spot on a truck is directly in the rear.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even a window in the bottom of the passenger door on
his truck so he can see cars directly on his right.
</P>
<P>
   The trucking industry contends that it is being unfairly
maligned in the safety debate.
</P>
<P>
   As the total truck mileage on the nation's highways has risen 77
percent since 1980, the fatal crash rate per 100 million miles
traveled has been cut in half, McCormick told Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than moving the Office of Motor Carriers, McCormick
testified, the trucking industry would support setting up a
separate federal agency to oversee its operations, with a
relationship like the Federal Aviation Administration has with
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   From the cab of his Freightliner, Burks dismisses the debate as
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Having driven 2.8 million miles without an accident, the
51-year-old driver takes safety seriously. Burks is a 1997
America's Road Team Captain _ selected by the trucking industry as
one of its safest drivers. He insists that both the government and
the industry have taken steps to ensure that commercial truckers
are safer than the average motorist on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Burks points out that truck drivers are required to earn a
federal Commercial Driver's License with more rigorous requirements
than the licenses held by most motorists. Federal law also requires
truck drivers to stop and rest for at least eight hours after
driving for 10 hours, and to record their periods of driving and
rest in a log book.
</P>
<P>
   Burks' employer, M.S. Carriers of Memphis, Tenn., is one of the
largest companies in the business. Like many of its peers, the
company invests heavily in safety equipment and training.
</P>
<P>
   On the dashboard of Burks' Freightliner is a computer connected
to a satellite positioning system that allows his dispatcher to
track him anywhere on the continent. This Qualcom system provides a
wealth of information _ the truck's speed, fuel consumption, idling
time, and rest periods. This data eliminates the possibility of a
driver cheating on the written log book.
</P>
<P>
   A Qualcom spokesman said about 230,000 long-distance, irregular
run drivers like Burks have satellite tracking systems tying their
trucks to dispatchers in the United States. Similar communications
systems such as cellular are also increasing in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The system ``can even show when a driver might be tailgating''
because it records how many times and how hard he hits the brakes,
said Burks.
</P>
<P>
   The 430-horsepower engine of Burks' truck also has a governor
that limits his speed to a maximum 65 mph.
</P>
<P>
   When he is not on the road, Burks is an instructor at the M.S.
Carriers driving and safety academy in Memphis. New drivers undergo
four weeks of schooling before going out on the road with a veteran
driver as a trainee.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of driving without an accident, M.S. Carriers
gives its drivers a ring with a blue stone in the middle. For the
next four years without an accident, a small diamond is added in
each corner. After 10 years, a big diamond goes in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appraises at about $3,500,'' said Burks, showing the ring
to a rider.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks to high school drivers education classes and other
groups to convey the trucker's viewpoint on to regular motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to share the highway,'' he explains.

 &HT;    A TRUCKER'S LIFE: DOWN THE ROAD WITH HAL T. BURKS
 &HT;    Repeating a story first moved Tuesday, Feb. 23 in (a) national
and (l) lifestyle categories for release Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD _ Daylight was fading over the tranquil Mississippi
pastures as Hal T. Burks steered his 18-wheeler down Highway 78
toward Tupelo and reflected on the two great loves of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pretty wife's name was Demetra,'' he said. ``One time early
in our marriage, I had just gotten home from two weeks on the road
when the doorbell rang and she got a delivery of roses. There was a
card that said 'To Demetra With Love,' but no signature.''
</P>
<P>
   After some chit-chat about other matters, his wife asked flat
out if he wasn't curious about who sent the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'No. Should I be?' Well, she thought I ought to,''
Burks recalled. ``She had sent them to herself to make me jealous.
We laughed about those roses for years. That was the only time she
ever tried to get me to quit driving. She knew how much I loved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal T. and Demetra had been married for 24 years and had reared
three children to adulthood before she died in 1997 of
complications from a liver disease. ``I'd been planning to retire
when I was 55 to be with her,'' said the 51-year-old long-haul
driver. ``Now I'll just keep on trucking.''
</P>
<P>
   Many motorists _ ``four-wheelers'' in the lingo of citizens'
band radio _ wonder about the nation's 3.75 million commercial
truck drivers like Burks. Romanticized in songs like ``Six Days on
the Road'' and ``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses,'' they are
often portrayed as cowboys of the interstates. But safety activists
sometimes depict them as tattooed death on wheels _ fatigued or
drugged-out renegades riding 80,000 pounds of speeding jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   For a reporter riding with Burks through five Southern states,
though, the stereotypes vaporize like the exhaust from his white
Freightliner. He drinks more bottled water than coffee, for
instance, and listens to books on tape as much as to country music
radio and CB gab. As for recreation on the road, ``give me more
than a 12-hour break and I'll find a golf course,'' Burks said.
</P>
<P>
   From his M.S. Carriers headquarters in Memphis to truck stops
across America, folks call him ``Hal T.'' His truck has his name on
the door, 10 forward gears, a 430-horsepower engine and a roomy cab
with a refrigerator and bunk beds. It gets about six miles to the
gallon of diesel fuel. There's also a company-installed engine
governor that restricts his speed to a maximum 65 miles per hour
and a Qualcom satellite hookup that lets his dispatcher track him _
within 20 feet _ anywhere on the continent. The system permits
instantaneous two-way communications through a computer on his
dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   Burks is hardly a typical trucker. Over the past two decades or
so, he has driven 2.8 million miles _ that's nearly six trips to
the moon and back _ without having an accident. In 1997, the
American Trucking Association, which represents most of the major
carriers, selected him as an America's Road Team Captain. These
dozen drivers are picked because of their performance test scores,
safety record and flair for public relations. They represent the
trucking industry for 18 months, and then a new team is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Driving east on I-20 through the Alabama night, Hal T. Burks
shifted gears and spun his stories.
</P>
<P>
   The ``T.'' stands for Travis. He was one of 14 children born in
a farm family outside Memphis. ``I never heard my parents argue,''
he marveled. Whenever there were differences, ``they'd go park by a
cornfield and have what Mama called 'loud reasoning'.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his schoolmates was the sister of singer Jerry Lee Lewis,
and he regularly visited the Killer's Memphis home during his
boyhood. Burks dropped out of high school in the 12th grade. ``My
downfall was my '59 Ford convertible _ black with red trim
interior,'' he recalled. ``I couldn't stand to sit in class and see
that car sitting in the parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after leaving school, though, he was driving an olive
green ``deuce-and-a-half'' _ a 2.5 ton military truck. He earned a
high school equivalency diploma in the Army and served a tour in
Vietnam. After his discharge, he was working at a Jackson, Tenn.,
truck stop owned by his sister and brother-in-law when he was
struck by a yearning to drive a big truck down the road. Since
then, he has hauled cargo through 48 states _ all but Alaska and
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like driving any time,'' he declared. ``And it's great to
wake up in a different place every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was close to midnight when he backed his trailer up to a
loading dock at a warehouse in Duluth, Ga., filled out his log
book, and settled into the lower bunk to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Federal transportation law lets truckers drive for 10 straight
hours, but then forces them to take an eight-hour break before
starting again. Practically every minute is chronicled in the log
book, and the Qualcom system provides computerized documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Paychecks are determined by mileage. Long-distance drivers who
operate company trucks usually earn between 28 and 35 cents per
mile. Drivers who use their own rigs to haul company cargoes earn
more per mile, but also must pay for gas and upkeep of their
trucks. The average truck driver makes $35,000 a year, according to
the American Trucking Association.
</P>
<P>
   To keep their expenses down and maximize their mileage, drivers
usually sleep their eight hours in their truck cabs rather than in
motels. They park in truck-stop lots or roadside rest stops or, if
possible, at the destination of their cargo. Drivers typically stay
on the road for two-week stretches, finding out where to pick up
and deliver the next load only after dropping off the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   Around 8 a.m., Burks notified his dispatcher that the Duluth
cargo, huge spools of wire, had been unloaded. Shortly afterward, a
message popped up on the computer screen to pick up a loaded
trailer at the M.S. Carriers depot in Atlanta and drive it to
Orlando. After hash browns, eggs and sausage at a Waffle House, he
drove to the depot, where the empty trailer was replaced with a
full one. The Freightliner was soon headed south on I-75.
</P>
<P>
   Passing miles of piney woods and palmettos, Burks allowed that
the road can get lonely. For years, he called his wife and kids
every day that he was away.
</P>
<P>
   Separations from family ``are the main reasons that a lot of
drivers quit,'' he said. ``You can't sit home and make money in the
trucking business. It takes a good woman to put up with a trucker.
She has got to be it all _ plumber, carpenter, sometimes mama and
daddy. Most of them can't handle all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are increasingly more women behind the wheel,
more than 90 percent of long-distance drivers are male.
</P>
<P>
   Burks looks back fondly on an 18-month period when he drove his
own rig. ``I took my pretty wife with me on the road,'' he
recalled. ``We had a great time. But I didn't like spending my days
off working on my truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Now M.S. Carriers provides him with a new truck every couple of
years and maintains the vehicles. A new Freightliner costs $80,000
to $100,000, and the Memphis-based carrier has about 2,500 on the
road. A trailer costs another $20,000 or so. In addition to its own
rigs, M.S. Carriers contracts with 700 to 800 owner-operators.
There are a few bigger carriers, but not many.
</P>
<P>
   The trucking business is booming. The industry employs about 9
million people _ including 3 million drivers _ and there is a
national shortage of 80,000 drivers, according to the American
Trucking Association. About 82 percent of the nation's freight
revenue goes to trucking firms, and the business has grown by 20
percent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Burks faced an hourlong wait for a shower at the TA Truckstop
near the intersection of I-75 and the Florida Turnpike near
Wildwood, but wait he would. A day and a half had passed since he
had left his home in Humboldt, Tenn., and driven to company
headquarters in Memphis to begin this two-week run. It was time to
clean up and change clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The shower was free with a $50 fuel purchase or $6 without.
Truckers got a clean blue towel and matching washcloth and a key to
a private tiled bathroom with shower stall, lavatory and toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a wait in the evening'' as truckers fill the
parking lots for the night, explained Burks. ``The best time to get
a shower at a truck stop is early in the mornings.''
</P>
<P>
   But this day's drive has not yet ended. After the shower and a
supper of liver and onions, he was back behind the wheel _ heading
east on the Turnpike to Orlando. Time spent at truck stops doesn't
count against the 10-hour driving limit.

   Burks' CB handle is ``Double Trouble,'' but he listens more than
talks in the conversations that crackle over the airwaves. One
night, though, he talked to the driver of Dolly Parton's tour bus.
``He told me to look at his back window when he passed,'' Burks
said. ``There was ol' Dolly waving at me. Sometimes you'll see
country music singers and their crews eating in truck stops in the
middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the food and sassy waitresses that pull truckers _
and bands' tour buses _ to truck stops, but also the huge parking
lots and 24-hour services. It's hard to pull a big rig up to a
McDonald's drive-in window.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Orlando are nearly deserted as the Freightliner
arrives around 11 p.m. Burks follows the directions on his Qualcom
computer screen to find his destination warehouse. He backs up to a
loading dock, enters the time in his log book, and is quickly
asleep in the bunk. He is awakened at 6 a.m. by a banging on the
cab door. A warehouse supervisor told him to move to another bay to
be unloaded immediately. Wiping the sleep from his eyes, he
complied.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor pointed to a room with coffee and an adjoining
bathroom where drivers can wash their faces and brush their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Before 8 a.m., the trailer was empty and Burks sent the news to
his dispatcher. Minutes later came orders to pick up a load about
50 miles away and drive it to Greensboro, N.C. Often, Burks does
not know what he is hauling. A load is a load. And a driver can't
make money in a parked truck. Breakfast will come somewhere down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Hal T. Burks was rolling again.

MEDIATION EASES PAIN OF DIVORCE FOR INCREASING NUMBERS OF TEXAS
COUPLES

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Who gets the kids and the house?
</P>
<P>
   What about the pots and pans, retirement plans and stock
options?
</P>
<P>
   A young woman without children once complained that after 10
years of marriage, the biggest dispute in her divorce was over how
to divide up all the baseball cards she and her husband had
collected over the years.
</P>
<P>
   And for that they needed one tough umpire _ or, in this case,
mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Mediation, also known as ``alternative dispute resolution'' or
``assisted negotiation,'' involves communication and compromise
among warring parties, and it's gradually changing the
rough-and-tumble nature of traditional Texas-style divorce. It
makes for a kinder, gentler, more civilized and speedier divorce
than slugging it out in front of a judge and jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mediation is the single most significant change in family law
in the last 25 years,'' says Ike Vanden Eykel, a high-profile
Dallas divorce lawyer and author of ``Successful Lone Star Divorce:
How to Cope with a Family Breakup in Texas'' (PRO Solutions,
$16.95).
</P>
<P>
   Texas has the most progressive and intense use of mediation in
the country, with most family court judges ordering mandatory
mediation in all divorce cases in which there are any areas of
disagreement, Vanden Eykel says.
</P>
<P>
   These days you almost have to get mediation to get a divorce in
the Fort Worth-Dallas area, says Larry Upshaw, editor of Vanden
Eykel's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``This four-county area is a hotbed of mediation,'' the Dallas
attorney agrees. ``We've been doing it longer, and we have judges
who aggressively advocate it because it works, but it's gaining in
favor all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were 9,808 divorces and 10,123 other family law
matters filed in the five family law courts in Tarrant County (Fort
Worth). Of the 9,808 new divorces filed, 7,300 of them were decided
by default or agreed judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Although no record is available on how many of the cases
involved mediators working quietly behind the scene, most agreed
judgments do involve mediation.
</P>
<P>
   The swing away from long and costly trials has been prompted by
overcrowded court dockets and the realization that making divorce a
long, drawn-out, adversarial process is not in the best interest of
children.
</P>
<P>
   Slugging it out over child custody and visitation, closely held
businesses, jewelry, toasters and baseball cards can get very
expensive in terms of time, lawyers' fees and mental health.
</P>
<P>
   A big advantage of mediation is that consumers have a direct
hand in the resolution of their cases, says Tarrant County District
Judge Frank Sullivan, who almost always requires mediation in
contended divorce cases and says that every family court in the
county has cases set up for the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for everybody,'' Sullivan says. ``It saves time, and
people come out of mediation feeling like they had some control
over the settlement of their cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediators most often are appointed by the court, usually with
agreement by the lawyers for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Those mediators come in several varieties. Professional private
mediators, many of whom are lawyers, eliminate the need for a jury
trial about 90 percent of the time. The cost varies from a flat
$250 per party to $250 per hour, with the average case totaling
$500 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   With volunteer mediators, many of them retired attorneys or
nonlawyers trained by Dispute Resolution Services of Tarrant
County, the settlement rate is 65 percent to 70 percent _ still
very high considering that the cases would not have gotten to
mediation if there were not some major bone of contention on which
the parties disagreed. These mediators charge a flat $25 fee if the
case is filed in Tarrant County or involves county residents, and
$125 per party for noncounty residents. The fee is waived for
residents who cannot pay. Primary funding comes from $10 taken out
of every county lawsuit filing fee.
</P>
<P>
   Dispute Resolution Services was set up 15 years ago under a
contract with the county. The social-service agency provides
mediation services in about 110 civil cases each month _ about 60
percent of which are divorces and child custody cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We save people time, money and relationships,'' says Marcia
Kazarian, program development coordinator for the private,
nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people don't know about mediation options until
after a divorce decree has been filed, Kazarian says, a savvy few
seek out Dispute Resolution Services first. When they reach
agreement on the terms of the divorce, they take it to an attorney
who drafts the decree and files it at great cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make decisions about what's fair,'' Kazarian
explains. ``We encourage the parties to consider all their options
and consider the cost of different choices, but we make no specific
recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   Total confidentiality and neutrality are the cornerstones of the
mediation process, Sullivan says. ``When mediation fails, people
still have the courts available. When a case comes back to us, we
don't even want to know why. For this to work, the parties involved
need to be sure that nothing they say or do in mediation will be
held against them in court.''
</P>
<P>
   James Handy, a board-certified family lawyer who also does
mediation, says the process takes a lot of the adversarial aspects
out of family law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explain the law to people and help them understand why their
position may not be a very strong position with the court, and I
offer ideas that both sides involved can live with and the court is
likely to approve.''
</P>
<P>
   Handy says mediation, in which clients can speak their minds
without regard to court rules of protocol, is almost like therapy
for his clients. ``People can vent their feelings and
frustrations,'' he explains. ``We are attorneys and counselors at
law, and the counseling aspect becomes very important. You don't
have the adversarial role that you do when you are the attorney
representing one side.''

   Some might consider it unladylike, but the Baroness Philippine
de Rothschild does it. I know that May-Elaine de Lencquesaing does
it because I've done it with her. And Serena Sutcliffe partakes all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   What is it they do? Why, they spit. Baroness Rothschild and Mrs.
de Lencquesaing own famous Bordeaux chateaus, Mouton Rothschild and
Pichon-Lalande. Ms. Sutcliffe is senior director of the
international wine department at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Tasting wine is central to these women's lives, and no one can
taste wine professionally without spitting out much of it.
</P>
<P>
   The term wine tasting has come to mean a social event at which
wine is served rather than cocktails. A professional wine tasting
is another matter entirely. It is hard work.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious tasting is done by professional wine buyers,
who prowl through damp, cold cellars of winemakers, sampling raw
young wines and trying to decide which ones will become great in
another 5 or 10 years. Given wine prices, fortunes can ride on a
taster's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Spitting is essential to the buyers' work, and the wine cellar
floor is a perfectly acceptable target. No, don't call for the
health police: in a good winery, the floor is hosed down several
times a day.
</P>
<P>
   For a few years, I was part of the wine-judging team at the Los
Angeles County Fair. The team met several months before the fair to
work through hundreds of wines submitted by California growers and
winnow down the field.
</P>
<P>
   It was not unusual for the red wine panel to assemble at 7:30
a.m. to taste 100 cabernet sauvignons, rest for 30 minutes, then
move on to 95 zinfandels. After lunch, the panel might judge 35 or
40 merlots. This would go on for three days.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking all these wines probably would have been fatal. We spit
to survive _ into our own individual bucket, of course _ and to be
able to form clear opinions about all the wines, not just the first
half dozen in each group.
</P>
<P>
   In his Complete Guide to Wine Tasting and Wine Cellars, (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 1984), Michael Broadbent, wine director of Christie's
auction house, wrote: ``It is nothing short of ridiculous to drink
one's way through a tasting. How can the last few wines yield more
than a hazy impression? To taste critically is one thing; to enjoy
wines with a meal is another.''
</P>
<P>
   The temptation to swallow is strong: it is what people do when
they eat or drink. But if all ``tasting'' was done in just the
mouth, anyone swallowing a bit of wine would immediately get all
the sensations it has to offer. In fact, the nerves that can sense
more than sweet, sour, salt and bitter are deep in the brain and
depend much more on aroma.
</P>
<P>
   In his World Atlas of Wine (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1994), Hugh
Johnson wrote: ``The real organ of discrimination is in the upper
nasal cavity and the only sensations that can reach it are the
vapors of volatile substances.'' Which means, simply, that with
complex substances like wine, critical judgments depend more on
smell than taste.
</P>
<P>
   A good friend, a wine professional, could drink no alcohol for a
year because of illness. Nevertheless, he attended tastings but
only smelled the wines. After he recuperated, he said he thought
his judgment of wines had been more accurate during that period
than before.
</P>
<P>
   Serious tasters smell a group of wines several times before
actually tasting them, and only rarely does tasting change their
opinions. And that's the secret to getting through an important
tasting in which the quality of the wines can range from superb to
execrable. Plenty of wines need not be tasted at all: they can be
eliminated by smell alone.
</P>
<P>
   Proust's memory may have been triggered by the taste of a
madeleine, but many would agree that aromas stir memories more
rapidly and vividly than any other sensation. An experienced wine
taster will derive almost as much pleasure from the memories of
other wines as from drinking the wine at hand.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon at lunch in Bordeaux, with a few bottles on the
table, I listened to several veterans of the wine trade reminisce
about memorable bottles from years gone by, and of great wines they
had sadly misjudged.
</P>
<P>
   But wine is, after all, a drink, and where fine wine is
concerned, tasting does add several important dimensions. Texture,
intensity and richness are qualities in a wine best defined by
tasting. Is the wine rough on the palate or velvety? Do the flavors
linger long in the mouth? Only tasting will tell.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that a lot of wine doesn't need to be tasted
seriously. Good, simple wines are just that, and searching for
subtleties they don't possess is a waste of time. Great wines, on
the other hand, are a cerebral pleasure as much as a physical one
and they warrant serious study.
</P>
<P>
   Once, at a tasting of Argentine wines at the consulate in New
York, Argentina's Consul General at the time, Rafael Vasquez,
watched the intense sipping, sniffing and spitting and asked me,
``Do you like tastings?'' I replied, ``Some.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer drinkings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   We all do. But tastings, serious tastings, are important. They
can teach us how and what to drink. As long as we don't swallow too
much.

 By THOMAS MALLON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When William Rehnquist, the chief justice of the United States,
gaveled the Clinton scandal into history on Feb. 12, those with a
curatorial bent began wondering what will happen to the objects of
the president's affection _ the artifacts that may testify to Bill
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky long after both of them
are gone.
 &HT;    Whither the gifts _ the hatpin, ``Leaves of Grass,'' the Black
Dog T-shirt _ and, yes, the Dress? What provisions are being made
for their perpetuation in the curious gallery of anti-relics by
which presidential scandals and fiascoes live on in glass cases and
the public imagination?
 &HT;    ``It's tough to say what's going to happen to the dress,''
admits Steven Tilley, who for the past two decades has worked with
the holdings at the National Archives that relate to the Kennedy
assassination, Watergate and the various independent-counsel
investigations that followed.
 &HT;    The dress may yet, of course, figure in criminal proceedings
against the president, but eventually, Tilley said, ``we would
assume we'd get it. If we do, then we're going to retain it as a
piece of evidence from this very, very visible and highly
interesting investigation.''
 &HT;    A spokeswoman for the office of the independent counsel says
that ``normally'' such subpoenaed items go ``back to the rightful
owner,'' but adds that the disposition of Monica miscellanea has
not been settled. ``Legal research is being done right now,'' she
says, referring to all the materials held by the various
independent counsels.
 &HT;    Tilley adds that, so far, discussions between the archives and
Ken Starr's operation have involved only documents, not wearables,
and not the book of Whitman poems that Monica called the most
sentimental'' of the president's presents.
 &HT;    If Congress, as many expect, refuses to renew the Independent
Counsel Act, civil libertarians may cheer, but some historians are
likely to sigh with regret. Since Watergate _ our first fully
curated presidential scandal _ special prosecutions have assured
the survival of a whole Grand Guignol of historic illegality.
 &HT;    The archives, for instance, preserves much of the paraphernalia
used by the 1972 Watergate burglars and in the cover-up that
followed: Bernard Barker's address book, Chap Stick tubes with
hidden microphones and all the office equipment involved in what
Tilley calls ``the Rose Mary stretch,'' the gymnastic explanation
offered by Rose Mary Woods, President Nixon's secretary, of how she
erased 18 minutes of tape.
 &HT;    Advances in office technology yielded the archives some computer
hard-drives from Oliver North's offices at the National Security
Council. Tilley says that the Nixon and Reagan libraries have never
requested the loan of any Watergate or Iran-contra items for use in
an exhibit on either subject. But a number of presidential
librarians point out that these institutions balance their
scholarly and memorial aspects with more candor than one might
suspect.
 &HT;    The Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., has just
acquired the staircase that led toward the evacuation helicopters
taking off from the American Embassy in Saigon. Richard Norton
Smith, the museum's director, admits that while Ford was pleased to
get the object, some of the institution's trustees did not want to
own something so associated with, if not scandal, then at least
national humiliation.
 &HT;    Harry Middleton, director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library
in Austin, recalls how LBJ, not too long before his death, judged
some antiwar citizen mail being marked for a Vietnam display not
nearly ``mean enough.''
 &HT;    He urged the librarians to substitute more evocatively abusive
items, including one postcard that read: ``I demand that you as a
gutless son of a bitch resign as President of the U.S.'' Middleton
says he has ``tried very, very hard'' to find the infamous stuffed
ballot box that may have helped send ``Landslide Lyndon'' to the
Senate in 1948.
 &HT;    Because Judith Campbell's name appears on handwritten logs of
both telephone calls and appearances at the White House visitors
gate, the John F. Kennedy Library could not eliminate this
presidential girlfriend from the historical record. Before the
existence of government-run libraries (there are none prior to
Herbert Hoover's), it was easier to clean up after the chief
executive.
 &HT;    The biographer Carl Sferrazza Anthony points out that after
Warren G. Harding's sudden death in 1923, the president's
secretary, George Christian, probably destroyed photographs of the
president's mistress and illegitimate daughter, which Harding kept
in his Oval Office desk.
 &HT;    Materials from the Clinton trial will remain the property of the
Senate that conducted it. The curved tables at which the House
managers and White House lawyers sat have been marked, so that
their historical function will not be forgotten after the furniture
is moved and used elsewhere.
 &HT;    The deposition videotapes will go to the archives, along with
one of the misprinted pens _ Untied States Senator, says the barrel
_ used by the legislators to sign their oath as jurors. The object
may eventually join a handful of highly select materials in the
sliding metal drawers of the Archives' legislative division, which
includes the now-much-discussed censure of Andrew Jackson and its
later repeal.
 &HT;    The depth of feeling in Jackson's day is simply not graspable
without looking at his censure: the angrily literal expunction is
written right across the offending language in the original
document. The tally sheet for Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial,
during which Sen. Edmund G. Ross displayed his profile in courage
by casting the deciding vote for acquittal, rests in another
drawer.
 &HT;    (Lest all this seem excessively majestic, the archivists direct
a visitor's notice to a different sort of item carefully wrapped in
plastic: the first issue of Mad magazine, hauled before a 1950s
Senate subcommittee investigating juvenile delinquency.)
 &HT;    Skip Rutherford, local planning coordinator for the Clinton
Presidential Library in Little Rock, Ark., concedes that this
future facility will have to address the events that led to
impeachment. If it were up to Rutherford personally, neither the
gifts nor the dress would be exhibited, but all such decisions will
be made by professionals at some later time. ``We don't even have
an architect on board yet,'' he says.
 &HT;    The dress may be an extreme example of memorabilia, but the
impulse to preserve it is still more healthy than prurient. For one
thing, its existence determined the entire course of the scandal.
 &HT;    More important, in an age of virtual reality (even virtual,
videotaped witnesses), it remains grotesquely real, almost
literally alive with its stain of presidential DNA. It is a messy,
assertive fact that no amount of photography and digitalization
could hope to replicate. And it is the same with the gifts.
 &HT;    No matter how cheap or goofy or exquisite, they evoke the
connection between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky far more
compellingly than, say, the computerized records of hush money
might have. The Black Dog T-shirt is not an object to inspire much
awe or heartbreak _ like, say, the string with which Lincoln
repaired his own spectacles, preserved in a box at the Library of
Congress _ but like it or not, it too now belongs to the ages.

 By JAMES TRAUB  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Republicans in the House of Representatives are looking to their
new speaker, Dennis Hastert, with a yearning that appears
suspiciously like desperation. Few of them even pretend that they
consider Hastert a forceful leader.
 &HT;    As one leadership aide put it recently, and bluntly, ``What
people like about Denny is that he's not going to do something
stupid.''
 &HT;    Hastert is a modest, amiable soul who is fond of recalling his
past career as a high-school wrestling coach. When party leaders
came to Hastert in December to tell him that he needed to fill the
breach created by the stunningly unexpected resignation of Robert
Livingston, the speaker-designate, Hastert, according to one
Midwestern congressman, ``wasn't sure he could do it, he wasn't
sure he wanted to do it, and he was scared.''
 &HT;    What Hastert's colleagues are hoping is that the new Speaker
will somehow save them from themselves, as if his bulky frame were
a rampart standing between the G.O.P. and the cliff it seems
disposed to race off. Hastert's real virtue is that he is not his
predecessor, Newt Gingrich, for the retrospective view inside the
party is that Gingrich is at the heart of practically everything
that anyone thinks went wrong in the last few years.
 &HT;    Talk to Republican House members, as I spent the past few weeks
doing, and you'll hear that Gingrich was too obsessed with
destroying the president, failed to remind the public of the
party's accomplishments, caved to the Christian right and caved to
the Clinton left. You would think that Gingrich was a virus alien
to the party, rather than the party's leader and visionary for most
of the decade.
 &HT;    Hastert, the not-Newt, was trotted out for celebration at a
closed-to-the-press party-leadership retreat in Williamsburg, Va.,
earlier this month. The retreat began with a sobering presentation
from pollsters: Current numbers, they explained, show that voters
trust the Democrats more than the Republicans on almost all major
issues, including taxes, an issue on which the GOP has
traditionally been favored by a significant margin.
 &HT;    After dinner on the first night, Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, the
new head of the National Republican Congressional Committee,
screened a video made up of clips of gloating Democrats, designed
to fire members with horror at the prospect of a Democratic
takeover of the House _ which is precisely what would happen were
an election held today, according to pollsters.
 &HT;    Hastert didn't speak until the following morning, when he got up
and more or less said, according to a summary provided by one
attendee, ``We need to work together, he's the coach, he wants to
put other people in the spotlight.''
 &HT;    It was a pep talk, and not a particularly memorable one, and it
lasted no more than 10 minutes. Then the group talked about issues
and heard a presentation from executives of a marketing firm, who
explained that in order to promote a winning message, the GOP
needed to empathize with voters, tone down the ideological content,
personalize and simplify. So yes, there had been a problem _ but
with the marketing, not the message.
 &HT;    ``The message needs to be delivered by people who are upbeat,
who are connectors with folks out there, who can relate everything
we're doing to people's everyday lives,'' Jennifer Dunn, a
congresswoman from Washington who is herself an important element
of the Republicans' new look, told me a few days after the retreat.
 &HT;    Or as Rep. Joe Scarborough of Florida put it, with perhaps a
trace of irony, ``Denny is this year's model.''
 &HT;    As the congressional Republicans head out into battle with the
ordeal of impeachment finally behind them, they hope to win back
the public with a kinder, gentler face. It should become clear soon
enough whether the problem really was Newt, and whether the answer
is Denny.
 &HT;    An alternative theory constitutes the nightmare underneath the
professions of optimism and bonhomie _ that the House Republicans
have actually lost touch with ordinary Americans, or rather are
captive to a base that is itself out of touch with ordinary
Americans, as the Democrats were 15 or so years ago.
 &HT;    Michael Forbes, the Long Island congressman who publicly
agonized over impeachment before voting with his party, said to me,
``If we keep defining the party by the extreme right, not only will
you see Republicans leaving the party, but you will also see a
permanent Republican minority where we will lose the White House,
we will lose the House and we will lose the Senate.'' And then
Forbes added, ``I have great hopes in the ascension of Denny
Hastert.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Among the congressional Republicans there is no bafflement like
the bafflement over the failure of the American people to rally to
the cause of impeachment.
 &HT;    John Doolittle, a California congressman who has both his car
and his office desk festooned with bumper stickers that read,
``Impeach Clinton for the Children,'' said: ``I feel good about
impeaching the president, and I would happily do it tomorrow. How
the rest of the country can not feel good about it is truly beyond
me.''
 &HT;    Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster, advances the almost
metaphysical argument that ordinary citizens, unlike congressional
Republicans, simply can not own up to their own true feelings on
the subject.
 &HT;    ``People don't want to admit that the man they voted for
president is so deeply flawed because that says something about
themselves,'' Luntz said.
 &HT;    A number of moderate Republicans pointed out that many of their
party brethren loathe the president so passionately that they
simply cannot conceive that people of good will could feel
otherwise. Given their own scorn, they cannot admit that most
Americans disagree with them without feeling contempt for the
people themselves, an emotion very few politicians permit
themselves to express.
 &HT;    Tom DeLay, the Republican majority whip and the leader of the
party's Clinton-hating faction, insisted in a speech before the
House that impeachment was a matter of ``relativism vs. absolute
truth.'' Given the choice, Americans, it turned out, preferred a
tolerant and forgiving relativism.
 &HT;    Some version of this understanding has now in fact become patent
to many Republicans. Vin Weber, a former congressman and Reagan-era
optimist who along with Gingrich proclaimed the coming of a new
``conservative opportunity society,'' said, ``The image that our
party is defined by a hectoring moralism is as dangerous to us as
it is on the left if they're defined by a pandering
permissiveness.''
 &HT;    But it's also true that impeachment did not provoke a new tone
of hectoring moralism from an essentially secular party; it brought
to the fore passions that have been bubbling at least since the
``revolution'' of 1994 and perhaps since the election of Clinton
two years before.
 &HT;    Gingrich stoked those passions and was finally, in the classic
revolutionary denouement, consumed by them. The speaker staved off
a coup from the right in the summer of 1997 and then was ousted
after last year's election. And on his way out, like a Jacobin
railing at the Terror as he's led to the tumbrels, Gingrich warned
darkly of the party's ``perfectionist caucus.''
 &HT;    This is the kind of epithet that may stick to the House
Republicans. Gingrich's lament suggests a very different
explanation for the Republicans' grave problems.
 &HT;    I heard such a theory from Peter King, the Nassau County
Republican who became a hero to Democrats everywhere by his
unwavering, and very public, opposition to the impeachment of
President Clinton. King has been held in fairly low regard inside
his own party since he made himself into a sort of celebrity
martyr, boasting of his victimization by party leaders and almost
flaunting his subsequent marginalization inside the GOP.
 &HT;    At the same time, as King told me, he has a perfect voting
record with the Christian Coalition. ``I am not a moderate,'' he
said flatly.
 &HT;    King doesn't see the party's problems precisely in ideological
terms. In the '80s, he explained, the party's base was not Sunbelt
evangelicals but Reagan Democrats. ``They weren't Holy Roller
types, but they wanted to have some semblance of decency, they
wanted to reward hard work.''
 &HT;    Today, King went on to say, those Reagan Democrats are ``looking
for someone like Reagan, but what they're seeing are these really
harsh, unrelenting, unforgiving, avenging-angel types _ that scares
them off. And as I look around the House of Representatives, there
are very few people who would be comfortable with Ronald Reagan in
terms of their attitudes _ the Democrats are the enemy, Bill
Clinton is evil, politics is evil.''
 &HT;    And yet Republican governors around the country, including
George Pataki, George W. Bush, Tommy Thompson and Christine
Whitman, have gained enormous popularity by emphasizing effective
government over moral or ideological campaigns. You won't see many
of these governors mounting the barricades on issues like
immigration or affirmative action, not to mention partial-birth
abortion.
 &HT;    Gingrich may have instituted the style and the rhetoric of total
war, but it is now a deep-seated reflex among the House
Republicans. It was, after all, Dick Armey, the Republican majority
leader, who said of Hillary Clinton, ``All her friends are
Marxists,'' and who referred to Barney Frank, the openly gay
Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, as ``Barney Fag.''
 &HT;    DeLay, the House whip, has compared the Environmental Protection
Agency to the Gestapo. DeLay has replaced Gingrich as the most
powerful figure in the House as well as the Democrats' extremist of
choice. He is a small businessman _ an exterminator, more precisely
and deliciously _ who represents the new middle-class suburbs that
have grown up outside of Houston, an area very similar
demographically to Gingrich's DeKalb County and also largely devoid
of the yeasty ethnic mix that, King would say, lent a certain
realism and restraint to the Reagan Democrats.
 &HT;    In recent years, DeLay has developed strong ties to the
Christian right. Both he and Armey are among the few congressional
members of the Council for National Policy, an organization of
right-wing political and religious leaders.
 &HT;    Randy Tate, the head of the Christian Coalition, used to be one
of DeLay's deputy whips, and they remain close. A number of
Republicans suggested to me, without questioning the depth of
DeLay's convictions, that he had recognized that if you want the
power that comes with a mass following in today's Republican Party,
you cultivate the Christian Right.
 &HT;    DeLay is not exactly a practitioner of the school of genteel
bipartisanship. He is known inside the Beltway as the Hammer, a
nickname that he cherishes like a scar from an old brawl. Shortly
after Tate won election to Congress from Washington in 1994, DeLay
sent a letter to PAC's listing the amounts each had given to Tate's
opponent.
 &HT;    ``I was surprised to see you opposed Randy Tate,'' he wrote.
``You now have the opportunity to work toward a positive future
relationship. ... Your immediate support for Randy Tate is
personally important to me and the Republican leadership team.''
DeLay had served notice that lapses into bipartisanship would no
longer be accepted. ``He is,'' as one prominent Republican said
wonderingly, ``almost harsher than Newt.''
 &HT;    Yet party leaders recognize that the rhetoric of total warfare,
of Barney Fag and the Gestapo, has not gone down well with the
American public. The party wants to substitute some smiling faces
for DeLay's angry glare and to restore the sunny optimism of
Reagan.
 &HT;    GOP advisers such as Reed and Luntz have begun to remind the
party of why it was that Reagan was so popular and masterful a
figure. Recently, in a private memo to party leaders, Luntz wrote:
``Think about how often we were on the tube last year 'blasting'
someone or something. ... Ronald Reagan hardly ever raised his
voice, yet his message was clear, persuasive and popular. Let us
learn from our Great Communicator.''
 &HT;    Luntz suggested the Reaganesque strategy of head-shaking
ridicule and even provided examples: ``Bill Clinton wants to spend
millions of your taxpayer dollars on dance lessons for convicts.
Convicts!! It's a prison. Can you visualize prisoners dancing? Who
leads?''
 &HT;    It is probably safe to say that neither DeLay nor Armey can be
trusted to bring off this joke with just the right tone of voice.
(During the president's most recent State of the Union Message,
cameras periodically focused on DeLay and Armey as they smirked and
grimaced and virtually sat on their hands to keep from having to
applaud.)
 &HT;    By giving his maiden speech in the well of the House rather than
in a partisan setting, Hastert scored points; and he has said that
he wants to speak regularly to Richard Gephardt, though an aide of
Gephardt's said that the meetings to date have been procedural
rather than substantive.
 &HT;    Several of the Republican legislators I spoke to said that they
are waiting for a sign _ a sign that Hastert realizes the need to
publicly affirm a new identity for the party. Yet the reason why
Hastert, or Luntz, may not be able to cure what ails the GOP is
that the problem is not simply the messenger or the tone of voice.
The party can not be jollied out of its hectoring moralism. That
part of the party that is beholden to, and identifies with, the
Christian right is profoundly at odds with the part that isn't, and
doesn't.
 &HT;    It is also true that the Republican standbys that Reagan could
count on _ communism, crime _ have either evaporated or lost their
edge of urgency.
 &HT;    Clinton has vowed to set aside 62 percent of the projected
surplus to shore up the Social Security system _ and the
Republicans have agreed _ but that still leaves nearly $100 billion
over the next two budget years. The Republicans want to use some or
all of that money for tax cuts, while the Democrats want to use it
for Medicare, a few far-more-modest tax cuts and the kind of
domestic initiatives that have been waiting in the wings for just
such a moment of historic prosperity. The Democrats, too, have an
impatient base.
 &HT;    What's more, the economy could finally tumble off the rails,
though Republicans can't permit themselves to openly root for a
recession. Finally, the GOP could come up with a presidential
candidate more charismatic than Al Gore, which wouldn't seem
terribly difficult to do. A lot of things could happen, but the
auguries are grim.
 &HT;    ``Right now,'' said one Republican strategist, ``we're whistling
past the graveyard.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Driving south on Utah's Highway 59, you slip out of the
subdivisions sprouting in the desert, ascend to a lonely stretch of
ink-colored juniper trees, then suddenly find yourself at the edge
of the last century. There on the Arizona border, tucked behind
towering flanks of red rock, is a town of about 5,000 people. Most
are Mormon fundamentalists, and most are outlaws: It is the largest
polygamous community in the United States.
 &HT;    Though polygamy is a felony, nobody has to hide from the law in
this town, called Hildale on the Utah side of the state line,
Colorado City on the other. More than a century after it was
outlawed, polygamy is flourishing in Utah and small pockets of the
American West, nurtured by religious directives and the hands-off
stance of legal authorities.
 &HT;    Laura Chapman, 36, is the 25th child from a family with four
mothers and 31 children, and she knows most of the people in
Hildale and Colorado City, even the few she is not related to by
blood. Chapman left the town years ago _ she calls it ``the land
that time forgot.'' Today she is one of a new group of women who
have fled plural families and want to draw attention to the reality
of modern polygamy.
 &HT;    Forget the sepia-toned notion of kindly Mormon patriarchs
frolicking with a bushel of happy wives, these women say. Forget
about the polygamy of Abraham or the Mormon pioneer Brigham Young.
 &HT;    Late-20th-century polygamy, practiced by people who seem
unconcerned about the law or public opinion, is a Dark Ages hybrid,
say women who have left the big families. They raise allegations of
sexual abuse, pedophilia and incest.
 &HT;    ``This is organized crime, operating under the cover of
religion,'' Chapman maintains.
 &HT;    If the charges of women such as Chapman have been shrugged off
before, that may be about to change. Last year a teen-age girl
emerged with a story of incest, child abuse and forced marriage at
the hands of one of Utah's biggest polygamous clans, the Kingstons
_ who are based right in Salt Lake City, within a few miles of the
domed capital building.
 &HT;    Whatever the outcome, Chapman and other ex-wives of polygamy
hope the resulting trials, scheduled to begin in April, will force
a reckoning with Utah's oldest ghost.
 &HT;    After the Mormon Church denounced polygamy and Utah outlawed it
in 1896 _ Washington had made this a condition of statehood - it
was thought that the practice of taking multiple wives would
ultimately disappear. But a century later the opposite has
happened, with anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 people living in
families where one man is married to 2, 3, 5, as many as 30 women.
 &HT;    No one has been prosecuted for polygamy in Utah for nearly 50
years, and the state's power structure has not made enforcement an
issue. Last year Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican who is
himself a descendant of polygamists, even said the practice is not
often prosecuted in part because ``these people have religious
freedoms'' (a statement he later amended in the wake of a public
outcry).
 &HT;    The practice is still a minority one in this state of 2 million
people, of course, and the mainstream Mormon leadership in Salt
Lake City strongly condemns it. But it survives in ``clans'' _
massive patriarchal cabals linked by bloodlines and business ties,
whose members generally tithe 10 percent of all wages and earnings
to their church.
 &HT;    Those leaders insist that their only crime is following the true
word of God _ they see the church's capitulation on polygamy as a
blasphemous mistake. Sexual abuse is rare, they insist, and when it
occurs it is not tolerated.
 &HT;    There are at least four major clans in Utah. One of these
polygamous empires, based about 40 minutes south of Salt Lake, in
Bluffdale, is run by Owen Allred, age 84. The state has long
estimated its membership at about 5,000 people.
 &HT;    But Janet Bennion, a Utah Valley State College anthropologist
who spent five years studying the Allreds for a recent book,
``Women of Principle'' (Oxford University Press), says the number
is closer to 10,000, with clusters all over the West.
 &HT;    At the Allred compound, the headquarters is a huge, windowless
two-story building facing the Wasatch mountain range. Arrayed
around it are massive houses, with two or three minivans in many of
the driveways.
 &HT;    Lillian Bowles spent most of her life on this patch of arid
land. She grew up in a trailer not far from Bluffdale's church, one
of 40 children in a family in which her mother was one of eight
wives. She is not even sure where she fits in the family
chronology. ``I think I'm No. 17,'' she says. She remembers a life
of claustrophobia and fear of the outside world. ``I knew early on
that what we were doing was against the law,'' says Bowles, who is
26. ``We were always taught to hide. We couldn't play in the front
yard. When we drove somewhere, it was always 'Duck!' when you
passed a police car.''
 &HT;    At 16, she wanted to leave. But like other women who have fled
polygamy, she says she had no idea how to. ``We were taught early
on that we were God's chosen people, and everyone else was
condemned to hell. If you left, you were condemned.''
 &HT;    At age 17, she married a man who told her it was better to get
married young, rather than wait to be a third or fourth bride.
After six years of marriage, she says, Bowles left her husband when
he decided take on another wife.
 &HT;    Rowenna Erickson, 59, told me a similar tale when she described
her life within another major clan, the Kingstons. She married her
brother-in-law, Charles L. Kingston, and produced eight children.
 &HT;    ``The other wives kept telling me how this was all so wonderful
because we were going to heaven,'' she says between baby-sitting
chores for grandchildren in Salt Lake City. ``But if it was so
wonderful, how come I felt so horrible?''
 &HT;    I asked her if she was ever in love with her husband. ``It was
business,'' she says. ``Produce the babies. Don't question your
husband. But still, you get jealous. I remember when my husband had
his eyes on a very young girl. My sister and I were so hurt.''
 &HT;    She went on to explain a marital routine I heard from members of
polygamous families all over Utah, a sexual-rotation schedule with
all the romance of being a hen at a poultry ranch. ``When you're
ovulating, the patriarch is called,'' she says.
 &HT;    Polygamous leaders tend to shrug off stories such as those told
by Bowles, Erickson and Chapman, dismissing them as bitterness with
a political agenda. But they may have a more difficult time
explaining away an episode that rocked Utah last spring, when a
sobbing, badly bruised 16-year-old girl placed a 911 call from a
truck stop in northern Utah.
 &HT;    She told the police a story of indentured barbarism, alleging
her father had forced her into becoming the 15th wife of her uncle.
When she tried to flee, she maintained, she was whisked to a family
ostrich ranch, taken into a barn and whipped by her father.
 &HT;    The leaders of the Kingston clan run one of the biggest and
wealthiest family business empires in Utah. With 1,500 members and
interests in everything from restaurants to casinos, the clan is
worth $150 million or more, state officials estimate. The clan
operates much of its business out of an old brick office on State
Street just outside downtown Salt Lake City. The building has no
identification on the outside, save an address.
 &HT;    In a December pretrial hearing, the girl gave a hint of what her
life was like inside the clan. Her marriage was arranged by her
father and uncle; the latter had sex with her the first time at her
mother's home.
 &HT;    ``I guess it was my night, so he came over,'' the girl
testified. Then she was moved into a small apartment, with another
wife, one door away from a third wife. All the while, the girl
said, she was terrified. ``I felt trapped.''
 &HT;    The girl's uncle David O. Kingston has been charged with three
counts of incest and one count of unlawful sexual conduct. Her
father, John D. Kingston, has been charged with child abuse. The
two brothers will be tried separately in April, and both have
pleaded not guilty. (The father's lawyer _ and cousin _ Carl E.
Kingston refused to talk to me.)
 &HT;    But even in the face of the girl's court testimony that she had
been forced to marry her uncle and join 14 other wives, the state
has chosen not to bring polygamy charges.
 &HT;    State officials insist the law is unenforceable because most
polygamists have a marriage certificate only for the first bride;
the others are sealed in church ceremonies, without a paper trail
necessary for proof of crime.
 &HT;    The last major attempt at prosecuting anyone on polygamy charges
was in 1953, in Hildale/Colorado City _ then called Short Creek. A
big raid on the compound was written about and photographed by Life
magazine, and what resulted was a furor over families being torn
apart by the state.
 &HT;    Last year, six women from plural marriages _ including Bowles,
Erickson and Chapman _ founded one of the most unusual private
outreach groups in the country, an advocacy organization called
Tapestry of Polygamy. When such women hear Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah
intone about the sanctity of law and President Clinton's sexual
misdeeds, they want to shout from the top of the Mormon Temple:
``What about polygamy?''
 &HT;    Prompted in part by Tapestry, the state attorney general's
office recently sent emissaries to the Allred compound to discuss
things such as statutory rape, child abuse, the minimum wage and
other basic legal facts of modern American life. They gave out
phone numbers. According to the attorney general's office, dozens
of calls have come in _ women and children asking basic questions
about the outside world.
 &HT;    When Chief Deputy Attorney General Reed Richards said last year
that polygamy was not only nearly impossible to prosecute but,
technically, not a crime at all, it took the largely poor and
unschooled ex-wives of polygamous men to point out the law to him.
Polygamy is in fact covered by the statute that makes bigamy a
felony, the women noted, and the law says nothing about a marriage
certificate being needed for proof of crime, only that a husband or
wife ``purports to marry another person.''
 &HT;    I read that statute to Richards and mentioned that prominent
polygamists in Utah had their own Web sites and seemed to be
bragging about breaking the law. One man, Graydon Henderson, whom I
spoke to, lives openly with his five wives and 21 children in a
suburb just south of Salt Lake.
 &HT;    ``I'm not a bit afraid of the law,'' he told me. ``It's not even
worth worrying about.'' Richards finally said that he has no idea
why polygamy was not prosecuted in his state. But he added, ``If we
cracked down on it, I think it would all go underground.''
 &HT;    In Hildale/Colorado City today and in the Allred and Kingston
compounds, residents consider themselves the followers of the true
Mormon Church. In their view, the heretics are the ones operating
out of Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake.
 &HT;    On a tour of Temple Square, the global headquarters of the
Mormon religion, one of the fastest-growing in the world, I asked
the guide about the wives of Brigham Young, a founder of the Mormon
Church. We were in a former home of Young's, the Beehive House,
about a block from the Temple, and the guide was explaining how the
patriarch's wife made bread.
 &HT;    ``Which wife?'' I asked. Young had 27.
 &HT;    ``These other wives were mostly widows,'' the tour guide
replied.
 &HT;    But that sort of historical revisionism ends up infuriating both
the women who have fled polygamy and the people who defend it.
 &HT;    Chapman wants Utah's Mormons to acknowledge that some of their
most revered founding fathers had child brides. Fundamentalists
want the basic facts of the polygamists' past to remain a central
part of the Mormon narrative.
 &HT;    What seems to interest outsiders the most about polygamy is the
sex. The famed 19th-century eroticist, Sir Richard Burton, traveled
to Utah to have a firsthand look at a practice he considered quite
natural. Some people who defend modern polygamy take the same
approach, saying men are, after all, promiscuous animals by nature.
 &HT;    ``You look at the nature of men, and most of them are
polygamous,'' says Mary Potter, who was once one of three wives of
a policeman in a Salt Lake City suburb. (The family later split
up.) She has now formed a group in support of plural marriages, and
openly frets about ``having to wear a Scarlet P,'' as she calls the
cries for legal action. ``In polygamy, men are properly
channeled.''
 &HT;    She and other supporters of polygamy point to recent studies
that maintain that men are evolutionally wired for multiple sexual
partners. ``There's a desire on the part of men to have a diversity
of mates _ it's their natural urge _ so sex is definitely a
motivating factor for many of the patriarchs,'' Bennion says.
 &HT;    Viagra has been a blessing for a few of the older patriarchs,
she also notes. ``Some members of the Allred group are using Viagra
because they just can't keep up with their younger wives,'' she
says. ``There is a big age difference for many of these men. If
you've got three or four sexually active wives, that's a lot of
work.''
 &HT;    With its reputation for divinely sanctioned promiscuity, the
Hildale and Colorado City community attracts its share of misguided
visitors, says Dan Barlow, who is the town's mayor and an elder in
the church that owns nearly every house here.
 &HT;    ``They think what goes on here is all about sex,'' he says.
``It's foolish to make such a claim because we live a hundred miles
or so from Las Vegas. If people want sex, that's where they should
go.''
 &HT;    The mayor took me on a tour. The houses he showed me were huge,
some with as many as 15 to 20 bedrooms and others that looked more
like half-finished motels or dormitories. On a weekday afternoon,
every female in town was wearing an ankle-length dress.
 &HT;    ``These are happy, joyous homes,'' Barlow said. With its
extraordinary rate of reproduction, the community is growing by
better than 10 percent a year, he said.
 &HT;    As for the allegations that boys paw at their sisters and old
men prey on young girls, he shakes his head. ``Whenever you have
people living together, you're going to have people problems, the
same here as anywhere else.''
 &HT;    Prompted by the recent furor, two bills introduced in the
current state legislative session directly target polygamy. One
would raise the legal age of marriage from 14 to 16. The other
would provide money and shelters for women who want to flee but may
not meet the specific admittance rules of traditional halfway
homes.
 &HT;    ``What these women have brought into broad daylight is a civil
rights issue that is second to none in the history of Utah,'' says
State Sen. Scott Howell, the leader of the Democratic legislative
minority in Utah, who introduced one of the bills.
 &HT;    ``Here, we've got all the world coming to town for the Olympics.
Do we really want to be known as the place where we let old men
marry little girls?''
 &HT;    For the women who brought polygamy out of Utah's closet, the
2002 Olympics remain the trump card. More than 10,000 visiting
journalists will be deluged with information about the world's
greatest snow, the glowing city in the Wasatch, the spotless
facilities.
 &HT;    And then, when they grow tired of the luge and the Tabernacle
Choir stories, the press will have no trouble finding the women of
Tapestry, who will tell them about Utah's other heritage.

<P>
   The United States, as Zbigniew Brzezinski once said, will be the
first, last and only global superpower.
</P>
<P>
   American officials quite naturally tend to act as if the world
were unipolar. They boast of American power and American virtue,
hailing the United States as a benevolent hegemon. They lecture
other countries on the universal validity of American principles,
practices and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1997 G-7 summit in Denver, President Clinton boasted
about the success of the American economy as a model for others.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has called the United
States ``the indispensable nation'' and said that ``we stand tall
and hence see further than other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement is true in the narrow sense that the United
States is an indispensable participant in any effort to tackle
major global problems. It is false in also implying that other
nations are dispensable _ the United States needs the cooperation
of some major countries in handling any issue _ and that American
indispensability is the source of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the United States was often able to impose its will on other
countries. That unipolar moment has passed. The two principal tools
of coercion that the United States now attempts to use are economic
sanctions and military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions work, however, only when other countries also support
them, and that is decreasingly the case. Hence, the United States
either applies them unilaterally to the detriment of its economic
interests and its relations with its allies, or it does not enforce
them, in which case they become symbols of American weakness.
</P>
<P>
   At relatively low cost, the United States can launch bombing or
cruise missile attacks against its enemies. By themselves, however,
such actions achieve little.
</P>
<P>
   More serious military interventions have to meet three
conditions: They have to be legitimated through some international
organization, such as the United Nations where they are subject to
Russian, Chinese or French veto; they also require the
participation of allied forces, which may or may not be
forthcoming; and they have to involve no American casualties and
virtually no ``collateral'' casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the United States meets all three conditions, it risks
stirring up not only criticism at home but widespread political and
popular backlash abroad.
</P>
<P>
   American officials seem peculiarly blind to the fact that often
the more the United States attacks a foreign leader, the more his
popularity soars among his countrymen who applaud him for standing
tall against the greatest power on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The demonizing of leaders has so far failed to shorten their
tenure in power, from Fidel Castro (who has survived eight American
presidents) to Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein. Indeed, the
best way for a dictator of a small country to prolong his tenure in
power may be to provoke the United States into denouncing him as
the leader of a ``rogue regime'' and a threat to global peace.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Clinton administration nor Congress nor the public
is willing to pay the costs and accept the risks of unilateral
global leadership. Some advocates of American leadership argue for
increasing defense expenditures by 50 percent, but that is a
nonstarter. The American public clearly sees no need to expend
effort and resources to achieve American hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   However much foreign policy elites may ignore or deplore it, the
United States lacks the domestic political base to create a
unipolar world. American leaders repeatedly make threats, promise
action and fail to deliver. The result is a foreign policy of
``rhetoric and retreat'' and a growing reputation as a ``hollow
hegemon.''
</P>
<P>
   In acting as if this were a unipolar world, the United States is
also becoming increasingly alone in the world. American leaders
constantly claim to be speaking on behalf of ``the international
community.''
</P>
<P>
   But whom do they have in mind? China? Russia? India? Pakistan?
Iran? The Arab world? The Association of Southeast Asian Nations?
Africa? Latin America? France? Do any of these countries or regions
see the United States as the spokesman for a community of which
they are a part?
</P>
<P>
   The community for which the United States speaks includes, at
best, its Anglo-Saxon cousins (Britain, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand) on most issues, Germany and some smaller European
democracies on many issues, Israel on some Middle Eastern questions
and Japan on the implementation of U.N. resolutions. These are
important states, but they fall far short of being the global
international community.
</P>
<P>
   On issue after issue, the United States has found itself
increasingly alone, with one or a few partners, opposing most of
the rest of the world's states and peoples. These issues include
U.N. dues; the land mines treaty; global warming; an international
war crimes tribunal; the Middle East; the use of force against Iraq
and Yugoslavia; and sanctions against Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   On these and other issues, much of the international community
is on one side and the United States is on the other. The circle of
governments who see their interests coinciding with American
interests is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States regularly denounces various countries as
``rogue states,'' in the eyes of many countries it is becoming the
rogue superpower.
</P>
<P>
   If a unipolar world were unavoidable, many countries might
prefer the United States as the hegemon. But this is mostly because
it is distant from them and hence unlikely to attempt to acquire
any of their territory.
</P>
<P>
   American power is also valued by the secondary regional states
as a constraint on the dominance of other major regional states.
Benign hegemony, however, is in the eye of the hegemon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reads about the world's desire for American leadership
only in the United States,'' one British diplomat observed.
``Everywhere else one reads about American arrogance and
unilateralism.''
</P>
<P>
   Political and intellectual leaders in most countries strongly
resist the prospect of a unipolar world and favor the emergence of
true multipolarity.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1997 Harvard conference, scholars reported that the elites
of countries comprising at least two-thirds of the world's people _
Chinese, Russians, Indians, Arabs, Muslims and Africans _ see the
United States as the single greatest external threat to their
societies.
</P>
<P>
   They do not regard America as a military threat but as a menace
to their integrity, autonomy, prosperity and freedom of action.
They view the United States as intrusive, interventionist,
exploitative, unilateralist, hegemonic, hypocritical and applying
double standards, engaging in what they label ``financial
imperialism'' and ``intellectual colonialism,'' with a foreign
policy driven overwhelmingly by domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Such reactions are to be expected. American leaders believe that
the world's business is their business. Other countries believe
that what happens in their part of the world is their business, not
America's, and quite explicitly respond.
</P>
<P>
   As Nelson Mandela said, his country rejects another state's
having ``the arrogance to tell us where we should go or which
countries should be our friends. ... We cannot accept that a state
assumes the role of the world's policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bipolar world, many countries welcomed the United States as
their protector against the other superpower. In today's world, in
contrast, the world's only superpower is automatically a threat to
other major powers.
</P>
<P>
   It would behoove Americans to stop acting and talking as if this
were a unipolar world. It is not. To deal with any major global
issue, the United States needs the cooperation of at least some
major powers. Unilateral sanctions and interventions are recipes
for foreign policy disasters.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders also should abandon the benign-hegemon illusion
that a natural congruity exists between their interests and values
and those of the rest of the world. It does not. At times, American
actions may promote public goods and serve more widely accepted
ends. But often they will not, in part because of the unique
moralistic component in American policy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also simply because America is the only superpower,
and hence its interests necessarily differ from those of other
countries. This makes America unique _ but certainly not benign in
the eyes of those countries.

   Col. Qaddafi's emissary, Youssef Debri, met me in Cairo. He was
in Egypt exploring the ramifications of Libya's surrendering two of
its citizens to stand trial for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In formal talks in New York, a U.N. official had already managed
to narrow the gap between Libya's concerns and the British-American
proposal for a trial in the Netherlands, but important differences
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Now Debri was in Cairo informally, to clarify Washington's terms
with a well-connected, retired American diplomat, in the hope of
ending Qaddafi's equivocation.
</P>
<P>
   An intimate of Qaddafi since their student days at military
college, Debri had contacted me some weeks before to propose that I
visit Libya. Cut off from the world by the U.N. embargo over
Lockerbie, Libya, he said, had grown weary of its isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the embargo's terms, it could sell oil _ its only export _
to European customers, so it had money for food and medicines. But
the other barriers to trade and transportation were wearing it
down. Few businessmen and almost no journalists came to call.
</P>
<P>
   Debri's message was that Libya, anxious for a new start, wanted
to put Lockerbie behind it. In Libya, he assured me, I would be
free to go where I liked and to see whomever I wanted, including
Qaddafi himself.
</P>
<P>
   Having decided on the journey, I went to the State Department
for a briefing. Officials there acknowledged that they knew little
about what was going on in Libya. In 1986, two years before
Lockerbie, President Reagan broke off relations with Libya and
imposed economic sanctions in response to a series of terrorist
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the officials said, Libya had committed
no terrorist acts. Unlike Iraq, it posed no strategic threat. But
because of Lockerbie, the United States still shunned Qaddafi and
kept Libya on its list of terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a U.S. grand jury indicted two Libyans _ Lamin Khalifa
Fhimah, ex-manager of the Libyan Arab Airlines office in Malta, and
Abdel Basset Ali al- Megrahi, a high-level intelligence official _
for the Lockerbie bombing. A British court did the same. In 1992,
the U.N. Security Council imposed its own sanctions, including a
flight ban that effectively closed Libya's airports. Tripoli, in
response, proposed trying the two suspects in a neutral country,
but Washington and London would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last August, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
announced that she would ``call the Libyan government's bluff'' and
offered a trial by a Scottish court seated in the Netherlands.
Libya agreed in principle, but Qaddafi demanded more details.
</P>
<P>
   The American embargo did not bar my visit (since it makes an
exception for journalists). I flew to Cairo; then, with Youssef
Debri, set off for Tripoli by car.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at Benghazi, then Sirte, chosen by Qaddafi as Libya's
new capital. Around 11 o'clock on the morning after our arrival,
Youssef and I set out, heading south, to see Qaddafi.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-hour ride across the desert, we were met by a
police escort, which led us to an almost indiscernible dirt track
that ran off the paved road. A bumpy mile or so later, we reached
the gate of a chainlink fence, where three or four limousines sat.
</P>
<P>
   Parking our car among them, we piled into a Land Rover, which
bucked us over rock and sand a half-hour deeper into the desert.
Finally, we reached an encampment of large tents and modern
trailers near which grazed a herd of some 200 camels. No armed
guards seemed to be anywhere in view.
</P>
<P>
   The tent to which I was first directed was ballroom-size, its
sides open to admit the breeze. Seated next to three Africans in
native robes, I was offered tea.
</P>
<P>
   The Africans made a brief call on Qaddafi, after which Youssef
escorted me to Qaddafi's tent, pitched nearby, and left me there.
Save for a few simple chairs and a table, the tent was bare. Its
camel-skin roof and sides were weathered; the rugs covering the
sand floor were ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi sat alone, except for an interpreter. He wore a thin,
tattered Bedouin robe, embroidered at the edges, over a
much-laundered print sport shirt and khaki pants. His furrowed face
was clean-shaven, his eyes covered by dark glasses. A beige turban
half-concealed his bushy hair.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I began the interview by asking whether the view that Libya had
embarked on a new course was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi did not turn to me to answer. Through the open flaps of
the tent, he fixed his eyes on the horizon. His lips seemed barely
to move. He spoke in a controlled monotone, though from time to
time emotion quickened its pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' he said, ``unfortunately treats us as if the world
was the way it used to be. Americans accept that changes have taken
place since the end of communism, but not in their treatment of
Libya. So in the end, they take a racist and fanatical position,
similar to the way Hitler treated the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that America is much like Hitler. We have no
explanation for this, except that it is a religious, fanatical,
racist position. Some analysts call this a new colonialism. But
colonialism is colonialism, and it is always unjust. It is how we
were treated by the Italians, Algeria by the French, India by the
British. This is imperialism, and we seem to be entering a new
imperialist era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause of our conflict with America is not that we attacked
them. We have never attacked an American target. America started
the aggression against us right here in the Gulf of Sirte. When we
defended ourselves, they attacked us in these very tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were bombed by missiles in our own territorial waters. In
1986 our own children were killed. No one can bring my daughter
back to me. Then Lockerbie came along. Now we'd like this chain of
events to be over. But America doesn't want to turn the page. We
shall, however, show courage and be patient, and America will be
the loser.''
</P>
<P>
   The events about which Qaddafi rambled date back to 1981, when
American jets shot down two Libyan planes in a dispute over the
extent of Libya's territorial waters. In January 1986, President
Reagan, responding to terrorist attacks in Rome and Vienna, blocked
commerce with Libya and froze its American assets. A few weeks
later, U.S. Navy planes bombed Sirte and destroyed four patrol
boats in another dispute over territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Reagan, blaming Libya for a bomb that killed two
American soldiers in a Berlin nightclub, attacked Tripoli and
Benghazi, along with suspected terrorist camps in the desert. Among
the 37 civilians reported killed was Qaddafi's adopted infant
daughter, Hana'a. Libyans say the child's death haunts him still.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Qaddafi if Libya was responsible for the many
terrorist incidents of which it was accused in the 1980s, he issued
no denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents that you mention belong to the past,'' he
said. ``Once Abu Amar (Yasir Arafat) was wanted. Now he enters the
White House with all the trappings, the music, the red carpet
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought I detected a note of envy in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Libya is a terrorist country. But now that is
illogical, not reasonable. All these things are of the past, an era
that is over. The bombing of the French plane (a French UTA
airliner bombed over Niger in 1989, at a cost of 171 lives) took
place during a time of war in the region _ Libya, Chad, France. It
was similar to America's downing of the Iranian plane in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis shot down a Libyan aircraft over the Sinai. The
Soviet Union shot down a Korean airplane. It was a time of war. So
how come you forgot all about that and you just mention the charges
against Libya? There is no explanation for that. We go back to the
racist, fanatical complexes of America.''
</P>
<P>
   When I suggested to Qaddafi that the downing of the other
airliners might have been the result of miscommunications, he broke
into derisive laughter. But I persisted, asking whether the UTA and
Lockerbie bombings were not deliberate efforts to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at your logic, the American logic. Those who use missiles
or fighter planes and rockets are legitimate. Those who use
explosives or small bombs are considered terrorists. If we use the
same logic, Osama bin Ladin will use cruise missiles, the same
weapon used by America, and he will not be accused of being a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we were responsible for bringing down the French plane
will be decided by a French court. We don't say anything about it.
The same is true of Lockerbie. I can't answer as to whether Libya
was responsible. Let's let the court decide. Libya has not been
convicted of any terrorist act up to this moment. If they accuse
us, they have to prove their charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Was terrorism, I asked, ever in Libya's national interest?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you ask me that? Why don't you ask why it is in
America's interest to attack us in the Gulf of Sirte, why it is in
America's interest to kill our children? Is it so unusual for Libya
to have a reaction when these things happen? Who is being unfair?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no interest in being hostile to America. We would be
fools to initiate a confrontation with America. But when you face
aggression, you have to defend yourself, no matter how small you
are. We want a reconciliation with America, but America doesn't
want a reconciliation with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Libya, I asked, ready to turn over the two Lockerbie suspects
for trial? His answer, I thought, contained a clue to his
procrastination in resolving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have agreed that a trial should take place. Now let us sit
down and decide how it can be put into practice. I want to find out
the truth about Lockerbie myself. After that, the story will be
finished. I am not so concerned about whether the two Libyans are
convicted or not. What is important is that the problem come to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice the number of Libyans have died from the embargo than
were killed at Lockerbie. Whether this one or that is guilty or not
is the business of the lawyers and the courts. What matters is that
once the trial starts, sanctions will be over against Libya. The
embargo will be lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on, pessimistically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, normal relations between our two countries should
be restored. But I am sure that because of America's psychological
complexes and imperialist designs, such normal relations will not
be restored, even if the Lockerbie business is over. America wants
to occupy the Gulf of Sirte and the north of Africa. It wants to
hand over Egypt and Syria to Israel, so that a Greater Israel is
established.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problems with the West generally. Libya has good
relations with Europe. We have European embassies and companies
here. But America is different. We are not enemies of the American
people. Millions of Arabs, millions of Muslims, millions of
Africans are Americans these days. How could we be their enemy?
Only imperialist policies prevent our working together. Libya is a
victim of American terrorism.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later I was cautiously sipping camel milk in the
waiting-tent when Youssef returned. In an urgent tone he reported,
``The Leader wants me to remind you that he was not talking
officially and that he was not stating policy. He asks you to
remember that he is a private person and was speaking from his
heart on what he feels.''

   What a trick of fate: The way to get ahead in the age of the
knowledge worker is not through raw brainpower, but by harnessing
your emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Goleman, a Harvard-trained psychologist and former New
York Times science writer, turned this idea into a household phrase
with his 1995 blockbuster ``Emotional Intelligence.'' A primer on
the art _ and science _ of self-mastery and social persuasion, the
book remains an international best-seller, now translated into 30
or so languages. At the time of this interview it was topping the
charts in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Goleman's follow-up volume _ ``Working with Emotional
Intelligence'' (Bantam, 1998) _ goes even further, providing a kind
of moral philosophy for corporate America. His thesis: In today's
technical fields, you need a highly developed set of soft
(emotional) skills to leverage your hard (knowledge-based)
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Now CEO of the consulting firm Emotional Intelligence Services
(www.eisglobal.com/), Goleman seems to be walking the talk; let him
know what you think at goleman &LR; javanet.com.
</P>
<P>
   JEFF GREENWALD: The mythical hero of Silicon Valley is the nerd
_ a brain trapped inside a geeky-looking body. Your research
suggests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   DANIEL GOLEMAN: The stereotype of the tech expert with no social
skills may be accurate. And I used to think these two factors were
independent. But friends at places like MIT argue that people drawn
into the technical fields spend many hours _ particularly in
adolescence _ alone, absorbed at the computer, or in a lab.
</P>
<P>
   As they're increasing their technical understanding in math and
science, they're missing out on a parallel track of social
learning. They become emotionally de-skilled, and that pulls them
back later in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The person who seems to belie this point of view is Bill
Gates, who by external appearances is almost autistic. He's hardly
what anyone would call a failure.
</P>
<P>
   A: Gates is a fascinating case. He has a fabulous drive to
achieve, and that reverberates throughout his company. On the other
hand, he's notorious for the worst of emotional intelligence. He
yells, he's abrasive, and he doesn't seem to care how he's coming
off. If he were starting at the bottom _ if the playing field were
level for Gates _ he's not the guy you would pick to lead a team.
He'd work for you, not run you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what's the role of technical skill?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's an entry-level requirement. You have to have enough to
do the job _ but it's not what sets star performers apart. A
University of California/Berkeley study, started in the 1950s,
followed a group of Ph.D. students in science and the technical
fields for 40 years. It turned out emotional-intelligence abilities
were four times more important than IQ in determining professional
success and prestige by the end of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   And in a study of managers who failed, it was always because of
a deficiency of emotional intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does our penchant for smartcards, smart homes, and PDAs
encourage emotional intelligence in society, or impede it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The early returns show a negative impact, particularly as it
affects kids _ the average level of emotional intelligence has been
declining among young people for the last 20 years. This generation
spends more time than any generation in history staring at video
monitors. It doesn't matter if they're doing educational CD-ROMs;
they're not out playing with other kids.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the workplace?
</P>
<P>
   A: The increasing reliance on communication via the Web and
e-mail _ if it replaces human touchpoints _ weakens the fabric of
connectedness that makes a company or organization work. That's why
emotional intelligence is so important in the high tech universe.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does emotional intelligence apply to people like Oracle's
Larry Ellison who are more inspired by the Japanese ``warrior
mentality''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Samurai were Zen students _ they engaged more skillfully
because they cultivated inner peace. Emotional intelligence is
about being skillful, not squishy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's today's most emotionally intelligent technology?
</P>
<P>
   A: The MIT Media Lab's Roz Picard, who wrote a book about 2001's
HAL 9000, is investigating computers that can read emotions in the
user and adjust themselves accordingly. If you're frantic and
uptight, they can make things easier. If you're enthusiastic and
zeroed in, they'll up the level of challenge. They're user-friendly
in the real sense of the word _ which means they're emotionally
intelligent, for machines.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's one thing to program a computer; how about humans?
</P>
<P>
   A: Competency in emotional intelligence is learnable. In
``Working with Emotional Intelligence,'' I set out guidelines for
training programs designed to make people better on the job, where
the payoff is. A lot of programs out there _ such as these one-day
motivational seminars, or doing ropes courses in the countryside _
have little, no, or even a negative effect. Companies are wasting a
lot of time and money on inappropriate solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could good training rescue a troubled company _ say, Apple?
</P>
<P>
   A: Emotional intelligence is not the answer to every problem
faced by an organization. There are market realities. But how well
you face a market reality is determined by emotional intelligence.
Andy Grove, writing about Intel, makes a good point: The critical
thing is how managers respond emotionally to a crisis. So often
people panic, deny the crisis _ or kill the messenger. A company
has to be open to bad news, take it in fully, and respond quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other traditions that have a different way of
dealing with emotions?
</P>
<P>
   A: In many Asian cultures you squelch expressions of emotion,
particularly of negative emotion _ which means that people are
getting eaten up inside without showing it. But I was amazed at
Asia's interest in emotional intelligence. In Taiwan, ``Emotional
Intelligence'' is the best-selling book of all time. In Korea,
they're starting to put emotional intelligence curricula in the
schools. ``We're very taken by the West,'' they told me, ``and very
influenced by your ideas and technologies. And here is Western
science affirming our most deeply held values.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is emotional intelligence sort of bottom-line Buddhism?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's very interesting. Buddhists read ``Emotional
Intelligence'' that way. Christians tell me it's about
Christianity. And Jews tell me it's a great book about Judaism. It
may in that way reflect what Huxley called ``the perennial
philosophy,'' which itself reflects the basic neurological
structures that govern human existence.
</P>
<P>
   My work is grounded in science, particularly neurological
science. Apparently the eternal questions all the great religions
are grappling with are the legacy of evolution: What do you do with
destructive emotions? How can you live a good life, and have
healthy connections to other people? How can you help future
generations?

WITH TUNA, THE SECRET IS IN THE CRUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the fifth of eight columns by Rick Moonen, the executive
chef and an owner of Oceana in Manhattan. His collaborator on these
columns is Dorie Greenspan.  
 By RICK MOONEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe you've had this experience. You're still half-asleep,
waiting in line to get your morning coffee and bagel. You wait and
wait, just taking in all the great aromas, and then the guy behind
the counter calls out, ``Next!'' with typical New York impatience,
and it's you, you're next, and all of a sudden you're confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me an everything bagel,'' you say _ it was the only thing
you could think of _ and it turns out to be perfect. It always is.
It's got a ton of flavor, and a taste that goes on forever.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story behind my Everything-Crusted Tuna: a thick hunk
of tuna coated with the everything bagel's pebbly mix of dried
garlic and onions, coarse salt, poppy and sesame seeds. A crust
gives tuna flavor and shields it from too much heat.
</P>
<P>
   But the everything crust does more: it gives the tuna a strong
personality. Once the tuna is dredged, it's pan-fried until the
crust is beautifully browned and crunchy, and the seeds and herbs
are intensely flavorful. Then the tuna is finished in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   To get the most out of this dish, buy premium-quality tuna and
cook it only just enough. Ask the fishmonger to cut each steak like
a brick, an even one-inch thick. The tuna will look like beef and
like beef, you'll want to keep it rare.
</P>
<P>
   Once fried, it will be very rare. Put it in the oven for a
minute, and it will be rare and then, for every minute after that,
you'll be cooking it to another level of doneness. Go easy _ to my
mind, tuna is best when it's cooked least.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce is a blend of roasted red pepper, garlic and shallots.
Gently sauteed, the garlic and shallots are a sweeter version of
the garlic and onions in the crust. I roast red bell peppers over a
gas flame or under the broiler until they're black and blistered,
then I rub off the skins.
</P>
<P>
   Their slightly charred flavor makes the sauce lusty enough to
play opposite the assertive crust. At the restaurant, I also serve
a timbale of couscous and caponata. But if you go for couscous
alone, it's a natural with the sauce. &QL;

   EVERYTHING-CRUSTED TUNA WITH ROASTED RED PEPPER SAUCE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons dry minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons dry minced onion
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons poppy seeds
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons black sesame seeds
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons white sesame seeds
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons coarse salt
</P>
<P>
   1 egg white, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   4 sushi-quality center-cut tuna steaks, 3 inches by 1{ inches by
1 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 large shallot, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   3 medium-size roasted red peppers, peeled and coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   { cup unsalted or low-sodium chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   \ cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 tablespoons Champagne vinegar
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup grape-seed oil
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups canola or other vegetable oil. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the crust, mix together the minced garlic, onion,
poppy seeds, sesame seeds and salt. Sprinkle some of this mixture
on a plate. Dip the tuna steaks in the beaten egg white just enough
to coat, then roll each steak in the crust mixture to coat it
thoroughly, adding more of the mixture if necessary. Put steaks on
the same plate, atop the remaining mixture; set aside at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   3. To make the sauce, warm the olive oil in a large saute pan
over medium heat, and add the garlic and shallots. Cook, stirring,
until they are soft but not colored, about 5 minutes. Add the
peppers, chicken stock and wine, season with salt and white pepper,
and simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, about 8 minutes.
Carefully transfer the mixture to a blender, add the vinegar and
with the machine running, pour in the grape-seed oil. Blend just to
emulsify. Adjust the seasonings, adding water if sauce is too
thick, and set aside in a warm place.
</P>
<P>
   4. Have a metal baking pan at the ready; you will need it
quickly after frying the steaks. Pour the canola oil into a 12-inch
saute pan or a wok, and set over high heat; when the oil reaches
350 degrees, slip the tuna into the pan. Fry for 1{ minutes on each
side, until the crust is well browned. Lift out the steaks with a
slotted spatula, and place in the baking pan. Transfer to the oven,
and roast for 1 minute for rare, 2 minutes for medium-rare, 3
minutes for medium. Remove from the oven; spoon some sauce on each
of 4 warmed dinner plates. Cut each steak in half on the diagonal,
and place the two pieces in the center of the plates.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ When it comes to the news of
the day, I confess I am a victim of lowered expectations and sorely
in need of an attitude adjustment. Lord help us: According to the
London Times, the U.S. National Security Agency in Maryland, the
espionage entity that analyzes telephone taps and electronic
intercepts picked up from around the world has issued a ``Furby
Alert,'' warning employees to leave their cyberpets at home lest
its computer chip (the one that allows it to repeat anything it has
heard), defect and start blabbing classified information. What are
we doing with a spy network that carries their stuffed toys to
work? (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ My time would be better spent if
the law required my son to walk faster. The Texas Legislature
should step to it. When my son's voice changed, so did his gear
ratio. Now he has two speeds: ``slow'' and ``glacial.'' I want
Texas to set a minimum pedestrian speed for able-bodied Texans ages
13-18. With slouching a concurrent teen condition, Texas also
should declare an ``official body language,'' which would be
upright. Stop me before I go much further. Someone in the state
Capitol is going to take these proposals seriously. (Young, Waco

   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ When it comes to the news of the day, I
confess I am a victim of lowered expectations and sorely in need of
an attitude adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning I unfurl the daily blab foolishly hoping for some
good news. Maybe a headline proclaiming ``Peace in the Middle
East'' or maybe even a cure for the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   Warily, I scan page one for assurance that Bill Clinton made it
through the night without being accused of assaulting the entire
soprano section of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
</P>
<P>
   More and more I find myself responding to the news with comments
like ``Lord help us,'' and ``Who cares.''?

   Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   Lord help us: According to the London Times, the U.S. National
Security Agency in Maryland, the espionage entity that analyzes
telephone taps and electronic intercepts picked up from around the
world has issued a ``Furby Alert,'' warning employees to leave
their cyberpets at home lest its computer chip (the one that allows
it to repeat anything it has heard), defect and start blabbing
classified information.
</P>
<P>
   Shall we ask the obvious question, folks? Like, what are we
doing with a spy network that carries their stuffed toys to work?
</P>
<P>
   Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   A 47-year-old wholesale steel distributor from Bucks County,
Pa., paid $255,000 for O.J. Simpson's second-hand Heisman Trophy.
He did it to impress his girlfriend who hadn't been paying much
attention to him lately.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the words of the new owner who has taped his name over
O.J.'s and called in the media for a photo op, his lady is
``totally impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow! Me too! (Talk about a pair of empty suits.)
</P>
<P>
   Lord help us: According to the Detroit Free Press, an
assembly-line worker at DaimlerChrysler AG glass plant in Detroit
was arrested by FBI agents after being identified by her supervisor
as the woman photographed robbing a bank in
</P>
<P>
   Bloomfield Hills. The accused's elegant, designer wardrobe and
sunglasses were her undoing.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? Despite federal prosecutors' pleas to have the
accused armed robber jailed, the judge released her to the custody
of her family in lieu of a $10,000 personal bond - AND - she'll be
back on the job taking orders from the person who turned her in.
Talk about ``labor relations!''
</P>
<P>
   Who cares? Teammate grumbles Rodman is turning Lakers into
traveling circus.
</P>
<P>
   Is it Rodman's purple and gold hair he's objecting to?
</P>
<P>
   Lord help us: The Washington Post writes that the 2000
presidential race is rapidly turning into a ``mammoth spending
spree'' with candidates attempting to intimidate poor folks out of
the running by raising astronomical amounts of campaign funds early
on. Vice President Gore, we're told, plans to ``exploit every
available legal loophole'' to reach his goal of $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   That'd sure feed a lot of hungry folks.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares? Texas Gov. and presidential hopeful George W. Bush
admits to having been a hard-drinking party animal. His daddy and
former president, George, tells us his son was never an alcoholic,
he just can't hold his liquor.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it's going to be from now on, so we'd better get
used to it - declaration followed by confession and contrition.
Ho-hum.
</P>
<P>
   Lord help us: Smilin' Jerry Falwell is out to save the world
from gay Teletubbies. The good reverend has denounced Tinky Winky
because he's purple, because he carries a purse, and because he
wears a triangle on his head.
</P>
<P>
   It must be depressing viewing the world through evil-tinted
glasses. And finally, from Columbus, Ohio: City crews sent out to
remove snow and ice from the Statehouse grounds before Gov. Bob
Taft's inauguration last month
</P>
<P>
   wrecked the joint to the tune of $1 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Snowplows broke 66 granite sidewalk stones and three curbs,
chipped or gouged at least 1,476 feet of curb, uprooted and dented
an anchored trash can, and bent a sign. The city's street
maintenance manager says he isn't aware of any damage.
</P>
<P>
   Nice day's work, guys!
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you folks, it's laugh or perish. If we get serious,
the news will make us nuts.

 &HT;    Simple lessons learned in a cemetery
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Long an avid student of Texas history, I've
stumbled upon another one of those folks who wasn't in my
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   He was a wealthy landowner in Fort Bend County during the last
century and part of this one. He got into politics and was elected
sheriff and tax collector, then was elected to the Texas Senate.
While in the Legislature, he backed many education initiatives,
including one bill establishing a state university. He returned to
Fort Bend County, which sits along Houston's southwestern edge and
stayed active in politics and farming until he died in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, while on a trip to Richmond, the county seat, last
year, my family and I stopped at the historic Morton Cemetery. We
find it interesting to explore old cemeteries and talk about the
lives of the people who are buried there. On this visit, we spotted
a state historical marker near two of the graves at this final
resting place of many prominent Fort Bend County families.
</P>
<P>
   The marker, erected in 1992, told about a politician/farmer and
when we were through reading it, my husband turned to my son and
declared, ``You have got to do your history project on this guy.''
Our school requires a yearly history project from all fifth through
eighth graders and families learn to be on the lookout for great
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   So what was it about the life of the man on the marker, which
sounds like that of so many others who helped build this great
state, that would elicit such enthusiasm from a history nut like my
husband?
</P>
<P>
   He was a slave.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Moses Burton was born around 1840 in North Carolina and
brought to Texas by his master, Thomas Burke Burton in 1850.
Against all laws and customs, Burton taught the young slave to read
and write and when slavery ended after the Civil War, he sold to
Walter Moses Burton several parcels of
</P>
<P>
   land.
</P>
<P>
   The former slave, now a wealthy and influential landowner,
entered politics in 1869 when he was elected sheriff and tax
collector of Fort Bend County.
</P>
<P>
   His service in the Texas Senate began in 1874 and ended in 1882.
In 1879, he was instrumental in passing the bill establishing
Prairie View Normal School, now Prairie View A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Burton and his son, Horace, are the only two black people buried
in Morton Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   My son listened to his dad and pursued the project for his
seventh grade year, which is the year Texas schoolchildren study
our state's history. He got an A and we all got a little richer in
our knowledge of black history, which after all is part of what
makes Texas history so rich.

 &HT;    Good intentions don't justify these bills; they're stinkers
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ My time would be better spent if the law required
my son to walk faster.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature should step to it.
</P>
<P>
   When my son's voice changed, so did his gear ratio. Now he has
two speeds: ``slow'' and ``glacial.'' I want Texas to set a minimum
pedestrian speed for able-bodied Texans ages 13-18.
</P>
<P>
   With slouching a concurrent teen condition, Texas also should
declare an ``official body language,'' which would be upright.
</P>
<P>
   Stop me before I go much further. Someone in the state Capitol
is going to take these proposals seriously.
</P>
<P>
   As much as we mean well making requirements for young people, we
can overstep.
</P>
<P>
   Two bills before the legislature are examples of good intentions
gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   The first, by Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, would require
every Texas high schooler to take two years of Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The second, by Tony Goolsby, R-Dallas, would require high
schoolers to do 60 hours of community service to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   I should be singing the praises of both. Having two years of
high school Spanish and 60 hours of community service would be good
for any student. So would walking faster and not slouching.
</P>
<P>
   Texas should stomp these bills to death.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Spanish ought to be fundamental in the Southwest. It's
an argument I've made in my own home many times. It is
geographically self-evident. My son is taking French.
</P>
<P>
   He had his first Spanish in middle school. He knows just enough
to be dangerous. I can see him robbing a Juarez bank with tellers
mulling the warning: ``I've got cheese and I'm not afraid to use
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be to his benefit to be fluent in Spanish, but
requiring two years of Spanish would cause several problems. The
first is the way high schoolers see electives erode under
core-subject mandates. Heap on a few more mandates and there won't
be enough hours in a day for a high schooler to have an education
that suits his or her interests. Requiring two years of Spanish
would virtually erase French, Russian and Latin from Texas
offerings, because only hard-core language students would free up
the time for them.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is an accute lack of qualified Spanish teachers.
Texas is hard pressed to find enough bilingual teachers as it is.
</P>
<P>
   Topping this off is the fact that high school is too late. The
perfect-world solution: Learn Spanish in grade school. With that
underpinning, more students would be inclined to choose two years
of Spanish in secondary school. This is important enough to launch
a state initiative: Spanish from the bottom up. But don't order it
top-down.
</P>
<P>
   Good intention, bad law. Nothing so reflects the combination
than that other bad bill: the 60-hour ``community service''
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each school shall develop a list of approved community service
organizations from which a student may select,'' it says. Red tape
alert. Who on the average high school campus has time to administer
this?
</P>
<P>
   I'm a big advocate of volunteer work. Many youngsters would
benefit under this requirement, and so would agencies. But watch
out for coerced teen-agers slouching slowly toward make-work
opportunities in which they would end up rearranging dust with
leaden sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   As with TAAS drills and TAAS practice tests (even for students
who don't need them), and then three days of the real thing under
state decree, this sounds like one more way for Texas to say, ``We
interrupt your regularly scheduled education for . . . ''

<P>
   Ancient Romans lucky enough to have game to eat knew just what
to do with it. First, they hung it up to age and tenderize it. Then
they may have bathed the meat in wine, honey, herbs and spices
intended not only to soften the tough, sinewy meat but also to
flavor it, and perhaps to obscure the funky smell that develops
from old-fashioned aging.
</P>
<P>
   Since the earliest days of recorded history, and maybe even
before, humans have marinated their food, steeping meat, fowl and
fish in some combination of liquid _ usually oil or acid _ and
seasonings. At first, there were practical reasons: tough meat
needed to be made tender, it needed to be preserved, and with
humans ever attuned to improving their lot, it needed to be
flavored. But from ranch to refrigerator, almost everything has
changed about meat and the way it is treated today. Everything,
that is, except marination.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is meat the tough, stringy stuff of even 100 years
ago, but it is the rare home cook who has not tossed chicken or a
piece of beef into a bath of, say, wine and spices for a few hours,
even a few days, to tenderize it while adding some flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most cooking experts scoff at the notion that marinating
makes meat more tender. Yes, they say, an acidic solution will
alter texture, but often not for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, marinating has little or no effect on tenderness,''
said Jack Bishop, a senior writer for Cook's Illustrated who has
experimented with all sorts of marination techniques. ``Everybody
just assumes marination is going to tenderize meat, so they leave
it in the refrigerator for three days. It really just breaks down
and becomes soft and mushy. Tenderizing comes from the way you cook
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The science seems clear. ``Acid does break down protein, but
after it breaks it down, it causes it to coagulate,'' said Shirley
O. Corriher, whose book, ``Cookwise'' (William Morrow &AMP; Co., 1997),
explores the reasons some recipes work and others do not. ``If you
leave it too long, it toughens or turns to mush.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, bathing meat in acid begins the cooking process.
Just as ceviche is made by steeping raw seafood in lime juice until
the flesh is ``cooked'' by the citric acid, so are meat, poultry
and fish altered by an acidic marinade. By the time the acid
penetrates a piece of meat an inch or more thick to get to the
tough center, it will have had far too much time to work on the
surface, rendering it ``unpleasantly strange,'' said Edward Behr,
who writes The Art of Eating, a quarterly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   So, if marinades tend to hurt meats rather than help them,
what's the point? Flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of marination is to add a layer of flavor, and
it's literally just the external layer,'' said Harvey Steiman, who
writes about cooking for Wine Spectator magazine. While some may be
tempted to poke holes in the meat to extend the flavoring beyond
the surface, that technique has more drawbacks than benefits. It
may improve the distribution of flavor, but more fluid will be lost
during cooking, resulting in drier meat, said Harold McGee, who
tested the technique in his book ``On Food and Cooking: The Science
and Lore of the Kitchen'' (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1984).
</P>
<P>
   Still, that extra layer of flavor can be important, and it can
be obtained easily without damaging the texture of the meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rub a butterflied leg of lamb with olive oil, garlic and
rosemary because there's nothing there that's breaking down the
meat,'' Bishop said. ``Even better is a spice rub, which at its
most basic is a 30-second operation and you don't even have to
think about the texture. But if you see a recipe that has a
half-cup of lemon juice in it, that's a red flag and you better be
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   With such a consensus about acidic marinades, why are acids
still frequently included in recipes? Behr believes this is a
holdover from earlier days. ``A lot of these recipes for using wine
and vinegar come from France, and it's a whole function of not
having refrigeration, '' he said. Technology changed, but not the
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   If you still want to add that acidic flavor before cooking,
Bishop recommends no more than a quick dip _ 20 minutes maximum for
fish, maybe half an hour for beef or lamb.
</P>
<P>
   While lemon juice and wine may be out as marinating agents, one
acidic ingredient still has its fans: yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Punjabi food, when you prepare chicken for the tandoor,
there's no question that yogurt breaks down fiber and tenderizes
the meat,'' said David Rosengarten, the Food Network personality
whose latest cookbook, ``Taste,'' was published by Random House
last year. ``Two days for a marinade is OK. Afterwards, it gets
unattractively mushy. I played around once using yogurt marinades
for tough cuts of lamb, and it was a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Science seems to support the yogurt partisans. Not only is the
acid in yogurt far milder than the acids in wine, lemon juice or
vinegar, but it also contains calcium, which McGhee says activates
enzymes in meat that break down the muscle fiber. ``It's
conceivable that the calcium in yogurt may result in the same sort
of tenderizing that you get when you age meat,'' he said. That's a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Short of marinating everything with yogurt, the never-ending
search for other methods of tenderizing tough cuts of meat has led
some cooks to brining, a method akin to pickling. Soaking meat in
mildly salty water, perhaps flavored with herbs, onions and garlic,
actually moistens the interior, making it more tender, without the
drawbacks of acidic marinades.
</P>
<P>
   ``By brining the meat for a few hours, you can actually
penetrate the meat without denaturing it,'' Steiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corriher concurs that brining keeps meat moist and
concentrates its natural flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If the mantra for marinating today is ``flavor, not texture,''
even that irks some cooks. Behr of The Art of Eating sees an
overbearing tendency in the development of modern marinades that
incorporate many different ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to use ginger and garlic and lemongrass and
mangoes, all these strong exotic flavors,'' he said. ``It treats
everything as if it's a chutney _ distinct from what it goes with.
It's too often a counterpoint. It's this age of chaos, in fashion,
in architecture, in the information overload. People are not
thinking about harmonies. They think about slamming stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   One area where even a harmonizing marinade is not necessary is
with an ingredient that is already great and distinctive, like an
excellent cut of meat, which needs no marinade to add flavor. ``I
would never marinate a prime porterhouse steak, never ever in a
million years,'' Rosengarten said. &QL;

   INDIAN CHICKEN THIGHS WITH SAFFRON SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from David Rosengarten &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes plus 24 hours for marinating
</P>
<P>
   For the chicken:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup plain yogurt
</P>
<P>
   3 medium garlic cloves, peeled
</P>
<P>
   \ cup coarsely chopped fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon garam masala
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon ground allspice
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon Indian chili powder
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon ground cardamom
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon ground fenugreek
</P>
<P>
   8 chicken thighs, boned
</P>
<P>
   Salt and black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Fresh coriander leaves for garnish
</P>
<P>
   For the sauce:
</P>
<P>
   2 small onions, peeled and quartered
</P>
<P>
   { green pepper, cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   2 cinnamon sticks
</P>
<P>
   2 whole cloves
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon saffron threads
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons flour.
</P>
<P>
   1. To prepare the chicken, place the yogurt, garlic, ginger and
all the spices in bowl of a food processor. Process for about 1
minute, or until the mixture is smooth. Place the chicken thighs in
a bowl and coat them well with the yogurt marinade. Cover and
refrigerate for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. When ready to cook, remove the chicken from the marinade, and
pat completely dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper.
Preheat the broiler.
</P>
<P>
   3. To prepare the sauce, place the onions, green pepper,
cinnamon sticks and cloves in a heavy saucepan. Add the chicken
stock and saffron, bring to a boil, and cook rapidly for about 30
minutes, or until the mixture is reduced by about two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   4. While the stock is boiling, place the chicken in a broiler
pan. Broil for 7 minutes, turn thighs over, and broil for another 7
minutes. The thighs are done just when they have lost the rosy
tinge at the center. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   5. Continue with the sauce: melt the butter in a saucepan, and
add the flour. Stir for 2 minutes over medium heat. Strain the
reduced chicken stock into the flour-butter mixture, discarding the
solids. Whisk rapidly to blend. Simmer for about 1 minute or until
sauce coats a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   6. Place 2 chicken thighs on each of 4 dinner plates. Pour the
sauce around the chicken, and garnish with a few fresh coriander
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

TRANSFORMING TAPIOCA FROM PUDDING TO PEARL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The appetizer was a vision in shades of pink and green. Chunks
of coral-tinged Alaskan king crab and matchstick cremini mushrooms
topped a frothy sea of moss-colored bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   The flavors of the buttery, slightly briny crab and the earthy,
sweet mushrooms were delicious and familiar. But as for the satiny
bubbles, if it did not say so on the menu, would anyone have
guessed they were tapioca?
</P>
<P>
   While to many Americans tapioca is merely a sweet custard that
brings back comforting memories of childhood, around the world it
has been used for centuries with much more versatility, in savory
as well as sweet dishes. Chefs in New York are catching on to
tapioca's special qualities.
</P>
<P>
   John Schenk, the chef at Clementine, created the king crab
appetizer, mixing tapioca with shiso, a tart Japanese herb. The
shiso provides a little bite, and the tapioca a velvety softness
that is a textural contrast to the crab.
</P>
<P>
   At Tabla, Floyd Cardoz uses tapioca in a savory way twice on the
current winter menu. He mixes it into a pan-fried potato cake that
is served as an appetizer, and pairs tapioca with braised oxtail,
garnishing the entree with fried leeks and beets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really like about the tapioca is that on the tongue, it
feels like the fat of the oxtail,'' Cardoz said. ``And that's what
I'm trying to mimic _ that fatty, gelatinous texture.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Conant of Chianti is aware that not everyone was a tapioca
fan once upon a time, so he does not list it on the menu as an
ingredient in his cacciucco, an Italian seafood stew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that people are ready for it,'' he said, ``and I
worry that some people may be turned off from trying the dish.''
</P>
<P>
   Conant got the idea for his stew from a cooking teacher who used
tapioca to give beef soup depth and sheen. ``When I used to make
cacciucco, the lobster reduction would splash up onto the plate,
which ruined the presentation,'' he said. Tapioca, like flour or
cornstarch, adds body to the broth without making it cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   Because tapioca has no flavor of its own, it can be an ideal
thickener. Another benefit of its inherent tastelessness is that it
fully and deeply absorbs the essence of whatever liquid it's cooked
in.
</P>
<P>
   At Cafe Centro, Julian Alonzo makes a potent ``risotto'' using
tapioca pearls, chicken broth, mustard oil and a touch of coconut
milk. Unlike rice, tapioca has a buoyant mouthfeel that makes it
all too easy to eat, especially when it is not weighed down by
cream and eggs, as it usually is in pudding.
</P>
<P>
   Although standard pudding recipes call for granulated, or
minute, tapioca, purists favor the larger pearl tapioca, which
looks like albino salmon roe. Pearl tapioca, sold at Asian markets
and specialty stores, requires a longer cooking time than the
granulated sort, but rewards the cook with abundant voluptuous
texture.
</P>
<P>
   Derived from the dried root of the yuca, or cassava, pearl
tapioca is a common ingredient in tropical Asia and South America,
where it is used in dishes both savory and sweet. In Asia, tapioca
is added to desserts and sweet beverages.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand, it is also cooked into spicy broths, which are then
pureed to serve as sauces. In Brazil, besides being mixed into
sweetened condensed milk for a sugary snack, the translucent orbs
are traditionally cooked into a rich soup flavored with beef broth
and beaten eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Tapioca probably made its way to Europe in the 17th century
along with other bounty from the Americas, but it wasn't
universally admired. The English liked it well enough, but it
wasn't adopted by any other cuisines, except, moving much further
east, by Armenia, which may have gotten it via Asia.
</P>
<P>
   There, says Geoffrey Zakarian, chef at Patroon, his forebears
combined it with barley and yogurt in a fortifying soup. At
Patroon, he uses tapioca in a vinaigrette drizzled over seared
scallops and pureed sweet peas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It lends textural diversity to the dish, and is nice and easy
in the mouth,'' he said. His customers, he added, ``like to try new
things _ not that tapioca is new, but when I want to find a new
idea, I go back and look for something so old that it seems new.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there just aren't any new ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is lucky for those of us who want more of the old ones,
especially tapioca. &QL;

FAT, IN DUCKS, IS BEAUTIFUL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The part of the duck that scares most people _ its
thick layer of fat _ is actually its best feature, one that makes
roast duck a nearly foolproof dish, absolutely suitable for a
weeknight meal. The fat keeps the meat juicy even when it's well
done _ a distinct advantage, because the breast is best medium
rare, but the legs must be cooked through, or nearly so, to be
palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Duck is so difficult to roast badly that all experienced cooks
seem to claim their procedure is the best. Having tried many
methods in recent weeks, I can say that the results are all about
the same. So I chose the one presented here, which is the easiest
way to guarantee a succulent but beautifully browned bird.
</P>
<P>
   The only method that works markedly better is much more of a
production. First, you steam the duck on a rack over simmering
water until it is nearly cooked, then transfer it to a rack in a
roasting pan and roast in the oven until the skin is good and
crisp.
</P>
<P>
   There are three challenges in roasting a duck. The first is
spattering. All that fat can make a mess of your oven. But the
solution is simple: keep a thin layer of water in the roasting pan.
The fat drips into it and stays there. (You'll need a rack to
elevate the duck, but you should be using one for a crisp bird,
anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   The second challenge is to achieve a uniformly brown color. I
cheat a little bit here and brush the roasting duck with soy sauce,
which works like a charm.
</P>
<P>
   The third challenge is having enough to go around, for a roast
duck can easily be finished by two people. If you want to serve
four, roast two, or plan on a lot of side dishes.
</P>
<P>
   EASY ROAST DUCK
</P>
<P>
   TIME: 60 or 70 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 4- to 5-pound duck
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   \ cup soy sauce, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat oven to 450 degrees. Remove giblets and neck from duck
cavity, and discard or reserve for another use. Cut off excess fat
from duck cavity.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place duck, breast side down (wings up), on a rack in a
roasting pan; add water to just below the rack. Sprinkle duck with
pepper, and brush with a little soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   3. Roast for 30 minutes, undisturbed. Prick the back all over
with the point of a sharp knife, then flip bird onto its back.
Sprinkle with pepper, and brush with soy sauce again. Add a little
more water to the pan if the juices are spattering (carefully,
because you don't want to get water on the duck).
</P>
<P>
   4. Roast 20 minutes, then prick the breast all over, and brush
with soy sauce. Roast 10 minutes; brush with soy sauce. Roast 5 or
10 minutes more if necessary, or until duck is a glorious brown all
over and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh
registers at least 155 degrees. Let rest for 5 minutes before
carving and serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 to 4 servings.

   NEW YORK _ A new question is creeping into wine service in New
York: How do you want that cooked?
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Americans have confounded the rest of the world
by drinking their white wines too cold and their red wines too
warm. Sommeliers no longer hesitate when diners ask that a luscious
Corton-Charlemagne be plunged into an ice bucket. They just do it.
It's easy.
</P>
<P>
   Red wine poses a different problem ince if often arrives at the
table with a slight chill. If the diners want their wine the
temperature of a blood transfusion, and fast, the sommelier must
resort to wiles, and the wiliest wile of all, it turns out, is the
microwave oven.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's the customer who wants his wine 'waved. Sometimes
it's the hard-pressed sommelier who makes the decision to go
nuclear. But it happens. There really are wines that go into that
silent chamber at 58 degrees and come out, like a client at a
tanning salon, flush with radiation and 7 to 10 degrees warmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way any sommelier is going to admit to doing it,''
said Dan Perlman, the wine director at Veritas. ``They'll say,
`I've heard of it,' like I just did. I'm in the clear, though,
because we don't have a microwave.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice is by no means widespread, or even widely known,
but it is something that happens at even the top restaurants.
Alexis Ganter, the wine director at City Wine and Cigar, reacted
with stunned silence when informed about the microwave trick. Then
he let out a long, shuddering sigh and moaned, ``Oh my God.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other members of the ``wine is a living thing'' school,
Ganter expressed deep fear of this new technological breakthrough.
Others showed a native American willingness to at least experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense,'' said Ralph Hersom, the wine director at Le
Cirque 2000. ``I don't see that it would harm a wine, but I'd
recommend doing it with a younger wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others fessed up, some expressing shame, but others not.
``I did it once when I was working at a wine bar in Madison,
Wis.,'' said Eric Zillier, the wine director at the Hudson River
Club. ``It was an '85 Burgundy from Verget, one of my favorites,
but I made the customer, who was very insistent, swear he would
never tell anyone I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Cannon, at the Judson Grill, has used the microwave
and doesn't mind saying so. It's a method of last resort, but it is
a method that works, and he will use it. ``I zap it for 5 to 10
seconds,'' he said. It seems more reasonable than the customer who
wanted his Gaja barbaresco served with ice cubes.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Most Champagne houses turn their bottles by
machine, not hand. The plastic cork and the screw top works just as
well, if not better, than a cork. So why resist the microwave?
</P>
<P>
   ``The microwaves are heating the water, which is the main
constituent of wine,'' said Christian E. Butzke, an enologist at
the University of California at Davis. ``If you do that for a very
brief period _ 10 seconds maximum _ no other chemical reactions are
going to take place, and nothing will be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenolic structure of the wine, Butzke said, should not be
disturbed by the microwaves. ``It is awkward,'' he admitted,
``because you associate a microwave with TV dinners.''
</P>
<P>
   Wine makers, somewhat surprisingly, do not run screaming from
the room at the idea. ``It's not something I'd do with a fine
wine,'' said Richard Draper, the wine maker at Ridge Vineyards,
``but if it's an industrial product, which 90 percent of wine is,
it's been through a lot worse already.'' As for fine wines, Draper
said that his objection to microwaving was philosophical rather
than rational.
</P>
<P>
   Some wine lovers even see magic powers in the microwave. Richard
Dean, the sommelier at the Mark Hotel, used to serve a wine club
that gathered once a month at the Honolulu hotel where he worked.
The members were convinced that warming a red wine in the microwave
for five seconds put an extra five years of age on the wine.
</P>
<P>
   A professional to the tips of his fingers, Dean did not laugh.
He did not argue. Nor did he tell his customers that the hotel had
no microwave. He simply disappeared with the wine, reappeared after
a decent interval, served it, and everyone was happy _ until a
rival hotel snitched on him. ``That was embarrassing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same sommeliers who shrink before the microwave do not mind
employing all sorts of nontechnological tricks, like running a
decanter under warm water before pouring the wine in it, replacing
glasses on the table with glasses that have just come out of the
dishwasher, or even putting the bottle in the dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Funghini, the wine director at the Post House, said that
he has wrapped a bottle in a warm towel. Others plunge the bottle
into a bucket of warm water.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every restaurant, bending to American preferences, has
raised the storage temperature from classic cellar temperature,
which is 55 degrees, to about 60 degrees. (Wines in long-term
storage remain at 53 degrees to 55 degrees, with a humidity of 70
percent.) ``Ninety-five percent of customers will object to 55
degrees,'' said Hersom, of Le Cirque.
</P>
<P>
   Some object to 75 degrees. ``I had a customer, very
sophisticated, who simply liked to drink red wine at body
temperature,'' said Perlman of Veritas. ``He asked that it be
decanted and then placed on a shelf above the stove.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlman has a lot of stories like that. There's the customer who
wanted the Champagne decanted, to get rid of those annoying
bubbles, and the one who wanted to add fruit juice to his
Mouton-Rothschild to make a sangria. Perlman suggested a more
modest red. The customer said no. He wanted a (italics)good(end
italics) sangria.
</P>
<P>
   The microwave, however, seems to be the philosophical point of
no return. Some sommeliers simply cannot cross the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're destroying everything in the wine that makes it wine,''
said Zillier, of the Hudson River Club. ``It's catastrophic.'' When
informed of Butzke's line of argument, he dug in his heels.
``Instinct tells me the fragile biochemical ingredients are going
to be affected by the highly excited water molecules,'' he said.
``You're cooking it. If you put wine in a saute pan to bring the
temperature up, people would laugh at you. What's the difference?''
</P>
<P>
   Convenience, for one thing. Efficiency for another. And one
thing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach, but you do
these things,'' said Perlman. ``After all, the customer is paying
for the bottle of wine.''

<P>
   ``In a case I mediated, the husband and wife were both employed
and had a fairly substantial community estate. However, they seemed
far more interested in ownership of their mutt, Diablo. Each party
told me early in the mediation that they would not settle unless
they got the dog. I told them that we would first divide the
property, and then we would conduct an auction of the dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the property settlement provided for splitting an
$11,000 tax refund. When the bidding began, the wife offered to
give her share of the tax refund ($5,500) for the dog. The husband
rejected the bid and offered his share of the tax refund and upped
the bid by $5,000, a total of $10,500. The wife rejected the bid
and offered the tax refund and upped the bid by $10,000. At that
juncture, the husband blinked, took the $15,500, fell out of love
with the dog, and the wife waltzed away with her valuable pooch.
Both parties were very, very happy.'' _ Harry Tindall, Houston

SWEET POTATO UNVEILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget most of what you think you know about sweet potatoes.
They aren't yams. They come in more than one variety. And they
definitely don't have to be candied to be good.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet potatoes are surprisingly versatile. In fact, unless you
are making a dessert, they're much better when they are combined
with savory herbs and spices, like thyme or cumin, instead of
cinnamon and nutmeg.
</P>
<P>
   They can be used interchangeably with winter squash in soups and
stews. And they are just as delicous served with pork tenderloin or
chicken, lamb or tuna, as they are with turkey and ham.
</P>
<P>
   They are also a nutritional bonanza. Sweet potatoes are loaded
with complex carbohydrates, fiber and important nutrients like beta
carotene, an antioxidant that is believed to help prevent cancer.
Generally speaking, the deeper the orange color, the greater the
amount of beta carotene.
</P>
<P>
   Yams have much less beta carotene, but then they are seldom seen
in this country, despite the labels in supermarket produce aisles
and on cans. Real yams are a South American vegetable. Sweet
potatoes have always been called yams in the South, a name that
comes from an African word, name, but they are not the same.
</P>
<P>
   Five varieties of sweet potato are generally available, and
there's not much difference in taste. Whether they are called
Garnet, Jewel, Beauregard or Hernandez, they are deep orange
inside, no matter the color of the skin. One of the few sweet
potatoes on the East Coast with yellow flesh is the Jersey Sweet or
Hayman, which has whitish skin and is much drier than the others.
But all varieties can be used interchangeably.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say that one variety is sweeter than another, but I
couldn't tell the difference in my taste test. In each variety,
however, there were subtle taste and textural differences from
potato to potato.
</P>
<P>
   To bring out the best in sweet potatoes, do not microwave them.
The result is quick but tasteless. They're best baked, and even
more delicious if cut into strips, tossed with a hint of oil and
roasted at 425 degrees until browned, about 30 minutes. Unlike
white potatoes, they can be pureed in a food processor or blender
without turning gummy.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most valuable piece of information I picked up in a
conversation with the executive director of the Sweet Potato
Council of the United States, Harold Hoecker, is that you are
better off not buying sweet potatoes in June and July, when they
are anywhere from 8 to 11 months past harvesting. The older they
are, the stringier they get and the more wrinkled and shrunken. The
harvest begins in the Deep South in July and works its way north,
where it finishes by Nov. 1. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   2. To make the curry flavoring, add ginger, cumin, coriander,
cardamom, turmeric and optional hot pepper flakes, and stir well.
Add sweet potatoes and stock, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and
simmer for about 20 minutes, until sweet potatoes are soft.
</P>
<P>
   3. Puree soup in batches in blender or food processor. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. (Soup can be made ahead of time and
refrigerated. Reheat slowly to serve.) If soup is too thick, add a
little more stock. Ladle into mugs, top each serving with a
teaspoon of cheese, and stir to melt a little.

CORNWALL AND DEVON BRACE FOR SOLAR-ECLIPSE CROWDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 7)  
 (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ What could eclipse something as historic as a total
solar eclipse in the closing months of a millennium? Answer: good
old everyday greed.
</P>
<P>
   The daytime sun is set to disappear behind the moon in parts of
Devon and Cornwall for up to 2 minutes 6 seconds on the morning of
Aug. 11 _ an event that has not been seen in Britain since 1927.
The next one, indeed, is not predicted to happen until Sept. 23,
2090.
</P>
<P>
   But what is transfixing some people is not so much the fading of
the light as the extraordinary prices that some homeowners in
England's westernmost county believe they can secure for renting
out their homes during what is called ``eclipse week.'' The
one-week rental for some family-sized houses in Cornwall has
quintupled from around $1,600 to around $8,000. A few homeowners
are asking the equivalent of over $16,000, hoping that rich
foreigners or corporations with deep pockets will pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``One or two people are asking astronomical prices,'' said Gage
Williams, the local coordinator of eclipse events, ``but there's
plenty of high-grade accommodation at normal prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has paid anything like'' the highest prices, Williams
said. ``It's people just flying a kite on the Internet. People
should shop around and they shouldn't have to pay prices that are
out of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   In the resort of Newquay, he said, accommodation is roughly 40
percent booked, increasing to 90 percent along the center line of
the eclipse at Penwith, where the eclipse will last longest. (In
Newquay, it will be roughly 1 minute 40 seconds.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This eclipse will be seen by more people than ever before in
human history, and Cornwall will be its first landfall,'' said
Williams. Many of the visitors, he said, will be Americans, who are
among the 100,000 eclipse hunters who chase such phenomena around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the event is momentous. Local authorities are
predicting that up to 1.25 million people will visit for the
eclipse. That's over two and one-half times Cornwall's year-round
population of 480,000 and more than four times the normal number of
290,000 August vacationers. Such is the scale of the anticipated
invasion that the military may be called in to preside over what is
expected to be a traffic jam as dense and enduring as the eclipse
is brief.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers are turning their fields into huge temporary campsites
to turn a buck from the crush. As a result, ecologists are warning
that the crowds will trample delicate flora and fauna. The Cornwall
Wildlife Trust says it is concerned that rare species such as the
silver-studded blue butterfly could be wiped out. The regional
water utility is considering a period of rationing to insure
supplies for the suddenly booming population. And local authorities
plan to plant huge boulders across the access routes to many of
Cornwall's hundreds of ancient monolithic and megalithic sites to
prevent damage by pagan and other revelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is particular concern about megalithic tombs, standing
stones and stone circles,'' said Steve Hartgroves, an archaeologist
at the Cornwall County Council. ``We are liaising with the pagan
groups to try to insure that, as far as possible, the right kind of
things will be going on.'' Police say they will be watching for
narcotics dealers and unauthorized mass celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Even surfers will be ordered out of the water when day turns to
night, according to the region's lifeguard service, which said it
had ordered the beaching for safety reasons. But not all living
things will be grounded: Bats could well make an unscheduled
appearance, duped by falling light levels.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one way out of the crush. The British Pullman,
a luxurious train operated by Venice Simplon-Orient Express, is to
roll into the county on a two-day trip for eclipse watchers. The
eclipse will track across France, Germany, Romania, Turkey and Iran
until sunset in the Bay of Bengal. And while Iran may be trickier
to get to, it does have at least one advantage: Its weather
forecast for August offers 96 percent certainty of a clear viewing.
In Cornwall, meteorologists say, the chances are less than 50-50.

   FORT WORTH _ Immortality _ at least in birding circles _ will go
on the auction block Friday when the Texas Audubon Society sells
the right to name a species of bird recently discovered in the
Amazon. Audubon officials described it as ``a subtly beautiful
antshrike,'' a robin-size bird that eats insects. The bird was
discovered last year by Bret Whitney of Austin, who donated the
right to name it. The minimum bid: $200,000. By PAUL BOURGEOIS.

 &HT;    SYPHILIS TOOK A RIDE ON I-95
 &HT;    Moving in (W) Washington category
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - No one knows why, but an epidemic of syphilis swept
along Interstate 95 in North Carolina during the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   University of North Carolina disease investigators report state
health statistics reveal sharp increases in syphilis rates in 1989
in counties that either have or lie within five miles of I-95
exits.
</P>
<P>
   They speculate the sexually transmitted disease may have
followed an earlier traveler on the same interstate highway:
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   There apparently have been no comparable studies of I-95
counties in other states, said Robert Cook, principal author of a
report on the North Carolina data in the current issue of the
American Journal of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syphilis was concentrated along I-95 in North Carolina and it
looks like it was linked to the influx of drugs in that area,'' he
said in a telephone interview. ``I feel the study presents
supportive evidence that drugs and sexually transmitted diseases
should not be treated as strictly separate problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Syphilis rates in the United States surged in the mid-1980s,
after years of decline, and some public health experts believe the
emergence of a national cocaine market was at least partly
responsible. Cocaine has been related to increased numbers of
sexual partners and less frequent condom use.
</P>
<P>
   Although truck drivers have been implicated in the spread of
sexually transmitted diseases in other countries, Cook said the
analysis found no evidence the I-95 outbreak was related to
truckers or truck stop prostitutes. The trend did not appear in
counties through which I-85, I-77, I-40 and I-26 pass.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina data showed cities not on the I-95 corridor,
particularly Charlotte and Greensboro, also had syphilis rates
above the state average.
</P>
<P>
   There are no large cities in North Carolina on I-95, although
the largest concentration of the disease appeared to surround the
Fort Bragg military reservation, which is near the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, now an assistant professor of medicine at the University
of Pittsburgh, said earlier studies have shown that after large
quantities of cocaine began appearing in the 1980s in metropolitan
areas, the drug spread out from these cities along interstate
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Two cities at opposite poles of I-95, New York and Miami, were
originally the primary entry points for imported cocaine in the
United States, he noted.

LAST-MINUTE ACTION SAVES REDWOOD FOREST DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The head of a California lumber company
agreed at the last minute to sell a huge tract of redwoods to the
state and federal governments for $480 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden decision by financier Charles Hurwitz came late
Monday, just minutes before a midnight deadline and only days after
the boards of directors of the companies Hurwitz controls _ the
Maxxam Corp. and its subsidiary, the Pacific Lumber Co. _ rejected
the entire deal.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber officials contended that environmental
restrictions contained in the deal put too many acres off-limits to
harvesting and would have financially crippled the 130-year-old
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This historic agreement will ensure the protection of one of
the world's most precious resources,'' California Gov. Gray Davis
said. ``I'm delighted that Pacific Lumber accepted this
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The state and federal governments have agreed to buy and
preserve about 10,000 acres of the Headwaters Forest in Northern
California, some of it ancient redwood groves, for $480 million.
The deal represents one of the largest per-acre prices ever paid
for a public park.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Hurwitz agreed Monday to restrictions on where and
when Pacific Lumber can log the rest of its land, about 211,000
acres. The area is home to the coho salmon, northern spotted owl
and a seabird called the marbled murrelet, all of them endangered
species.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton praised the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``These redwoods are a natural treasure, as much a part of our
legacy as the world's great libraries and cathedrals,'' he said.
``I am truly grateful that we are able to bestow this priceless
gift on generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Forestry reinstated the company's
logging license last week. It had been suspended last fall after
the company was found to have violated forestry regulations dozens
of times.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber and its corporate parent, Houston-based Maxxam,
had been negotiating for months with Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., and other officials over the plan to make a public
preserve out of private redwood groves in the Headwaters Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the company is bound to accept environmental
restrictions for the next 50 years. Davis, environmentalists and
state lawmakers insisted on the 50-year contract because they
feared Hurwitz would walk away with hundreds of millions of
taxpayer dollars, sell or bankrupt the logging company, and void
environmental safeguards they worked four years to write.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also requires any changes to the environmental
plan to be reviewed by forestry scientists at the University of
California at Berkeley, not just government officials, an attempt
to avoid political influence over the environmental process.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for fines between $1,000 and $3,000 for each
tree cut down in no-cutting zones near streams and in gorges. Under
the restrictions, for example, trees could not be logged within 30
or 100 feet of some streams, depending on their size, to prevent
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides $380 million Pacific Lumber will get for the 10,000-acre
tract, the company agreed to sell two redwood groves for up to $100
million later this year. These so-called ``lesser cathedrals,'' and
10 more covering a total of 7,900 acres, are protected for 50 years
anyway because they are home to the endangered marbled murrelet.

MICHELIN GALAXY RECONFIGURES AGAIN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The meeting had a slightly undercover feeling to it. A
tweedy, almost courtly man with a gray buzz cut escorted a visitor
to a small, chilly room in a trailer stationed in a driveway of a
gated compound on the Avenue de Breteuil, just a few blocks from
Napoleon's tomb.
</P>
<P>
   His office was being renovated, he said, but it was hard not to
feel as though he wanted to keep it off limits to prying eyes.
Certainly he was as adamant as any spy master about protecting the
identities of his inspectors, whose reports are published in what
is essentially code. Even the number in his employ was a secret.
</P>
<P>
   He himself looks as if he would melt into a crowd, and certainly
not attract a second glance in a restaurant, but his face and his
name are known to many of the top chefs in France. He is the man
behind the Michelin guides, the most powerful ranking of
restaurants and hotels in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Naegellen has worked for Michelin for more than 30
years, rising through the ranks at the 101-year-old tire company to
become director of the red guides in 1985. Sometimes, when push
comes to shove, he has to be the final arbiter on who gets how many
stars, or ``macaroons,'' as they call the highly prized little
rosettes awarded to top restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   A few get one, two or three, but the majority of restaurants
listed in the guides get none. The number of crossed-fork-and-spoon
symbols gives an indication of the quality of the setting. The
coveted stars are reflections of the food only _ or as Naegellen
put it, ``The stars are on the plate.'' Hotels have their own set
of symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Naegellen says the annual decisions are based on the findings
and opinions of a team of inspectors who are far more anonymous
than their boss.
</P>
<P>
   Their descriptions are reduced to symbols in the guides, with no
commentary, but the inspectors are not robots, Naegellen said.
``They are part of a team, but each keeps his personality,'' he
said. ``For that reason, we keep changing them around.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to evaluating a place, the two questions they must
answer are: Would I return on my own? Would I recommend this place
to friends?
</P>
<P>
   As for granting stars, and especially when a restaurant might be
elevated to two or especially three (or have them stripped away),
he said the procedure is to send one inspector, then a second one a
few months later, with perhaps a follow-up visit if necessary.
``Perhaps we'll even send one of our foreign inspectors as well,''
he said. ``We're not in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The process is easier when the chefs and restaurateurs are very
familiar to the Michelin crews, he said. That's why three stars
came so quickly to the new Pierre Gagnaire restaurant in Paris last
year, and why Taillevent in Paris kept its three stars even after
the chef retired in 1991. ``Vrinat is a great restaurateur no
matter who the chef may be,'' Naegellen said, referring to
Jean-Claude Vrinat, the owner.
</P>
<P>
   The French inspectors are all men, although there have been
women in the past, and some women are currently inspectors in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely demanding job,'' Naegellen said. ``They have
to cover a lot of territory, they're on the road most of the time
sleeping in different hotel rooms and eating in restaurants. It's
not conducive to family life.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelin inspectors work full time, and only for Michelin.
Forget about rounding up a group of willing friends for genial
lunches and dinners while checking out the pot-au-feu: mostly, the
inspectors dine alone.
</P>
<P>
   The red guides have been published annually since 1900, except
during the two world wars. Michelin publishes 13 red guides to
cities and countries in Europe. The green guides, in several
languages, give sight-seeing information on many regions of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Naegellen has engineered some changes. ``Le bib
gourmand,'' has been added _ an icon showing the face of the
Michelin mascot, Bibendum (recently slimmed down), in red to
indicate restaurants that provide good value. Last year, there were
458 listed throughout France; this year there are 509. There is
also a two-coin symbol for places with prix-fixe menus for less
than 85 francs (about $14).
</P>
<P>
   Asked about competition from the Zagat guide to Paris, which was
introduced with fanfare last year, Naegellen would only point out
that Michelin receives around 25,000 letters and comments from
readers every year, encouraged by a form in the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come right down to it, we're not Zagat, but we have
always paid attention to our readers,'' Naegellen said. ``We're
trying to do whatever we can to make the guides more
user-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting last year, there has been more general information _
vintage charts, wine maps, international dialing codes. And the
guides constantly add new European cities, including Prague,
Helsinki, Warsaw and Athens. St. Petersburg is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But what about extending Michelin's influence to New York,
Chicago or San Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, the quality is certainly there for the
hotels and restaurants,'' he said. ``We'll probably have to do it
some day. We attempted to get one for the United States going in
the late 1980s, but the logistics were too difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Michelin were to evaluate restaurants in the United
States, would it be biased toward French food? Naegellen explained
that outside France the inspectors are not always French and that
they value the local cuisine in countries like Spain and Italy.
``But if you're talking about England or the Low Countries, the top
restaurants happen to be French,'' he said. ``It's hard to find
good English food.''
</P>
<P>
   The distances from France and within the United States add to
the problems. ``It took us four years to develop a guide to
Switzerland,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of starred establishments has risen by four in
the 1999 red ``Michelin France'' guide, released on Monday. But one
elevation and one demotion kept the number of three-star
restaurants at 21.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Bras, in Laguiole, joined the top-rated three-star ranks
this year. His eponymous restaurant and hotel has headed the list
of potential three-stars for a number of years, according to those
who read Michelin's tea leaves. More surprising, perhaps, is this
year's demotion of L'Esperance in Vezelay from three stars to two.
</P>
<P>
   Three stars to Michelin means ``worth a journey,'' and getting
to Michel Bras certainly requires one: the grand establishment that
grew out of the Bras family's small inn is more or less in the
middle of nowhere, in a town known for cutlery in the mountainous
Massif Central, in south-central France.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of Michelin two-star establishments increased
to 74, from last year's 70. New ones in Paris include Le Violon
d'Ingres, owned by Christian Constant, the former chef of the
Crillon hotel, L'Astor and Le Pre Catalan, both with chefs trained
by Joel Robuchon.
</P>
<P>
   There were some additions and subtractions among one-star
ratings, but the total remains the same as last year's: 405. The
new guide hits American bookstores on Wednesday, for $26.

 By MOLLY O'NEILL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bruce Aidells was doing his Cro-Mag-non shuffle
before the display case at Florence Meat Market in Greenwich
Village. Sporting a large leather newsboy cap, jeans and a denim
jacket emblazoned with the logo of his sausage company, the bearded
and Bunyanesque meat maven shifted from one size 14E foot to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described throwback who claims to ``personally consume at
least 20 times the national per capita average of beef a year,'' he
could barely keep from salivating.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Aidells tried to temper his hopes. The quality
of beef in this country has been going steadily downhill for nearly
30 years, he said. Prime doesn't mean what it used to.
</P>
<P>
   Aidells, the founder of the Aidells Sausage Co. in Northern
California, which produces links like smoked turkey-chicken pesto
and chicken-apple, and his collaborator, Denis Kelly, spent nearly
a decade studying the state of meat in America to produce ``The
Complete Meat Cookbook,'' published in November by Houghton
Mifflin.
</P>
<P>
   Aidells approaches his passion with the cool calculation of the
scientist he once was. He holds doctoral degrees in endocrinology
and physiology and was a cancer researcher before his foray into
the sausage business took him out of the lab for good.
</P>
<P>
   Aidells formulates theories on meat cookery, of course _ but
then he investigates them with a rigorous scientific approach. So
the book became a treatise on modern meat cookery.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it secure his image as a man unafraid of meat,
even in these vegetable-revering times, but it is rife with
heretical ideas. ``Meat has changed in America,'' he says. ``We
need to change the way we cook it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aidells may be a scientist, but he began by learning the
butcher's trade from an uncle when he was a teen-ager. In the
ensuing decades, the growing public clamor for a reduction of the
fat in beef and changes in the way cattle are raised have led to
leaner beef.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2 percent of the beef sold in this country is prime,
the highest Agriculture Department (``USDA'') grade, with the most
marbling from fat, and hence flavor, Aidells says. And very little
prime meat is sold retail. In fact, he says, much of the beef sold
in supermarkets is either choice grade _ a wide category that
includes some decent minimally aged beef _ or is ungraded.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, butchers have become less inclined to take the
time and space to dry-age beef. The meat grows more dense and
flavorful, but it takes weeks to dry-age beef, and the meat loses
up to 25 percent of its weight in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Florence market raised Aidells' hopes with meat that was
well marbled and dark rose, not bright red, in color. In the aging
room, a cool walk-in, hundreds of pounds of beef hung. Beef like
this, he said, needs nothing but salt and pepper and fire to make
its flavor blossom.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he does not scorn modern meat, viewing it instead as
``different meat.'' Getting the best flavor and texture, he has
found, is just a matter of cooking it differently.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the beef sold in the United States comes to market as
``box beef,'' which is cut into sections at far-flung
slaughterhouses, sealed in Cryovac packaging and then shipped. The
beef will age in the Cryovac, but not the way it does when exposed
to air. With this ``wet aging,'' as butchers call it, the meat
grows mushy and takes on a taste not of aging proteins but of
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Moist-heat cooking methods like braising, along with marinades
and dry seasoning rubs, add flavor to today's leaner meat, and
Aidells developed recipes for his book that rely on those devices.
But his overriding discovery is simple: ``Lean meat,'' he says,
``cooks a lot faster than old-fashioned, well-marbled beef.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, he embarked on an experiment.
</P>
<P>
   He secured two porterhouse steaks from the Florence market, and
then headed for the Food Emporium on Union Square. He tried not to
compare the prime beef, by then wrapped in paper and string in the
canvas shopping bag he clutched, with the plastic-wrapped packages
of meat before him.
</P>
<P>
   In both his book and his life, his meat mantra is, ``We have to
get the most from what we have.'' The proper cooking equipment,
heat and recipes, he says, can turn ``so-so meat into a heck of a
meal.''
</P>
<P>
   He selected half a dozen cuts, including one labeled
porterhouse, and hurried north to a friend's kitchen. There, he
strapped on his oversize canvas apron, which more closely resembles
blacksmith garb, and began inspecting and testing his purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The dry-aged steak was all it should be: darker, rose colored,
clearly marbled with fat and dense looking. Aidells gave it his
``slap test'': when he slapped the steak onto a butcher block
counter, the meat was so taut that it bounced a little. He was
thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket steak was barely marbled and looked redder and
very juicy, almost wet. This time, the slap test yielded a light
splattering of juices. The steak not only failed to bounce, but
even seemed to wince and be slightly flattened on impact. The
mushiness that Aidells complains of was evident.
</P>
<P>
   The denser steak, he said, would take longer to cook. Because of
its low moisture content, he said it could be seasoned lightly on
each side with salt and pepper and then broiled, either under the
flame of a conventional home broiler or in a cast-iron skillet on
top of the stove over medium-high heat.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the spongier steak, on the other hand, would need
very high, fast heat to develop a crusty exterior. The relatively
low power of most home broilers would yield a gray, well-done steak
before the meat could develop anything approximating a crust.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For a fair comparison, both steaks were panbroiled in the same
cast-iron skillet. The inch-thick dry-aged steak required five
minutes on each side over medium-high heat to come out rare; the
inch-thick supermarket steak took only three minutes a side over
high heat.
</P>
<P>
   The faster cooking time of the choice meat, however, could not
exactly be called an advantage, Aidells said. The meat was soft,

what you can get with a marinade or a spice rub.'' &QL;

MONICA FOREVER AND EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After Babs interviews Monica Wednesday night, it's all
over, right? No more depositions. No more presidential hugs. No
more ``SNL'' skits. Please, please, puh-leeeeeeeez say it's all
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly,'' says T.V. Skreen, Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Dr. Skreen.
</P>
<P>
   Regular visitors will remember Dr. Skreen as the eminent
broadcast consultant and executive director of the Olden
Polynice/Vin Baker Straight Shooter Academy. In an unprecedented
hourlong interview airing exclusively inside my head, Dr. Skreen
puts the lie to any notion that Monica will be gone-ica after
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Because of space limitations, we can only print excerpts of the
far-reaching, wide-ranging, broad-based and totally imaginary
interview, which took place Tuesday as I was driving I-5 in an '81
Datsun with a broken radio. You'll notice that, despite the austere
surroundings, all of the questions were forceful and hard-hitting,
or, as we like to say in the mathematical arena, F2H2.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: Dr. Skreen, if Monica Lewinsky were a tree, what kind do
you think she'd be?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: A serviceberry.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: And if she were a sport utility vehicle, what kind would
she be?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: An Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: Intriguing. Why do you think her interview with Barbara
Walters Wednesday night on ``20/20'' (9 to 11, KOMO/4) won't be the
last time we hear from her?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: For one thing, you doofus, there's the interview she's
doing Thursday with Jon Snow on Britain's Channel Four Television.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: OK, fair enough. But after that, surely we'll have had
our fill.
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Not quite. Andrew Morton, the guy who did that
best-selling bio of Princess Diana, hits the stands Thursday with
``Monica's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: And after that?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Well, I recently signed her to a personal services
contract.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: Beg pardon?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Let me rephrase that. She has signed a deal with my
company to appear as a pundit on news and public affairs shows.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: Huh? (Notice how hard-hitting that was?)
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: So we might see her on ``Meet the Press'' or ``Northwest
Week?''
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Absolutely. I mean, can you think of anyone else who has
been that close to the president?
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: I'd rather not.
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Me neither. But we owe it to the country to provide
fresh, new perspectives on events of the day.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: But, seriously, Dr. Skreen. Do you think Monica Lewinsky
might have a cogent, well-reasoned position on, say, the Kosovo
peace initiative?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: I'm not familiar with all her positions, but she has
told me on several occasions that she's very much in favor of
peace.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: And you think America will be interested in hearing what
she has to say?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Sure, at least until the next Monica Lewinsky comes
along.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: And then what?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: At that point, we'll probably move into talk radio.

FINANCIER MAY TRADE TREES TO SETTLE BANKING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: With HEADWATERS-FOREST)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As financier Charles Hurwitz negotiated the sale
of the biggest stands of privately held virgin redwood trees in the
world, he and his company, Maxxam Corp., faced $750 million in
federal claims stemming from a failed savings and loan in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Hurwitz agreed late Monday to sell a huge tract of redwoods in
Northern California to the state and federal governments for $480
million.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden decision came minutes before a midnight deadline and
only days after the boards of directors of the companies Hurwitz
controls _ Maxxam and its subsidiary, the Pacific Lumber Co. _
rejected the entire deal.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining redwoods that Pacific Lumber owns could be the
prize that Hurwitz trades to settle a U.S. government enforcement
action designed to win taxpayer restitution for the $1.6 billion
bailout.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Treasury's Office of
Thrift Supervision (OTS) allege in two separate cases that Maxxam,
Hurwitz and five other parties caused the failure of the United
Savings Association of Texas in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The OTS case against Maxxam and Hurwitz, Maxxam's major
stockholder, ended in Houston on Monday. Administrative Judge
Arthur Shipe is expected to rule by the end of the year. The FDIC
case is on hold, pending the outcome of the OTS case.
</P>
<P>
   Maxxam spokesman Robert Irelan called the government's claims
``totally without merit'' and ``an abuse of government power
stimulated by environmental activists'' who came up with a plan to
have the company pay off any settlement in trees.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called debt-for-nature swap was a plot ``to get more of
our trees and not have to pay for them,'' Irelan said.
</P>
<P>
   If Maxxam loses and the agencies succeed in winning up to $750
million in a settlement agreement, environmentalists say the
Houston-based company should pay off in trees.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Little, executive director of the Rose Foundation, a
nonprofit organization in Oakland, Calif., that works on
environmental and economic issues, called a payoff in trees ``a
good business deal for Maxxam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think they're going to be able to cut a lot of the
remaining old-growth stands anyway because of environmental
regulations,'' Little said. ``Getting rid of the environmental
liabilities and at the same time getting rid of $750 million in the
federal banking liabilities in exchange for property that won't
generate commercial income anyway is a good business deal for the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   The OTS and FDIC cases, filed in 1995, proceeded over 17 months
against Maxxam and Hurwitz and five other parties in Houston. The
five others settled last month, without admitting guilt, for more
than $1 million and a promise to refrain from banking activity.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the OTS and the FDIC allege that either Maxxam or
Hurwitz or both deliberately misled the bank regulators, engaged in
sham transactions, failed to keep sufficient capital in the
institution and masked its deteriorating financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agencies charged that the defendants changed a
conventional savings and loan into an institution that bought and
sold high-risk junk bonds and speculative real estate investments.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say Maxxam and Hurwitz engaged in quid-pro-quo
transactions. The bank owners used the institution's cash to buy a
portfolio of Drexel Burnham Lambert, once the leading trader in
junk bonds and defunct since the late 1980s. Drexel returned the
favor by helping Maxxam finance the takeover of Pacific Lumber and
another company, they allege.
</P>
<P>
   Maxxam representatives have denied the charges and contend that
the banking regulators have failed to prove their case.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the company officials said, Maxxam had only a 24.9
percent ownership in United Savings.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the government has argued that Hurwitz had de facto
control of 25 percent because of his influence through contractual
agreements over other owners, primarily Drexel Burnham Lambert.

XTC ENDS SEVEN-YEAR VOID WITH SUBLIME CD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For XTC founder and main songwriter Andy Partridge, the seven
years between the band's last studio CD, ``Nonsuch,'' and the new
``Apple Venus Volume 1'' were literally the best and worst of
times.
</P>
<P>
   Everything went wrong: The band refused to record for its
English label, Virgin, because of what it called an unfair deal.
Partridge's marriage sundered. He had severe hearing problems that
included a burst, bleeding eardrum. Longtime lead guitarist Dave
Gregory left because the songs Partridge was writing didn't lend
themselves to electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   And then, suddenly, everything went right: Partridge discovered
that, while he doesn't read music, he really could do what he'd
been dreaming of for years: make an orchestral CD with the aid of a
sampler bought near the end of making ``Nonsuch.'' He fell in love
with a longtime friend, Erica Wexler, and the two were married.
And, finally, the band signed with TVT in the States (they have
their own label, Idea, in Europe) and released ``Apple,'' a sublime
CD of songs that touch on all of the above, plus sweet childhood
memories, his feeling of awe toward womankind, his hatred of cars,
and sundry other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long, hard slog, and Partridge, speaking by phone
from his home in England, feels ``massive relief'' now that it's
over and the CD is finally out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I've given birth to Frankenbaby _ some alien seed
pod,'' he said. ``I feel vindicated, because for so long we were
legally stuck in the fridge and couldn't work and I felt what I was
doing was right and the material I was writing was good. I felt the
goodness beat back the sea of cack (pooh) we were floating on for
such a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple Venus'' is very good _ smart acoustic/orchestral pop
suffused with sheer idyllic visions of days gone by ``and'' the
sort of savage venom only a dumped spouse can provide.
</P>
<P>
   The former comes on tracks such as ``Harvest Festival'' (an
English end-of-summer celebration) and ``River of Orchids,'' a
fantasy about everyone abandoning their cars and flowers growing on
motor ways. The latter comes on ``Your Dictionary,'' perhaps the
angriest post-breakup song ever committed to tape. ``H.A.T.E. _ is
that how you spell love in your dictionary?'' he snarls, and much,
much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote it to alleviate pain _ I had to let the song out to
let go of the pressure,'' he said. ``The CD was written at a time
when I was all over the map emotionally _ I don't ever want to go
through that hell again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the dark stuff came out, and then I found myself in
love with someone I've known since the 1980s and suddenly I'm
stumbling around in love writing all this lighter, happy stuff. It
was real roller-coaster stuff, but it was good acid for the
battery, good therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   What ties it all together, though, is the music, which marries
XTC's pop to soaring strings and horns. In this way, ``Apple
Venus'' sounds both familiar and fresh, quite an accomplishment for
a group that's been making records since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me if I like classical music, and the truth
is, not much,'' Partridge said. ``It leaves me a little cold. The
reason I wanted to get into strings has more to do with show tunes
and musicals and the type of cheesy light entertainment I had to
sit through as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``English radio in the '50s was incredibly square _ the best
thing about it was novelty records, people claiming they were
Martians or whatever. Waiting for that, I had to sit through a lot
of orchestra leaders playing their hits, and it rubbed off on a
very deep level.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that ``Apple'' is out, Partridge says the next CD will
most definitely ``not'' be seven years down the road, and will
sound more reminiscent of the quirky pop-rock that fans know and
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be much more in-your-face electric guitar,'' he said.
``I'm craving that, like a vegetarian craving a big steak. I
realize some people may be annoyed by the new CD _ `Oh, they've
gotten all mature on us.' I quite like that. I feel a sense of
mischief about this CD. If they consider us middle-of-the-road
that's even more pleasing to me. Because it is.''

<P>
   Q. Where can I buy herbes de Provence?
</P>
<P>
   A. Herbes de Provence, which usually contain some combination of
crushed bay leaves, fennel seeds, lavender, marjoram, rosemary,
sage, summer savory and thyme, can be used like other dried herbs.
Whisk the blend into marinades, dressings or eggs; sprinkle it over
vegetables and meats before roasting, or crumble it into soups,
stews and casseroles. It is available in specialty stores, usually
in little clay pots or rustic-looking miniature burlap bags (often
lined with plastic to keep the herbs fresh).
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Dean and Deluca, 560 Broadway (Prince Street),
(212) 431-1691, carries herbes de Provence in 1.5-ounce tins for
$4.50 and 5-ounce bags for $7. Kalustyan's, 123 Lexington Ave.
(28th Street), (212) 685-3451, sells the herb blend loose for $1.50
an ounce. You may also find it in supermarkets like D'Agostino.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen Ricotta?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you freeze fresh ricotta?
</P>
<P>
   A. You can, but like any other cheese, it will suffer. Fresh
ricotta, with its creamy texture and sweet, milky flavor, is best
used within a day of two of buying it. If you must freeze it, be
advised that it will break down on defrosting. The Italian food
expert Michele Scicolone, the author with Charles Scicolone of
``Pizza Any Way You Slice It!'' (Broadway Books, $20), says the
result is usually too grainy and watery to use in uncooked recipes
like a cannoli filling. It could be used in cooked dishes, where
its unpleasant texture will be hidden by the other ingredients
(like the tomato sauce and mozzarella in lasagna).
</P>
<P>
   Passing the ricotta through a sieve or whirling it in a food
processor or blender can help smooth out the curds, and draining it
in a cheesecloth-lined colander will also eliminate some excess
moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Nonstick Flambeing
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can food be flambeed in a nonstick pan?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not usually. Many manufacturers of nonstick pans use
plastic-based coatings that could burn off if subjected to a direct

warn against placing such pans under the broiler.) There is,
however, one type of nonstick pan that will withstand a flame
because it is made of a specially processed stainless steel. Called
French Cybernox, it is available in New York at Bridge Kitchenware,

   Roasted Parsnip Soup
</P>
<P>
   Q. I had a great roasted parsnip soup in England. Do you have a
recipe?
</P>
<P>
   A. Roasting parsnips intensifies their already sweet flavor,
giving them a complex, caramelized edge. This technique works on
almost all root vegetables, especially those high in natural
sugars, like parsnips, turnips, rutabagas, onions, garlic, sweet
potatoes and carrots. This recipe combines roasted parsnips and
garlic with simmered parsnips for extra flavor.
</P>
<P>
   For a richer soup, garnish each bowlful with a little sour cream
or whole milk yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED PARSNIP AND GARLIC SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds parsnips, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
</P>
<P>
   8 unpeeled cloves garlic, plus 4 cloves peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 leeks, white part plus 1 inch of the green, washed and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 large yellow onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs fresh thyme or 1/8 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   6 cups chicken or vegetable stock
</P>
<P>
   Fresh lemon juice to taste (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Chopped fresh chives or scallions, for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a bowl, toss together half
the parsnip slices, the unpeeled garlic and 2 tablespoons of the
oil. Spread vegetables out in one layer on a baking sheet and
season with salt and pepper to taste. Roast, stirring occasionally,
until they are tender and golden brown, about 40 minutes. Transfer
to a wire rack to cool slightly.
</P>
<P>
   2. While vegetables are roasting, make soup base. In a pot, heat
remaining tablespoon oil over medium heat. Add remaining parsnip
slices, leeks, shallots, onion and thyme, and saute until softened,
about 10 minutes. Add minced garlic, and saute 2 minutes longer.
Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add stock, and bring mixture to a simmer over high heat.
Partly cover pot, reduce heat to medium low and simmer until
parsnips are very tender, about 20 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Squeeze roasted garlic cloves to extract the flesh,
discarding skins. Add to the stock along with the roasted parsnips,
and simmer 10 minutes to meld the flavors.
</P>
<P>
   5. If using fresh thyme, remove sprigs. Using an immersion or
regular blender, puree the soup (you may have to work in batches
with a regular blender). Adjust seasonings with more salt, pepper
and lemon juice, if desired. Serve hot, garnished with the chives
or scallions.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

SENATE STUDY SAYS HOSPITALS, DOCTORS UNPREPARED FOR Y2K GLITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A majority of doctors and hospitals are unprepared
for the year 2000 computer glitch, putting diagnostic equipment and
drug distribution in jeopardy, a Senate committee warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's report on U.S. preparedness for the so-called
Y2K computer problem singled-out health care _ the nation's largest
industry _ as the most ill-prepared to cope with computer
malfunctions that could occur on or after Jan. 1, 2000, when some
computer systems are expected to misread the year 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the health-care industry's lack of
preparedness will necessarily mean loss of life, but it could
seriously impact care for millions of Americans dependent upon
prescription drugs and regular medical treatments to stay
healthy,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate
special committee on the year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   One major problem facing the health-care industry is computer
chips embedded in a range of medical diagnostic devices like
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines and blood-gas analyzers
used during surgery that could cause them to malfunction on or
after Jan. 1, 2000. While many medical device manufacturers have
made sure their devices won't have this problem, the Senate report
said the medical profession has experienced difficulty in getting
information from device manufacturers about their products.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that 90 percent of the more than 800,000
doctors offices nationwide have not fixed their computers to
correctly read the year 2000, which could result in the loss of
some patient medical records. The report also noted that 64 percent
of hospitals do not have computers that will work in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said most large hospitals are
well prepared for the millennium-date change but small, rural and
inner-city hospitals lack the resources to upgrade computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry is the best-prepared segment of the
health-care industry but pharmaceutical firms face potential
problems in dealing with foreign suppliers who may not have
up-to-date computer systems, according to the Senate report.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of the ingredients used to produce drugs in the
U.S. come from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that many foreign countries especially in Asia
and South America are lagging in fixing their computer systems.
Bennett said some countries such as the United Kingdom are in as
good as or better shape than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and Dodd said it was impossible to predict the exact
effects of the Y2K problem or the so-called millennium bug on the
U.S., but they think any problems would be relatively short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally it will be a bump in the road for the United
States,'' Bennett said. ``It will not be crippling.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said it was unlikely the millennium bug would cause
wide-spread power outages or disruptions in air travel in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The financial services and telecommunications industries are
well prepared for the Jan. 1, 2000, date change and have tested
many of their systems. For example, bank customers should be able
to withdraw cash from an Automated Teller Machine on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Dodd said Americans should prepare for Jan. 1 like
they would for a snow storm or a hurricane by having a few days of
food and water on hand. He discouraged people from stockpiling food
and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   More problems may be caused from Americans overreacting to the
Y2K problem than from actual Y2K disruptions themselves, lawmakers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said one of his constituents recently
had $30,000 stolen that he had withdrawn from a bank to protect it
from a potential Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Y2K panel also heard Tuesday from food-service
industry representatives who told the committee that there should
be few disruptions, if any, in the nation's food supply.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Herschel, executive vice president of the Kroger Co.,
which operates more than 1,400 grocery stores, said they generally
have 35 to 36 days of inventory on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Senate approved legislation that provides $500
million for the Small Business Administration to make loans that
will allow small businesses to address any Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and Dodd also briefed the Senate in a closed-door
session about U.S. security concerns related to Y2K, including an
accidental launch of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said Russia's military, nuclear plants and weapons
systems are vulnerable to the Y2K problem, but said the probability
of an accidental weapons launch is ``low.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has invited Russian officials to the
U.S. Space Command headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colo., later
this year to participate in a joint project to assure that any
false computer signals do not lead to an accidental nuclear attack
by either country.

THURMOND ACCUSES WINE GROUP OF IMPROPER INFLUENCE IN LABEL
DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By MARY FRICKER   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) _ Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ One month after the wine industry won a
stunning victory in its battle to tout the health benefits of
moderate wine consumption, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., has called
for a federal investigation into whether the Wine Institute in San
Francisco ``conspired'' with friendly government officials to
promote alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's senior Republican, long a critic of the alcohol
industry, said Monday he is concerned that the 1995 federal dietary
guidelines were improperly influenced by the Wine Institute, the
wine industry's largest trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 guidelines were the first to refer to possible health
benefits of moderate alcohol consumption, and they were the basis
for federal approval Feb. 5 of two controversial wine labels that
allude to those benefits.
</P>
<P>
   After the guidelines were released on Jan. 2, 1996, they became
a centerpiece of wine industry promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since the wine industry began using these dietary
guidelines to promote their product as part of a healthy lifestyle,
I have been gravely concerned that public policy was manipulated
for the purposes of marketing a potentially dangerous product,''
Thurmond said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Wine Institute president John De Luca denied exerting improper
influence on the officials who set the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes in federal nutrition policy he deplores actually
derive from the latest scientific research findings and not from
``political subterfuge' as he charges,'' De Luca said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter debate, building since the guidelines were released
three years ago, broke into open warfare after the federal Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms finally approved the two
educational labels sought for three years by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   One label urges consumers to consult with their family doctor
about the health effects of wine consumption. Another points
consumers to the federal government's ``Dietary Guidelines for
Americans'' for information on the health effects of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Furious, Thurmond last week introduced legislation that would
ban the two new labels, nearly triple federal taxes on table wine
to raise money to finance studies of alcohol's effects, strip the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of its power to approve
wine labels and transfer that authority to the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Thurmond called on the inspector generals at the
departments of Health and Human Services and of Agriculture to
investigate whether the Wine Institute had too much influence on
key government officials charged with developing the dietary
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, which heavily influence nutritional planning,
are updated every five years by a joint committee of the two
departments.
</P>
<P>
   De Luca defended the Wine Institute, saying it offers public
comment each time the guidelines are revised, as do many groups,
and it expects to do so again soon for the 2000 Dietary Guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond expects a reply from the inspector generals within
about two weeks and is optimistic they will launch an
investigation, Thurmond spokesman John DeCrosta said. He said a
thorough investigation probably would take several months.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond asked investigators to look into the relationship
between Philip Lee, a key official involved in developing the
guidelines as assistant secretary of health, and De Luca.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond said Lee deleted references to the ``drug effects'' of
alcohol, inserted by an advisory committee, and Thurmond wants
investigators to find out why.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who now heads the Institute for Health Policy Studies at UC
San Francisco, could not be reached for comment. But when the 1995
guidelines were released, Lee said, ``In my personal view, wine
with meals in moderation is beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   De Luca said he has known Lee for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the most eminent public policy academicians and
administrators,'' De Luca said. ``There's no place in this debate
for personal attacks.''

 &HT;    LIGHTING MARKS NEXT STEP IN WASHINGTON MONUMENT'S REPAIR
 &HT;    430&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the nation's most familiar landmarks glowed
a new blue hue Tuesday evening, lighting the way for another step
toward repairing the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic lighting of 506 floodlights beneath a decorative
sheath capped five months of preparation for a project to repair
and clean the famous obelisk's 38,000 white marble and granite
slabs.
</P>
<P>
   In November, construction began on a lightweight aluminium
scaffolding that now surrounds the 555-foot-tall monument. The $3
million scaffolding, designed by Princeton University architect
William Graves, is a structure unto itself _ not fastened to the
114-year-old landmark for fear of damaging it.
</P>
<P>
   Strips of sheer blue architectural mesh were attached to the
outer girders of the scaffolding, an artistic covering that will
leave the monument visible throughout the restoration. A lighting
system was then wired onto the scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt switched on the lights in a
ceremony Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our worries when faced with this restoration was
ensuring the Monument would retain its beauty despite the work
surrounding it,'' said Babbitt. But with the decoratively draped
scaffolding, ``we quelled those fears and, in fact, achieved a new
level of elegance for one of our nation's most prized structures.''
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after Egyptian obelisks and opened in 1888, the
Washington Monument is a free-standing masonry structure, which
means there is no internal skeleton of steel or iron beams to
support its 90,000 tons. The stones are 15 feet thick at the base
of the monument and taper to 18 inches at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to the weather has eroded and loosened the mortar
joining many of the stones, and cracks have been found near the
top. In addition, the whole exterior needs to be cleaned of grime
accumulated since the last cleaning in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The project, to be completed by mid-2000, will cost about $9.4
million. It is being funded through a public-private partnership
between the National Park Service, a federal agency within the
Interior Department; the National Park Foundation, a private,
non-profit group set up ``to encourage gifts'' to the National Park
Service, and Target Stores, a national chain of discount retail
outlets based in Minneapolis that has helped raise about $6.5
million for the restoration effort. GE Lighting donated the
fixtures, bulbs and design to illuminate the scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   After the scaffolding was completed, the Washington Monument
reopened to tourists on President's Day, Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Workers will inspect the entire monument, and then begin the
needed patching and repointing, or removing old mortar to the depth
of about an inch and replacing it with new mortar. The work is done
mostly with hand-held hammers and chisels. About 64,000 linear feet
will be repointed on the exterior walls, and another 3,900 on the
interior. Any cracks that are found will be sealed. The entire
exterior will be cleaned with low-pressure steam.
</P>
<P>
   The scaffolding surrounding the monument has become an
architectural attraction itself. Graves, its designer, is a
professor of architecture at Princeton. The scaffolding tapers to
conform to the dimensions of the monument, which narrows from about
55 feet at the bottom of the shaft to 34 feet at the top. The
pyramid-shaped top of the scaffolding matches the monument's
capstone, but does not touch it.
</P>
<P>
   The scaffolding contains 37 miles of aluminium tubing. Modules
were built in New Jersey, then taken to Washington on flatbed
trucks for assembly.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of its opening in 1888, the Washington Monument was
the tallest structure in the world. Its observation platform is
reached by a single elevator. On weekends, visitors _ which number
more than 1 million a year _ can walk accompanied by guides down an
iron stairway with 50 landings and 897 steps.

`APOCALYPSE PRETTY SOON': REVELATION MEETS MILLENNIUM MADNESS

Air.'')

<P>
   As the hours tick down to the end of the millennium and anxiety
escalates over the advent of the Antichrist, Y2K bugs and Dick
Clark's ultimate ``New Year's Rockin' Eve,'' I catch myself
fantasizing about the old story of Rip Van Winkle. Ah, to meet some
mischievous Catskill Mountain dwarfs, as Rip did, drink their
sleep-inducing draft and awaken 20 years hence. By then, either
life as we know it will have ceased to be, or the apocalypse will
be sheepishly remembered as a nonevent, like Geraldo Rivera's
opening of Al Capone's safe or President Clinton's impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   I am even more drawn to the notion of snoozing through the turn
of the millennium after reading Alex Heard's ``Apocalypse Pretty
Soon,'' a book populated by the kind of people for whom the phrase
``get a life'' was coined. Heard, an editor at Wired magazine who
has been an editor and reporter for The New Republic, The New York
Times Magazine and other publications, has spent the last 10 years
interviewing many of his fellow Americans who believe that weird
things will happen in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   There are the Unarians, who with an almost poignant faith in the
power of education, expect that in 2001 a stack of interlocking
spaceships will land in the California desert, where a bevy of
extraterrestrials from different planets will establish a New Age
university. Far darker in their predictions are Earth Changers, who
warn that Mother Earth has had enough of humankind's abuse and will
soon unleash a vengeful rash of famine, disease, floods and
continent-altering earthquakes. (Not surprisingly, New York, which
always seems to be doomed in these disaster scenarios, is nowhere
to be found on the Earth Changes' map of the future.) Heard sums up
the Earth Changes' theology with the catchy motto, ``My planet
wants me dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Heard also spent time with dreamers of immortality who make the
self-help guru Dr. Andrew Weil look like Dr. Jack Kevorkian. There
are the life-extensionists who believe that megadoses of vitamins
will keep them breathing for centuries, and the cryonics techies
who plan to keep their bodies (or at least their heads) on ice
until scientific advances grant them eternal life. We also meet a
jolly bunch of libertarians who want to greet the millennium in
their own South Pacific micronation called the Freedominium of
Merica.
</P>
<P>
   To give his subjects their due, Heard resolved that he would try
not to practice what he adroitly calls
``journalism-with-intent-to-kill'' and that he ``would attempt to
understand things from the believers' perspective, always based on
deep immersion in their canonical texts and firsthand reporting.''
Heroically, he plows his way through books with titles like, ``Why
Die?,'' ``If We Can Keep a Severed Head Alive ...'' and ``How to
Start Your Own Country.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Heard's intrepid investigative skills, however, his book
about believers in Revelation, sacred and profane, doesn't contain
many revelations of its own. His big discovery is that most
millennialists, despite their gloom-and-doom predictions, are
upbeat because they have faith that the coming world will be better
than the old. Otherwise, ``Apocalypse Pretty Soon'' simply confirms
something most of its readers already know: it's a big country and
there are a lot of ding-a-lings out there.
</P>
<P>
   Heard's wobbly stance as a cultural anthropologist further
undermines his intellectual authority. In interviewing amiable
subjects like the Uranians or hardcore members of the Christian
Identity movement, he keeps his distance. When, however, he and his
wife attend a weeklong session at a private institute in Virginia
devoted to the study of the paranormal, the quest turns personal:
``I've always vaguely wanted to believe we will exist again as
whooshing spirits,'' he writes. ``Ever since my dad died, in 1979,
I'd slowly moved further in that direction. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when Heard describes going to services at a
Pentecostal church in Harlem for a few months, it is not clear what
he thinks or how he represents himself to the congregants.
Throughout his book, he either needed to take the rhetorical (and
perhaps even emotional) risk of ``going native'' or he should have
maintained his professional boundaries and chanced being seen as
elitist, a criticism that was leveled, for instance, at Wendy
Kaminer and her withering critique of the self-help movement, ``I'm
Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   Heard's relationship to his subjects and their beliefs is
further muddled by his most likable quality as a narrator _ his
sense of humor. Despite his avowal to try to walk a mile in the
millennialists' shoes, he can't help cracking wise at the absurdity
of the sights he is seeing along the way. He is especially good at
dramatizing the goofy dynamic of group meetings where people take
themselves all too seriously. One hilarious highlight is his
description of a Council of All Beings weekend seminar where
everyone is urged to assume the persona of an endangered animal.
``The woman who became Elephant ...'' he reports, ``tried to
upstage everybody with her grieving ...''
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, though, Heard's humor manifests itself in glib,
breezy language that betokens his hipper-than-thou self-image.
Though he professes admiration for Arthur Blessitt, an evangelist
whose goal is to carry an 80-pound wooden cross to every nation in
the world before 2000, he cheekily characterizes Blessitt's mission
as ``humping the timber.'' Heard also has a wearisome habit of
constantly invoking pop-culture icons and, thus, implicitly
trivializing his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Various millennialists and utopians are compared to the likes of
Aunt Clara from ``Bewitched'' and Dr. Zaius from ``Planet of the
Apes.'' To elevate his material above the merely bizarre, Heard
needed to go beyond these coy citations and make substantive
connections to the recurring appearances of utopian and dystopian
crystal-ball gazers in American history. Cogent discussions of
Edward Bellamy, whose 1887 novel ``Looking Backward'' actually
looked forward to 2000, or the Owenites, who established a
19th-century experiment in communal living in Indiana, might have
helped the reader make more sense of Heard's subjects than does the
oeuvre of Don Knotts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ``Apocalypse Pretty Soon'' would have worked better as a
series of magazine pieces in which Heard's witty narrative voice
would not have exhausted itself against the exigencies of writing a
book that purports to be more than just entertainment.

   WHAT: Test Track, Epcot's newest attraction.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN: Though it doesn't officially open until March 17, the ride
is already operating off and on during the park's regular hours.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE: Epcot at Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   ADMISSION: Admission to Epcot is $44.52 for adults, $36.04 ages
3-9. Tax included.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: (407) 824-4321.
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Phil Terpolilli is too young to drive. But at
13, he knows a good ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild,'' he said. ``Especially when you hit 50 miles per
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's more like 65 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But then, all you really feel is the breeze as Epcot's latest
adventure goes whipping around the outside of what used to be the
World of Motion.
</P>
<P>
   Terpolilli, vacationing with his parents from Rochester, N.Y.,
was one of hundreds in line recently for a sneak peak at Test Track
_ a cooperative thrill put on by General Motors and Disney.
</P>
<P>
   A year behind schedule and almost seven years in the making,
Test Track revs up to full speed March 17 and is Disney's longest
and fastest ride. The World of Motion was gutted to create a
150,000-square-foot mock proving ground that cars filled with
guests move through in 5 minutes 34 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Using three on-board computers, the six-passenger cars go
through 34 turns and two braking exercises, climb a three-story
hill and navigate a road lined with 85 signs.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers are bumped around on rough roads, slammed to a halt
and gently misted twice. The electric cars undergo a 100-degree
swing in temperature, although passengers just feel a mild
sensation of hot and cold.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, riders see crash-test dummies do their thing. The
dummies are struck in the chest, banged on the knees and have their
necks bent 720 times during the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   As on real roads, there are also surprises. The vehicle must
practice evasive maneuvers to avoid being struck by a
tractor-trailer.
</P>
<P>
   The real fun begins when the car swings outside the building.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle zooms from 0 to 60 in 8 seconds in the open air. The
grand finale comes on a 50-degree banked turn at 65 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Watching over the Test Track like a mother hen is John Maciarz,
residential director for General Motors Operations. Maciarz's
office is inside the Test Track, and as he makes his rounds he
greets riders as if they were long, lost friends.
</P>
<P>
   Maciarz makes a habit of riding the exhibit twice a day _ once
when he gets to work and again before he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   He's all smiles by the time his Test Track car hits the 65 mph
mark, a limit that was hashed out during the design of the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-five was picked primarily because it was the speed limit
of our nation,'' Maciarz said. ``This is pretty fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the speed limits have risen across the country since
Test Track's inception.
</P>
<P>
   And riders like Brian Sanders, a 28-year-old systems engineer
from Chicago, wanted ``more speed and twists.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Joe Haveman, a 66-year-old commercial pilot from Akron,
Ohio, it was close enough.
</P>
<P>
   Haveman has a brother-in-law who works at the actual GM proving
grounds and has been lucky enough to check out the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like the test track,'' Havemen said. ``Not too bad.
They go faster at the test track. They really hot rod them there,
cause they run at night.''
</P>

WHEN THE SHOE FITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Beginning with Euripides, the great Greek tragedian
of the 5th century B.C., philosophers, poets and literary giants
through the centuries have mused wryly that the gods answer the
prayers of those they wish to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   If only the political midgets who fervently espoused the cause
of limiting congressional terms had accepted the ancient wisdom,
they might not be trapped today in the concept of a selfless
sacrifice they touted for others but prefer not to carry out
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican freshmen who took over the House in 1994 came to
power promising as part of their ``Contract with America'' to
impose term limits on themselves and every other member of
Congress. The issue was a political hit at the time, but now that
reality has set in, some incumbents are as loathe to give up power
as were their long-term predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The House failed to pass a constitutional amendment mandating
artificially short terms for everyone, although it had a high GOP
priority. But individual members of Congress are still stuck with
their personal pledges to put their resignations where their mouths
were _ unless, of course, their constituents don't care whether
they keep their word.
</P>
<P>
   If they keep their promises, nine Republicans and one Democrat
will not seek re-election next year in order to fulfill their
philosophical goal of perpetually churning congressional seats. In
all, 45 House members signed pledges in recent years to limit their
service to six years, and 14 senators similarly agreed to only two
terms, or 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 House members whose six years expire in 2000, four are
now reluctant to give it all up. The most conspicuous is GOP Rep.
George Nethercutt of Washington state, who defeated House Speaker
Tom Foley primarily by depicting Foley as a career politician who
had been around too long.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt crusaded against the value of seniority in the
congressional system, making a great foofaraw about Foley's lawsuit
to block a local term-limits initiative. ``If I can't effect some
change in six years, maybe I'm in the wrong place,'' Nethercutt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, he has discovered that Congress is a nice place to
work and longevity of service brings rank, which has its privileges
and its usefulness. (What a revelation. Tell that to Foley).
</P>
<P>
   House GOP leaders, who need every vote they can get to keep
majority control in 2000, are eager to see Nethercutt and other
potential term-limits hypocrites renege on their promise and run
again. But U.S. Term Limits, an organization dedicated to the
cause, is not going to let its political pawns forget their oath.
</P>
<P>
   The group plans a $20 million campaign to push term limits
during the 2000 election cycle. One of its early moves was to put
up a billboard in Nethercutt's district sarcastically _ or
optimistically _ ``thanking'' him for keeping his word, which he
has yet to do.
</P>
<P>
   The term-limits issue has lost much of its political cachet
since the GOP took over Congress. The party leadership turned
against it, retroactive provisions were barred to protect aging
Republican incumbents and the constitutional amendment was
defeated. In recent elections term limits have helped some
candidates and not others.
</P>
<P>
   The original momentum for the cause was rooted in Republican
frustration that the Democrats had controlled Congress practically
forever. The idea was that forcing a turnover would give GOP
candidates a shot at more seats.
</P>
<P>
   In order to sell this notion, it was necessary to persuade
voters that experience was bad and political ignorance was good.
The less elected officials knew about the way Congress worked, the
better they would be at governing.
</P>
<P>
   And it took some doing to get around that awkward business about
elections, the democratic way voters have always been free to kick
out the bums they don't want without resorting to artificial
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   We needn't weep for legislators caught in a promise they are now
reluctant to fulfill. It is not a surprise that term limits look
less attractive when applied to oneself than when assigned to
others. Euripides, a master of human nature, could have told that
to Nethercutt and his fellow sufferers.

THE ALHAMBRA AND THE CATHEDRAL: TWO ESSENCES OF GRANADA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, March 7)  
 (bl)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news from North Africa is not good. Algeria operates as a
civilian slaughterhouse, Libya a university for terrorism. Morocco
struggles with separatists over the Western Sahara; Ethiopia lives
with endless revolution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chaos and disorder, or so it would seem from our relatively
righteous vantage point across the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So it is enlightening to take a walk through the Alhambra in the
crisp, January sunlight of Andalusia and then make one's way down
the hill and into the Cathedral of Granada, keeping in mind all the
while the violent separations between Islam and the West that we
read about in our newspapers every day. It is like passing from an
exquisite daydream into the house of a superpower, political will
exuding from every stone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral, two square blocks of immensity and complication,
announces the defeat of the heathen. Granada was the last major
outpost of a Moorish domination that at its high point threatened
France and for 800 years controlled most of Spain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the surrender of the Alhambra _ part hilltop fortress, part
palace of kings _ in 1492, the shoring up of Christianity called
for strong measures, and under Queen Isabella's direction the
cathedral was begun, rising slowly over the duration of the 16th
century. It stands in what is now the middle of the city. The plan
was Gothic but the execution Renaissance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The connoisseur will find beauties in this church _ perhaps the
stained glass windows brought from Flanders or the gold and white
of the Capilla Mayor, or main chapel. Untrained, less articulate
eyes like mine feel it more from the gut. This is architecture as
threat. The intimidation begins with bigness. And indeed, to walk
between the two towering banks of organ works in the cathedral's
center is to run a certain gantlet: a stray chord is an alarming
prospect, capable of devastating the ears of unwary civilians from
both sides. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Granada's cathedral is big, but also aggressive. Here God is not
in the details but in the ornament. Every square foot to spare is
devoted to it. Decoration squirms across the chapels, demonstrating
an aliveness to foes of the Christian church. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the hill above the Cathedral of Granada, within the walls of
the Alhambra, stand the Nasrine palaces. They are essentially from
the 14th century, built by Yusef I and his son Mohammed V. If the
cathedral's columns are thick and powerful, supporting great
weight, those of the Alhambra are like the slender legs of
beautiful women. The cathedral's interior stretches nearly 400 feet
in length and rises 200 more. The Court of Comares in the Alhambra
shrinks those dimensions by three fourths and yet projects an
unparalleled air of spatial freedom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The graceful, reticent decoration and inlay of the Moors gives
the eye a sense of lightness. And then there is the sound of water:
fountains with plumbing so subtle that they are constantly but
never obtrusively in the ear. At Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater
in western Pennsylvania, water comes in a powerful rush,
unavoidable and dominating every aspect of the house built above
it. The Alhambra never insists. A European visitor in 1494 remarked
on its properties as ``so magnificent, so exquisitely executed that
even he who contemplates it can scarcely be sure that he is not in
a paradise.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paradise, indeed. This is architecture as seduction. Modern-day
suicide bombers sacrificing themselves in the market squares of
Jerusalem are promised something like it beyond the grave. Is it
visions like the Courtyard of the Lions and the Gardens of El
Partal that appear before them as they detonate the explosives
strapped around their middles? V.S. Naipaul has described the
Islamic political mind and its failed attempts to create a real
world in the image of an imagined one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Alhambra is an earthbound dream of paradise on earth. In one
courtyard are two arches _ one round and one pointed. The visitor
looks through them to a wall on which the shapes of both arches are
repeated, now superimposed on it. The arches _ first real, then
idealized _ constitute an act of promise and fulfillment. This is
religion for the eye. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Generalife sits still higher than the Alhambra proper, a
summer palace above the heat and administrative din. It is
approached and ultimately surrounded by gardens. Once many of them
grew food; now all are decorative, but it is their placement that
beguiles. For those who take the ascending pathways, every glance
and turn of the head has been anticipated: always something new and
something pleasing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spanish builders made their own imprint on the Alhambra, but
after the 18th century its maintenance was let slide. Washington
Irving, a diplomat attached to the U.S. legation in Madrid in the
1820s, came upon it in the hands of a small family of caretakers.
Enchanted, he lived in the ruins for four months and absorbed the
stories and histories that became his ``Tales of the Alhambra.''
Here we read of Boabdil, the last of the Moorish rulers, who
climbed the Hill of Tears and looking back on his loss uttered the
legendary ``Sigh of the Moor.'' A lot of the Alhambra's history is
just plain wrong, but so compelling that it ought to be true and so
in a sense is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is unwise to confuse the beautiful with the good. This
particular paradise struggled with insurrections from below and
cruelty within its walls. Legend or fact has it that in the
exquisitely decorated Hall of the Abencerrajes, one paranoid ruler
had the throats of many of his knights cut en masse. The marble
pool in its center bears stains. Blood, say romantics, though iron
oxide is more likely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Alhambra is pleasant in winter. There are fewer visitors;
mornings and evenings are chilly but the midday sun is surprisingly
warm. The forests on the surrounding hillsides (another example of
the Moorish way with water) are stripped of foliage, and it is easy
to trace the imposing fortress walls through bare branches along
the steep Cuesta de Gomerez. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cathedral of Granada _ huge, heavy and best seen from the
top of these walls _ looks back with another kind of militancy.
Violence and beauty coexist in both these sacred places, and yet
what different paradises they occupy.

   BKC-ACC-DUKE _ The 46th annual ACC Men's Basketball Tournament,

Charlotte Coliseum. Can anybody beat the No. 1 Blue Devils? Not if
they are hitting on all cylinders, say basketball experts. Some are
even saying that this is the best Duke team Mike Krzyzewski has

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms, some with brief downpours and gusty
winds, will develop Wednesday ahead of a cold front sweeping across
the Southeast states. A few thunderstorms may approach severe
levels across the eastern Carolinas and eastern Virginia later
Wednesday or Wednesday evening as increasingly humid air from the
Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico is lifted by a potent jet stream
disturbance trailing the cold front. If severe weather develops, it
will be limited mainly to small, isolated pockets of damaging
winds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rain will gradually spread across the Northeast
states from the eastern Great Lakes Wednesday and Wednesday night.
Rain will begin as wet snow in parts of upstate New York and
northern New England. In the wake of the system, moderate to
locally heavy wet snows will fall on mountain slopes in
west-central Pennsylvania as developing winds from the west are
forced to rapidly ascend the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean winds gusting over 75 mph will lash parts of the Oregon
coast Wednesday as an exceptionally strong Pacific low pressure
system slowly pushes northeast across Washington's Puget Sound.
Strong onshore winds will fuel rains in western Washington and
Oregon, with west-facing slopes of Oregon's Coastal Range likely
being deluged with the heaviest rains. Peals of thunder will
accompany some of the rain as a pool of very cold air at 17,000
feet arrives over western Washington and destabilizes the
atmosphere. Heavy mountain snows will fall in the Cascades of
Washington and Oregon and the Bitterroots of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Lake-effect Slowdown
</P>
<P>
   The Great Lakes are an efficient snow machine, manufacturing
snow whenever Arctic air is moistened in transit over relatively
warm waters. In late winter and spring, this lake-effect-snow
machine operates at reduced capacity, owing largely to the waning
chill of Arctic air and the icy surface waters of the Great Lakes.
Indeed, on Monday, only light snowfalls were observed at low
elevations downwind of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. But elevation
made a difference as 18 inches of snow fell at Montague, a town
located near 2,000 feet on the Tughill Plateau of northwest New
York.

African-American voters made up 30 percent of the total votes cast,

BOND PRICES RISE AS TRADERS COVER SHORT POSITIONS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices rose on Tuesday for only the second time
in almost a week as market participants covered short positions
after a benign report on new-home sales.
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing to higher prices were the unwinding of
positions in front of a large amount of corporate debt expected to
be priced during the next few days and the attractive yields
resulting from recent selloffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike existing-home sales, which rose to a record level in
January, new-home sales fell modestly during the month,'' said
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, ``and
while this was the second consecutive monthly decline, the sales
pace is still at historically high levels and shows no definitive
signs of slowing as of yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although rising mortgage rates could dampen housing activity in
the short term, Fine added, ``keep in mind that housing is the
leading edge of broad economic momentum, and the economy's
rip-roaring advance is not likely to slacken significantly until a
housing slowdown is under way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a separate report that the Conference Board's index of
leading economic indicators rose 0.5 percent in January did not
suggest a slowdown in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the market's recent swoon and concern about rapid
economic growth and Federal Reserve intervention, Fine said the
odds that the Federal Open Market Committee would raise interest
rates at its March 30 meeting were slim but that there was a good
chance that the committee could shift its stance in favor of higher
rates in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the recent onslaught of strong economic data, the labor
market data to be released this Friday could prove very
instrumental in this decision,'' Fine said.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 24/32, to 94 26/32.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price,
fell to 5.61 percent, from 5.66 percent on Monday. The two-year
note gained 3/32, to 99 24/32, to yield 5.13 percent, down from
5.18 percent the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury was an active seller of debt on Tuesday, selling
$10 billion of new 52-week bills and $19 billion of 12-day cash
management bills. The 12-day bills are used to meet the Treasury's
short-term cash needs and are an addition to its regular schedule
of debt sales.
</P>
<P>
   The auction of 52-week bills went well, analysts said, thanks to
the increase of nearly 30 basis points in yields since last month's
auction. The bills were awarded at an average rate of 4.665
percent, with the number of bids the best since last September's
auction. The rate of the 12-day cash management bill came in at
4.79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the bond market, Colombia sold a five-year note
that was priced to yield 11.587 percent, or 6.3 percentage points
over the comparable Treasury issue. The issue was another
indication that Brazil's devaluation of its currency in January has
had much less fallout than feared.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first bond that Colombia has sold since Russia
devalued the ruble and defaulted on some bonds last August. The
high yield attracted enough investors to raise the issue to $500
million from $400 million, said Rachel Hines, the managing director
for Latin American capital markets at J.P. Morgan Securities, one
of the joint lead underwriters on the issue.

ALBRIGHT DOWNPLAYS PROBLEMS IN U.S.-CHINA TIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ On her departure from China on Tuesday, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright put the best face on the fractured
U.S.-Chinese relationship, saying it was mature enough to withstand
sharp disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   As she headed for Thailand for talks about that country's
economy, she lauded the Chinese for the ``depth and ease'' of her
discussions here, which were crammed into less than 48 hours. She
emphasized that there would be no going back on the Clinton
administration's policy of broad engagement with China.
</P>
<P>
   In short, she suggested, the United States has managed despite
the rough bumps of the last few months to get beyond a relationship
whose health depended primarily on one issue, whether human rights
or trade or national security.
</P>
<P>
   But in each of those areas, which were the hottest topics in the
talks, Albright and her advisers acknowledged that they still faced
significant obstacles in China and at home in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On human rights, Albright told the Chinese authorities that the
recent arrests and long prison sentences for members of a fledgling
opposition party were a breach of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, not just an internal matter as the Chinese insist.
From the U.S. point of view, she said, the political stability that
China values so highly cannot be bought at the price of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Fairly predictably, her advisers said, the Chinese rejected the
arguments. But less predictably, a senior administration official
said, the Chinese did not ``go through the roof'' as they have in
the past at the mention of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the official said, slow progress is being made in
persuading the Chinese to set up an information exchange on
prisoners that would allow the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to have
regular contacts with the Chinese Foreign Ministry on the status of
individual prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese were also told that the visit of the Prime Minister
Zhu Rongji to Washington in early April would present them with an
opportunity to make a positive move on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   To coincide with his visit, Albright suggested that the Chinese
formally agree to one of the United Nations civil rights covenants
they have signed but not yet ratified: the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights or the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Congress remains angry over China's human rights policies, and
the recent arrests and sentences of opposition party members in
China has heightened the antagonism.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of this renewed ire, the Senate unanimously adopted a
resolution last week urging the administration to condemn China at
the annual meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva,
which will begin at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   One of Albright's tasks on this trip was to assess whether the
administration should introduce a resolution against the Chinese in
Geneva and what effect it would have on the Chinese leadership, who
have always interpreted such resolutions as highly negative acts.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Albright's talks, her advisers said, no decision
was made on the touchy subject _ but they allowed that it was not
such a bad idea to keep the Chinese guessing.
</P>
<P>
   In another area of discussion _ China's possible membership in
the World Trade Organization, which governs global trade _ Albright
came away somewhat heartened.
</P>
<P>
   Her aides said that for the first time, Zhu, who has major
responsibility for the economy, appeared to understand the positive
aspects for China of joining the trade organization, even as the
Chinese economy was being shaken by slowing growth.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has hammered at the idea that opening the
Chinese market for services, goods and agriculture are likely to
create job growth, not job loss, as the Chinese have feared.
</P>
<P>
   While the prospects for China's entry to the trade organization
have improved, officials said, the details of the concessions China
was prepared to make for what the administration insists must be a
``commercially viable'' agreement, were far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   China sees membership in the World Trade Organization as an
opportunity to enhance its national prestige and to insure that
other countries cannot discriminate against Chinese products. The
United States, which has a virtual veto over who can join the
Geneva-based organization, believes that membership would force
China to agree to a schedule for lowering tariffs and trade
barriers and would subject China to the rulings of the trade
group's court, which enforces trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is due in Beijing
on Wednesday and will make a specific proposal that addresses the
outstanding issues, a senior administration official said. ``After
her visit we'll have to see where we are,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration has, for the moment, made the trade
organization its central focus in the relationship with China,
there are problems with gaining support from Congress for Chinese
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Various interest groups in Congress will be taking a close look
at how the administration negotiates requirements for market
openings in such areas as agriculture and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, China would no doubt tie its agreement to join to
ending the annual vote in Congress on whether China should have
``most favored nation'' trading status _ which despite its name
means the basic rights enjoyed by most U.S. trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, several aides to Democratic senators said
recently, that lawmakers will favor waiving the annual debate over
the economic relationship between the two countries. At the very
least, they said, senators will want to see improvement by China on
the human rights front in exchange for granting permanent trade
status.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist in China's economy, Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow
at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that the Chinese
are nervous about their prospects in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has got only one carrot _ that is permanent
trade status _ but the Chinese say, `What if we don't get the vote
in Congress?' '' Lardy said. ``The Chinese say, `We've made all
these concessions but what do we get?'''
</P>
<P>
   On U.S. national security interests, which have also riled
Congress, Albright had to reply to some tart complaints from the
Chinese about Washington's intentions to deploy a missile defense
shield in Asia. The Chinese view this plan, which could involve a
protective shield around Taiwan, as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's answer was apparently equally tart: ``I replied that
instead of worrying about a decision that has not been made to
deploy defensive technologies that do not yet exist, China should
focus its energies on the real source of the problem _ the
proliferation of missiles,'' she said at a news conference today.
</P>
<P>
   China should use its influence on North Korea to help restrain
missile development there, she said. And China should work with
Taiwan to reduce tensions so that the Chinese can reverse their
recent buildup of missiles on the Chinese coast opposite Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   If the missile threat from North Korea and China were not
perceived to exist, then the need for a United States missile
defense shield in Asia would diminish, she said.

 &HT;    Cox Cable expands East marketBy Charles Haddad

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Communications has added more than 100,000 new
subscribers in a series of transactions that gave it cable TV
systems in New England and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   These deals are part of a strategy by the Atlanta-based cable TV
concern to expand in areas where it already has a high
concentration of subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clustering strategy continues to pay off in our ability to
offer new services more efficiently to a larger number of
consumers,'' said Jimmy Hayes, Cox Communications' chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The largest group of new subscribers were gained in a series of
swaps in New England with cable operator MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications took control of systems representing 105,000
subscribers in Enfield, Conn., and Westerly, R.I. It traded away a
series of smaller systems scattered across Massachusetts. The new
systems join a New England cluster, which already has 428,000
subscribers and is Cox Communications' third largest.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, Cox Communications bought a system with 11,000
subscribers owned by 1st Commonwealth Communications. The system
serves the Virginia communities of Gloucester, New Kent, West Point
and King and Queen County.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications already has 394,000 subscribers in the
Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Newport News areas.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of neither the Virginia nor the New England deal were
disclosed. The deals are expected to close in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is one of the largest cable TV operators,
with 3.8 million subscribers in Oklahoma City, Okla., Phoenix,
Orange County, San Diego and Las Vegas, among other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is controlled by Atlanta-based Cox
Enterprises, which also owns the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
newspaper.

 &HT;    Holyfield feeling better after flu
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Evander Holyfield, who in 1995 was admonished for
keeping secret a virus he had before a loss to Riddick Bowe, vows
that a recent bout with the flu will not affect him in his upcoming
heavyweight title unification against Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling a lot better now,'' said Holyfield, who resumed
full workouts last week after missing three days of sparring.
``With Bowe, I didn't start feeling better until the week of the
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who meets Lewis on March 13 at Madison Square Garden,
missed workout sessions Thursday and Friday, Feb. 18-19 and didn't
spar the following Monday, Feb. 22. He returned home to Atlanta and
was examined by physician Dr. Christopher Vaughns, who prescribed
an antibiodic. Holyfield also took a blood test.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are coming out with this flu bug, especially
in the South,'' Holyfield said. ``The big thing for me was just to
not take it for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995, Holyfield knocked down Bowe in the sixth round
of their third fight but didn't have the energy to finish his
opponent. Bowe rallied and stopped the depleted Holyfield in the
eighth. After the fight, Holyfield admitted that a virus, which he
previously had claimed cost him only a few workouts, actually hung
with him for three weeks. Fitness coach Tim Hallmark said Holyfield
ran and lifted weights only twice during that span. Officials of
the Nevada Athletic Commission criticized Holyfield for
understating the seriousness of his illness.
</P>
<P>
   Fight night
</P>
<P>
   Fight Night VIII, a black-tie boxing fund-raiser, will be held
tonight at the World Congress Center. Joe Frazier, Michael Spinks
and Mills Lane will be among those in attendance. Five fights are
on the card, headlined by WBC Continental Americas light
heavyweight champion Napoleon Tagoe (18-1) of Atlanta against Ray
Berry (17-2-1) of Sevierville, Tenn. The event, which benefits
inner-city youths, is sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande returns
</P>
<P>
   Henry Akinwande, ranked as the WBA's No. 1 contender, fights for
the first time in 15 months Saturday when he meets unknown Reynaldo
Minus of the Bahamas in Minneapolis. Akinwande was to meet
Holyfield June 6, 1998, but the fight was canceled when Akinwande
tested positive for hepatitis B. Holyfield has said he would fight
Akinwande in his next defense if he defeats Lewis, possibly in
South Africa. Akinwande took a blood test in December that came
back negative.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis responds
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he was amused by Holyfield's prediction of a
third-round knockout. ``I fail to see the realism in that,'' Lewis
said from his camp in the Pocono mountains in Pennsylvania.
``Evander Holyfield never knocks anybody out in three rounds. But
it's interesting that he's making predictions for the first time.
He says he's going to come straight at me, which is great. That
will make it an easier fight for me. He'll be right there to hit.''

   EURO (Frankfurt, Germany) _ In the two months since the European
single currency was introduced, pretty much the only direction it
has moved is down. From a buoyant and technically smooth start-up
on Jan. 4, the euro has steadily slipped against the United States
dollar. An initial exchange rate of $1.17 is now around $1.09. The
decline has surprised most experts and puzzled the overseers of the
new currency at the European Central Bank. It could also strain
relations with the United States, where government officials now
loudly complain that Europe has to do more to stimulate world
growth. By Edmund L. Andrews.

 &HT;    LATIN AMERICA SPECIALIST'S BOOK CATCHES CLINTON'S ATTENTION
 &HT;    200&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton spent part of his long weekend at
a Utah ski resort consumed by the ruminations of Emory University
Latin America specialist Robert Pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton read Pastor's ``Integration with Mexico,'' a treatise on
the need for formalizing what has become one of the most
complicated and comprehensive bilateral relationships in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is, number one, to help people understand that we
are part of a larger region, North America, and that this region
accounts for the largest share of our trade in the world,'' Pastor
explained in a telephone interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He argues in his book for the creation of a permanent North
American Secretariat, made up of government officials and private
citizens from Canada, the United States and Mexico, to devote
fulltime policy attention to emerging issues in the multi-faceted
and often vexing relationship among the three countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``An inter-governmental organization is necessary at this
time,'' said Pastor. ''There's nothing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had no comment Tuesday on whether Clinton, who
visited Mexico last month, had embraced the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I hope so,'' said Pastor. ''That would be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tapped the former Carter administration aide as his
choice for U.S. ambassador to Panama in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination fell prey, however, to the opposition of Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C. Now chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Helms still blames Pastor for policies that will result
in the handing over of the 85-year-old Panama Canal to Panama at
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Internet marketer Amazon.com sells Pastor's book for $8.95 and
ranks it number 981,468 on its in-house best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   For Pastor's latest thinking, though, readers will have to wait
until this summer's release of his newest effort, ``A Century's
Journey: How the Great Powers Shape the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastor was hammering out the final chapter Tuesday afternoon _
and facing a Wednesday morning deadline for delivery to his
publisher.

 &HT;    Robinson takes plea on solicitation charge
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The attorney for Falcons Pro Bowl free safety Eugene
Robinson accepted a plea bargain Tuesday in Miami that will allow
the player to enter a pre-trial diversion program that could result
in dismissal of Robinson's charge of solicitation on the eve of
Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 35, did not appear Tuesday morning in county court for
his arraignment on the misdemeanor charge of soliciting oral sex
Jan. 30 from an undercover police officer, but his case is all but
resolved anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, one of about 25 people arrested the night before Super
Bowl XXXIII in a prostitution sting operation in Miami, will not
have to go to trial. But he must take an HIV test and enroll in an
AIDS awareness program near his home in Woodinville, Wash., outside
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he complies, . . . essentially we will dismiss the charge,
as long officials in Seattle verify that the programs there are
similar to what we have here,'' said Don Ungurait, spokesman for
the Florida state attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney's offer is contingent upon proof that
Robinson had not been charged previously with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl cornerback Ray Buchanan will have arthroscopic surgery
today to help re-attach a ligament that tore partially loose in the
back of his shoulder last season. . . . More than a dozen Falcons
officials traveled to Greenville, S.C., on Tuesday to inspect the
campus of Furman University, where training camp is scheduled to
begin July 29. . . . Former Vikings defensive tackle Jason Fisk, an
unrestricted free agent, visited team officials Tuesday afternoon,
but he appears likely to accept a substantial offer from Tennessee,
where he probably would start. . . . Former Redskins defensive end
Rich Owens, who missed last season with a torn anterior cruciate
knee ligament, might visit in the next week. He already has been to
Miami. . . . If Tony Martin's trial on five counts of money
laundering and one count of conspiracy is delayed until next year,
Atlanta officials say they might be interested in bringing back the
wide receiver whom they waived Friday. . . . The agent for former
Minnesota and Jacksonville defensive end Fernando Smith, whom the
Falcons courted last season, has told general manager Harold
Richardson that his client would like to play in Atlanta.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, there was a brief fling with a prostitute. Then, a month
later, a flu-like illness.
</P>
<P>
   For one man, that's all it took to get the ball rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that he'd contracted HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,
the man went to a doctor for an expensive genetic test to detect
the virus. It came back negative.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he'd used a condom during sex, he didn't believe the
test. He took another. And another.
</P>
<P>
   Over many months, the man had more than 100 tests to detect HIV
antibodies, the standard test for HIV infection. He spread them out
over 30 different labs, taking as many as four or five a week.
</P>
<P>
   Because it takes time after infection for antibodies to form, he
also took many expensive tests designed to detect the virus itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the negative results rolled in, it simply solidified my
belief that I was infected with some unusual variant of the virus
that was eluding detection,'' he wrote on an HIV-related Internet
Web site called The Body. ``My obsession and fear went well beyond
excessive testing. My life, which was previously productive and
active, was reduced to surfing the Internet for information on
(HIV). Often, I would stay up all night reading about (HIV).''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the man said, he spent more than $20,000 on tests,
nearly lost his job, tried to commit suicide and had to seek
psychiatric treatment. He still gets tested, but only once every
few months. He's still negative.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Sowadsky, a counselor for the Nevada AIDS Hotline who
staffs a question-and-answer forum on the Web site, said the man's
posting is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who take the test over and over and over, and
usually the issue isn't HIV,'' he said. ``Usually the issue is,
they've done something sexual that they're remorseful about, and
they're punishing themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sowadsky said it's become easy for him to distinguish between
postings by people with legitimate concerns about infection and the
``worried well'' _ people at low risk who believe they're sick
despite medical evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   For many such people, the Internet has become an engine driving
their fears. Loaded with medical information, including
hard-to-interpret scientific studies and vague descriptions of
general symptoms, it's a big, scary world where ``fatigue'' could
herald anything from sleep deprivation to leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   HIV may be especially fertile ground for such concerns, being
infectious, potentially fatal, and linked to activities that carry
heavy social baggage. But any message board on America Online, from
colon cancer to chronic fatigue, contains postings from people
trying to diagnose themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Message boards and Web sites exist for almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet search using the Yahoo search engine, for example,
recently turned up 42 sites mentioning chronic fatigue syndrome.
Crohn's Disease, a chronic intestinal disorder, got 37 sites.
Lupus, an inflammatory illness, was mentioned on 75 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Even highly unusual conditions, such as the inflammatory disease
Wegener's Granulomatosis, have an Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   For people who are truly ill, and whose maladies have been
diagnosed by doctor, the Internet can be immensely helpful _ a
place of virtual support groups and up-to-date news flashes.
</P>
<P>
   For people who simply think they're sick, it can be a minefield.
</P>
<P>
   In a very general sense, people who are overly concerned about
their health are called hypochondriacs. They feel every pain
acutely and believe the worst. A muscle pull becomes kidney
disease. A swollen lymph node becomes cancer.
</P>
<P>
   True hypochondria _ a sometimes debilitating preoccupation with
health or dread of disease _ is not very common, doctors said. It's
not the same as being briefly worried about a single symptom until
it subsides, or until a doctor explains it.
</P>
<P>
   Hypochondriacs often focus on one particular problem or illness
that they believe they have. That ``illness'' may have many
symptoms. Once identified, hypochondria itself can be treated with
antidepressant medications and therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all who question a set of symptoms on the
Internet are truly hypochondriacal. They may really have a physical
problem.
</P>
<P>
   But when they've already been checked out by a doctor and given
a clean bill of health, the potential for hypochondria is there.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Parlane Reid, a psychiatrist at Sarasota Memorial Hospital's
Bayside Center for Behavioral Health in Sarasota, Fla., said
hypochondriacs do feel a need to research each perceived illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to find out about it, try to understand it, and see
what they can do to fix it,'' he said. ``My guess is that because
(the Internet) is a source of information, people are going to look
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Brownlee, chairman of the Department of Family
Medicine at the University of South Florida, said he'd rather have
educated patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a question of how well-educated they get on the
Web,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, aside from serving as a hotbed for bad
information and scams, the Internet also contains highly technical
information. Journal articles and studies, for example, rely
heavily on statistics and scientific language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previously all this medical information was just being read by
medical professionals. It wasn't for the general public,'' said
Sowadsky. The Internet is not increasing hypochondria, he said, but
``it's making it worse for many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joel Gallant agrees. A physician at Johns Hopkins University
in Baltimore, Gallant staffs an Internet question-and-answer forum
on treating HIV.
</P>
<P>
   He gets ``worried well'' questions, too _ lots of them. Because
his focus is on HIV treatment, most of them he simply deletes. But
sometimes he uses sarcasm or even scorn to remind people that their
fears are groundless: that HIV won't go undetected by blood tests
for years, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Gallant acknowledges that the Internet can contribute to
unwarranted health panics.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have to say before the Internet there were still a huge
number of people who were what we call Tthe worried well,' '' he
said. ``I don't know that the Internet is causing this. It just
gives a forum for people and gives them access.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid took a similar stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, namely those that are hypochondriacs, (the
Internet) may make it easier for them to do that kind of
research,'' he said. ``But what those folks would probably have
done before is run down to the library and look that stuff up
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there are illnesses that are hard to pinpoint with
traditional medical testing, said Dr. Wallace Kennedy, a clinical
psychologist and professor at Florida State University.
Fibromyalgia, for example, is a little-understood ailment that
causes fatigue, muscle pains and other symptoms, and it could be
easily mistaken for hypochondria.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is, accurate diagnosis requires a doctor. If the
patient doubts the doctor, he should get a second opinion. He
shouldn't practice self-diagnosis or try to become his own
physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person needs medical advice regarding personal concerns,
that person needs to see their physician in person,'' Sowadsky
said. The Internet can be a tool if used properly, but it can't be
a substitute for medical care.
</P>
<P>
   After all, ``anyone can put anything on the Internet whether
it's true or not,'' Sowadsky said.

DECODE YOUR BABY'S SIGNALS

   Rachel Wilson was only a few weeks old, but her parents had
already noticed that she cried every time she was exposed to loud
noise. Any loud noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was a month old, I breastfed her in front of a group
of friends and told a joke,'' says her mother, Jennifer Wilson, of
St. Paul, Minn. ``When I got to the punch line and everyone started
to laugh, Rachel turned her head away from my breast, scrunched up
her face, and began to shriek. Now, says Wilson, ``we're careful
not to startle her, and we prepare her for transitions as
thoroughly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment you bring your new baby home, you begin a dance
straight out of ``The King and I'' called ``getting to know you.''
Even though your baby can't talk, she can communicate through her
cries and her body language. She can let you know whether she's
hungry or happy, nervous or calm, sleepy or ready to play. The
trick is to learn how to decipher those cues in order to respond
appropriately to her needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't understand your baby's signals, you don't know
what her mood is at the moment or what mood she seems to be heading
toward,'' says Dr. Sirgay Sanger, a founder of the Parent Child
Center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City.
``You need to get the drift of your baby in order to build a close
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   As you develop that intimacy, she'll learn how to encourage you
to give her more of what she wants and less of what she doesn't
want says Marilyn Segal, a developmental psychologist and dean
emerita of the Family School Center at Nova Southeastern University
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ``The more adept you are at reading her
cues,'' notes Segal, ``the more likely it is that she will use
those cues to initiate a response.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, as your baby grows, so does her repertoire of signals.
Here are some tips on how to read her cues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Birth to 3 Months &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Babies are born with the ability to communicate on a very basic
level. They can convey interest or distress or tell you that they
want something. By crying, for example, a newborn could be saying,
``I'm hungry'' or ``I need comfort'': wide-open eyes and a relaxed
mouth may mean ``This is interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Most babies can also frown right after birth, and while it's
several weeks before you'll see a true smile, its obvious when an
infant brightens up and becomes alert: His eyes open wide, his
eyebrows rise, his mouth drops open, his hands and shoulders relax.
A baby in a wakeful, happy state is most receptive to new
information, Sanger says, so take advantage of this: Sing, make
faces, put up an interesting mobile for him to gaze at.
</P>
<P>
   An unhappy baby, however, may show his feelings in a variety of
ways. He may have a passive expression with slack facial muscles
and glazed eyes, showing that he wants to tune out or that there's
too much sound, fight, or activity. He may also show distress by
changing expression rapidly or breaking down into all-out crying.
The challenge is to tune in to what's making your baby feel this
way and to coax him gently out of his mood.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 to 3 months, your baby's cues become more complex. ``You'll
find emotions such as curiosity and pleasure mixed together, or
even blends of curiosity and anticipatory displeasure,'' Sanger
says. You'll be able to see these conflicting emotions in his
facial expressions. While you change his diaper and dress him for
bed, for instance, he may show interest by opening his eyes wide.
At the same time, he might be wondering if all this means playtime
is over, and he may relay his apprehension to you by knitting his
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4 to 6 Months &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Anger, surprise, sadness, fear and joy_by the middle of your
baby's first year, she has developed several new ways to react to
her surroundings. This gives you more opportunities to understand
her personality, Sanger points out.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus: Your baby now has a longer attention span, so she
won't immediately shut down if she's overstimulated. This means
you'll have more time to distract her.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to grasp toys (and noses, glasses, hair and
earrings) is perfected at this age and lets babies show off some
new signs of happiness, says Segal. ``By doing all of these
things_such as sticking her fingers in Mommy's mouth_a baby is
saying, 'I want to play' or 'You can help me explore,''' she
explains.
</P>
<P>
   You'll notice your baby's cues have become more organized by 4
months_her body, face, mouth and eyes will communicate the same
emotion. If she's expecting something, such as a warm bottle, not
only will her wide eyes and eager face show it, but her hands will
be open and relaxed, too.
</P>
<P>
   Communication becomes easier at this stage, and you can even let
your baby know when it's her turn. If you're shaking a rattle in
front of her, stop for a moment. This gives her the chance to cue
you with a coo or to reach out a hand, encouraging you to continue
the game. ``By dropping the pitch of your voice, moving your head
and hands, or becoming quiet you can elicit a smile or sounds from
your baby,'' explains Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   If she doesn't react, this may be a sign that she's had enough
and would like you to stop shaking the rattle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7 to 12 Months &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Your baby comes a long way during the last months of his first
year. He'll begin to look to you for reassurance and approval and
may point whine, or smile to get your attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can really begin to see a greater variety of emotional
expressions,'' says Segal. ``As your baby grows, you'll continually
see more differentiated cues.'' Your little one may display some
new emotions like boredom, shame, confidence and wariness. As he
begins to explore his world through crawling and walking, wariness
is very important, Sanger explains. He will hesitate while he
assesses a situation, which helps to keep him out of danger.
</P>
<P>
   Babies also begin to blend more emotions in complex combinations
as they approach their first birthday. Your child may smile happily
but seem fleetingly fearful or shy as he tries to reassure himself
in an unfamiliar situation, such as a loud party.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 months, hell learn to maneuver his facial muscles better
and will raise his eyebrows to ask a question or flirt by wrinkling
his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Your baby's cues may become more like an older child's as well.
If he wants to disengage from something, he might shake his head
from side to side or scissor his arms. And his signals may have
different meanings, too: The word no, for example, might mean ``I
don't like what's happening'' or ``Give me time to figure this
out.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're not sure what that no means, watch and wait _you'll
come to understand his message as he uses more familiar signals.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR: Baby Reading Tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Take time to observe your baby. This will help you figure out
what he's trying to communicate, and then you can decide on an
appropriate response.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch closely to see what mood he's heading toward. Look at
his face specially his eyebrows, cheeks, and mouth-for clues.
Raised cheeks and a tongue sticking out of the middle of his mouth
may signal joy, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for early warning signs of distress. Your baby's eyebrows
will draw together, the corners of his mouth will pull down or
sideways, his upper lip will flatten and he'll look down or narrow
his eyes. If you see these signals, try to figure out what's
setting him off, such as a room that's too bright or a wet diaper.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage playfulness by sticking out your tongue or swiveling
it from side to side; see if you get a positive reaction. But if
your baby scrunches up her face, squirms, or turns away, these are
clear signs that she's overstimulated and that you need to switch
to a calmer mode.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch your own signals. Don't loom over your baby-remember
that you're a big object. ``Wait to be invited in,'' suggests
Sanger. ``If you enter into her space, you should do it gradually
and see whether your baby welcomes your presence with her eyes and
eyebrows.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Be a good role model. If you have fun with your baby, you're
showing him that smiling and playfulness are allowed, which
encourages communication.

DECADENT-ERA MUSICAL ADAPTS, AS DOES L.A. THEATER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By REED JOHNSON  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was dubbed ``the Babylon of the world,'' a
turbulent city where many foreign tongues were spoken, bizarrely
dressed youths prowled the streets at night, and the populace
abandoned itself to wild, hedonistic pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   So much for present-day Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, circa 1932, was a pretty interesting place, too, as the
raunchy new national touring production of ``Cabaret,'' which opens
a 10-week engagement tonight at the Wilshire Theatre, is about to
remind us.
</P>
<P>
   Imported from London's tiny, experimental Donmar Warehouse
theater, this ``reinvented'' version of the 1967 musical comes to
Los Angeles via Broadway, where it won four 1998 Tony Awards,
including best actor, best actress and best musical revival.
</P>
<P>
   It's the brainchild of ultra-hot British director Sam Mendes,
who recently scored another risque trans-Atlantic hit with ``The
Blue Room,'' starring a seriously dressed-down Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   With a well-constructed book by Joe Masteroff and a slew of
memorable songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb, including ``Maybe This
Time,'' ``Tomorrow Belongs To Me'' and the title tune, ``Cabaret''
has enjoyed success from its first Broadway incarnation, to Bob
Fosse's Oscar-winning 1972 film version, to a 1987 revival by
director Harold Prince, to the current restaging by Mendes and
co-director/choreographer Rob Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   This production marks the professional stage debut of actress
Teri Hatcher in the role of Fraulein Sally Bowles, the reckless,
bohemian British chanteuse who performs at the sleazy Berlin
burlesque joint known as the Kit Kat Klub. Norbert Butz also is
featured as the Kit Kat's fiendish Master of Ceremonies, and Rick
Holmes plays Clifford Bradshaw, the bisexual American writer who
falls hard for Sally.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher, best-known as the savvy Lois Lane of ABC's ``Lois &AMP;
Clark,'' and for her role in the 1997 James Bond film ``Tomorrow
Never Dies,'' will be competing against memories of Liza Minnelli's
career-making, Academy Award-winning performance in the 1972 film
version, as well as Natasha Richardson's Tony-winning performance
from the current production's Broadway run.
</P>
<P>
   But there'll be another glamorous ``newcomer'' in the spotlight
tonight: the Wilshire Theatre itself, getting an elaborate makeover
for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to eliminate the ``fourth wall'' between viewers and
performers, ``Cabaret's'' design team has created an
``environmental'' concept for the show that's intended to make
audiences feel as if they're patrons at a seedy, Nazi-era Berlin
hotspot.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, construction crews at the Wilshire have been
removing rows of orchestra-level seating, installing cabaret-style
tables and chairs, repainting walls, hanging fabric, and generally
giving the historic art-deco theater the best buffing it's had in
years.
</P>
<P>
   When the opening-night crowd enters the theater tonight, some
may think momentarily that they've stepped off Wilshire Boulevard
and straight into the heart of Alexanderplatz.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk into the club, at the same time it's a club from
the '30s in Berlin, it also could be a club in downtown New York,
or the Viper Room (in West Hollywood),'' says Marshall. ``You
shouldn't really know where the walls end in the place, but you
also shouldn't know, `Where am I?' ''
</P>
<P>
   That disorienting effect reportedly was achieved at the
production's previous venues: the Donmar Warehouse in London; the
old Henry Miller Theatre on West 43rd Street in New York City; and
a former Manhattan opera house that once was home to the notorious
disco dance club Studio 54, where ``Cabaret'' transferred last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge in creating this ``site-specific''
production, says set designer Brill, is controlling the audience's
point of view without turning the space into a kind of Teutonic
theme park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really gone to great effort to really sort of look at
every decision that we make,'' Brill says, ``and to see whether
we've gone too far, and whether the choice really is about just
accentuating the facility to make both the production and the site
coincidental, (so) both of them can sort of merge together vs.
having wait staff in period clothing and serving beer from
steins.''
</P>
<P>
   Audience members will be invited to join the action in other
ways, not all of them subtle. A few surprised onlookers may even
find themselves dragged on stage to boogie alongside the bruised,
bedraggled Kit Kat dancers.
</P>
<P>
   By replicating the debauched !ital!mise en scene!off! of the
pre-World War II German capital, the production's creators hope to
invoke the spirit of ``Cabaret's'' primary source material,
Christopher Isherwood's ``The Berlin Stories.'' Written during the
1920s and '30s, Isherwood's collection of semiautobiographical
fictional pieces formed a lasting portrait of the colorful
characters he encountered during the waning days of the Weimar
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   While Hatcher has declined virtually all interview requests
until after the show opens, Marshall says she's up to portraying
the life of the party, ``a magnet, a bigger-than-life person who
everyone else is drawn to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, Teri Hatcher has been sort of a revelation to
us,'' he says. ``She auditioned for us, and I don't know her except
for really `Lois &AMP; Clark,' and a few of her films, and she's not a
stage actress, or she hadn't been a stage actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it was really a shocking revelation, because she's a
natural stage actress and can sing and dance _ wonderful accent.
I'll tell you, it's always great when somebody has more talent than
they've been given a chance to show.''
</P>
<P>
   In the equally critical role of the Emcee, the relatively
unknown Butz comes to Los Angeles from Broadway, where he's been
playing Roger in Jonathan Larson's ``Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Hatcher, Butz will have big shoes to fill: Joel Grey won a
Tony and an Oscar in the role, and Scottish actor Alan Cumming
copped another Tony in the current revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Norbert) had the perfect sensibility for this show,'' says
Marshall, ``because there's kind of a downtown, funky decadence
that he has as a person that he can bring to his stuff, but he's
charming, and scary, and seductive, and of ambiguous sexuality _ I
mean, he's married with a child, but he can play that.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Wilshire Theatre, the story line of ``Cabaret'' also
has been tarted up a bit. For example, Marshall says, it's now
easier to address the issue of Cliff's homosexuality (or
bisexuality) than it was in the 1960s. Book writer Masteroff
``actually helped us and worked with us on adding things to the
book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the thing,'' Marshall says. ``There's a very strong
play there. And that's why, when we did it in New York, we hired
people mostly who had never done musicals before _ because the book
is so strong, and we really wanted to bring to life that part of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very well thought-out play, because the first act's
very seductive in many ways, and the second act, it's almost as
though the doors lock and you feel you can't escape. It's that kind
of feeling.''

CBS RENEWS 12 SHOWS, BEGINS ADVERTISING PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unusual gambit designed to throw its rivals off-balance,
CBS Tuesday jumped the gun by two months and announced it has
renewed 12 of its most popular shows for next season and will begin
selling advertising slots on those shows immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Customarily, networks do not announce show renewals until May,
and then begin to sell time to advertisers in what is known as the
``upfront'' season. But CBS Television president Leslie Moonves
said Tuesday the network has decided this year, ``Why wait till May
when we know what we're going to be doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Top executives at NBC and ABC, in separate telephone conference
calls Tuesday with TV writers, indicated they have no plans to
follow suit. NBC Entertainment president Scott Sassa expressed
skepticism that a change in traditional ad-buying patterns would be
succesful, and ABC Entertainment president Jamie Tarses insisted
``there is no advantage to making an announcement'' on shows this
early.
</P>
<P>
   But Moonves is clearly confident his tactic will separate CBS
from the pack and be a magnet for advertisers. In fact, he
predicted double-digit increases in ad rates for CBS, which is the
top-rated network this season. ``We're now the prettiest girl in
town in terms of our ability to sell'' advertising, Moonves
boasted.
</P>
<P>
   There are potential flaws in CBS's strategy, however. While
ahead of NBC, ABC, and Fox in both households and total viewers so
far this year, CBS's older demographic is markedly less attractive
to Madison Avenue _ and consequently less able to command premium
ad rates _ than the younger-skewing viewership of its rival
networks. It is unlikely that many advertisers intent on capturing
young viewers will choose to steer dollars to CBS because the
network has its program lineup in place earlier. Even though
Moonves said CBS has enlarged its audience among viewers aged 18 to
49, the demographic deemed most desirable by advertisers, many of
the shows renewed Tuesday appeal largely to older viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The shows CBS renewed Tuesday are its Monday-night comedy lineup
of ``Cosby,'' ``King of Queens,'' ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' and
``Becker''; ``60 Minutes'' and its spinoff, ``60 Minutes II,''
along with its other newsmagazine, ``48 Hours''; three hit dramas,
``Touched by an Angel,'' ``Nash Bridges,'' and ``JAG,'' plus ``Kids
Say the Darndest Things'' and ``Candid Camera.'' Moonves said
``Walker, Texas Ranger'' and ``Chicago Hope'' are not on the list
because of ``contractual situations,'' but indicated those shows
will return as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for NBC, which is expected to win the Februrary sweeps that
ends Thursday, Sassa expressed satisfaction in the performance of
the network's new hit drama ``Providence'' and such high-rated
movies as ``Alice in Wonderland'' and ``The '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some NBC shows are sure bets to return: ``Dateline,''
``Frasier,'' ``ER,'' ``Just Shoot Me,'' ``Law and Order,'' ``3rd
Rock from the Sun.'' However, Sassa said it is too soon to say
whether perenially-endangered ``Homicide'' will return next season.
While praising the show, he noted that its ratings have been ``a
little soft'' this year, and indicated the fate of ``Homicide''
hinges on the quality of other shows NBC has in development.
</P>
<P>
   Another show that has been a critical favorite, ABC's ``NYPD
Blue,'' will temporarily be replaced in the next month by a new
drama, ``Strange World.'' ABC Entertainment chairman Stu Bloomberg
said the network didn't want to run ``NYPD Blue'' repeats because
``We thought it would be a little peculiar to have repeats with
Jimmy Smits in them.''

 &HT;    Mets aim for the top of NL East
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ To Mike Piazza, the view is remarkably
the same from the East as it was throughout his years on the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's been saying for the last 10 years that this is the
season they're going to knock the Braves off,'' Piazza said. ``And
they never do. The Braves always win.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the New York Mets, who have been 28 games over .500 the
past two seasons and finished a combined 31 games behind Atlanta.
This winter, the front office had had about enough. After spending
$163 million on free agents during the offseason, club CEO Fred
Wilpon arrived in Florida saying he would be ``very disappointed''
if the team didn't break their 10-year playoff drought this season.
When manager Bobby Valentine welcomed Piazza to camp with a kiss on
the cheek, was he just happy to see him? Or was he sending him on a
holy mission?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the axiom is that pitching wins games, the Braves still
have the best pitching,'' New York general manager Steve Phillips
said. ``But I think we have a better team (than 1998). Now, you
have to play 162 games. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were underpowered last season (136 homers ranking 12th
in the NL), remarkably slow (a major-league low of 62 stolen bases)
and remained an arm or two shy on the pitching staff. Bobby Bonilla
and Robin Ventura (33 HR and 136 RBIs last year) were added to
strengthen the offense. Rickey Henderson, whose AL-high 66 steals
surpassed the Mets team total, will play left field. Armando
Benitez and his 98-mph fastball joins the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' rotation _ Al Leiter, Rick Reed, Bobby Jones, Masato
Yoshii and Hideo Nomo _ might be suspect, but every other aspect of
the roster has been improved. Since the 1994 strike, only one NL
East team _ the 1997 Florida Marlins _ was realigned enough to
challenge the Braves, and that team eliminated the Braves on the
way to a World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this year as 1997 almost,'' Marlins alumnus Leiter said,
``with the additions they've made here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely like our team,'' Phillips said. ``We won 88
games last year, but we weren't scoring enough runs. Of 162 games,
108 were decided by three runs or less. Our pitchers didn't have
any margin for error. That really showed in the last five games.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Mets closed out the schedule 0-5, even as they
remained alive for a playoff spot until the season's final out. The
cash the franchise has laid out _ the payroll will come in between
$65 million-$70 million _ heightens hopes, as well as the pressure
on management.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, entering his third full season with the Mets, has
managed 1,541 games without taking a team into the postseason, the
longest streak by any manager to debut in the last 40 years, which
is as far back at the Elias Sports Bureau researched. And Phillips,
his resume spotted by last year's sexual-harassment case, is in
deeper jeopardy than Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we look better on paper,'' Piazza said.
``But we still have to come together on the field.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS GRAPPLES WITH Y2K PROBLEMS
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The millennium bug took center stage in Congress
Tuesday as lawmakers sought to respond to the risk that computers
will fail on Jan. 1, while warning against either public apathy or
doomsday scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   A special Senate panel on the Year 2000 problem was unable to
find any ``data to suggest that the United States will experience a
nationwide social or economic collapse.'' But, it concluded, ``some
disruptions will occur and that in some cases (they) may be
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's 160-page report ``exposes the vulnerability of
nearly every major sector of the economy,'' said Sen. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah. ``Progress is being made, but in various key
sectors, efforts remediation for Y2K have fallen behind,'' the
panel chairman noted.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the bug could set off civil unrest in poor
countries, retard economic growth in Asia, Latin America and
Africa, and disrupt global trade in oil and other key commodities,
the panel warned.
</P>
<P>
   While it saw only a low chance of an accidental nuclear weapons
launch, missile systems in other nations could malfunction and
terrorists could take advantage of weakened security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. military may experience some minor disruptions, but
its mission-critical, war-fighting capability will not be
compromised,'' Bennett said after releasing the report.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a technological glitch. On Jan. 1, many computers
could fail to distinguish the year 2000 from 1900 because of a
two-digit dating system embedded in both software and hardware. As
a result, many old systems that haven't been debugged could falter
or spew out bad data.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the panel had been unable to ``conclusively
determine how extensive the Y2K disruptions will be.''
</P>
<P>
   One major concern, the report noted, is that 90 percent of
doctors haven't fixed their computers and could temporarily lose
medical records. Smaller hospitals also may not be ready for
possible shutdowns of such critical devices as dialysis machines.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of major Y2K lawsuits, the report also noted, had
shadowed the panel's work from its inception. Bennett said he will
soon hold hearings on the litigation issue _ which according to
some estimates could exceed $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he urged consumers to keep detailed financial records
because of the potential of disruption in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Senate sought to ease the problem for small
businesses by setting up a $500 million loan program.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, approved 99-0, would require the Small Business
Administration to guarantee loans for businesses trying to fix
their own computers or threatened by the Y2K problems of their
suppliers, customers or financial institutions. It is expected to
easily pass in the House and be signed into law by President
Clinton before April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., the measure's chief sponsor, said
``the outlook for small business is not good'' because ``many small
companies have not yet begun to realize how much of a problem Y2K
failures could be for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the panel's vice-chair,
held an hour-long classified briefing for about 40 senators. It
focused on the threat posed by the Y2K issue to nuclear
installations in Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   Food industry representatives assured Bennett and Dodd at a
hearing that they would have adequate stocks on hand Jan. 1. ``We
believe ... unless there is widespread hoarding or excessive
stockpiling, Jan. 1, 2000, will be a routine shopping day,'' said
Michael Heschel of the Kroger supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre told the House Government
Reform Committee that, despite numerous Y2K problems that have yet
to be solved, the Pentagon ``will continue operations and maintain
military readiness before, during, and after 1 January 2000.'

COMPANY'S SERVICE CONVERTS FAXES TO E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
 (mk) 
 By RON TRUJILLO   
 Santa Barbara (Calif.) News-Press   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Fast-moving business executives,
international globetrotters and out-of-the-office road warriors
could benefit from a free high-tech service that converts faxes
into e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Barbara start-up CallWave could connect more than 1
million computer users to its FaxWave service, delivering fax
documents _ from critical contracts to detailed maps _ through
e-mail messages nationwide by the end of the year, said Dave
Hofstatter, co-founder and executive vice president of CallWave.
</P>
<P>
   CallWave's FaxWave allows computer users around-the-clock access
to data anywhere. FaxWave also eliminates the need to toggle
between the fax machine and phone, saving at least $250 for a
fax-dedicated second line, said company spokeswoman Antonia Inman.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of consumers are thinking about a second line, but it's
expensive,'' said Inman, adding that 29 million computer users
nationwide operate with a single phone line. ``There's an enormous
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The company _ at www.callwave.com _ is currently conducting
private trials, with a national release by the end of March,
Hofstatter said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer response ``has been overwhelming,'' he said. The
connections ``are instantaneous, it's very real time. It's the same
experience as sending a fax to a machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers Dave and Nancy Oster of Santa Barbara agree, adding
that they sent data from their fax at home to their FaxWave e-mail
account in less than 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so cool and really easy to use,'' said Nancy Oster, who
has telephone land lines for their computer, fax and phones.
``We're paying a significant amount for those three phone lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, computer-users must have e-mail access _ a cost of at
least $15 per month _ to link with the free FaxWave service.
</P>
<P>
   CallWave issues customers individual fax lines, Hofstatter said.
</P>
<P>
   CallWave will profit from additional fee options _ such as local
or toll-free phone numbers or pager services _ while banner
advertising will also help raise revenue for the 6-month-old
start-up, Hofstatter said. But customers' fax numbers will not be
released, an increasing concern and problem with no-charge services
on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   CallWave is benefiting from the fast-paced Internet, as more
companies compete with new and improved services, said GTE
spokesman Mike Raydo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already know there are going to be a lot of changes from
the Internet,'' said Raydo, adding that GTE offers Internet
Protocol Fax, a similar service. The consumer services are also
money-making opportunities, compared to the low-growth phone
service. ``We know there's a lot of technology out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And eventually, e-mail could eliminate fax machines, a more than
30-year-old technology, industry leaders said. But that is not
likely to happen any time soon: Fax machine sales have climbed from
about 3.4 million in 1993 to almost 6 million units last year,
statistics show.

SONY LOOKS TO DUPLICATE SUCCESS WITH PLAYSTATION II 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Making what could be a quantum leap in the march to wed
consumer electronics to computers and the Internet, the Sony Corp.
on Tuesday introduced the widely anticipated second generation of
its hit Playstation video-game console.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, the leading consumer electronics company, has high hopes
for new console and has bet more than $250 million on it. The
machine, which the designers are calling Playstation II for now, is
far more powerful than the current model, with a 128-bit
microprocessor compared with the current generation of 64-bit
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Playstation II has markedly increased graphics abilities and
speed, providing greater realism in video imagery. It can produce
three-dimensional characters of the same quality as those seen in
the movie ``Toy Story.'' It can connect users to the Internet and a
personal computer. It can play music and movies using CD-ROM's and
the more cutting-edge DVD's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just an extension of the line of game machines,''
Ken Kutaragi, executive vice president of Sony Computer
Entertainment Inc., Sony's video-game business, was quoted as
saying by the newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun in an article
published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential selling point for Playstation II is that the
3,000 software titles made for the classic Playstation will work on
the new machine. That makes Playstation II the first video-game
player that allows users to play games designed for its
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   While Sony did not announce a suggested price, the cost of
developing Playstation II means it will probably take a few years
for the company to start making money from the machine.
Playstations generally sell for about $130 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said it was likely to start selling the machines in Japan
by next winter and to start selling them in the United States by
fall 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With Playstation II, Sony is essentially betting that it can
take the computer out of the desk-top box in which it currently
resides and put it onto the television screen, where Sony has long
been a dominant force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the next-generation Playstation will become one of
the pillars of Sony's business,'' Nobuyuki Idei, the president of
Sony, said at a news conference held to announce the design of the
new machine.
</P>
<P>
   Playstation is already a major contributor to the company's
financial well-being. Sony Computer, which is largely the
Playstation business, accounted for 26.5 percent of Sony's
operating profits in the first half of this fiscal year, according
to Nikko Securities Smith Barney (Japan) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   The business has been a phenomenal success, essentially
redefining the home-video game market and far exceeding Sony's
wildest expectations. More than 50 million Playstations have been
sold since the product was introduced in 1994, and software
developers, which are critical to the success of game consoles,
have embraced it.
</P>
<P>
   That widespread acceptance makes Sony a formidable contender in
the $15 billion video-game business, where Sony competes with the
Nintendo Co. and Sega Enterprises Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts expect the torrid pace of Playstation's sales to
taper off in a year, severely decreasing profit unless Playstation
II duplicates its predecessor's success.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moreover, Sony is not the first to offer a more powerful machine
than the current 64-bit models. Sega announced last month that it
would start selling its next-generation machine, called Dreamcast,
in the United States next fall. That machine, which also features a
128-bit processor and can connect to the Internet, is expected to
sell for $200 to $250.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony has to transform Playstation into something more than a
game console, and they know it,'' said Koichiro Chiwata, a consumer
electronics analyst at Nikko Smith Barney. ``It has to be
revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiwata and other analysts have said that the 128-bit computer
processor that Sony developed together with the Toshiba Corp.
probably exceeds the performance of the Intel Corp.'s famed Pentium
III processor, based on a demonstration at a recent trade show.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, Sony may be trying to establish a new
standard, although it denied Tuesday that it was trying to take on
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   But Sony did boast that the abilities of the Playstation II
processor exceeded those of leading personal computers and the best
graphics work stations, allowing previously unattained levels of
sophistication and realism.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the processor, together with other components,
would be able to simulate physical attributes like gravity,
friction and mass as well as materials like water, wood and gas _
and how characters and objects think, act and behave.
</P>
<P>
   A chip made by LSI Logic will enable Playstation II to use the
same software as the existing Playstation.
</P>
<P>
   Sony shares fell 30 yen in Tokyo Tuesday, to 8,690. In the
United States, Sony American depository receipts fell 12.5 cents,
to $73.875.

   Furthermore, the bug could set off civil unrest in poor

the panel warned.

   The threat of major Y2K lawsuits, the report also noted, had
shadowed the panel's work from its inception. Bennett said he will
soon hold hearings on the litigation issue _ which according to
some estimates could exceed $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he urged consumers to keep detailed financial records
because of the potential of disruption in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Senate sought to ease the problem for small
businesses by setting up a $500 million loan program.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, approved 99-0, would require the Small Business
Administration to guarantee loans for businesses trying to fix
their own computers or threatened by the Y2K problems of their
suppliers, customers or financial institutions. It is expected to
easily pass in the House and be signed into law by President
Clinton before April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., the measure's chief sponsor, said
``the outlook for small business is not good'' because ``many small
companies have not yet begun to realize how much of a problem Y2K
failures could be for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the panel's vice-chair,
held an hour-long classified briefing for about 40 senators. It
focused on the threat posed by the Y2K issue to nuclear
installations in Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   Food industry representatives assured Bennett and Dodd at a
hearing that they would have adequate stocks on hand Jan. 1. ``We
believe ... unless there is widespread hoarding or excessive
stockpiling, Jan. 1, 2000, will be a routine shopping day,'' said
Michael Heschel of the Kroger supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre told the House Government
Reform Committee that, despite numerous Y2K problems that have yet
to be solved, the Pentagon ``will continue operations and maintain
military readiness before, during, and after 1 January 2000.'

 &HT;    Q and A on the influence of computers in education
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _ Educators from kindergarten through
college spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on computers
to enhance learning. But how well does it work? In one of the first
conferences focused on that question, more than 80 educators are
meeting through today at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem,
N.C. Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Chris Burritt talked
to Craig Runde, director of the university's International Center
for Computer Enhanced Learning, sponsor of the first Congress on
the Impact of Technology on Learning.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Explain the growing interest in assessing how computers
influence learning.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think in some respects we are fairly early on in this
investigation, but the timeliness of looking at the question is
very ripe. The question being put to administrators is very
important because the investments are large. Are these going to be
cost effective investments? They are quite unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are universities investing in technology?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of the decisions have been marketing driven as opposed
to proven effective in learning. Could they get the benefit in
recruiting students if they are seen as a high-tech school? The
administrators of educational institutions would like nothing
better than to get a report that says these are the areas where
technology makes a qualitative difference in learning outcomes. But
that report does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is that research being collected?
</P>
<P>
   A: A number of people are trying to assess whether these
different approaches provide measurable improvements. But that very
term ``measurable improvements'' is a little slippery. How would
you measure that improvement? Is it better grades? Is it better
results on standardized tests? Is it some sort of subjective
measure of critical thinking skills? Is it measured by greater
amounts of communication between faculty and students? How can you
isolate it in such a way so as to determine whether it was a
technology factor as opposed to another factor?
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the types of technology investments?
</P>
<P>
   A: It runs into millions of dollars for a school system or a
college. You have the need to improve the computer network and the
support services for computing. And you need to provide access to
everybody, either with a laptop for everyone or an expanded lab.
Regardless of how it is done, it is a significant financial
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How widespread is the interest?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would not call it a rage yet, but I would definitely say
there is a great deal of interest in the area. In higher education,
there are probably fewer than 100 institutions which made the
investment. In kindergarten through 12th grade, a small percentage
of the total has jumped in. But there are large numbers of other
schools which are looking closely at what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are some common uses of computers in learning?
</P>
<P>
   A: One is using technology as a communications tool to expand
and enhance communications among students, faculty and outside
visitors in the class. This is where you would have e-mail
discussion forums. Outside of class, either in a preparatory
fashion for the next class or in a follow-up from the last class,
you have an electronic discussion that extends the discussion that
took place in class. The other common use is to provide access to
material content. This is where you would have students go out to
relevant Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How about in the public schools, kindergarten through the
12th grade?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are more types of educational software in the K-12
rooms. You have more software where students are doing exercises on
the computer. There's probably less emphasis on communications
because of concerns about the Web.

ALVIN AILEY COMPANY SHOWCASES FOUR DECADES OF DANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: ``Tonight'' refers to Wednesday, March 3). 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Hitting the big 4-0 needn't be the prologue to a
full-blown midlife crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, according to Judith Jamison, is to just keep doing
what you've always done before.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in this 40th anniversary (season), I did what I normally
do,'' says the artistic director of Alvin Ailey American Dance
Theater. ``Commission new works, bring back old works, have company
revivals and generally spread the word that dance can be something
that can affect you deeply inside emotionally and really change
your perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by phone from a friend's house in Philadelphia,
one-third of the way through a 19-city U.S. tour, Jamison's words
tumble out in great gusts of unpremeditated enthusiasm. Still, her
modestly stated goals don't quite do justice to what she and her
31-member company will be up to this week at the Ahmanson Theatre,
where they'll open a six-performance engagement tonight.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the company will be presenting the L.A. premieres
of two highly anticipated works, Jamison's autobiographical ``Echo:
Far From Home,'' and ``Lettres d'Amour,'' a sexually charged work
about isolation in modern society by the French-born choreographer
known as Redha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Echo'' makes its local debut at 8 p.m. Saturday and 3 p.m.
Sunday in a program that also will include three Ailey signature
works, ``Streams,'' ``Cry'' and ``Revelations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lettres d'Amour'' will be performed at 8 tonight and Friday,
along with ``Revelations'' and a new production of Geoffrey
Holder's ``The Prodigal Prince,'' a pageantlike work inspired by
the life and art of Haitian primitive painter and Voudoun (or
voodoo) priest Hector Hypolite.
</P>
<P>
   Two other performances, at 8 p.m. Thursday and 2 p.m. Saturday,
will be devoted entirely to ``Ailey Classics,'' a full-evening
lineup of excerpts of works by company founder Alvin Ailey, who
died in 1989 at age 58. Highlights include ``Memoria,'' to music by
Keith Jarrett, ``Night Creature'' and ``The Mooche'' to music by
Duke Ellington and ``A Song for You'' to the music of Leon Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you see, there's the old and the new, there's the veteran
and the emerging, and within that company is also that quotient of
diversity,'' Jamison says.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison says ``Letters d'Amour'' is a work very much in keeping
with Alvin Ailey's tradition of seeking out experimental,
postmodern works that will stretch her dancers. Although Ailey
himself created nearly 80 ballets during his lifetime, he believed
in developing an eclectic repertory of works by other modern dance
pioneers as well as up-and-coming innovators. (At present, there
are some 170 works by 63 choreographers in the company's
portfolio.)
</P>
<P>
   Set to music by Apocalyptica, Arvo Part, Einstrurzende Neubauten
and Pieter Bourke, among others, ``Lettres d'Amour'' is an overtly
erotic piece danced by men in long, flowing capes and women in
provocatively slashed gowns. At the work's U.S. premiere last fall,
one New York reviewer described it as ``glorious trash,'' while
another approvingly noted its ``imaginative decadence.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jamison says she doesn't read reviews, she's quick to
respond when it's suggested that ``Lettres d'Amour'' amounts to a
dance critic's guilty pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very interesting, I was talking to somebody and they
said, `Oh, but this is so new, isn't this a European way of
moving?' What are you talking about, a European way of moving?
Where do I live, you know what I'm saying? What is this country I'm
in?
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that Redha has a vocabulary that is very close to
the earth. It's very, very weighty. And he also incorporates
popular dance. And the dancers love that. They love the challenge
of being able to combine his ballet background _ which is what they
do with every ballet that they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamison, 56, describes ``Echo: Far From Home'' as ``a very
personal statement, as are most choreographies,'' about her own
evolution as a dancer, dovetailing with the historical and cultural
odyssey undertaken by African-Americans. Against a backdrop of
oversized paintings depicting scenes from the Middle Passage, the
dancers represent Jamison, her parents, a love interest and various
mentors, including a regal figure in a flowing gown who might be
Ailey himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love putting men in long, draped things that move, and
jewels,'' Jamison says, ``because men in history have been the ones
that dressed! So I loved putting this gorgeous man, (dancer) Edward
Franklin, in a long kind of sarong, with one of my earrings on, and
a large bracelet, and a kind of stance as a guru and a mentor and a
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's Jamison doing the leading, moving forward while
looking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did (this year) was to stop and say, `Thank you,
Alvin! Thank you for thinking of this in the first place!' And that
we continue, and everything is all right.'' &UR;

JUSTICES UPHOLD FEDERAL CARJACKING LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that a carjacker
cannot escape federal prosecution by arguing that he meant his
victims no harm so long as they complied with his demand for their
car.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision marked a victory for the Justice
Department, which urged the justices to interpret broadly the
federal Carjacking Correction Act, to cover a wide range of
instances in which thieves steal cars under threat of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The law was passed in 1996 following a rash of violent
carjackings.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal defense lawyers assailed the court's broad reading of a
law they say is designed to trap only the most vicious car thieves.
</P>
<P>
   In its 7-2 ruling, the court rejected arguments that the 1996
statute prohibits only those automobile thefts in which the thief
plans to harm the driver even if he surrenders his keys. Justice
John Paul Stevens, writing for the court's majority, said the law
should be read broadly to trap also those carjackers who intend
primarily to steal automobiles but who would harm motorists if they
put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising move, the court's two most unflinching
law-and-order justices _ Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas _ said
the court misread the law, which outlaws carjackings committed
``with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.'' Scalia
and Thomas said the court should have overturned the convictions of
New York carjackers Francois Holloway and his armed accomplice
because their primary intent was to steal cars, not to injure
motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers called the
court's broad interpretation of the carjacking statute improper and
found itself in the unusual position of supporting Scalia and
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislatures should be held responsible for the words they use
when they write laws,'' said NACDL spokesman Jack King.
</P>
<P>
   A federal district court jury in eastern New York found Holloway
and his accomplice guilty in 1996 of three carjackings in which
they accosted motorists, displayed a gun and threatened to shoot
the drivers if they did not surrender their car keys. The
accomplice, Vernon Lennon, testified that he and Holloway planned
to steal the cars without harming the drivers but that they would
have shot the motorists had they given the thieves a ``hard time.''
</P>
<P>
   On appeal, the carjackers argued that the federal law did not
apply to their crime because they intended not to injure the
drivers but simply to take their automobiles. The 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in New York rejected that argument, saying
Congress intended the law to prevent a wide gamut of carjackings.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, agreeing with the 2nd Circuit, said a
carjacker who is willing to shoot a driver for failing to hand over
car keys is in violation of the law's prohibition on violent
intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether a person who points a gun at a driver,
having decided to pull the trigger if the driver does not comply
with a demand for the car keys, possesses the intent, at that
moment, to seriously harm the driver,'' Stevens wrote. ``In our
view, the answer to that question does not depend on whether the
driver immediately hands over the keys or what the offender decides
to do after he gains control over the car. At the relevant moment,
the offender plainly does have the forbidden intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, in an unusually personal dissent, said the specific
words of the law indicate that Congress intended the statute to
apply only to the especially heinous carjackings in which the
criminal intends to seriously injure the driver even if the keys
are surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a friend whose father was killed, and whose mother was
nearly killed, in just such an incident _ after the car had already
been handed over,'' wrote Scalia, who provided no further details
of the episode. ``It is not at all implausible that Congress should
direct its attention to the particularly savage sort of carjacking
_ where killing the driver is part of the intended crime.''

HAVE YOU HUGGED YOUR BUTCHER TODAY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With AMERICAN-MEAT) 
(mk) 
 By BRUCE AIDELLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Aidells has a lot to say about making the most of modern
beef. Here are some words of advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``TALK TO THE MEAT GUY'': The single most important factor in
determining tenderness is the part of the carcass that the meat
comes from. Talk to the butcher (even supermarkets have them) and
find out what the label won't tell you. The most tender cuts come
from the sirloin, top loin (New York strip steak) and tenderloin
(fillet). The Agriculture Department (USDA) grade is less important
today; most supermarket beef is choice grade, but many chains do
not even buy graded beef.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH MEAT AND METHOD: The second most important factor for
flavor is the cooking method. Decide on that first, and then buy
the meat. All lean meats cook quicker than traditionally dry-aged
beef once did. If you intend to grill or broil, look for a tender
cut. If you plan a long, slow, moist cooking, like braising or
stewing, look for chuck, brisket or short ribs.
</P>
<P>
   SALT IS A FRIEND: Forget the old theory that salting draws out
moisture and makes meat dry and tough. Salt is the most important
seasoning for meat, accentuating the beefy taste in meats that are
just not as flavorful as they once were. In addition, it brings
together a number of chemical reactions and promotes a nice, tasty
crust.
</P>
<P>
   WIELD A HEAVY SKILLET: Use old-fashioned, well-seasoned cast
iron skillets for panbroiling or grilling. Such pans retain heat at
very high temperatures. Lighter pans cannot produce a crust to firm
up today's meat, with its high moisture content _ the beef sweats
instead of searing.
</P>
<P>
   TIME IS NOT THE ESSENCE: Meat today cooks quicker, but cooking
times don't matter so much anymore. Old cooking charts list minutes
per pound to reach the desired state of doneness, but those numbers
are no longer useful. An instant-read thermometer is a meat cook's
best friend; a digital instant-read model can give an accurate
temperature when only a quarter-inch of the tip is inserted into
meat, so it works even for thin cuts like steaks, chops and
burgers.
</P>
<P>
   GIVE IT A BREAK: Meat should also be allowed to rest after
cooking to reach the ideal state. A beef roast should be taken off
the heat when the internal temperature is 125 to 130 degrees for
medium, for instance, and beefsteaks need to reach 120 to 130
degrees to be rare. As the meat rests, it continues to cook from
the heat it has absorbed. And before cooking, bring beef to room
temperature, whether you plan to grill, braise, saute, broil or
stew; take it out of the refrigerator an hour ahead.
</P>
<P>
   SPICE TO START: To make up for the flavor that is lost in beef
bred to be less fatty, rub meat with dry mixtures of herbs and
spices and let it sit a day or two or just a few minutes before
broiling or grilling.
</P>
<P>
   DO THE TENDER THING: The only way to make tough meat tender is
to cook it slowly in liquid, as in a braise or stew. Commercial
tenderizers give meat a soggy texture and unpleasant taste; steaks
sold as ``tenderized'' have been run through a piercing machine and
have all the flavor of cardboard. Marinades will not tenderize cuts
like brisket that have a lot of connective tissue.

 &HT;    Daughter of university president escapes African terror
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Elizabeth Garland, the daughter of Miami (Ohio)
University President James Garland, awakened to the sounds of
grenade explosions and machine-gun fire early Monday as attackers
overran a tourist campground no more than 30 feet from where she
was staying in southeast Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Garland quickly dressed, but did not leave her tent for fear she
would be discovered, according to her father, who talked with her
Tuesday. An hour after the last grenade explosion, a camp manager
approached and called out, ``Elizabeth, are you alive?'' She
emerged to find smoldering vehicles and buildings and the body of a
person who had been burned to death, and she learned the Rwandan
Hutu attackers had abducted more than a dozen tourists. Later in
the day, eight of those tourists were dead; an American survivor
said the rebels, 100 to 150 of them, brutally hacked some victims
to death with machetes. Six tourists were rescued and taken to a
safe location.
</P>
<P>
   Garland, an anthropology Ph.D. student at the University of
Chicago, was conducting field work for her dissertation at the
Bwindi National Park, home of 320 rare mountain gorillas. She was
living in a tent on the northern edge of the park, waiting for her
permanent quarters at a nearby village to become available. Her
tent was concealed in bushes, her father said Tuesday, separated
from the main camping area by a short trail.
</P>
<P>
   That short distance saved her life, Garland, 29, told her
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said it sounded like the gunshots were just outside her
tent, and they lasted for more than two hours,'' he said. ``She
kept saying to herself, 'Please don't let them find me, please
don't let them find me...' ``
</P>
<P>
   The Miami president said his daughter ``was still pretty much in
a state of shock'' when he spoke to her shortly before noon Tuesday
after she was evacuated to nearby Kampala. But then, the full
impact of what happened didn't hit her father right away, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of what she's been through has been sinking in to
me as the day goes by,'' Garland said. ``She came close to being
killed in a horrible way. It gives me chills. It's a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Witness accounts of the incident were indeed nightmarish.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ross, a tour operator and pilot who was born in Arkansas
but has spent years in Africa, told reporters the rebels rounded up
tourists from several jungle camps in southwestern Uganda. Ross
said he was among those taken captive, but was freed later with a
political message from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels _ who came to Uganda after Rwanda's 1994 genocide _
marched their captives through the rain forest, where Ross said
some were hacked to death Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came across the first set of bodies. The women that we'd
been told would be escorted back had been killed on the spot. It
looks like one was raped prior to being killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he saw five bodies, and ``the ones that I saw had
their heads crushed in and deep slashes.''
</P>
<P>
   His account clashed with that of Ugandan police spokesman Eric
Naigambi, who told The Associated Press there was a shoot-out and
that the rescue operation was carried out this morning in a
mountainous rain forest made famous in the film ``Gorillas in the
Mist.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``tourists were killed in the crossfire during the rescue
operation,'' Naigambi said.
</P>
<P>
   But another Ugandan, Hussein Kivumi, manager of a rain forest
camp, said the rebels targeted Americans and Britons. ``They killed
four women and four men with knives, machetes and axes. There were
no gunshots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hutu rebels fled Rwanda after they took part in a 1994
genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically
moderate Hutus. The rebels are angry at Uganda for supporting the
Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said two
Americans were murdered as they were being marched away by their
captors. The remaining six victims were killed the same way, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said the victims cannot be identified until their
relatives are notified. The six released hostages were returned to
Kampala and taken to a safe location, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandan government did not give names or nationalities of
the dead, but said that those rescued included an American, two
British, one Canadian, one Swiss and one New Zealander.
</P>
<P>
   Garland told her father she wasn't sure of her future plans. She
had intended to spend a year in Uganda, researching her
dissertation on the impact the tourism was having on the native
people of the forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``She expressed great sorrow about the impact of this incident
on the native people in the area, for whom she has great respect,''
Garland said. ``She was concerned that the publicity over this
event would undo years of effort and would reinforce undesirable
stereotypes about Africa and her peoples.''

FEINSTEIN SAYS SENATE WON'T OVERTURN MEXICO'S CERTIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Paul Coverdell,
conceding Tuesday that the Senate won't cancel the Clinton
administration's decision to certify Mexico as a drug-fighting
ally, proposed a ban on business dealings with foreign companies
that serve as fronts for drug cartel smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said Mexican drug cartels must be targeted ``like a
laser beam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cartels of Mexico today are stronger than Mafia organized
crime ever was and I believe they represent a threat to the U.S.,''
Feinstein told a news conference. ``Our enemies should be the
cartels, not Mexico vs. the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein stressed that she doesn't want to hurt trade or
friendship with Mexico and that she believes top Mexican government
officials are ``doing their level best'' to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, D-Calif., and Coverdell, R-Ga., have led past
unsuccessful Senate efforts to override administration
certifications of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said the bill would focus on ``bad actors'' in Mexico,
as opposed to seeking to override the administration's decision to
certify Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're not decertifying Mexico, we're decertifying the
cartels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said he and Feinstein ``adamantly oppose'' efforts to
repeal the law that requires the administration to give annual
certifications to Congress that Mexico or other nations with
drug-trafficking histories are cooperating in the U.S. war against
drugs. If a foreign country loses an annual certification, it could
risk losing U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell acknowledged that Congress won't repeal the
certification of Mexico this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Feinstein-Coverdell proposal targets foreign narcotics
dealers considered a threat to U.S. national security. It would
freeze the assets of drug traffickers and ban their related
businesses _ either front businesses or those run from drug profits
_ from trading with American companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control would
draw up a list of narcotics traffickers and impose criminal
penalties of up to $500,000 per violation or $250,000 and up to 10
years in prison for American companies that do business with them.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, the U.S. government has targeted and financially
crippled a drug store chain, a poultry business and pharmaceutical
laboratories connected to drug cartels.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, efforts were continuing in the House to strip Mexico
of its certification.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Feb. 26 certified to Congress that Mexico
is a fully cooperating drug-fighting ally. Congress has 30 days
from that date to overturn the president's decision, a prospect
that seems highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's certification has been renewed 13 times since 1986 when
the annual process went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. John Mica, R-Fla., Clay E. Shaw Jr., R-Fla., and Spencer
Bachus, R-Ala., introduced a resolution Tuesday to decertify Mexico
in what they said was a first step toward overturning the
certification.
</P>
<P>
   Mica said America is ``on the verge of having a state to the
south of us that is an ally become a narco-terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachus called Clinton's decision to certify Mexico ``a sham.''
``To certify Mexico is to make a mockery out of the certification
system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bachus acknowledged he faced ``an uphill battle,'' and said he
has no assurances that the House will actually vote on the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said this year's recertification
``cheapens and degrades'' the work and sacrifices that other
countries are making to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The following countries are subject to the re-certification
process: Afghanistan, Aruba, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil,
Burma, Cambodia, China, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador,
Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela and
Vietnam.

   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The Audio Ballerina's tutu got lost in transit
from Germany. The Audio Geisha's kimono emitted sudden, terrifying
sounds of an opening coffin when a press photographer's flash went
off. There was some worry about what might happen if a dancer
perspired with 220 volts of electricity strapped to his body.
</P>
<P>
   But the International Dance and Technology 99 conference went
off without a hitch, with four days of nonstop, intense exploration
of the meeting points of ``human modes and digital codes,'' as one
conference essay put it.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 participants from 18 nations descended on this
sunny, palm-dotted town, the home of Arizona State University, this
year's conference host. (``Just schedule it in Arizona in February
and everyone will come,'' an administrator reassured a worried
planner early on.)
</P>
<P>
   The biennial Dance and Technology conference began in 1991 at
the University of Wisconsin at Madison, but this was the first to
aggressively seek international participation.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, when the conference ended, some 70 events had sped
by. Plugged-in performers were everywhere, demonstrating everything
from electronic sneakers to the uses of electrodes in dance.
</P>
<P>
   Off-the-shelf technology and software were the tools in most
sessions, which ranged from a talk on ``Cunningham, Collage and the
Computer'' and one by the veteran choreographer Daniel Nagrin
exploring the ``uncomfortable fit'' of the competing visual forms
of dance and camera, to such esoteric topics as ``Escape Velocity''
and ``The Desire of the Verb: Inverting Cartesian Space.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants also learned how to design online Internet courses
and studied CD-ROMs on teaching ballet, on music for dancers and on
codifying Bharata Natyam dance.
</P>
<P>
   One popular spot was the on-campus Web Cafe, furnished with
comfortable chairs, tables, computer work stations and a dance
floor. On the floor, a video camera, sensing moving bodies, fed
information into a computer program that triggered the projection
onto a screen of Web pages with material pertinent to dance,
technology and the conference.

<P>
   Even lunch time was not sancrosanct, accompanied as it was by
keynote speeches by Bob Bejan, a former dancer who is the director
of sales and operations online at Microsoft Corp., and Lowry
Burgess, a professor of art and former dean of the College of Fine
Arts at Carnegie Mellon University.
</P>
<P>
   The conference Web site is http://isa.fa.asu.edu/IDAT99.
</P>
<P>
   While the technology seemed at least as dysfunctional as the
most difficult ballet star or accident-prone modern dancer, much of
what was on view suggested that the opportunity for play in the
field of dance technology is enormous, for the viewer and the
creator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little laughter on my right toe,'' Robert Wechsler
said impishly but with undisguised delight in a demonstration of
the Touchlines program developed by his Palindrome Performance
Systems, based in Nuremberg, Germany. The movement of his toe,
caught by the camera and transmitted to a computer, had triggered a
portion of a musical score that included children's laughter.
</P>
<P>
   In interactive installations by Sarah Rubidge and Gretchen
Schiller, for example, the audience became the creator in a limited
way. Seductive dances of video imagery were ``choreographed'' by
viewers walking and shifting on surfaces embedded with pressure
pads that triggered reactions in the electronic systems controlling
the images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falling to Earth,'' an electronically mediated, collaborative
multimedia piece by Ellen Bromberg, John Mitchell and Douglas
Rosenberg, and Seth Riskin's ``Light Dance'' created the sense not
so much of new ways of performing or looking at movement, but of a
plunge into a theatrical experience and even a physical space
unbounded by the normal parameters of live performing.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Alpert's ``Wearing Me Out'' incorporated technology that
included morphing to drop the viewer into the mind of a woman
comically dissatisfied with her appearance.
</P>
<P>
   And the delicacy of Jools Gilson-Ellis' performance in ``The
Secret Project,'' created with Richard Povall, suggested that
motion-sensor technology could sometimes create effects as subtle
as live dancing.
</P>
<P>
   One popular topic was the ideal degree of connection between
artist and machine. It was easy, Wechsler said, to lose ``the fine
line between honest artistic goals and tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the techno-choreographer Isabelle Choiniere
suggested, a more refined and sophisticated approach to the use of
technology in dance requires that artists become familiar enough
with the technology to develop a relationship as intimate as that
between dance partners.
</P>
<P>
   There were heated discussions about the redefining of the roles
of dancer, choreographer and audience _ and of the nature of
performance _ inherent in much of the technological work. Most of
the participants stressed that the field was new. The biggest
audience hit of the conference's two formal proscenium-stage
programs was a low-tech work by Sean Curran, who confessed in a
panel discussion that he didn't even own a computer.

   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ The drought this winter could be a portent
of an even drier future unless Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians
work together to conserve shared water resources, an international
panel of scientists warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 12 million in a region with as much
rainfall as Phoenix, Ariz., water supplies ``are barely sufficient
to maintain a quality standard of living,'' said Gilbert F. White,
a geographer from the University of Colorado who was chairman of a
research group from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and
counterpart institutions from Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
   In what was described as the first major study of the long-term
outlook for water supplies between the eastern border of Jordan and
the Mediterranean Coast of Israel, the report said that even with
strict management ``the area's inhabitants will almost assuredly
live under conditions of significant water stress in the near
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancient underground aquifers are being drained dry, while scarce
rains flow unused into desert gulches and rivers are diverted for
water-intensive tropical agriculture, the researchers said.
Watersheds cross political boundaries and can only be managed
jointly, they said.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly news here that water is getting ever scarcer and
the population steadily larger. Yet by drawing on data from
disparate sources within and outside the region, the study provides
what its authors believe is the first comprehensive analysis of
regional patterns of water demands and supplies, while at the same
time detailing feasible methods of conserving water and reducing
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   At least as significant as the content, participants said, was
the political fact that this was the first serious study involving
Jordanian, Israeli and Palestinian experts, all of whom urged their
governments to work together on recycling waste water, efficient
irrigation and using brackish water for industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual regional collaboration and the prestige of the
Academy of Sciences should help assure that the study will guide
the World Bank and other Western aid donors whose support is
crucial to all three governments, the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   Left carefully unmentioned were the consequences of an regional
battle over dwindling water resources. But the concern was
implicit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very dry region and a very tiny region, with an
importance out of all proportion to its size,'' said David
Policansky, staff director of the project.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 225-page study, which took more than two years, is itself
rather arid, scrupulously avoiding any hint of national bias or
ideological advocacy, and concentrating on regional research rather
than policy prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were aware of many proposals for managing water
supplies in the study area and neighboring areas, we explicitly
refrained from making recommendations about these specific programs
and political policies,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists acknowledged that their hope was to galvanize
policymakers into action and to remove the excuse that there is
insufficient scientific information on which to base broad new
water policies.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group met on Monday with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat. The Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities will
be presenting its findings to the Israeli government, and the Royal
Scientific Society of Jordan is advising the government in Amman
about the research.
</P>
<P>
   The principal scientific contribution of the panel, some
suggested, was to collate and verify existing research from varied
sources on regional industry, irrigation, meteorology and geology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a serious lack of regional information,'' Policansky
said, pointing to a map of regional rainfall patterns that was
drawn from different official sources and research institutes.
``This is quite basic. But until we did it there was nothing like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The report stresses the limits of a landscape ranging from
``sparse forest'' to desert and ``semidesert,'' cleaved by the
``temperate steppe'' of the Jordan Valley, itself increasingly
dried out by upstream irrigation. In 40 years, all fresh water in
the region should be reserved for household use, with treated waste
water and saline water used to supply agriculture and industry, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   As the largest and by far the most prosperous of the three,
Israel accounts for most of the consumption, the study confirmed.
At 344 cubic meters, its per capita water use in 1994 was almost
four times that of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, at 93 cubic
meters a person.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials and Israeli environmentalists often point
critically to this disparity and to California-style watered lawns
and capacious bathtubs that they consider irresponsibly profligate.
Yet the study showed that Israel's use is only marginally greater
than Jordan's. Jordan is poorer than the West Bank, yet consumed
244 cubic meters a person.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan and Israel, the thirstiest consumers are not
households, but farms, out of all proportion to their share of the
economy and workforce. In Israel, agriculture accounts for 3
percent of the gross domestic product and 57 percent of water
consumption. The Jordanian agricultural sector contributes 6
percent of the GDP, but uses 72 percent of the water. In the less
developed West Bank and Gaza Strip, agriculture absorbs about the
same share of water, 64 percent, yet accounts for fully a third of
the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has been promoting plans
for Mediterranean desalting plants that could supply Gaza and
Israeli coastal communities. But the study noted that desalting sea
water was extremely expensive _ $1 or more for a cubic meter of
potable water _ and would not usually be considered feasible in a
region without cheap and abundant fuel supplies.

`OSHUN': WOMAN SEEKS A PLACE AMONG YORUBAN SAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Propelled by the spirited, captivating performance of
Keisha Monique Booker in the title role, the dance-drama ``Oshun''
at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe revisits the tumultuous world of
orishas, the Yoruban saints, which proved so entertaining and
memorable in the theater's 1995 production of ``Shango da Ima.''
</P>
<P>
   In the potent and rewarding ``Oshun,'' subtitled ``The Goddess
of Love,'' the focus of the West African legend told in words,
music, song and sound by David D. Wright is a strong, determined,
complex young woman who simply will not be denied her place in the
Yoruban pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these extraordinary creatures such splendid material
for drama are their imperfections. Like the Greek gods, they
bicker, battle and foment mischief. They are proud, arrogant,
greedy and covetous yet fully capable of goodness and generosity,
though Olofi, the Supreme Being, at times grows weary of their
foolish ways and is prompted to abandon them after distributing
power and knowledge among them.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Oshun (pronounced Oh-SHOON) seeks equal
status in the male council. As her story unfolds under the skilled
direction of Rome Neal in 30 lively scenes of chant, dance,
drumming, conflict and conciliation, she employs her intelligence,
wiles and courage to enhance her powers and win her place among the
orishas.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, there are encounters with the black-hooded ajes,
or witches; with the fierce Shango, who controls fire; Ogun, the
orisha of iron and warfare, and the ominous Elegba, the orisha of
the crossroads and the bearer of messages. There is an abusive
marriage to Orunmila, the orisha of divination, and the seduction
of the married Shango. Oshun is not always wise, but she is always
riveting.
</P>
<P>
   With flashing eyes, haughty demeanor, lithe, seductive body, wit
and intelligence, Ms. Booker gives a multifaceted performance that
is the key to the success of this handsome and energetic shoestring
production, with costumes by Marcel Christian, dance by Angela D.
Brown, musical direction by Vanessa A. Wright, masks by Hjordis
Linn and lighting designed by Christophe Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after its beginning with a series of poetry
readings in the Lower East Side apartment of its executive
producer, Miguel Algarin, the Nuyorican Poets Theater, now at 236
East Third St., remains a vibrant contributor to the city's
culture.

   So, the big night on ABC television is finally here: Monica
Lewinsky meets Barbara Walters tonight at 9 for two hours of
chit-chat.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr has finally relented to letting the infamous intern
rehash the relationship that almost brought down the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has us wondering what she'll actually say and what
PG words she'll choose to explain some raunchy, R-rated behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good bet the L.A. resident, fluent in valley girl, will
use some of the same language she employed in the Starr report and
during her two dozen interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good guess that you might be tired of the whole
affair. So, let's make it fun and turn it into a game _ a
family-friendly version of the frat house drinking game. Every time
Lewinsky uses certain words, follow it with a corresponding action.

FAMILY TIES: BUSH, DOLE LEAD PROSPECTIVE NOMINEES IN GOP RACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The more things change, the more they stay the
same: a Bush is edging toward a campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination, and his chief competitor may be a Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   In the six national elections beginning in 1976, a Dole or a
Bush has been on every Republican ticket. The sometimes angry,
psych-out competition between the patrician George Bush and the
hardscrabble Bob Dole was one of the most interesting _ if not
edifying _ political exercises of the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bush's son, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, and Dole's wife,
former Cabinet official Elizabeth Hanford Dole, are considering
bids for the Republican presidential nomination and have quickly
emerged in national polls as the front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the surveys and political buzz nationally and in key
states, the nomination is either Bush's or Dole's to lose as the
GOP selects a candidate for the open race to succeed President
Clinton, the Democrat who sent Bush's father into political
retirement in 1992 and buried Dole's husband three years ago in a
landslide.
</P>
<P>
   The two dominate the field _ George W. Bush with his polls and
his pledges from key Republican figures around the nation, and
Elizabeth Hanford Dole with her zoom to virtual parity in the polls
with the governor after she quit as president of the American Red
Cross to consider making the national race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between them, they have sucked almost all the oxygen out of
the Republican political atmosphere, especially Bush,'' said a top
adviser to another prospective GOP candidate. ``This race is likely
frozen between the two of them until George W. makes his first
mistake and we see how he handles it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other big question,'' the strategist said, ``is does Dole
really get in?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush signaled his intentions Tuesday with a long-anticipated
announcement in Austin, Texas, that he will soon authorize a
committee to explore a presidential candidacy and raise money. That
is expected to lead in the coming months to a formal announcement
that he is running.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's steps have been less precise, but she is expected this
spring at least to form an exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong poll showings by Bush and Dole, experienced
Republican strategists know that survey results can't be taken to
the bank almost a year before the first caucuses and primaries.
Even politicians favorably disposed to Bush, such as recently
retired former California GOP chairman Michael Schroeder, warned
against the governor relying on his currently strong press notices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way too early to say the race is in the hands of one
person unless he makes a mistake,'' Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least nine other prospective nominees, with varying
degrees of ability to attempt to fight their way into the top tier
with Bush and Dole. They are: Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Bob
Smith of New Hampshire, former Vice President Dan Quayle, House
Budget chairman John Kasich of Ohio, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander, commentator Pat Buchanan, magazine publisher Steve
Forbes, conservative broadcaster Alan Keyes and conservative
activist Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them privately have expressed irritation that the race
is dominated by relatives of famous Republican politicians of the
recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes has remarked publicly on the fascination of party
officials with what might be viewed as dynastic politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a Republican establishment that's doing its best to
promote the usual list of suspects,'' Keyes said. ``With those old
horses, we'll lose in the same old way.''
</P>
<P>
   But that seems to be a minority view, as Keyes found out at the
California state Republican convention last weekend where Bush was
the major topic of conversation without even showing up. Dole also
skipped the event, which drew seven prospective GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the delegates, such as Betty Cordoba of San Diego, who
also has been a national convention delegate, already has Bush
nominated and has penciled in Dole as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question Bush appealed to many Republicans because
of his family ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's anything like his mother and father, I'll adore him
and he'll win,'' said Lois Glab, a state delegate from Camarillo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To more hard-eyed Republican pros, Bush's allure stems from his
political record _ defeating Gov. Ann Richards, a seemingly popular
Democratic incumbent, in 1994 and then sailing to re-election last
fall when other big-name Republicans across the country were felled
by a Democratic tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so successful where we were so miserable,'' said Allan
Hoffenbloom, a GOP operative in California, where in November
Republicans lost the governorship for the first time in 16 years.
``We took such a shellacking. When we look at George W., he looks
like Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is unlikely to shy from such comparisons. His campaign, in
fact, may have more similarities to those of conservative icon
Reagan than to his father's less robust political efforts. But
former President Bush will always be a strong point of reference
for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Some pollsters and strategists still believe the governor fairs
so well in surveys because respondents are confused and thinking of
the former president.
</P>
<P>
   So what, said Hoffenbloom: ``In politics, an easily recalled
name is a very, very important thing.''

 &HT;    REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS SEEK TO DECERTIFY MEXICO DRUG EFFORTS
 &HT;    moving in (w) washington category
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling President Clinton's certification that
Mexico is cooperating in efforts to fight drug smuggling ``a
sham,''a group of Republican lawmakers filed a bill Tuesday to
overturn his action.
</P>
<P>
   The bill by Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., calls for revocation of
U.S. economic and diplomatic support of Mexico, but would allow the
president to waive those sanctions in the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Republican from Fort Lauderdale and one
of the bill's co-sponsors, said he doubted it would become law. But
he said it would result in Mexico's role as a leading drug producer
and transit country being exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who has been involved in previous unsuccessful attempts to
decertify Mexico's drug status, said he would prefer to see stiffer
sanctions imposed against America's southern neighbor to force
officials there to take action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my way I'd stop every truck coming across the border
and unload it,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw noted that the United States took unilateral action to
eradicate weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and should act
against Mexico for exporting drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These weapons of mass destruction are killing Americans,'' he
said. ``These weapons of mass destruction are contributing to
growing crime in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Mica, a Republican from Winter Park, Fla., said he
will hold a hearing of his Government Reform drug policy
subcommittee Thursday to review Mexico's anti-drug efforts and the
proposed legislation.
</P>

 &HT;    Strong economy gives airlines a lift
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines (ticker symbol DAL) shares have risen
25 percent just in the past two weeks as confident investors helped
the Atlanta-based airline and other big air carriers pull out of a
share-price dive.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the persistent strength of the U.S. economy is
responsible for investor interest in airline stocks. Investors are
confident that business growth will translate into busy airline
schedules later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists entered 1999 forecasting slower growth, along
the lines of 2 percent to 2 1/2 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, government numbers continue to reflect a
stronger-than-expected economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the growth rate for the fourth quarter was revised
upward to a 6.1 percent annual rate from an initial estimate of 5.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs analyst Glenn D. Engel said in a report Tuesday
that the economy's strength points to increased air travel this
spring, especially among business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Engel raised his ratings on the shares of UAL (UAL), the world's
largest airline; American Airlines parent AMR (AMR), and
Continental Airlines (CAI/A, CAI/B). This boosted the shares of
Delta and other airlines whose ratings were not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's shares rose Tuesday by $2.68 3/4 to $65.62 1/2 on
turnover of more than 2.6 million shares, or almost double the
average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on Tuesday, LHS Group (LHSG) fell $2.43 3/4, or 5.6
percent, to $41.43 3/4 on news of a large sale of shares by a group
of insiders and investors in the Atlanta-based provider of
telephone billing and customer service software.
</P>
<P>
   The company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to
offer 3.34 million shares owned by a venture capital group and by
insiders including Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hartmut
Lademacher.
</P>
<P>
   All the shares will be offered by the shareholders and not the
company, LHS Group Senior Vice President Rainer Westermann said.
</P>
<P>
   The largest block _ 2.5 million, or about 75 percent of the
total _ will be sold by General Atlantic Partners LLC, which
Westermann described as a venture capital group that had invested
in LHS Group.
</P>
<P>
   Lademacher will offer 500,000 shares, according to the filing,
reducing his interest to 30.6 percent from 36.1 percent, Bloomberg
News said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg said the other shareholders are Jerry W. Braxton,
chief financial officer and treasurer; Hansjorg Beha, executive
vice president of technology; Erik Froberg, special adviser to the
chairman; Ulf Bohla, a director; and Jon Limbird, executive vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   HypoVereinsbank AG, Deutsche Bank Securities and SG Cowen will
underwrite the offering.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus-based Total System Services (TSS) rebounded Tuesday
from Monday's 10 percent share price decline with a gain of 25
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $20.62 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which provides third-party credit card processing
services, had announced that one of its larger clients _ a Citibank
subsidiary _ will not renew its processing relationship beyond Aug.
1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream Aerospace (GAC), a Savannah-based manufacturer of
corporate jets, rose $1.68 3/4, or 3.6 percent, to $48.06 1/4 a day
after announcing plans to buy back up to $200 million worth of its
common stock.
</P>
<P>
   The share price leader among Georgia stocks was Atlanta-based
Security First Technologies (SONE), which provides Internet
services for financial institutions. The stock rose $4.37 1/2, or
almost 5 percent, to $70.12 1/2.

IN TWO MONTHS OF EXISTENCE, THE EURO HAS STEADILY DECLINED AGAINST
THE DOLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In the two months since the European single
currency was introduced, pretty much the only direction it has
moved is down.
</P>
<P>
   From a buoyant and technically smooth start-up on Jan. 4, the
euro has steadily slipped against the U.S. dollar. An initial
exchange rate of $1.17 is now around $1.09.
</P>
<P>
   The decline has surprised most experts and puzzled the overseers
of the new currency at the European Central Bank. It could also
strain relations with the United States, where government officials
now loudly complain that Europe has to do more to stimulate world
growth. A weak euro makes that harder, because it increases the
price of imported goods and diminishes European demand for them.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's troubles reflect a series of economic and political
developments that have taken the shine off Europe and its new
currency. Economic growth has sharply slowed, particularly here in
Germany, while the United States has defied expectations with an
unrelenting pace of torrid growth.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts and political leaders also warn that the financial
markets may have been unnerved by the rancorous squabbling among
European political leaders over monetary policy, farm subsidies and
budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get around the fact that the euro is the economic
component of a blueprint for political unification,'' said Graham
Bishop, an adviser on the single currency to Salomon Smith Barney.
``If you see disarray at the heart of the political process, that
ought to make people nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Many economists argue that the euro will regain its initial
strength later this year, though perhaps not before it sinks a
little further. But many also concede that their predictions two
months ago were simply wrong. ``I had to change my view fairly
quickly,'' said Ravi Bulchandani, chief currency strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London. Like many others, Bulchandani
had expected the euro to climb from its starting price of $1.17.
Now he predicts that it may sink to $1.05 before it strengthens.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank,
suggested in January that he would be comfortable if the euro
traded between $1.14 and $1.19. When it dropped below $1.14,
Duisenberg acknowledged that he was puzzled, but he did not signal
any policy change.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say the euro's decline largely reflects the sharp
contrast between American and European growth rates. Industrial
production across the 11-nation euro zone declined 0.2 percent in
December, the European Commission said in data released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Commerce Department reported last Friday that
fourth-quarter growth in the United States increased at an annual
rate of 6.1 percent, the fastest in nearly 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   European sluggishness has been notable in Germany, which
accounts for one-third of the euro zone's total economy. On
Tuesday, the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce said
companies now expect the economy to grow only 1.5 percent this
year, down from 2.8 percent in 1998. The German central bank has
already estimated that the economy declined 0.4 percent in
December. ``There are clouds spreading over the German economy, and
the sunshine has disappeared,'' said Franz Schoser, the chambers'
managing director.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, Europe's third-largest economy, things are worse. The
Italian government said on Monday that economic growth last year
was only 1.4 percent, far short of its projections.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, economic expansion has made the United States
a magnet for foreign money, increased the demand for dollars, and
reduced that for euro investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the two economies,'' said Stefan Schneider,
chief European economist for Banque Paribas, ``they just seem to be
going in opposite directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe's uncertain prospects have aggravated the running battle
between some of its left-leaning political leaders and the
conservative monetarists at the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine of Germany continues to press
the bank for reduced interest rates, which would help stimulate
European economies with increased lending but could further weaken
the euro by reducing the value of investments denominated in the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Some currency traders think the central bank will soon give in,
and some economists say that the expectation of lower rates
probably helped push down the euro in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Duisenberg and other members of the central bank's board
made it clear this week that they would not change course at their
next meeting on Thursday. ``We think the interest rate should stay
where it is now,'' Duisenberg said in an interview with the Spanish
newspaper El Mundo, and several of his colleagues have since echoed
those views.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials note that parts of Europe are still growing at a
pace they consider reasonable. France is more buoyant than Germany,
and economists say it can still grow by more than 2 percent this
year. Spain, Portugal, Ireland and the Netherlands are all growing
much faster than that.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some analysts say German political leaders appear at
odds with their French colleagues. Both governments are now
controlled by left-of-center parties, but French leaders have
refrained from actively criticizing the central bank.

 &HT;    Diller no 'pretender' in online worldBy Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Who needed me to muck everything up?''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive of USA
Networks ,which owns Lycos and the Home Shopping Network among
other things, began his keynote address to the 1,600 plus attendees
of the Jupiter Online Forum underway at the Sheraton New York.
</P>
<P>
   Diller, a seasoned media veteran, seemed oddly humble before the
high-tech Web-savvy crowd.
</P>
<P>
   His self-deprecating speech surely scored points with a
potentially hostile crowd who didn't like the idea of their
bleeding-edge Web sites and business models suddenly becoming so
closely intertwined with a TV network best known for selling
bracelets and blenders to bored housewives in Des Moines. (Somewhat
defensively Diller pointed out that HSN also sells millions worth
of computers via TV every day. ``It's not just about little rings
anymore,'' he insisted.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get away with saying 'we' in the Internet world','' he
said. ``I'm just a pretender.
</P>
<P>
   However, Diller is not as naive as he'd have you believe.
Comparing the Internet of the '90s to the great land rush of the
1800s, Diller explained the process that led him to believe there
is gold in the Internet hills.
</P>
<P>
   To put it as simply as possible, Diller did the math. And the
answer came up Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Diller is one of the few people in or out of the Internet
business willing to admit up front he's building an online presence
squarely aimed at selling people things. It may not be as
altruistic as content sites such as Salon or the New York Times on
the Web, but if it's done right, online shopping can be one Diller
of a money-maker. And he would like to make a lot of money, not in
inflated Internet stock certificates, but in cold, hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw QVC (the first shopping channel Diller
bought, now owned by Tele-Communications Inc. and Comcast), I saw
that it used television to attract viewers, phones to get orders
and computers to tie it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Diller bought Ticketmaster Online and the CitySearch
network of local sites and merged the two into the Ticketmaster
Online-CitySearch Inc. He saw the combination as a way to generate
revenue from CitySearch users looking for arts and entertainment
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see the Internet only through its global mystique is a
mistake,'' he said. ``Search global but live local,'' he said.
``It's intriguing to look at movie times in New York City when
you're sitting in Kenya, but ultimately it's a frustrating
experience, because you can't get there in time for the 8 O'clock
show.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to describe his new alliance with Web portal Lycos as
``real business combined with 'a world where possibilities
exist.''' However, he knew some people in the Jupiter audience,
perhaps more than would admit it, still aren't making money. What's
more, they may never make the money that Diller has made off-line
and now proposes to make online. ``Have I in this transaction (with
Lycos) pulled one or two items of clothing off the emperor?'' he
asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Net companies will make money. Some won't,'' he said. ``I
want to make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   However, while Diller believes he can make money with his
combined TV and Web ventures, he knows he is rolling the dice just
like everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in on a great game,'' he said in his closing comments,
signalling his uncertainty about the Web. For all his pragmatism
and real world databases of active, credit-card wielding customers,
at the end of the day, not even Barry Diller knows if he can make
money on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange way that is sort of reassuring.

BUSH INITIATIVES OFF TO SLOW START IN LEGISLATIVE SESSION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush finally stopped being coy
Tuesday and put his presidential campaign in gear. Now, some people
are wondering, can he do the same with his legislative program?
</P>
<P>
   Supporters from near and far, urging a Bush run for the White
House, have been moving in and out of the Governor's Mansion a lot
faster than most of Bush's legislative proposals have moved at the
state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks into the legislative session, only one of the
governor's priorities _ a tax break for small oil and gas producers
_ is anywhere close to becoming law, and it may still spark a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to predict success or failure for most of Bush's
program because it is still relatively early. Lawmakers will not
adjourn until May 31, and the House, under Speaker Pete Laney,
normally does not pass much legislation during the first two months
of a session anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But there already have been strong hints that rough sledding
awaits several of the governor's proposals, partly because of
budgetary restraints and philosophical differences and partly
because of his upcoming presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The success or failure of Bush's initiatives _ and how he
handles the give-and-take with lawmakers _ may have a major impact
on how Bush is perceived nationally as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate already has given quick passage to three major bills
backed by Bush _ the energy tax break, a $57 million franchise tax
exemption for small businesses and one of the governor's top
priorities, a measure to crack down on social promotions in the
public schools by requiring children to pass a standardized test
before they are advanced to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   But all have been slowed down in the House, where a number of
Democrats, who hold a 78-72 majority, disagree with the Republican
governor's priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly a difference in philosophy,'' said state
Rep. Kevin Bailey, D-Houston, chairman of the Legislative Study
Group, an organization of Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Major fights also are brewing over the governor's proposals to
cut school property taxes by $2 billion, establish a pilot program
of tax-backed vouchers for private schools and require parents to
be notified before their minor daughters could have abortions.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Capitol insiders believe the voucher program, which
would benefit only a limited number of children from low-performing
public schools, is dead on arrival. Public support for the idea is
dwindling, according to a recent Scripps Howard Texas Poll, despite
an expensive lobbying effort by voucher supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Voucher advocates believe a majority of legislators would vote
for the program, if given a chance, but the voucher bill is
believed to lack the two-thirds support necessary to be debated by
the full Senate and may be blocked in the House by the Public
Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A parental notification bill, one of the most emotional issues
lawmakers will face, won Senate approval during the 1997 session
but was killed in the House on a procedural maneuver that sparked a
nasty partisan fight late in the session.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is expected to win Senate approval again, but a vote
in the House, if the measure emerges from committee, may be close.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of this issue will be important to Bush's support
among the religious and social conservatives who are instrumental
in nominating Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Price, president of Texans United for Life, an
anti-abortion group, said he believed Bush was committed to getting
the bill passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would generate a lot of concern among social
conservatives if he wasn't able to get this through,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's $2 billion school tax cut proposal anchors a tax
reduction package that also includes $307 million worth of business
tax credits and exemptions and a $330 million cut in sales taxes on
diapers, other health aids, over-the-counter medicine and Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also wants to increase state funds to the public schools by
$1.6 billion during the next two years _ on top of the $2 billion
that he wants the state to reimburse districts for lower property
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One key Republican lawmaker, state Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount
Pleasant, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has warned that
the state budget surplus is not big enough to cover all of the
governor's requests and also meet other spending needs.
</P>
<P>
   And some Democrats would rather see less money spent on tax
relief and more money spent on children's health care and other
early intervention programs.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Paul Sadler, D-Henderson, chairman of the House
Public Education Committee, which plans to overhaul the social
promotion bill, believes the measure also should require children
to attend kindergarten. Sadler's proposal would cost the state $500
million and further jeopardize Bush's tax cut plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, the governor has said the oil industry is facing an
emergency but children are not,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to a bill, designated an emergency by Bush, to
provide as much as $45 million in severance tax exemptions for
owners of marginal oil and gas wells. The House Ways and Means
Committee was expected to approve that bill Wednesday after
delaying action last week. The Senate approved it last month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed $483 million in funding for a health insurance
program for needy children, but some Democratic legislators want to
make even more youngsters eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said the governor was ``working
with legislators to provide coverage for more children and to be
fiscally responsible for the state in the long term.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; State Rep. Paul Hilbert, R-Houston, said he believed some
Democratic lawmakers are trying to take advantage of Bush's need to
avoid a disruptive session to negotiate with the governor over
children's health care and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to slow it (the governor's program) down,'' Hilbert
said. ``I think at this juncture the governor is minding the store
very well. But they (Democrats) see an Achilles heel.''

HP TO SPLIT INTO TWO FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 2,760 Massachusetts employees of Hewlett-Packard Co. will
soon be working for a new company, due to a dramatic corporate
reorganization at the pioneering Silicon Valley firm.
</P>
<P>
   The electronics titan will split into two separate independent
firms. The lion's share of the business _ the $40 billion
computing, imaging and printing operations _ will go on as
Hewlett-Packard Co. Meanwhile, the firm's $7.6 billion medical
instruments, measuring devices and electronic test equipment
business will become part of a new company, which has not yet been
named. HP employs 2,200 workers in Massachusetts at its medical
systems operation in Andover, and another 560 in Burlington work
for the company's measuring devices unit.
</P>
<P>
   HP officials say the split should help stimulate faster growth
in both companies. ``We are taking this action to sharpen the
strategic focus of our businesses, improve their agility and
increase their responsiveness to customers and partners,'' said
Lewis Platt, HP's chief executive. Platt will continue to lead the
computer and printer business during a transition period, and will
then step aside.
</P>
<P>
   The new medical instruments and electronic devices business will
be headed by Edward Barnholt, currently executive vice president of
the unit inside HP. Barnholt said that giving the unit its
independence will allow it to become a more aggressive competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully by being more focused, well be faster on our feet,
we'll be more responsive to the market opportunities,'' he said.
The new firm will sell 15 percent of its stock to the public;
Barnholt said the public offering will probably occur in October.
The remaining stock will be distributed among HP shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the company rose 2 3/4 to 68 5/8 Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Barnholt's new company will include the electronic
testing business that gave rise to Hewlett-Packard in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   The company was the original high-tech start-up, begun by
Stanford University buddies William Hewlett and David Packard in
Hewlett's garage in Palo Alto, Calif. in 1939. There they built
audio oscillators for the Walt Disney Co., which used them to make
the movie ``Fantasia.'' The garage still stands, and is now a
national landmark, cited as the official birthplace of Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The company got into medical devices in 1961 when it bought the
Sanborn Co. of Waltham. HP began making computers in 1966. Hundreds
of people who established the modern computer industry learned
their trade as HP employees, including Apple Computer Inc.
co-founder Stephen Wozniak.
</P>
<P>
   Today computers, printers and scanners are HP's biggest
businesses, producing far more revenue than test equipment and
medical devices. Cynthia Danaher, vice president and general
manager of the medical products group, said that being part of a
much larger company had become a hindrance. ``I don't think the
company's been able to grow up to its ability,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Jay, vice president at BT Alex Brown in Boston, said the
spinoff could liberate the new company for strong growth in the
medical equipment market. ``Over the past five years we have seen a
number of medical technology companies spun out from larger
parents,'' said Jay. ``With independence and entrepreneurial
management, these companies in many cases have performed quite well
as investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Danaher predicted the new company would move quickly to make
strategic acquisitions in the medical equipment industry. She also
expected it to produce more products for use outside of hospitals,
such as home defibrillator units for emergency treatment of heart
attack victims.

LEGISLATURE URGED NOT TO REQUIRE OPEN-DOOR CLEMENCY HEARINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
and JAMIE STOCKWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The state's top parole official Tuesday urged
the Legislature not to require open-door clemency hearings for
murderers facing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles should fine-tune
its deliberations, which recently were upheld as constitutional,
and upgrade its computer-dependent review process, said board
chairman Victor Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we meet constitutionality,'' Rodriguez told the House
Appropriations Committee, ``why would we want to do more for
someone that has committed the most heinous crime against our
people?''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez acknowledged there have been ``serious challenges'' to
existing procedures from condemned inmates Joseph Stanley Faulder
and Henry Lee Lucas, executed inmate Karla Faye Tucker and others.
</P>
<P>
   But ``those cases have been decided in our favor. Now that those
things are cleared for us, we are contemplating a series of rules
changes that better spell out our clemency review process,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``we don't anticipate going above and beyond what the
courts have ruled is a system that's constitutional,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's stance drew biting questions from Reps. Sylvester
Turner, D-Houston, and Robert Puente, D-San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just having a philosophical problem with a board choosing
not to meet; when the public doesn't have the right to see what
you're doing,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no constitutional right to clemency,'' Rodriguez
responded. ``And I believe it would create a right _ to have a
public meeting,'' he said, adding, ``the full board is supposed to
be a representative body of the people of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Puente countered by saying ``it's not that it's the inmate's
right to a hearing necessarily. It's the public's right to know how
your board makes decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a hearing of the House Corrections Committee, Rep.
Elliott Naishtat, D-Austin, presented two measures, House Bills 397
and 398, that would require open proceedings on clemency questions;
require voting members to state reasons for their decisions and
establish criteria for granting clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board doesn't hold public meetings; doesn't meet at all to
deliberate or review clemency applications; relies on packets of
information that often aren't timely received; votes by phone or
fax; doesn't give reason for its actions; has no written guidelines
or criteria for evaluating requests and in a nutshell, does its
business in a secretive, arbitrary and perhaps capricious manner,''
Naishtat said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker noted that Gov. George W. Bush has not embraced his
proposals because the process passed constitutional muster, and
Naishtat's bills are opposed by the Justice For All victims rights
group.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``it's the right thing to do,'' Naishtat said. However,
his measure produced no immediate action.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez appeared before the spending committee to request $2.2
million for a new computer network to make deliberations more
efficient. He said the agency reviews 60,000 to 70,000 cases a year
and needs the network to link numerous field offices and board
members.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to discouraging an overhaul of the clemency process,
Rodriguez disputed the need for a new life-without-parole
sentencing option in Texas. Several related proposals are pending
in the House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the existing 40-year minimum term attached to
life sentences fulfills the same purpose and would have a
negligible impact on public safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, we have it,'' Rodriguez said. Forty calendar years
behind bars ``in fact constitutes a life-without-parole program.
The impact of that would be nominal,'' he predicted.
</P>

A-10 TEAMS HOPES BALL _ AND PLAYOFF BID _ BOUNCES THEIR WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The operative word is redemption. Virtually every
Atlantic 10 team will be looking for it during the conference's
postseason tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to vying for an automatic bid to the NCAA
Tournament, most of the teams are hoping to bounce back from
worse-than-expected regular seasons that made the league one of the
biggest disappointments in major college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no team has more to gain than the University of
Massachusetts (13-15), which was ranked as high as ninth in the
country in some preseason polls but never went above .500 after
winning its opener. UMass finished third in the Atlantic 10 East
Division and will meet Duquesne, sixth in the West, in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   In other first-round action, Fordham, the fifth seed in the
East, meets Virginia Tech, fourth in the West, at noon; St.
Bonaventure (fourth in the East) meets Dayton (fifth in the West)
at 7 p.m.; and St. Joseph's (sixth in the East) meets La Salle
(third in the West) at 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Four teams earned first-round byes and won't begin play until
Thursday. East champ Temple meets the Virginia Tech-Fordham winner
at noon; East runner-up Rhode Island meets the St. Joseph's-La
Salle winner at 9 p.m.; West champ George Washington plays the St.
Bonaventure-Dayton winner at 7 p.m.; and West runner-up Xavier
plays the UMass-Duquesne winer at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   UMass has made seven consecutive NCAA Tournament trips, but to
reach the Big Dance this season, it must win the A 10 tourney.
Reaching the tournament championship game could be worth a National
Invitation Tournament bid.
</P>
<P>
   With so many teams looking to salvage seasons, none can be taken
lightly, according to UMass coach Bruiser Flint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone is dangerous in their own way,'' said Flint.
``Sometimes you can overlook teams. Sometimes all of a sudden teams
who have been struggling all year can get it together and play well
for four nights. But then, some might continue to struggle, and
some might put it together one night and struggle the next.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic 10 had four teams ranked in both preseason polls,
tied with the Pac-10 for the most. UMass and the three others
(Rhode Island, Temple, Xavier) dropped out as the season
progressed. Temple (19-9, 13-3) returned last week, only to be
knocked out when it lost to UMass in the regular-season finale
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of basketball left,'' said UMass point
guard Charlton Clarke, who has been playing with a stress fracture
in his right foot for three weeks. How he fares with the injury
this week might determine how far the Minutemen go.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Atlantic 10 has put five teams in the NCAA Tournament
each of the last two seasons, it might not be so fortunate this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Temple is considered a lock, regardless of its showing this
week. George Washington (19-7) likely will earn at least an
at-large berth as long as it doesn't lose its first-round game.
Ditto for Xavier (20-9), which has two narrow defeats (to UMass and
GWU) in its last three games.
</P>
<P>
   URI (17-12) is in an intriguing situation. The Rams appeared to
have things turned around a week ago following a season-high
four-game winning streak, but they closed out the regular season
with consecutive losses. The Rams might have to win the tourney to
secure an NCAA bid.

MAKING AN INDELIBLE IMPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For most people, a misspelled word isn't that big a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   You may be briefly embarrassed if someone points it out in a
letter or something. If you work for a newspaper, you may even have
to correct it in the next day's paper. But it passes.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the misspelled word is tattooed on your arm. Then you've
got troubles.
</P>
<P>
   A man in Roseville, Mich., recently sued a tattoo parlor for
$25,000 for misspelling ``villain'' on his arm. He and the workers
at the parlor debated how to spell the word, according to a
newspaper story; they settled on ``villian.''
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   The man got the tattoo in 1996 but didn't notice the misspelling
till a friend made fun of him. Now he has a ``scar as long as his
forearm'' where he had the tattoo removed, according to his
attorney. (That still beats having a misspelled word there; you
might as well have a tattoo on your forehead that says ``stupid,''
too.)
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the tattoo parlor, meanwhile, says that if a
customer agrees to a misspelling _ the parlor's policy is to ask
customers how they want words spelled _ it's the customer's fault,
not his.
</P>
<P>
   As you might guess, local tattoo artists sided with him. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hairy situation &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell (customers), `If you're not sure, think before you
ink,' '' said Daniel Rees, the manager of Arizona Ink. ``Be really
sure before you make that step because once you've got it, you've
got it. Diamond rings are lost, stolen, hocked. Relationships come
and go, but that tattoo is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he urges caution. Most shops do. Usually, a customer has
to write out what he wants tattooed, then sign a release. Then the
artist draws a stencil, so the person getting the tattoo can see
what he's getting into before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   And it never hurts to double-check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got `incomplete' across my wrist,'' said Lloyd Parrack, a
body piercer at Crawling Squid Tattoo Studio. ``I checked three
different dictionaries to make sure it was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Good for him. Maybe it's just me, but if I were going to have
something as permanent as a tattoo needled onto my body _ making me
in effect a walking billboard _ I'd want to make sure it was
spelled correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even then, there are no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember this one guy was in a shop in South Dakota,'' said
Gene Roberdeaux, a tattoo artist at Mom's Tattoo. ``The guy spelled
`Harley-Davidson' wrong. He spelled it `Hairy-Davidson.' And it was
HUGE on the guy's back. I think if that ever happened to me, I
would quit tattooing.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd think you wouldn't have any choice, since your fingers would
probably be gnarled and covered with motorcycle tire tracks. At
least your fingers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Yeah, but . . .' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people get really upset,'' said Michael Hoffman, a tattoo
artist at Ultimate Art Tattoo. No doubt.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think you'd feel bad with a misspelled word or
slogan, think how you'd feel with a misspelled fiancee's name.
Ex-fiancee, probably, at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are usually, `You spelled her name wrong,' '' Parrack
said. ``No, this is the way you spelled it. You told me. They
usually go, `Well, yeah. But you spelled it wrong.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman once tattooed a fellow who misspelled (begin ital) his
own middle name. (end ital) Hard to blame Hoffman for that one. But
he also acknowledged misspelling ``vengeance'' _ as in, ``powered
by vengeance'' _ when tattooing someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked right,'' he said of ``vengence'' _ the way he
spelled it. ``It went by for weeks and nobody knew it. Then
somebody said something to the kid. He was embarrassed. He came
right in and got it fixed.'' A wise choice.
</P>
<P>
   Rees, of Arizona Ink, is right. Despite all the blood and
needles, this isn't brain surgery. It's tattooing. If you're going
to get something permanent, think.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that difficult,'' Rees said. ``Common sense would
tell you to take $3 and get a dictionary. Or go back to school and
get a GED or a high school degree.'' &QL;

BJ'S WHOLESALE CLUB POSTS BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter earnings for BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. handily
beat Wall Street expectations Tuesday, partly as a result of lower
expenses and strong holiday sales of jewelry and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the news, BJ's shares hit a 52-week high of 47 3/4 on
the New York Stock Exchange. The price dipped slightly at closing
to 47 11/16, up 4 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a sensational quarter,'' said Jack Nugent, BJ's
president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Natick, Mass. operator of 96 wholesale warehouse clubs had
been expected to earn 93 cents per share for the fourth quarter,
according to analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, BJ's earned $1 a share before results were adjusted for
a 2-for-1 stock split investors will see in Wednesday' trading
price.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter profits jumped from $29.6 million to $37.7
million, or about 27 percent, after earnings were restated to
reflect an accounting change.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Jan. 30, sales rose nearly 6 percent to
$1.03 billion. At stores open for at least a year, sales were up
4.5 percent when compared with the same 13-week period from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far, a robust economy and a strong holiday shopping season
have helped many retailers post better-than-expected earnings for
the fourth quarter, said Charles L. Hill, First Call's director of
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, 73 percent of the retailers in our survey have
exceeded expectations, and 72 percent have surpassed year-ago
results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even in a strong quarter for retailers, ``BJ's' performance
stands out,'' said Sally H. Wallick, an analyst with Legg Mason
Wood Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Several small factors contributed to BJ's' big quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were especially encouraging at the 12 club stores BJ's
opened last year, according to Amy E. Ryan, an analyst with
Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sales were brisk for jewelry and apparel, which
tend to have higher profit margins than most of the
supermarket-type items found at a BJ's. A year ago, a chunk of
BJ's' holiday sales came from TV sets and consumer electronics,
which have lower profit margins than jewelry and apparel, Ryan
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fair weather meant BJ's never had to dip into the
money it had set aside for snow removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saved a lot of money against our plan,'' said Nugent, who
added, ``A lot of little things went our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating Wall Street's expectations is nothing new for BJ's.
</P>
<P>
   This is the company's eighth consecutive year of both operating
and net income improvements, Nugent said.
</P>
<P>
   For its full fiscal year, BJ's said sales rose 10 percent to
$3.5 billion. Excluding a charge, earnings were $81.8 million, up
from $68.3 million.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Being just across town anyway, the United Nations
might want to send over a few of its delegates to see the August
Everding production of ``Khovanshchina'' now in revival at the
Metropolitan Opera. Diplomats trying to sort out Kosovo, Bosnia,
Serbs and Albanians could possibly find Mussorgsky's views on late
17th-century Russia chillingly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Opera is filled with gallant causes and tragic results, but the
political despair of ``Khovanshchina'' elevates it to a different
level of sophistication. There are few poetic deaths in this vast,
unfinished piece; even the self-immolation of fundamentalist
Christian Old Believers at the end can be taken as an act of
fanaticism as much as one of devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khovanshchina,'' which opened at the Met on Monday night,
depicts a quartet of political and religious forces hacking away at
one another in search of ultimate power. To somehow bind them
together, Mussorgsky has invented a female character named Marfa.
Alternately Old Believer, protector of feminine virtue against the
military police and soothsayer to one set of czarist pretenders,
Marfa is a somewhat artificial construct. But the composer
certainly needed some kind of cohering force in this jumble of
hostility.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Boris Godunov,'' true eloquence belongs to Mussorgsky's
chorus and to individuals like the drunken sentry, Kouzka (Nikolai
Gassiyev), and the Public Scribe (Constantin Pluzhnikov), acting as
marginal commentators on lofty doings. If ``Khovanshchina'' has a
message for us, it is that the global pockets of insurrection we
contend with today are sometimes less moral crusades than matters
of lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   For what better way to escape the oppression of drab
surroundings and vacuous tranquillity than to manufacture a
dramatic, violent life for one's self, feeling heroic about it all
the while? The causes come and go, but the bloody-mindedness
remains.
</P>
<P>
   The Met production from 1985 replaces Rimsky-Korsakov's
posthumous 1886 revision with Shostakovich's less intrusive version
first heard in 1960. The cast here is largely Russian, occasionally
American and in one prominent case Italian. Ming Cho Lee's design
features two elegant interiors and some plain outdoor scenes: one
with cutout Kremlin spires, the others formed largely from boards,
nails and rough carpentry.
</P>
<P>
   Valery Gergiev, who conducted, is now the Met's official
Russian, and he evidently has access to the best singing talent his
country offers. As usual, low voices dominate. Vladimir Ognovenko
is a booming, radiant Khovansky. Roberto Scandiuzzi _ singing
Dosifei, leader of the Old Believers _ smolders eloquently, if at a
slightly lower volume.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Forbis (Khovansky's son) takes one of the tenor roles
firmly; Vladimir Bogachov (Golitsin) sings the other in the
piercing, somewhat wavering Russian style. Nikolai Putilin
(Shaklovity) is a solid baritone.
</P>
<P>
   Dolora Zajick, big of voice and seemingly an apt Marfa, is
strangely subdued here. It behooves Ms. Zajick to dominate the
explosive personalities around her (Emily Pulley as Emma, Irena
Milkeviciute as Susanna). But often she seems almost to sleepwalk
through the part. Phebe Berkovitz, the stage director for the
revival, has her hands full with the large number of mob scenes,
sometimes too full.
</P>
<P>
   Gergiev brought his rough-cut conducting style to music close to
his heart. Offstage, the chorus was prone to confusion. Onstage, it
sang gloriously, as the music Mussorgsky wrote for it demands.

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION BACKS KILLING INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration came out Tuesday against
the independent counsel act, saying that public confidence in the
fairness of the Watergate-inspired law has been ``undermined rather
than enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the administration, Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder told a House panel that the law ``has failed in its goal of
removing politics from the process'' and that its ``structure comes
dangerously close to tipping the traditional balance of fairness in
the conduct of criminal investigations and prosecutions,''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said that he saw no way to fix the ``fundamental flaws''
in the statute and urged Congress to let it expire on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Justice) Department has reluctantly concluded that
decisions and actions under the act, both by independent counsels
and attorneys general, inevitably and unavoidably become such
targets for attack that public confidence in the administration of
justice in these high-profile cases has been undermined rather than
enhanced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holder suggested that investigations into the president and
upper-level administration officials should be handled by the
Justice Department in a manner similar to the system used before
passage of the 1978 independent counsel act.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that act, the attorney general would turn over credible
allegations against the president, vice president, most cabinet
officials, the CIA director and the FBI director to the Justice
Department's Public Integrity Section. The section would
investigate the allegations and recommend whether a special
prosecutor should be appointed.
</P>
<P>
   Holder's comments to the House Subcommittee on Commercial and
Administrative Law marked the first time the Clinton administration
has gone on record against the statute. The president and Attorney
General Janet Reno successfully lobbied for its renewal five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will likely continue its campaign against the
law _ which has been attacked by many Capitol Hill lawmakers _ on
Wednesday when Clinton's personal attorney, Robert Bennett, appears
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. Reno is scheduled
to testify before the same committee later this month.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Barry Toiv said Clinton ``concurs
with the judgment of the Justice Department that the statute should
not be renewed _ that its flaws outweigh its benefits.'' Toiv said
Clinton's judgment was ``a policy decision based on his observation
of how the law has been implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law requires the attorney general to
seek appointment of an independent counsel when there is
substantial and credible evidence of a crime by any one of 49 top
federal officials, including the president. A panel of three
federal appellae judges then picks an attorney for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans opposed the law when it was passed in the wake
of the Watergate scandal. During that time President Richard Nixon
ordered the attorney general to dismiss special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox, who had refused to drop a subpoena for
Nixon's incriminating White House tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, congressional
Republicans complained that the statute permitted independent
counsels to conduct politically inspired investigations. They cited
Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh's probe into the Iran-Contra
arms-for-hostages deals of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were so upset over the six years and $48 million
Walsh had spent investigating the Reagan and Bush administrations,
that they almost prevented the act, which had lapsed in 1992, from
being renewed. In 1993, 28 Senate Republicans threatened a
filibuster, but a newly elected President Clinton lobbied for the
measure and won.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, when a three-judge panel appointed Kenneth Starr to
investigate Clinton, Democrats have repeated many criticisms of the
law that Republicans had voiced earlier.
</P>
<P>
   However, Holder repeatedly emphasized that the administration's
reversal on the independent counsel law ``does not have to do with
any particular inquiry or investigation, but rather (with) the fact
that the types of decisions we are talking about here can be
controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that a ``climate of politicization pervades the process
regardless of which way a specific decision, investigation or
prosecution comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said independent counsels are ``largely insulated'' from
the normal checks placed on prosecutors because they have unlimited
time and resources to investigate one individual or event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This insulation contributes greatly to the independence of
these prosecutors, but it also eliminates the incentive to show
restraint in the exercise of prosecutorial power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has spent nearly $50 million on his investigation of
allegations against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Holder also said independent counsels are given too much
authority to expand their investigations, going far beyond their
original mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's mandate, for example, began with inquiries into
Clinton's Whitewater land deals in Arkansas and widened repeatedly,
finally to the Monica Lewinsky scandal that led to his impeachment
and trial. The Senate acquitted him Feb. 12 of perjury and
obstruction of justice.

A NOBEL LAUREATE RETURNS TO HIS FIRST LOVE: JOURNALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ He has already won a Nobel Prize, says there
are still books he needs to write and is about to celebrate his
72nd birthday. So it came as something of a shock to Colombians
when the novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez recently bought a
money-losing newsmagazine here and then promptly joined the ranks
of its reporting staff.
</P>
<P>
   But to Garcia Marquez, the decision makes perfect sense. For
years, he said, he had dreamed of using his Nobel Prize money to
organize a newspaper to be called El Otro, or The Other, so when a
group of young editors and reporters came to him with a proposal to
buy and overhaul the newsweekly Cambio, he welcomed it as a chance
to return to his first love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalism is the only trade that I like, and I have always
regarded myself as a journalist,'' said Garcia Marquez, who earned
a living as a newspaper and news-agency reporter before writing
``One Hundred Years of Solitude,'' the 1967 novel that established
his literary reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nobody would employ me'' after he won his Nobel in 1982,
he added jokingly, ``because it was too expensive. So now I pay so
that I can be published.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Garcia Marquez is president of the seven-member
board of directors of Cambio and the magazine's chief stockholder,
roles he is not accustomed to playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' he said, handing a business card to an American
visitor, an amused grin on his face. ``I've never had one of these
before.''
</P>
<P>
   By choice, though, his week-to-week duties at Cambio range as
far afield as editing copy and reviewing photographs. When peace
talks between the government and left-wing rebels began in early
January, he even went to the site of the negotiations as part of
the magazine's reporting team, sending dispatches that were
incorporated into the main article without his byline appearing.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Vargas, the magazine's new editor in chief, said that
one of the great advantages of having the Spanish-speaking world's
most eminent author on staff is that ``many doors open to him, and
he knows how to ask that they be opened.''
</P>
<P>
   That celebrity status has resulted in exclusive interviews with
heads of state and business leaders, but can create difficulties in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to feel the atmosphere, to be a reporter, but I have a
problem,'' Garcia Marquez acknowledged, referring to the commotion
caused when he appeared at the start of the peace talks. ``My
presence causes other reporters to treat me not as a colleague, but
as news. So I have asked my fellow journalists to respect my right
to exercise our craft.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cambio also provides a vehicle for Garcia Marquez's
ruminations about current events and the international scene.
Several of his essays have already been syndicated to publications
throughout Latin America and Europe, helping enhance the magazine's
reputation and improving its bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the article most widely reprinted was one in which
Garcia Marquez, to the consternation of Latin American feminists,
defended president Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   After recalling how Clinton dazzled him at a dinner on Martha's
Vineyard in 1995 by reciting from memory long passages from ``The
Sound and the Fury'' by William Faulkner, Garcia Marquez went on to
attack what he sees as an unhealthy moralism in American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president only wanted to do something that ordinary men
have done behind the backs of their wives since the beginning of
the world, and Puritan obtuseness not only prevented him from doing
it but even denied him the right to deny it,'' Garcia Marquez
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It is one thing to lie to deceive, and something
altogether different to hide the truth in order to preserve this
mythic instance of the human being that is one's private life.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether because of the lure of Garcia Marquez's presence or the
series of political crises Colombia has been experiencing lately,
the circulation of Cambio has risen sharply since the new
management took over at the start of the year. In the first four
weeks, newsstand sales doubled to more than 12,000, editors said,
circulation rose to about 45,000, compared with 171,000 for Semana,
Colombia's main newsmagazine, and advertising quintupled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Miguel Silva, president of Semana, said Garcia Marquez's
involvement with the rival publication ``is the culmination of a
process'' that has injected new life and energy into the Colombian
press, benefiting both reporters and readers.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, two new television networks have begun
broadcasting, and one of the two main daily newspapers in Bogota,
El Espectador, has been reinvigorated with new resources after
being bought by the country's leading business group.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a consumer of information, I'm all in favor of more
competition, whether on television or in print,'' said Luis
Norberto Restrepo Godoy, 31, a computer technician interviewed as
he bought a copy of Cambio at a newsstand here. ``The more
information I have at my disposal, the better off I am, so I
welcome the arrival of Garcia Marquez and the resurgence of
Cambio.''
</P>
<P>
   Silva said he was confident that more than one newsweekly could
thrive in Colombia, which has a population of 40 million. ``You
don't compete with Gabo,'' he said, using the nickname by which the
Nobel laureate is universally known here, ``but you can compete
with his magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both magazines are trying to be better, and to be better than
the other,'' Silva continued. ``It's like a good jazz concert,
where you have the trumpet and the saxophone responding to each
other. Having Gabo back in the trade makes everyone want to write
and investigate better every day.''
</P>
<P>
   As Garcia Marquez sees it, Cambio is carving out a niche that
allows it to avoid what he calls ``the scoop syndrome'' and to
treat ``journalism as a literary genre.''
</P>
<P>
   True to his novelist's instincts, he argues that what
subscribers really want is for reporters ``to tell a story, to go
back to the time when a reader could know what happened as if he
were there himself.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Garcia Marquez seems energized both by his
return to his original profession and the chance to work with much
younger reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this experience is making him feel profoundly alive,''
Vargas said. ``It is an antidote to his sacred status'' as Latin
America's most revered writer.
</P>
<P>
   With enthusiasm, Garcia Marquez recalled that the night in late
January that Cambio held a party to celebrate its rebirth, he
stayed at the event until midnight, greeting 2,000 invited guests.
He then returned to the office, working through the night to write
a long article about Venezuela's new president, Hugo Chavez, which
he finished as the sun was rising, just ahead of deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 40 years since I've done that,'' he said, delight in
his voice. ``It was wonderful.''

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION NOW OPPOSES INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration reversed course Tuesday
and announced opposition to the independent counsel law, saying the
21-year-old statute has diminished trust in government and should
be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   The Watergate-inspired act ``has failed in its goal of removing
politics'' from investigations of top administration officials,
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said, urging House members to
let the law expire June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate of politicization pervades the process regardless
of which way a specific decision, investigation or prosecution
comes out,'' Holder told a House subcommittee. ``The act was
supposed to increase trust in our government; unfortunately, it has
diminished it.''
</P>
<P>
   The position outlined by Holder, which was developed by a
Justice Department task force and cleared by the White House, is a
turnaround from the position staked out five years ago when Clinton
and Attorney General Janet Reno urged lawmakers to renew the law.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Barry Toiv confirmed that Holder
was speaking for the administration and that White House Counsel
Charles F.C. Ruff had been involved in discussions with the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The president ``concurs with the judgment of the Justice
Department that the statute should not be renewed, that its flaws
outweigh its benefits,'' Toiv said, adding that Clinton's new
position is ``a policy decision based on his observation of how the
law's been implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time the administration has gone on record
against the law, which provided the statutory muscle for Kenneth
Starr's five-year investigation of Clinton's Arkansas business
dealings and cover-up of his affair with former intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's examination of the White House sex scandal prompted him
to recommend Clinton's removal from office on charges of lying
under oath and obstruction of justice. Divided along party lines,
the House impeached Clinton, which led to only the second Senate
impeachment trial of a president in U.S. history. The trial ended
last month with Clinton's acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law was passed by Congress in 1978 in
reaction to President Nixon's effort five years earlier to thwart
investigations of his administration by dismissing Archibald Cox,
the first Watergate special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the attorney general to seek appointment of an
independent counsel when there is substantial and credible evidence
a crime has been committed by the president or a number of other
top government officials. A panel of federal judges appoints the
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno has sought appointment of seven independent counsels
in six years to investigate Clinton administration officials, she
has refused to seek appointment of a special prosecutor to examine
alleged violations of federal campaign fund-raising laws during the
1996 campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, renewal of the independent counsel law was
fought by Republicans, angered over the multiyear investigation of
the Iran-Contra scandal during the administrations of presidents
Reagan and Bush. Over the past year, Democrats have been turned
against the law by Starr's investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During his testimony Tuesday, Holder emphasized several times
that the administration's new opposition ``does not have to do with
a particular inquiry or investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said the law insulates independent counsels from normal
budget constraints and traditional Justice Department rules for
prosecutors. As a result, it ``comes dangerously close to tipping
the traditional balance of fairness in the conduct of criminal
investigations and prosecutions.''
</P>
<P>
   If the law is allowed to expire, investigations of high-ranking
government officials would revert to the Justice Department. The
attorney general, Holder said, could appoint special prosecutors in
cases where conflicts of interest clearly exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress' substantial oversight and funding powers, when
coupled with the power of the press, constitute a structure of
accountability,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Holder's comments before the House Subcommittee on Commercial
and Administrative Law were the latest from Democrats and
Republicans who favor allowing the law to expire June 30 rather
than trying an overhaul and extending its life for another five
years.
</P>

   BAND-IN-BERLIN-THEATER (New York) _ Broadway is new territory
for Susan Feldman. Not that she works far away: she is the director
of the well-known Arts at St. Ann's program in Brooklyn Heights.
Nor is she a stranger to music theater. She has produced and
commissioned a range of work since 1979, including ``Songs for
'Drella,'' Lou Reed and John Cale's piece about Andy Warhol. But
Arts at St. Ann's, at the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity,
is more commonly associated with the Brooklyn Academy of Music than
with Broadway, and Ms. Feldman is thought of more as a producer of
other people's work than as the creator of her own. Nevertheless,
after a long incubation period, she has conceived, written and
co-directed her first Broadway show. Entitled ``Band in Berlin,''
it opens Sunday night at the Helen Hayes Theater. By Anne Midgette.

   MILLENNIAL-FILMS (New York) _ A series of millennial films from
seven countries entitled 2000 Seen By, opens in New York on Friday
for the first leg of a pre-millennial tour around the country. By
Karen Durbin.
</P>
<P>
   OSCARS-SHAKESPEARE (Los Angeles) _ Even before the nominations
for the 71st annual Academy Awards were announced on Feb. 9, the
Miramax the Disney-owned company's juggernaut was at work, spinning
journalists and spending lavishly on trade paper advertisements
promoting the films, notably ``Shakespeare in Love.'' The
nominations cemented the belief that ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a
charming romantic comedy, directed by John Madden and starring
Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes, had emerged as (italics)the(end
italics) rival to ``Saving Private Ryan'' for the best picture
award. The awards will be given, for the first time ever on a
Sunday evening, on March 21. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   ACADEMY-AWARDS (Undated) _ With only two weeks to go until the
Oscars, my local movie theater is running a promotional spot for
this year's Academy Awards show. There they are, all the memories _
James Cameron crowing, David Niven fielding the streaker, Cher
winning for ``Moonstruck'' in the bird headdress _ in a pitch meant
to trumpet Oscar's glory. ``It's the night that brings the whole
world together and sets Hollywood apart!'' the ad exclaims. Since
when do we need reminding? At the very least, America's love-hate
relationship with the most divine of traditional awards shows
should mean a red-circled date on the calendar. Yet each year, the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences comes closer to
weakening its franchise and its hold on our collective imagination.
By Janet Maslin.
</P>
<P>
   20-DATES-FILM (Undated) _ For his first film, Myles Berkowitz
set up his camera and hoped for the worst. Inspired by Ross
McElwee's personal odyssey ``Sherman's March,'' a funny, rambling
first-hand account of that director's fraught relationship with
women, Berkowitz decided to film a series of his own dates. The
resulting movie, ``20 Dates,'' nudges real life along by
orchestrating its humorous situations. Closer in technique to MTV's
``Real World'' than to ``Sherman's March,'' it is cinema verite
that has slipped on a banana peel. By bending the rules to send up
the conventions of romance, Berkowitz, 36, produced a movie that
defies genre labels. By Ted Loos.

<P>
   DANCEGALAXY (New York) _ Dance, like youth, may be wasted on the
young. That is one of the premises of DanceGalaxy, a new ballet
troupe founded by Judith Fugate and Medhi Bahiri, which makes its
formal New York debut on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. Ms. Fugate
and Bahiri are part of a growing trend, in modern dance for the
most part, of providing showcases for the kind of burnished
artistry that comes only with age. By Jennifer Dunning. Photo.

   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews: ``Not About
Nightingales'' ``The Hothouse'' and ``Bright Lights Big City.''
</P>
<P>
   SLY-OPERA (Undated) _ Like Verdi's ``Falstaff,'' which preceded
it on the boards of La Scala by nearly three and a half decades,
Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari's ``Sly'' plays fast and loose with
Shakespeare, in the process enriching the material almost past
recognition. Unlike Falstaff, who marched straight from
Shakespeare's quill onto the Great Stage of Archetypes, Sly is a
character even his begetter promptly forgot. But Giovacchino
Forzano, a man of letters and the theater active at La Scala in the
first half of this century, saw Sly's potential. A play resulted,
and eventually an opera, which receives its belated American
premiere on Wednesday at the Washington Opera. By Matthew
Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   SNAKEBIT-THEATER (Undated) _ David Marshall Grant's first play,
``Snakebit,'' which reopens Monday at the Century Center for the
Performing Arts in New York City, seems to succeed in keeping
things small. Peter Marks, writing in The New York Times, called
the play ``the intimate sort of Off Broadway theater that has you
picking apart the characters long after the curtain falls.'' Not
that you would want to trade places with any of the central
characters in ``Snakebit''; they are all at various stages of
anxiety or depression. By Jesse Mckinley. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OPERA-LANGUAGE (Undated) _ Why is it that Americans (with
splendid exceptions) are valued internationally more for their
usefulness and versatility than for intimate personal contact with
Verdi or Puccini? And why do Italians, often with sketchy musical
backgrounds and faulty technique, sometimes penetrate their roles
more convincingly. The question is easy to answer. Italian is the
Italian's language, and Puccini begins with words. Melody, harmony
and rhythm are his way of getting words off the printed page and
into our ears. Italian singers don't imitate their language's
distinctive vowels and consonants; the right sound is a birthright.
And when a word in a libretto bears specific emotional baggage, the
Italian shapes it without thinking. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   COSI-FAN-TUTTE-OPERA (Undated) _ Many Mozart experts and opera
buffs will no doubt dismiss a recent release of ``Cosi Fan Tutte''
from Sony Classical with a knowing huff. It is a reissue of a 1952
recording, with Fritz Stiedry conducting the orchestra and chorus
of the Metropolitan Opera Association, as it was then called
(Masterworks Heritage MH2K 60652; two CDs). So what's the problem?
Mozart's opera, written in Italian, is performed in English. ``Cosi
Fan Tutte'' becomes ``Women Are Like That.'' And the recitatives
are accompanied not by a historically appropriate harpsichord or
fortepiano, as they would be today, but by a modern piano. Yet the
recording is a joy. The pleasure comes partly from nostalgia. By
Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY-CLASSICAL (Undated) _ Country has long been packaged as
the classical music of simple American folks. The transformation of
hillbilly entertainment into an official repository of our national
traditions has extended from the fancy naming of the Grand Ole Opry
in 1927 to the appointment of William Ivey, the director of the
Country Music Hall of Fame, to the chair of the National Endowment
for the Arts in 1998. Country music finds its real power in the
tension between nostalgia and the need for change, a contradiction
mined on two new albums. ``The Mountain,'' by Steve Earle with the
Del McCoury Band, investigates country's most classical form,
bluegrass. ``What I Deserve,'' by Kelly Willis, takes a more
eclectic approach. By Ann Powers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BECKER-PHOTOGS (Los Angeles) _ Harold Becker, a former
commercial photographer in New York, used a restored 1920s camera
more than 30 years ago to take a series of abstract portraits of
the female form. An exhibition of his work opened in Los Angeles
last month at the New Alchemy Gallery. The show is the fifth in a
series titled ``Still/Moving'' and runs through April 6. Since last
May, it has been a showcase for the still photography of Hollywood
professionals, for the most part cinematographers. By David Hay.

   TV-JEWS-WOMEN (Undated) _ About 30 Jewish professionals in
television and film a year ago organized the Morning Star
Commission under the auspices of Hadassah to work toward changing
Jewish women's stereotypical image on Televison. By Joseph Hanania.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KIASMA-ARCH-ANTIQUES (Helsinki, Finland) _ At a time when much
new architecture is almost interchangeable from country to country,
the Kiasma Museum in Helsinki is distinctive for the way it
expresses the national character of Finland and its landscape. The
name itself describes an intertwining of genetic material, but here
it takes on a more metaphoric meaning, evoking the confluence of
the urban streets that surround the museum. By Paula Deitz.

`DANCEMAKER': CHOREOGRAPHER WHO DEMANDS AND RECEIVES MUCH

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The performance of ``Esplanade'' that opens the
Academy Award-nominated documentary ``Dancemaker,'' about the Paul
Taylor Dance Company and its celebrated choreographer, is filmed
from the wings of the stage. There the dancers can be seen
preparing to spring into action, and they can be heard breathing
heavily afterward, moaning in relief. That signals the mostly
blisters-and-all approach of this vivid group portrait, which
extends beyond Taylor's creative processes to offer an overview of
lives utterly devoted to dance. It's a must for anyone who reveres
modern dance with even an iota of the passion seen onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-working performers seen here are united by the physical
kinship of shared experience, and by their consensus that working
with Taylor amounts to a near-religious experience. And as depicted
here, Taylor is not one to disagree with that assessment.
Soft-voiced yet coyly, discreetly imperious, he is seen exerting
absolute control over dancers who are thrilled to be part of his
world. ``Sometimes I think if I asked them to jump out the window
they actually would,'' he muses, and he seems to be halfway
enjoying that thought.
</P>
<P>
   Watching how Taylor creates a new piece with his troupe (the
scorching, tango-derived ``Piazzolla Caldera'') is the film's
central focus. And it's reason enough to explain the dancers'
reverence. The camera observes what is necessarily the
collaborative way in which Taylor's work takes shape. Discussing
their eagerness to please Taylor and live up to his expectations,
the dancers try to act out his suggestions and win his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to see something in front of me before I know if it's
what I want or not,'' he remarks. ``As a result, we do a lot of
fooling around and trying things.'' The film incisively illustrates
why this is by no means as nonchalant as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Matthew Diamond, ``Dancemaker'' observes the
creation of ``Piazzolla Caldera'' from start to finish, moving from
rehearsal studio to New York's City Center with a side trip to
India along the way. Though it branches out into talk about
financial pressures on the troupe and allusions to Taylor's
personal history, much of the film has the deliberately narrow
focus of an authorized version. Diamond, who has been dancer,
choreographer and a director on television series including
``Golden Girls'' and ``Designing Women,'' is now in charge of film
and video projects for Taylor. And he does work in a fair amount of
hagiography. (``I think often of my parents, how they took care of
me,'' says Ross Kramberg, the company's executive director. ``And I
turn it around and I think, `How can I take care of Paul in that
way as well?''')
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the format alternates interviews with dancers, chats
with Taylor and graceful, eloquent outbursts of dance. Among the
pieces seen at least in part here are the startling ``Cloven
Kingdom'' and ``Aureole,'' with Taylor himself seen dancing the
latter in 1962. He is movingly seen watching the same dance
performed by Patrick Corban, one of the current troupe members who
speaks most emotionally and touchingly about Taylor's influence.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Dancemaker'' is a reminder of just how autocratic
any artist must be in realizing his vision. ``I just didn't want to
work with her,'' he remarks coolly about a dancer he has dismissed.
``It just wasn't . . . interesting.'' The flip side of the triumphs
seen onstage is this absolute ruthlessness, and Diamond succeeds in
capturing both.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shawn Mullins was nearly two hours into his stay on
``Regis and Kathy Lee,'' and the three or so minutes he would spend
playing music had just concluded. Mullins, a Georgia-based
singer-songwriter, grinned while Regis Philbin quizzed him about
his recent Grammy nomination. In his worn brown jacket and rumpled
blond hair, Mullins looked as if he would be more comfortable
discussing poetry in a Village bar.
</P>
<P>
   He did not fade when he had to recount stories that he has
shared with scores of other interviewers about his nine years of
struggling and his break with the hit single ``Lullaby.'' He kept
smiling because he felt pleased to be there, but also because right
now smiling is part of his job.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after a limousine sped him south from Lincoln Square,
where the ABC morning show is taped, to the Paramount Hotel, where
he was staying, Mullins excused himself to decompress briefly.
``I'm just real honest,'' he said upon resurfacing. ``By the eighth
interview of the day if I think I'm going to be bad, I'll say we
need to reschedule. I just ask for what I need and try to do it
like a gentleman. A lot of artists don't want to say anything, and
then they eventually blow up. I am a product, I know. I'm pretty
aware of how to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If things were different, if he were different, Mullins, 30,
would be a perfect candidate for psychic explosion. Last spring,
after nearly a decade of playing tiny clubs, he won the lottery of
pop. He had hoped to spend his life as a moderately successful
singer-songwriter, and his countrified soul man's voice and
empathetic songs had gained him some attention. But he got more
than he had dared hope for.
</P>
<P>
   He'd written ``Lullaby,'' a song about a Hollywood wild child
with a sweeping chorus and a hip-hop beat, for ``Soul's Core,'' his
eighth album, initially released on SMG Records, the label he runs
with his fiancee, Kelly Hobbs. Atlanta's Top 40 radio station 99-X
started playing it, and it became a local smash. Mullins, who had
often played smaller spots like the Bitter End, showcased at the
Bottom Line, New York City's renowned singer-songwriter venue in
June, to a house full of record executives eager to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried about labels feeding off the one song,'' he
said. ``I listened carefully as I was talking to people. One in
particular, he's the head of a huge, huge music group, a great guy
and I'm sure a brilliant man, but he didn't know anything but
`Lullaby.' I asked him if he'd heard anything else on the record,
and he said no. I saw his two assistants gritting their teeth and I
was so sorry but that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose Columbia, the label of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen,
partly because Columbia's president, Don Iennar, had more deeply
understood ``Soul's Core.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he thought `Lullaby' was awesome, a great hit,''
Mullins said. ``But he also said `Twin Rocks, Oregon' was a really
cool song. His intention from the get-go was to make me a career
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   The executives at Columbia assured Mullins that the label would
be committed for the long haul. First, though, everyone agreed to
put some serious promotional money behind ``Lullaby.'' A
publicity-garnering video featuring the actress Dominique Swain,
who played Lolita in Adrian Lyne's 1998 film, turned the song into
an event. Columbia heavily marketed the single to radio, television
and the press.
</P>
<P>
   Led by ``Lullaby,'' the rereleased ``Soul's Core'' went gold by
the year's end. He said he had hoped that it would sell 20,000
copies last year; now it was selling 30,000 to 40,000 a week. Soon
the former folk music road warrior was sharing an arena stage with
Shania Twain and other hit makers. He was nominated for a Grammy
for best male pop vocal performance. (Eric Clapton won.)
</P>
<P>
   ``One month I'm playing at coffeehouses for 40 or 50 people, and
in debt,'' he said. ``Three months later I'm at Madison Square
Garden. It's a blessing, and it's a hard thing to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lullaby'' was a gift, a country-flavored, rap-influenced
modern rock song with an infectiousness that songwriters aim for
but rarely capture. It suited today's diverse pop market, which
unites teenybopper bands like 'N Sync with heavy metalists like
Korn, hard rappers like Jay-Z and silky divas like Kelly Price. Now
it is lodged in the brains of pop listeners, guaranteeing Mullins a
lifelong ounce of fame. But he wants a serious career as a
singer-songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Carter, the Atlanta-based manager who represents his
friends the Indigo Girls and fellow fledgling hit makers Fastball,
plans to help Mullins earn it. ``Shawn is prolific, he has great
production ideas and he has his ear to the ground,'' he said.
``He's not a Top 40 act like 'N Sync. What we want to do is create
a singer-songwriter career that can sustain him as an artist for
the next 25 years.''

<P>
   To that end, Carter is bent on establishing a live reputation
for Mullins. ``He needs to headline his own dates and find his own
audience as a live act,'' he said. ``That might mean turning down
an opening slot on a big tour. It's critical for him to perform a
90-minute set for people who are there to see him.'' He will play
one such date on Friday night at Irving Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins is not above doing promotion-driven events like the
championship round of Bandemonium, a battle-of-the-bands tour,
organized by the record-store chain Sam Goody, that concludes on
March 17 in Panama City Beach, Fla. Sharing the bill with two
unknown contest winners will keep his name in the media; it is
unlikely, though, that the spring break crowd will be the attentive
kind Carter wants.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Mullins will still manage to capture some new fans. He
is unusual among Top 40 performers, who are often unseasoned. He
has spent years learning how to woo a crowd. ``I was so impressed
with him,'' said Alan Pepper, an owner of the Bottom Line. ``With
all that pressure, if he was nervous you couldn't tell. He just
gave a great performance. He's got the goods: He sings great, he's
a writer, he's got a totally winning manner onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Danay, the executive who brought Mullins to Columbia, said
the label supported Carter's strategy. (Ms. Danay declined to
discuss details of the contract but the industry standard usually
binds an artist for six albums.) `` `Lullaby' has exposed Shawn to
an audience, and now we have to make sure that people really hear
his other songs,'' she said. `` `Soul's Core' is a very deep album;
there are a lot of potential singles.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Soul's Core,'' earnest love songs balance witty slices of
life and social commentary. But the depth Ms. Danay observes may
make no difference. ``The attention span of American record buyers
has shrunk incredibly,'' said Joe Fleischer, a columnist for the
trade magazine Hits, who first brought Mullins to the attention of
the industry. ``Nobody's waiting for the next single from Shawn
Mullins. All they want is another song. And the companies, artists
and managers are now OK with the idea that one single may be all
they'll get. They just try to get all they can out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a second single from ``Soul's Core'' is delicate.
Mullins said he would still like to be on the radio but wanted a
broader perception of his work. That was why he proposed that the
follow-up to ``Lullaby'' be ``Shimmer,'' a ballad about racial
tolerance and self-love that shows off Mullins' voice and his
musical chops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote `Shimmer' five years ago, and recorded it at the end
of 1994,'' Mullins said. ``When Columbia and I finally sat down to
plan things, I said, `I think I'd like to give this song a shot
because it's really strong.' I played it for them, and they said,
`That's the second single.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shimmer'' is initially being targeted at Triple-A radio, the
musical equivalent of VH1, which favors an older audience known to
enjoy songwriters like Billy Joel. Z 100 (WHTZ-100.3 FM), New York
City's biggest Top 40 station, is not yet playing the song, though
it favored ``Lullaby'' enough to invite Mullin to play at its
annual Jingle Ball at Madison Square Garden in December with Shania
Twain and other hit makers. Tom Poleman, Z 100 program director,
says he will pay attention to its status on less mainstream radio
stations, listen for fan requests and see how its video does.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Christopherson, who directed the ``Shimmer'' video, not
only had to follow up a splashy clip that had featured a movie
starlet; he also needed to present Mullins in a way that took him
beyond novelty status. The clip, shot in Atlanta, features a group
of locals in their Sunday best and in homey spots like a
barbershop. Mullins wears ordinary clothes and his patented sunny
smile; he has lost the groovy pink sunglasses he wore for
``Lullaby.'' His shoulder-length hair, little beard and sincere
gaze fulfill the poetic image of the modern-day troubadour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some artists require a tremendous amount of styling, but Shawn
is absolutely not one of those guys,'' Christopherson said of the
make-over process that helps many pop stars express their
personalities through clothes, hair and attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins embodies the stereotype of the sensitive artist, the
same one fulfilled by popular singer-songwriters from ``Sweet Baby
James'' Taylor to Jewel. He knows, however, that pop runs on a
paradox, requiring endless variations on the same basic themes. He
could become a mainstay of a particular pop arena, like his hero
Kris Kristofferson, whose ``Sunday Morning Coming Down'' he covers
on ``Soul's Core.'' Or he could be replaced next season by another
strumming balladeer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get emotional about it, it gets sickening,'' Mullins
said. ``So I have the artist part of myself, and the business part.
And my business person is just ruthless: He was careful to
negotiate a contract with Columbia that allows him the kind of
control he wielded by adding `Shimmer' to `Soul's Core.' '' He is
investing his money carefully, making prudent purchases like an
Atlanta house for himself and Ms. Hobbs. They still own the rights
to his seven independent albums, which are sold through their SMG
label.
</P>
<P>
   If he does end up a one-hit wonder, Mullins says, he still sees
a decent future for himself. He is writing songs these days on a
tour bus since he doesn't have to drive his van from gig to gig.
``I'll be able to play large clubs and small theaters for the next
20 years,'' he said. ``I'll probably always have Triple-A radio
play. I'll have something going on.''

   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Pledging to rebuild Nigeria but also urging
caution, the president-elect said on Tuesday that he would bring
together this fractious country, where years of military
dictatorships have heightened ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The president-elect, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who was declared
the winner of Saturday's election on Monday, promised in his
victory speech that he would restore openness and justice. To
ordinary Nigerians who have ``borne the frustrations and
inconveniences of the past,'' he said he would revive ``the dignity
of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My first duty and priority is to reconcile the people of this
country and heal their wounds,'' he said. ``I have no doubt in my
mind that every one in our ethnically diverse society has suffered
in many ways from the unacceptable and undemocratic manner in which
we have been governed for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo, who served as military ruler from 1976 to 1979, said
he would fight corruption, clean up the military and police, remove
obstacles to domestic and foreign investment and draw home the
thousands of Nigerians who have fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contest is over, but the process of democracy is
continuous,'' he said. ``I will continue to deepen and widen that
process for the benefit of all Nigerians. I call on all parties to
join me in that process. My belief in democracy is absolute.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked whether he favors establishing a
reconciliation commission, like the one in South Africa, to
investigate Nigeria's recent history of corruption and brutal
repression of human rights, Obasanjo did not give a clear answer.
</P>
<P>
   Many Nigerians have clamored for such a commission. But others
oppose the idea, fearing it would further divide the country and
perhaps even provoke an angry reaction from the powerful military.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Obasanjo accused him of being the candidate of these
powerful retired generals, who financed his party, the People's
Democratic Party, and who endorsed him personally.
</P>
<P>
   The general's political opponents contend that the retired
generals supported him because they felt confident he would not
investigate them if he was elected.
</P>
<P>
   His televised speech, in Abuja, the capital, was preceded by a
private meeting in the presidential suite on the seventh floor of
the Hilton Abuja, where Obasanjo is staying. In a small inner room,
surrounded by supporters, new governors and his wife, Stella,
Obasanjo received Gen. Yakubu Gowon, who ruled Nigeria from 1966 to
1975.
</P>
<P>
   Gowon was deposed in a bloodless coup by Gen. Murtala Muhammed,
whose assassination in 1976 led to the elevation of his deputy,
Obasanjo, to the presidency. Gowon offered congratulations and
urged all Nigerians to rally around the president-elect.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of journalists present were on their way out of the
suite when another visitor offering congratulations walked in: Gen.
Ibrahim Babangida.
</P>
<P>
   Babangida ruled Nigeria from 1985 to 1993 and set no fewer than
five dates for a transition to civilian rule that never came. He
was the one who annulled the 1993 presidential elections, which
Moshood Abiola apparently won, a decision that plunged Nigeria into
the political darkness from which it is still emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Babangida _ whose nicknames run from Evil Genius to Maradona,
after the Argentine soccer star, for his crafty footwork _ is
thought to have been Obasanjo's chief backer during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The three generals embraced and bantered, and traded a local
joke about winning and winning well.
</P>
<P>
   Babangida took no questions but allowed photographs and made a
brief comment: ``I believe the people have made the right choice. I
said six months ago that this country needs him. So I say
congratulations. Over the years, people didn't get to know what
government is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``All hands must be on deck to move this nation forward. We can
always build it together. I believe in the greatness of this
country, and I think we will get there.''

RECREATORS' MUSKETS EXEMPTED FROM STIFF BAY STATE WEAPONS LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Declare it a victory for historic battle buffs.
</P>
<P>
   Those who reenact famous battles will be able to carry antique
or replica muskets without worrying about breaking the law,
following votes Tuesday in the Legislature. Lawmakers amended the
stringent controls on assault weapons by exempting the older
firearms from required safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, guns stored or transported in Massachusetts
must have locking devices or be in locked containers. But a debate
has been raging as to whether the new law applied to antique and
replica muskets.
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers tried to sort it out, reenactors planning to
attend the Battles of Lexington and Concord next month _ a dress
rehearsal for next year's huge 225th anniversary staging of the
Revolutionary War events _ said they might not attend for fear of
being arrested.
</P>
<P>
   But the quick movement on Beacon Hill saved the Patriots Day
battles, as well as Friday's reenactment of the Boston Massacre
near the Old State House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were we not to act today, the echo would be still heard on
Friday and on Patriots Day,'' said Representative Jay Kaufman, a
Lexington Democrat. Patriots Day, a Massachusetts holiday, is April
19.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci is expected to sign off on the amendment
exempting muskets made before 1899 from trigger locks and storage
requirements. The amendment passed the House and Senate unanimously
Tuesday, however, not without a few members offering the proverbial
I told you so.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we debated the gun bill last year, those of us who
opposed it said it was poorly written and riddled with errors,''
Representative Ronald Gauch, a Shrewsbury Repulican, said on the
House floor. ``We are correcting a problem that should have been
avoided. The bill placed a tremendous burden on law-abiding gun
owners and sportsmen. It should have been focused on punishing
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   The reenactments, drawing participants from around the world,
had been in a state of chaos over the last few months since the
assault weapons controls were enacted. British forces even
threatened to pull out of the events.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment will have an immediate impact on two historic
muskets hanging in the Senate chamber, one from the battle of
Lexington and Concord and the other the first gun seized from the
British during the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham recently had both firearms
outfitted with trigger locks after the Gun Owners Action League, a
group that fought the new law, pointed out the guns violated the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Now those bright orange locks will be removed.

SENATE PANEL'S REPORT DETAILS Y2K THREAT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ No need for alarm yet, but the nation's lawmakers
are worried that on midnight Dec. 31 all hell could break loose if
the so-called Year 2000 computer bug is not resolved.
</P>
<P>
   A special Senate committee charged with investigating the Y2K
problem released a report Tuesday detailing disturbances that could
occur nationwide and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Although rating the possibility as ``low-to-medium,'' the panel
report raised the specter of everything from an accidental Russian
nuclear missile launch to civil unrest brought on by economic
collapse in some countries. All this as a result of tiny computer
chips in many systems failing to process information correctly
because they were not built to recognize the calendar year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel also warned that there could be minor to
significant disruptions in everything from utility services and
health care delivery systems to transportation and general business
operations. Disruptions in food distribution, energy and water
systems also could occur because governments and businesses have
failed to prepare for the possibility that many computer systems,
which use a two-digit dating method for data storage, may read the
year 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Americans, especially in rural areas, could
experience limited, short-term problems in services considered
crucial to their modern-day lives, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Y2K threat is real and heightened by the ubiquity of
microchips and our dependence on just-in-time delivery for
everything from groceries to medicine,'' said Sen. Bob Bennett,
R-Utah, who chairs the special Y2K committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said the problems would amount to only ``a bump
in the road'' as the world enters the new millennium. ``It will not
be crippling, and it will not last for an undue length of time,''
he said at a news conference held to release the panel's report.
</P>
<P>
   In a move aimed at helping some of America's smaller businesses
prepare for the year 2000, the Senate voted 99-0 Tuesday to provide
up to $500 million in loans through the end of this year to
companies that could be significantly affected or forced out of
business because of Y2K problems. The money will be used in most
cases to help companies fix their own computer systems and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate committee vice chairman, Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., cautioned Americans against panic, saying that they ought
to prepare for the Year 2000 as if they were readying for a
hurricane or winter storm, not the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, he said it would be a good idea for Americans
to put aside some canned goods and water, and perhaps a little cash
as well, to help them cross that bridge _ to quote President
Clinton _ into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need for stockpiling,'' Dodd stressed, adding that
``a few days of water and food'' should be sufficient to get people
through in areas that might be affected more severely by power
outages or other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, however, said predicting what will happen is difficult.
``We are guessing here, as everyone is.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd predicted that there would be no widespread power outages.
At worst, he said, there would be minimal failures for up to 72
hours or less in areas where smaller utility companies may not have
the resources to devote to Y2K compliance.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the committee found that most of the nation's 3,200
independent utility companies are behind in their efforts to
address the problem. But the panel's report notes that the electric
utility industry ``as a whole is configured to handle
interruptions, blackouts and natural disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A prolonged, nationwide blackout is not likely to occur,'' the
report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers are not particularly concerned about power
problems, they are worried about the possibility of serious
interruptions in the nation's health care system, which was found
to be lagging in efforts to deal with the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dodd said that 90 percent of the nation's
hospitals, and especially those in rural and inner-city areas, have
not begun to address potential problems if computer systems fail or
the microchips used in life support and analysis systems
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The committee described the U.S. health care industry as ``the
worst prepared ... for the Y2K glitch'' and noted that the lag in
correcting the problems could interrupt the supply chain of
pharmaceuticals that hospitals, clinics and even drug stores rely
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the health care industry's lack of
preparedness will necessarily mean the loss of life, but it could
seriously impact care for millions of Americans dependent on
prescription drugs and regular medical treatments to stay
healthy,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   He also raised concerns about the government's Medicare program,
which he said had not carried out any testing to determine whether
its payment delivery system will continue to work. ``We can only
hope that Medicare's billion-dollars-a-day in payments to hospitals
and caregivers continue to find their way through the high-tech
maze,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's report also emphasized what it described as the
``high probability'' of economic disruptions in Latin America, Asia
and Africa. It also singled out Venezuela and Saudi Arabia as key
world oil suppliers that are at least a year or more behind in
preparing for potential Y2K problems. In addition, Japan, Mexico,
China, Germany and Taiwan were cited as being behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett emphasized that the failure of other countries to
address potential problems could have a severe impact on the world
``because of the interconnectedness of our information systems in
every economic sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., who sponsored the bill aimed at
helping small businesses fix Y2K bugs, told lawmakers that the
``outlook is not good'' for the nation's small-business owners as
the new millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many small companies have not yet begun to realize how much of
a problem Y2K failures could be for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill must be approved by the House to become law.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee also began consideration Monday
of another controversial measure that would limit the amount of
damages awarded in Y2K-related lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Various estimates of how much it will cost the U.S. government
and private sector to address the Y2K problem ranges from a low of
$50 billion to a high of $150 billion.

IT'S `PROVIDENCE' TO BE WRAPPED IN COMFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Must be divine intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe end-of-the-week ennui.
</P>
<P>
   After suggesting that ``Providence'' was sappier than a case of
pure Vermont maple, I have watched seven of the eight episodes NBC
has aired (Fridays at 8, KING/5). That's better than my track
record with shows I adore, like ``Buffy'' and ``Sports Night.'' And
I can't possibly adore ``Providence,'' can I?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it has to do with being Rhode Island born and Rhode Island
bred (and when I die I'll be Rhode Island dead). Maybe it's just
good old Catholic guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Since its premiere on Jan. 8, the series has sneaked
up on me like a fogbank oozing up Narragansett Bay. Creeping slowly
along both sides of Beavertail, it slithers over the island
sentries Prudence and Patience, rolling quietly past Warwick Neck
and Conimicut until Providence itself is awash in gray.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Maybe that's it. ``Providence'' is so colorless, it is
actually soothing, a salve on the fevered mind. Especially after a
long week of stringing sentences together, of making verbs agree
with subjects, of rescuing participles dangling at the precipice.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday nights, when the brain is a quart low, it's easier to
commit a few idle cells to ``Nash Bridges'' than to a tart,
arresting episode of ``Homicide: Life on the Street.'' A formulaic
show like ``Nash'' demands nothing of the viewer but a little
loyalty. ``Providence'' makes the same simple request: Show up,
check your IQ at the door, turn on the TV and zone out.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has done it for years on Fridays, combining four hours of
vapid comedies with a slick newsmagazine. CBS does it with a
mixture of mindless amusement and formula drama. And now NBC, which
has been praying for a Friday night hit since ``Miami Vice,'' may
have found it in ``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   And I think I'm hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence'' is a pretty show, certainly prettier than my
memories of Providence. It is safe, unthreatening. Its writing is
barely adequate, though annoying when characters utter things for
the sake of exposition that normal folks would never say.
</P>
<P>
   The really good shows let us figure that sort of thing out on
our own, maybe with the help of a raised eyebrow or a subtle shrug.
But I sit and watch anyway as Dr. Sydney Hansen, formerly of Malibu
and the cosmetically enhanced beautiful life, toils at a clinic for
low-income patients in the hometown she thought, with the grace of
God, she'd left behind.
</P>
<P>
   I still find Sydney (Melina Kanakaredes) hopelessly altruistic,
and Sydney's sister, Joanie (Paula Cale), hopelessly annoying. But
still I watch.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, mine wasn't the only review that found
``Providence'' to be lacking. An NBC spokesman acknowledged last
week that the cons easily outnumbered the pros. Still, John Masius,
the show's creator, was surprised by the ``vitriol.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that, at worst, the show would be treated as
benign,'' he said, ``because it was coming from a sweet place and,
at best, that maybe it would move people.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ``Providence'' has moved people. It is the most
successful new drama of the season, a bona fide Top 20 show. So
successful that NBC added four episodes to its original order of
13.
</P>
<P>
   Masius, who created the treacly ``Touched by an Angel'' and
produced it for the first season, says the negative reaction forced
him into reflection. ``It obviously affected the critics in a very
strong way,'' he said, ``and I would rather have a strong negative
or a strong positive than have something that just sort of sits in
the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, it's ``Providence'' that seems to sit in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm right there with it, lapping up the syrup. Which may
explain my craving for pancakes on Saturday morning.

<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia _ Tesfay Hadush, a government health
inspector, rode eight hours in a bus Tuesday to celebrate one of
the defining events in his nation's history: On this day in 1896,
Ethiopian soldiers crushed the Italian army near the town of Adwa,
a rare victory by an African army over a European one.
</P>
<P>
   Hadush, 27, who lives in the south, was not the only one among
the crowd of tens of thousands of Ethiopians on the streets here
Tuesday who drew parallels between that victory and the nation's
more recent one: Last weekend, Ethiopia expelled the Eritrean army
from the Badme region, which it had been fighting for, with words
and bullets, for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a modern war, with sophisticated weapons, machine
guns,'' he said. ``That was a primitive one. But it's the same
thing: a war of aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   By a quirk of timing, the anniversary of that older battle _ now
a national holiday _ fell just days after the defeat of Eritrea in
Badme, a border area that both nations claim as their own. And so
Tuesday became a day of double celebration here.
</P>
<P>
   But three days after Eritrea said it was willing to accept a
cease-fire, Ethiopia still had not said whether it will end
hostilities in the war, whose latest round was fought for only
three weeks. The fighting apparently cost thousands of lives, but
the actual totals are not known.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Eritrea accused Ethiopia of having no interest in
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to have a shifting agenda and it's becoming clearer
and clearer this is not a border dispute at all,'' said Yemane
Ghebremeskel, an aide to Eritrea's president. ``They have
territorial ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   An Eritrean government statement on Tuesday accused Ethiopia of
wanting to overthrow the Eritrean government and President Isaias
Afwerki. Eritrean officials worry that Ethiopia, landlocked since
Eritrea seceded and became an independent nation in 1993, might
want to take the port at Assab, or even to re-annex Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian officials could not be reached on Tuesday because of
the holiday, but they have consistently denied that they want any
of Eritrea's territory.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of officials from other nations, however, are
speculating that Ethiopia in fact intends to keep fighting, and may
be trying to push Eritrea as far back as possible from the disputed
area. Or Ethiopia may be shifting focus to two other border areas
where it contends that Eritrean troops occupy Ethiopian land, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia and Eritrea, two former friends on the Horn of Africa,
went to war briefly last spring over a rocky triangle of land along
their 600-mile border, which was never officially demarcated after
Eritrea's peaceful passage to independence. Fighting resumed Feb.
6, after each nation spent eight months firming up its positions
and buying hundreds of millions of dollars in modern armaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking among some is that they are going to consolidate
their gains,'' one Western diplomat here said of the Ethiopians,
speaking on the condition of anonymity. The diplomat said outside
mediators were trying to send a message: ``Don't inflict injury.
Don't inflict a lesson. You taught them a good lesson at Badme.
Give up on all the fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   But it seems increasingly likely there will be no quick end to
the war, even though hopes were high after Eritrea was expelled
from Badme last week. On Saturday, it agreed to the terms of a
peace proposal, drafted by the Organization of African Unity, that
Ethiopia had accepted last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't over till it's over,'' the diplomat said. ``That
probably sums it up.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to find Ethiopians who believe that they should
continue fighting, despite Eritrea's acceptance of the peace
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their army has not been damaged enough,'' said Andreas Eshete,
a 53-year-old philosopher who teaches at the law school of Addis
Ababa University. ``If the past is any indication, there is no
telling what they will do if they continue to have the military
capacity,'' he said of the Eritreans.
</P>
<P>
   Aklilu Daniel, a 26-year-old sociologist who went to the rallies
Tuesday in Meskel Square, said most people he knows believe both
that Ethiopia should keep fighting and that it should work to
overthrow Eritrea's government. But Ethiopia should not, he said,
take any Eritrean land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war would lose its mainstream cause,'' he said. ``The
cause was to defend Ethiopia's sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel reflected a feeling among some Ethiopians that Afwerki of
Eritrea is responsible for the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Ethiopians seem to be in jubilant mood, believing they
had won the war even if the fighting has not died down yet. But
still, several people said it was hard to celebrate with so many
countrymen dead in a war against a nation that was once part of
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very strongly that we should not have any triumphant
celebration,'' Eshete said. ``First, I think it's in bad taste. Far
more important, I think this is a family fight. Only fools
celebrate the ill luck of their ex-spouses.''

 &HT;    Penalties against Mexico unlikely
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two of the harshest critics of the Clinton
administration's Mexican drug policy said Tuesday they will not
seek to reverse President Clinton's decision to certify Mexico as
fully cooperating with the United States in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement from Sens. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) and Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) means that Clinton's decision Friday to
certify Mexico in the war on drugs probably will not be overturned
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in the end that will happen,'' said Coverdell, a
member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has
jurisdiction over Mexican issues.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) joined a handful of GOP House
members in what they conceded was an uphill battle to overturn the
president's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell and Feinstein have been among the harshest critics of
the administration in the annual battle over certification of
nations cooperating in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   A decision not to certify can mean cutoff of trade and other
economic subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Coverdell and Feinstein withdrew a bid to overturn
the administration's decision to certify Mexico after extracting a
commitment from Clinton to measure more carefully Mexico's progress
in eradicating drug production and cracking down on the powerful
cartels that ship drugs to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Drug Enforcement Administration Director Tom
Constintine recently testified that Mexico had undertaken ``limited
enforcement action'' in the past year, both senators said they
wanted to give the effort more time to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican government is doing everything they can to be
cooperative,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting the Clinton administration over
certification, Coverdell and Feinstein will back new legislation to
blacklist individuals and businesses associated with the drug
trade. Individuals and businesses placed on the list would be
barred from doing any trade or business with the United States and
U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 companies associated with drug trafficking were
forced out of business in Colombia, where a black list has been in
effect since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply says you cannot participate in any trade of any kind
with the businesses and corporations of this nation,'' Coverdell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to certify Mexico still faces considerable
opposition in the House, where two committees plan hearings this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sorry story down there,'' said Rep. Spencer Bachus
(R-Ala.), who has introduced a resolution to overturn Clinton's
certification but exempt Mexico from any financial penalties. ``It
just defies imagination that the president would say Mexico is
fully cooperating.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual twist, Barr and Coverdell are on opposite sides of
the certification issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be privy to some information that I don't have,'' Barr
said of Coverdell. ``The information I have leads me to believe
that Mexico is not fully cooperating.''

SENATORS CONFRONT Y2K REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forget Y2K. Now, it's all about TEOTWAWKI.
</P>
<P>
   The dire acronym for ``the end of the world as we know it,''
which predicts what will occur at the stroke of midnight, Jan. 1,
2000, is in vogue on Web sites. Tuesday it made its way at last
into the Senate, as lawmakers met in a closed session to discuss
the potential Year 2000 crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Most said afterward that there was no reason to panic. But as
senators discussed the contents of a 160-page report on the topic,
they occasionally uttered warnings that made the Y2K problem seem
like a legitimate threat.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Dodd advised citizens to stock up on canned goods.
Senator Gordon Smith suggested passengers ask airlines about Y2K
before boarding a plane that night. Senator Robert Bennett said
there was a great likelihood of economic disruptions around the
world as a result of computer glitches accompanying the turn of the
millenium _ though he said national-security concerns appeared to
be less of a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a low probability of a nuclear launch,'' Bennett
said, while refusing to rule out the possibility of
intercontinental warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks followed a private session devoted in part to
informing senators about the Y2K problems faced by other countries
_ particularly Russia and China, whose military forces appear
ill-equipped to handle the added stress of a possible computer
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said Russia in particular faced the threat of
``deterioration of their military capabilities because of Y2K
simply adds to their problems,'' such as their inability to pay the
salaries of members of the military in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the world, particularly in regions with shaky
economies, Bennett said there is a ``medium probability of economic
disruptions that will lead to civil unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the chances of difficulty are much higher
internationally,'' said Bennett, the Utah Republican who heads the
Senate's Special Committee on the Year 2000 Problem.
</P>
<P>
   To address the potential threat of international war, lawmakers
are considering establishing a center in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
where officials from foreign countries would gather to observe one
another at the turn of the millenium, to make sure no nation was
launching a military offensive. Dodd described the facility as the
``Center for the Year 2000 Strategic Abilities,'' and said Russia
was the only nation on the guest list so far.
</P>
<P>
   To address potential problems at home, the Senate Tuesday
unanimously passed legislation to help guarantee loans to small
businesses in order for them to fix their computer systems. The
House has yet to act on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, ranking Democrat on the
Small Business Committee, said that ``unless businesses deal with
that issue now, they can wind up losing money and being hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But in general, Kerry said, ``in this country, I think the
effects will be negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's great dangers here,'' he said. ``I think
there are much greater dangers abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Although domestic companies are far better equipped to face the
new millenium, medical centers are still unprepared; some 64
percent of the nation's 6,000 hospital facitilies have yet to
adjust their computer systems, according to a report by the Gartner
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 percent of all doctors offices _ many of whom would
qualify for assistance through the loan bill the Senate passed
Tuesday _ are equally unprepared for the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications and energy systems are far better off,
Bennett said. He also dismissed a test failure at a power plant in
York, Pa., last month as ``not in any way life-threatening or
safety-threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure, Bennett said, occurred when power plant officials
turned the clocks forward during a Year 2000 test. The plant's
system failed, leaving officials mystified for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   But, Bennett said: ``That's why you do tests. Let's not
overreact to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But senators did hint at fears of traveling on the night the
century turns. Smith, a Republican from Oregon, said airlines are
likely to hold their computer systems to a higher standard than
even the government recommends, but cautioned that passengers
should contact airlines before taking a flight.
</P>
<P>
   And Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, said travelers going
abroad for New Year's Eve ``might want to go a few days early and
stay another couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The analysis we've been given here is that about 90 percent of
the problems that we could face at home should be remediated or
resolved within 72 hours...So I wouldn't be discouraging people
from foreign travel,'' Dodd said. ``But if I had to make
reservations today or had to do it, I'd certainly leave a little
leeway on either side.''

COMMENTARY: WORKING ON POVERTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)  
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Courage is a quality in short supply with
politicians of any era, and especially now. So it seemed odd at
lunch this week with Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of Housing and
Urban Development, to hear him insist, passionately and
un-self-consciously, that now is the time to move on behalf of the
perennial underdogs in our society _ the families living in squalor
and hopelessness on Indian reservations, or in the economic and
social wreckage that has defined Appalachia for decades, or in the
worst of our inner cities, which continue to be dangerous and
isolated crucibles of despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have real people in real pain that we have to attend to,''
said Cuomo, who toured the poverty-ridden coal mining regions of
West Virginia last week.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. economy humming, and with the budget deficit gone,
there is an unprecedented opportunity to make investments that will
bring training and real jobs to men and women for whom employment
has been little more than a distant memory, or a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is breaking all sorts of records,'' Cuomo said.
``And because the economy is strong we want to say everything is
good. A lot of things are good. Employment is up, crime is down,
poverty is down, welfare is down. But at the same time we have a
lot of significant problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He picked up a stack of large color photographs and spread them
across a table. ``The Dow Jones? They don't know from it,'' he
said, pointing to individuals in the photos who have been so
hounded for so long by poverty in the Mississippi Delta, on the
Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, on the South Side of
Chicago, that they cannot imagine an economically viable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great economy, yes,'' said Cuomo. ``But you go to
Appalachia, it's just like it was 30 years ago. We've had some
success with the cities, but overall the cities are not doing well.
They are smaller, poorer, and the poverty is more concentrated than
20 years ago. You want to say the poverty rate has come down? Yes.
But it's still one in five.'' He was referring to the fact that
even in these most prosperous of times, one in five American
children lives in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 poorest counties in the United States are rural, and
their poverty rates are staggering, in some cases higher than 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The way to deal with these problems is to put people to work,
said Cuomo. And because the economy is doing so well, the necessary
investments should be made now. ``You fix the hole in the roof when
the sun is shining,'' he said, ``not when it's raining.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal, said Cuomo, is to get businesses and jobs into
poverty-stricken areas, or to get residents of depressed areas into
jobs that are located elsewhere. ``We have some new approaches to
these problems that are designed to create jobs by stimulating the
private market economy,'' said Cuomo. ``It will require government
action because the private market is not going to South Central Los
Angeles without a subsidy. Period. So you have to say, `If you go
to South Central L.A., I'll give you a tax break.' That's Jack
Kemp's enterprise zones. Or you say, `If you hire a person from
South Central, I'll subsidize their salary.' That's Charlie Rangel.
We do both, but it has to be about either creating jobs or getting
people into jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era in which technological miracles have become
commonplace, it is possible to get good jobs to the unlikeliest
places. Cuomo recently asked a gathering of executives if their
operations could function out of the Pine Ridge Reservation. Sure,
he was told. For the right price, they could work anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo is trying to spread the word that there are many Americans
living in squalor and with very little hope at a time when the
nation is more prosperous than ever. He insists they can be helped
to help themselves, and that it is in the national interest to
offer that initial help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president talks about untapped markets,'' Cuomo said.
``Where do we still have the economic potential, the untapped
markets where the economy can still grow? It's the very same areas
that need the help. The high-unemployment areas. The high-poverty
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to do this. We have the resources. The excuses are
gone.''

LEWINSKY ENTERS NEW PHASE WITH TV APPEARANCE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Let the marketing of Monica begin.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night the former White House intern known almost
exclusively for her sexual escapades with the president talks to TV
celebrity confessor Barbara Walters. Thursday her own story in her
own words hits bookstores. By Friday, the campaign to resuscitate
her reputation _ and make everyone a pile of cash along the way _
will be as intense as the campaign for New Coke.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen whether consumers will accept the
newly sweetened version of Monica Lewinsky. She was, after all, an
unknown before dallying with Bill Clinton. Now she is known mostly
for the sort of behavior that makes people smirk, or simply makes
them mad.
</P>
<P>
   Still, public relations specialists and others who sell America
on people and products said the name Monica Lewinsky could also
mean money, and not just the quick kind. The trick, they stressed,
is in knowing which opportunities to grab and which to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who's given their 15 minutes of fame can turn it into
something positive or negative,'' said Steve Connelly, president of
Ingalls Advertising in Boston. ``How the fame is acquired is moot.
Give me 15 minutes with Barbara Walters and I can make something
happen. The question is: Is she savvy enough to do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, 25, has been smart enough to surround herself with
handlers. There is a publicist retained by the publisher of
``Monica's Story,'' St. Martin's Press, and another retained by the
Lewinsky family. There are agents and legal advisors, not to
mention her parents.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strategy has been one of restraint, at least in the
United States. Except for her televised deposition, Lewinsky has
not been heard from publicly since her relationship with Clinton
became known more than a year ago. Beside a starlet spread in
Vanity Fair magazine, the only photographs of her have come from
the paparrazzi.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks building up to the book's release, she and her
family have been more forthcoming in Europe, where Channel Four in
Britain paid $600,000 for an interview and where Lewinsky has posed
for magazines and will soon be signing copies of her story. No
signings are planned statewide. Still, reporters everywhere will be
stuck interviewing biographer Andrew Morton, who actually wrote the
book, since Lewinsky is still under a contract of sorts to
independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me that distance and dignity was the way to go,''
said Lynn Goldberg, who is handling publicity for Lewinsky and
Morton. ``This woman has been exploited. We want to sell books, but
we also need to protect her.''
</P>
<P>
   Also needing protection is Lewinsky's long-term image,
specialists said. Unlike actress Pamela Lee Anderson, caught on
videotape having sex with her husband, or sportscaster Marv Albert,
captured in court testimony wearing women's underwear, Lewinsky has
no reservoir of good will to draw on now. As Barry Glassner, a
sociologist at the University of Southern California who has
studied career crashes, put it, ``They had something to go back to.
In her case, it's all about what she becomes in the public mind in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the image experts agreed, Lewinsky must appear
sympathetic in Wednesday night's television interview (Walters says
she does) as well as remorseful (Lewinsky, apologizing to the
nation and First Family, says she is). Once that is done, they
added, she could capitalize on her notoriety in any number of ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would put her up for guest roles and Hollywood would jump
because Hollywood is the most forgiving place in the world,'' said
Sherri Spillane, president of the Ruth Webb Talent Agency in Los
Angeles, whose clients have included disgraced auto mechanic Joey
Buttafuoco, disgraced televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker, disgraced
ice skater Tonya Harding and Divine Brown, the prostitute who
helped disgrace actor Hugh Grant when he was arrested in her
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as she didn't make silly moves, she'd be off and
running,'' Spillane added. ``I'd try to get her a commercial,
personal appearances. It'd be endless.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the jokes that have Lewinsky as their punchline,
many of the career avenues now open to her are obvious. She could
do product endorsements, although advertising specialists advised
against cigars or lipstick if she wants to be more than a famous
fluke. She could even get her own talk show, since her name alone
would guarantee an audience at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely difficult to put your name in the public mind,
so she's 99.9 percent of the way toward having an enormous career
as, what else, a celebrity,'' said Al Ries, a marketing strategist
whose firm is based in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell. ``Of course
she's got to have a message. She's got to tell the public what she
has learned and how this has made her a better woman and tell women
how this will help her help them deal with the issues that they
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Ries urged Lewinsky to shun advertisements, no matter how
tasteful. Otherwise, he said, she could become another Donna Rice,
who posed for No Excuses jeans after her relationship with
Democratic presidential hopeful Gary Hart was exposed and then
disappeared from public view. A better role model would be Vanessa
Williams, who lost her Miss America crown after magazines published
nude pictures of her, kept a low profile for some time, then went
on to become a movie and music star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously she could have her own talk show, but that would be
a sad exploitation of what seems to be an intelligent woman caught
in a difficult or interesting situation,'' said Larry Weber, chief
executive officer of Weber Public Relations Worldwide in Cambridge,
Mass. ``She should definitely not do commercials unless it's
absolutely necessary to pay off her debts. That would be wrong for
living a happy and thoughtful life, and I know I sound more like a
therapist than a marketing adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives make no secret of the fact that they expect the
Lewinsky interview to be a ratings bonanza. Though the network is
in third place with two days remaining in the February ``sweeps''
period, Stu Bloomberg, chairman of ABC entertainment, said that
``it ain't over until the intern sings.'' He added: ``We hope
everybody's going to be watching Wednesday night.''
</P>
<P>
   As the image specialists recommended she should, Lewinsky
reportedly speaks candidly Wednesday night about her experiences
with Clinton and since Clinton -- and she does in the company of
the interviewer troubled celebrities everywhere seek out. Walters,
in a network statement, called her ``extremely articulate, poised
and often quite funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also says she loved the president, an admission that
some image consultants said could make her more likable to
Americans in general and to American women in particular. Neither
of them felt good about what the affair, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a very sensual man who has a lot of sensual
feelings,'' Lewinsky said in an excerpt from the interview released
Tuesday. ``And I think he also has a very strong religious
upbringing. . .I think he struggles with his sensuality because I
don't think he thinks it's okay. . . . He tries to hold himself
back. And then can't any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Don White, who heads the marketing group at Hill, Holliday,
Connors, Cosmopulous, a Boston-based communications agency, said
Lewinsky will be performing a delicate balancing act Wednesday
night. She must appear confident, but not too confident or viewers
may be reminded of early and misleading allegations that she
stalked the president. She needs to show that she is both
intelligent and a victim. She needs to help people get past their
first impressions of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should never put herself in a position that reminds people
of what she's famous for,'' said White, who did not spurn the idea
of endorsements as long as they are not self-parodying. ``She could
have some longevity, but if everything she does is based on what
happened to her last year, then no.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what steps Lewinsky takes or who she becomes, several
consultants said, the reason for her initial fame will haunt her.
Spillane, the Hollywood publicist, went so far as to insist that a
``normal'' life is now impossible for Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way for that to happen is for her to change her name
and have plastic surgery to look like someone else and move to the
middle of nowhere,'' she said. ``No one will ever let her forget
it. She's just got to figure out how to use that to her
advantage.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Responding to the ever-shifting fortunes of
high-technology industries, Hewlett-Packard Co., the cornerstone of
California's Silicon Valley, announced Tuesday that it would split
into two independent companies, one focusing on computers, printers
and scanners, the other on electronic test equipment and medical
technology products.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street greeted the move enthusiastically, sending
Hewlett-Packard shares up $2.75, to close at $68.625 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the split would allow Hewlett-Packard's computer
and imaging businesses to compete more effectively with more
focused companies that have lower cost structures, like the Dell
Computer Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Lexmark International
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hewlett-Packard's reputation was built on the quality
of its test and measurement equipment _ not to mention its
legendary founding in the iconic Palo Alto garage 60 years ago _
that business has been marked by higher overhead and slower growth
than the company had realized in computers, printers and scanners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has been in too many businesses,'' said Steven
Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``H.P. has actually done
surprisingly well through the years with a diversified business,
but the time has come for this kind of step. I think it should be a
shareholder-enriching event.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard has struggled to meet its own or analysts'
estimates of revenue growth, although it beat earnings estimates in
the most recent quarter through rigorous cost-cutting. Test and
measurement, which also includes medical products like ultrasound,
patient monitoring devices and heart defibrillators, had averaged
better than 10 percent revenue growth over the last decade, but in
the most recent fiscal year, growth dropped to 1 percent, because
of the Asian economic crisis and a slowdown in the semiconductor
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have quite a collection of businesses under one roof,
which have become increasingly divergent in terms of their business
models, the way they go to market, and the customers they serve,''
Lewis E. Platt, Hewlett-Packard's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   After the split, the computer and imaging company will continue
to be known as the Hewlett-Packard Co., while a new name will be
chosen for the measurement company. Hewlett-Packard plans a public
offering of 15 percent of the measurement company's outstanding
shares by year-end, which would be the largest initial public
offering in Silicon Valley history. The measurement business,
including chemical-analysis and medical businesses, represented
$7.6 billion of Hewlett-Packard's total revenue of $47.1 billion in
fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus we get from being separate will help our outbound
message,'' said Platt. ``What can you say about a company like
H.P.?''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, he said, Sun Microsystems, a major competitor in
large network server computers, ``is out there with just one
message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The complexity and confusion of having all these businesses
under one roof outweigh the synergy of having them all together,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Platt, 58, said he would remain chief executive until
Hewlett-Packard's separation was completed. That is expected to
take 12 to 18 months. A search for a successor is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the printer business, where Hewlett-Packard has a
commanding market share, the company has struggled to own any
particular market segment the way Sun is identified with the
Internet, Dell with personal computers or IBM with large enterprise
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that while Hewlett-Packard has credible offerings
in all of those markets, it has lacked a coherent strategy to
address any one of them. What is not clear is whether spinning off
test and measurement will change that picture, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think test and measurement is the crown jewel,''
said James Moore, chief executive of Geopartners Research in
Cambridge, Mass. ``Test and measurement is where the technology
tends to be, where a lot of the talent tends to be. The problem is
on the PC side. It was a great mistake for them to plunge so
heavily into PC's. They and Compaq got into a price war, and what
neither company understood was that Dell was hitting them in a
blind spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell has grabbed market share from Compaq Computer and
Hewlett-Packard with a combination of a direct sales model, which
eliminates the overhead of dealers and distributors, and custom
configuration, which allows it to sell machines at higher average
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Platt said the companies' business models were actually
coming closer together. ``Dell's out now very aggressively
recruiting dealers and distributors to help them serve customers
who prefer to be served that way,'' he said. ``While we started out
with very different multitier strategies, we are converging.''
</P>
<P>
   At $10.2 billion, revenues in Hewlett-Packard's computer
business increased 3 percent over last year; in contrast Dell grew
sales by 38 percent in the same period. At the same time, revenue
from the measurement organization declined 11 percent, with test
and measurement down 14 percent, chemical-analysis up 8 percent,
and medical-products down 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Platt said one quarter's results did not drive the decision to
split the company, but he conceded that they might have been a
factor. ``If we'd had quite a wonderful year, maybe there would
have been less urgency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward W. Barnholt, Hewlett-Packard's executive vice president
and general manager of the measurement organization, has been named
chief executive of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll work very hard to be an $8 billion start-up that will
compete very effectively with companies of all sizes,'' Barnholt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever name is eventually chosen for the new company, he said,
it will likely reflect the legacy of Hewlett-Packard. ``We
certainly want to build on the heritage of H.P.,'' he said. ``We
don't want to leave that equity behind.''

 &HT;    Unexpected gift given to Georgia beneficiaries
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Emory University, Young Harris College, a children's
home and retired Methodist pastors are the beneficiaries of the
$192 million estate of a South Georgia woman and her father.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts will fund scholarships at Emory's Candler School of
Theology and at Young Harris, shore up a ministers pension fund
that labors under a $30 million liability and secure the future of
a children's home in Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Adger Pitts of Waverly Hall, near Columbus, died in
July at the age of 104. Her death activated conditions not only of
her will, but also the will of her father, W.I.H. Pitts, who died
in the mid-1960s at the age of 103.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Pitts was a Waverly Hall dry goods merchant who built a
fortune based on Coca-Cola stock in the 1920s. His estate is worth
about $130 million and his daughter's is valued at about $62
million.
</P>
<P>
   The institutions will receive dividends from the investments of
the estate held in trust, about one percent of the value each year.
They will ask SunTrust Bank, the trust administrator, for the total
annual return of the trusts' value, about 4 or 5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   For Emory University, the gift is the third-largest in its
history. Emory's Candler School of Theology will receive the income
from half of the W.I.H. Pitts estate, which currently would be
worth about $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   Young Harris College in North Georgia will receive the income
from about $63.5 million, coming from both estates. Young Harris
now has the highest endowment of any two-year college in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Methodist Home for Children and Youth in Macon, also a
beneficiary of both estates, will receive the income from about
$47.25 million _ multiplying its current $8 million endowment by
six.
</P>
<P>
   A pension fund for ministers in South Georgia will receive the
income from about $16.25 million, about an eighth of Mr. Pitt's
estate. The Board of Pensions for the South Georgia Conference of
the United Methodist Church currently has an unfunded liability of
$30 million for ministers for the years they served prior to 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very significant in the history of American
philanthropy,'' said William Chace, president of Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Emory received $105 million in 1979 from Robert W. Woodruff, the
late Coca-Cola magnate. In 1996, the Emory Health Sciences received
$295 million from the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great impediment to going into the ministry is the student
loans that have to be paid off,'' said R. Kevin LaGree, dean of the
Candler School of Theology. ``We will begin next fall to fund six
full scholarships named for Margaret Pitts. It will be full tuition
plus $3,000 annual stipend. We will add six scholarships a year for
three years for a total of 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Harris, the tiny North Georgia college that boasts alumni
such as former Gov. Zell Miller, also intends to spend much of its
new-found income on scholarships, according to President Thomas S.
Yow III. Yow said Mr. Pitts became interested in Young Harris
because the son of his secretary was a student there.
</P>
<P>
   Yow said he would occasionally visit with Miss Pitts, who never
married, and they would have lunch together at a restaurant in Warm
Springs. ``On her 100th birthday, I asked her what she was going to
do for the next 100 years,'' Yow said. ``She said, `I'm going to
find me a man.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Yow laughed. ``I thought to myself, `Gosh, I hope not.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Pitts was always interested in the Methodist Home for
Children and Youth in Macon. ``We have a cottage on our campus that
we call Miss Margaret's house,'' said Steve Rumford, administrator
of the home. ``She was here at the groundbreaking, and she had a
shovel in her hand. She was 103. She was sitting in a wheelchair
with the shovel. She had a tremendous love for Methodist
institutions in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumford said the children's home will use its proceeds from the
estate to help fund prevention services for disadvantaged children.
``This is a defining point in how we will address the next
century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald M. Kea, chairman of the Board of Pensions for the South
Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church and senior
minister of the Albany First United Methodist Church, was a pastor
in Waverly Hall when Mr. Pitts died. The minister recalled how he
was always concerned with the support of retired preachers. ``He
had given two homes to retired ministers in Waverly Hall,'' Kea
said. ``It was one of his philanthropies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kea credits Columbus industrialist W.C. Bradley with influencing
Pitts to make the investment that grew to a fortune: ``It was Mr.
Bradley's persuasive powers that got Mr. Pitts to invest in the
Coca-Cola Company. He must have been quite persuasive because Mr.
Pitts was not one to throw money away. Coca-Cola was a risky
investment then.''
</P>
<P>
   When W.I.H. Pitts drew up his will in 1938, the value of his
estate was $1.2 million, Kea said. At the time his daughter died
last July, the value had shot up to $166 million, falling a bit
since then because of a slide in the price of Coca-Cola stock.

BUSH, IN STEP TOWARD CANDIDACY, TO FORM EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush announced Tuesday he
would form an exploratory committee that would allow him to raise
money as he continues to contemplate the possibility of running for
the Republican presidential nomination next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the announcement was expected and is not a formal
commitment to seek the presidency, the move is significant because
it marks the first official step Bush has taken in what promises to
be a long, expensive process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the Texas press, and therefore my fellow Texans, to
hear it from me first, that this coming Sunday I'm going to
announce the formation of an exploratory committee to determine
whether or not I should seek the presidency,'' said Bush, the son
of former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of you who have been covering me every day know I don't
make this decision lightly. I've carefully considered its
ramifications,'' said Bush, who was joined on the Governor's
Mansion lawn by his wife, Laura.
</P>
<P>
   As he mulled the idea of running in recent months, Bush emerged
as a leading contender in a crowded field of would-be Republican
candidates, including Elizabeth Dole, magazine publisher Steve
Forbes, former Vice President Dan Quayle, Arizona Sen. John McCain,
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and conservative commentator
Pat Buchanan, who announced Tuesday he was launching a third bid
for president.
</P>
<P>
   Some right-wing Republicans question Bush's conservative
credentials, but a number of GOP officials believe his brand of
politics, which he calls ``compassionate conservatism,'' represents
the party's best chance of retaking the White House after an
eight-year shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 52, said that although he needed to stay focused on
legislation session in Texas, he believes it's time to find out if
there is enough support to launch a formal candidacy. And a key way
to gauge political strength is through fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``First things first. I'm going to start raising money to
determine whether or not there is an interest beyond people just
coming to Austin,'' he said, referring to delegations of GOP
lawmakers from other states who have gone to the Texas capital to
urge Bush to run.
</P>
<P>
   Jokingly, Bush said he needed to know if his popularity extended
beyond the fact that he is the governor of a big state and the son
of a ``famous mother,'' a reference to former first lady Barbara
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has the luxury of tapping into a well-established,
fund-raising network that traces its roots back to his father. The
governor also flexed considerable fund-raising muscle by gathering
more than $17 million for his re-election campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   The governor did not say when he would make a decision on a
formal candidacy or how much money he thinks he needs to raise for
such an effort.
</P>
<P>
   He has held back making a decision as he thought about the
effect a race would have on his wife and 17-year-old twin
daughters, Jenna and Barbara, all of whom have voiced reservations
about him running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked a lot with Laura and the girls, and while
there's some natural concerns about the potential major change in
our life, I am convinced, and Laura is convinced, that our love for
each other is strong enough and our family is close enough to take
whatever life brings,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was hesitant about is the ugliness that we all see in
political life,'' Laura Bush said. ``George and I went through the
1992 election with his dad. It was a very miserable year for all of
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dread criticism of my husband. On the other hand, I love
George, and I'm very proud of him. And I know he'd make a great
president,'' she continued, her words bringing tears in the
governor's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had compelling reasons to consider running for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my family and for every family in America, I want the 21st
century to be prosperous,'' Bush said. Additionally, he said, he
wanted to usher in what he called a ``new era of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Bush has conceded he was ``young and
irresponsible,'' but he has declined to cite specifics about any
youthful indiscretions, other than to say he drank too much alcohol
but stopped when he was 40. But he also has insisted there is
nothing in his past that would prevent him from running for
president.

LEWINSKY ENTERS NEW PHASE WITH TV APPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Let the marketing of Monica begin.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night the former White House intern known almost
exclusively for her sexual escapades with the president talks to TV
celebrity confessor Barbara Walters. Thursday her own story in her
own words hits bookstores. By Friday, the campaign to resuscitate
her reputation _ and make everyone a pile of cash along the way _
will be as intense as the campaign for New Coke.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen whether consumers will accept the
newly sweetened version of Monica Lewinsky. She was, after all, an
unknown before dallying with Bill Clinton. Now she is known mostly
for the sort of behavior that makes people smirk, or simply makes
them mad.
</P>
<P>
   Still, public relations specialists and others who sell America
on people and products said the name Monica Lewinsky could also
mean money, and not just the quick kind. The trick, they stressed,
is in knowing which opportunities to grab and which to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who's given their 15 minutes of fame can turn it into
something positive or negative,'' said Steve Connelly, president of
Ingalls Advertising in Boston. ``How the fame is acquired is moot.
Give me 15 minutes with Barbara Walters and I can make something
happen. The question is: Is she savvy enough to do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, 25, has been smart enough to surround herself with
handlers. There is a publicist retained by the publisher of
``Monica's Story,'' St. Martin's Press, and another retained by the
Lewinsky family. There are agents and legal advisors, not to
mention her parents.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strategy has been one of restraint, at least in the
United States. Except for her televised deposition, Lewinsky has
not been heard from publicly since her relationship with Clinton
became known more than a year ago. Beside a starlet spread in
Vanity Fair magazine, the only photographs of her have come from
the paparrazzi.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks building up to the book's release, she and her
family have been more forthcoming in Europe, where Channel Four in
Britain paid $600,000 for an interview and where Lewinsky has posed
for magazines and will soon be signing copies of her story. No
signings are planned statewide. Still, reporters everywhere will be
stuck interviewing biographer Andrew Morton, who actually wrote the
book, since Lewinsky is still under a contract of sorts to
independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me that distance and dignity was the way to go,''
said Lynn Goldberg, who is handling publicity for Lewinsky and
Morton. ``This woman has been exploited. We want to sell books, but
we also need to protect her.''
</P>
<P>
   Also needing protection is Lewinsky's long-term image,
specialists said. Unlike actress Pamela Lee Anderson, caught on
videotape having sex with her husband, or sportscaster Marv Albert,
captured in court testimony wearing women's underwear, Lewinsky has
no reservoir of good will to draw on now. As Barry Glassner, a
sociologist at the University of Southern California who has
studied career crashes, put it, ``They had something to go back to.
In her case, it's all about what she becomes in the public mind in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the image experts agreed, Lewinsky must appear
sympathetic in Wednesday night's television interview (Walters says
she does) as well as remorseful (Lewinsky, apologizing to the
nation and First Family, says she is). Once that is done, they
added, she could capitalize on her notoriety in any number of ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would put her up for guest roles and Hollywood would jump
because Hollywood is the most forgiving place in the world,'' said
Sherri Spillane, president of the Ruth Webb Talent Agency in Los
Angeles, whose clients have included disgraced auto mechanic Joey
Buttafuoco, disgraced televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker, disgraced
ice skater Tonya Harding and Divine Brown, the prostitute who
helped disgrace actor Hugh Grant when he was arrested in her
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as she didn't make silly moves, she'd be off and
running,'' Spillane added. ``I'd try to get her a commercial,
personal appearances. It'd be endless.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the jokes that have Lewinsky as their punchline,
many of the career avenues now open to her are obvious. She could
do product endorsements, although advertising specialists advised
against cigars or lipstick if she wants to be more than a famous
fluke. She could even get her own talk show, since her name alone
would guarantee an audience at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely difficult to put your name in the public mind,
so she's 99.9 percent of the way toward having an enormous career
as, what else, a celebrity,'' said Al Ries, a marketing strategist
whose firm is based in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell. ``Of course
she's got to have a message. She's got to tell the public what she
has learned and how this has made her a better woman and tell women
how this will help her help them deal with the issues that they
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Ries urged Lewinsky to shun advertisements, no matter how
tasteful. Otherwise, he said, she could become another Donna Rice,
who posed for No Excuses jeans after her relationship with
Democratic presidential hopeful Gary Hart was exposed and then
disappeared from public view. A better role model would be Vanessa
Williams, who lost her Miss America crown after magazines published
nude pictures of her, kept a low profile for some time, then went
on to become a movie and music star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously she could have her own talk show, but that would be
a sad exploitation of what seems to be an intelligent woman caught
in a difficult or interesting situation,'' said Larry Weber, chief
executive officer of Weber Public Relations Worldwide in Cambridge,
Mass. ``She should definitely not do commercials unless it's
absolutely necessary to pay off her debts. That would be wrong for
living a happy and thoughtful life, and I know I sound more like a
therapist than a marketing adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives make no secret of the fact that they expect the
Lewinsky interview to be a ratings bonanza. Though the network is
in third place with two days remaining in the February ``sweeps''
period, Stu Bloomberg, chairman of ABC entertainment, said that
``it ain't over until the intern sings.'' He added: ``We hope
everybody's going to be watching Wednesday night.''
</P>
<P>
   As the image specialists recommended she should, Lewinsky
reportedly speaks candidly Wednesday night about her experiences
with Clinton and since Clinton -- and she does in the company of
the interviewer troubled celebrities everywhere seek out. Walters,
in a network statement, called her ``extremely articulate, poised
and often quite funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also says she loved the president, an admission that
some image consultants said could make her more likable to
Americans in general and to American women in particular. Neither
of them felt good about what the affair, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a very sensual man who has a lot of sensual
feelings,'' Lewinsky said in an excerpt from the interview released
Tuesday. ``And I think he also has a very strong religious
upbringing. . .I think he struggles with his sensuality because I
don't think he thinks it's okay. . . . He tries to hold himself
back. And then can't any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Don White, who heads the marketing group at Hill, Holliday,
Connors, Cosmopulous, a Boston-based communications agency, said
Lewinsky will be performing a delicate balancing act Wednesday
night. She must appear confident, but not too confident or viewers
may be reminded of early and misleading allegations that she
stalked the president. She needs to show that she is both
intelligent and a victim. She needs to help people get past their
first impressions of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should never put herself in a position that reminds people
of what she's famous for,'' said White, who did not spurn the idea
of endorsements as long as they are not self-parodying. ``She could
have some longevity, but if everything she does is based on what
happened to her last year, then no.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what steps Lewinsky takes or who she becomes, several
consultants said, the reason for her initial fame will haunt her.
Spillane, the Hollywood publicist, went so far as to insist that a
``normal'' life is now impossible for Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way for that to happen is for her to change her name
and have plastic surgery to look like someone else and move to the
middle of nowhere,'' she said. ``No one will ever let her forget
it. She's just got to figure out how to use that to her
advantage.''

BUCHANAN SAYS HE'LL HEAL AMERICA'S SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Patrick J. Buchanan, the revolutionary
Republican who turned politics on its head in 1992 and 1996,
declared Tuesday that he will be a candidate for president in 2000,
promising to ``heal the soul of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody, mount up and ride to the sound of the guns,'' he
exclaimed at the end of his announcement speech to a couple of
hundred supporters chanting ``Go, Pat, Go!''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, the conservative television commentator and author,
retraced many of the same themes that won him an ardent following
during the last two presidential elections. He panned the Clinton
administration for what he called its ``moral deficit'' and its
gutting of the armed forces, he demanded a moratorium on
immigration, and he decried a trade imbalance that has cost
American jobs. He also said he would stand up for the rights ``of
the innocent unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   A strong part of Buchanan's appeal in 1992, when he put a scare
into President George Bush, and in 1996, when he beat Senator Bob
Dole here, was his anger over the weak economy and his promise to
return people to work. This time, however, even Buchanan concedes
that ``the economy is doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Buchanan told reporters that the nation had lost 250,000
manufacturing jobs and farm income has fallen. ``Go down to
Weirton, West Virginia. Not everyone is doing well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he delivered his prepared remarks without the usual verve
of past campaign appearances, Buchanan's attacks on the Clinton
administration, with its yearlong sex scandal, drew the most
enthusiastic response from his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's greatest deficit is no longer found in the federal
budget,'' he said. ``It is a moral deficit, and it may be found in
a polluted and poisoned culture that has become the great enemy
within.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, he said, ``this temple of our civilization, has
been desecrated, used to shake down corporate executives, to lie
with abandon to the American people, a place to exploit women.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd included a hefty contingent from Massachusetts, as
well as Catholic schoolgirls from Richmond, N.H., nuns, priests,
and many who are still deciding between Buchanan and Senator Bob
Smith, also a candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Testerman, a 1996 Buchanan delegate from Mount Vernon,
said she was surprised not to see many of the familiar faces who
helped Buchanan beat Dole three years ago. But this time,
Testerman, too, has moved on. She is working as the state
coordinator for Gary Bauer, the socially conservative head of the
Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Buchanan is also competing with many more candidates
for the hearts and votes of the far right here. Besides Buchanan,
former Vice President Dan Quayle is appealing to the right, as are
Publisher Steve Forbes, US Representative John Kasich, Bauer, and
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas D. Rath, a Concord attorney who is helping Lamar
Alexander's campaign, said Buchanan might still unify socially and
economically conservative voters. ``He knows his way around up
here. He has incredible loyalty from the voters,'' Rath said. ``It
becomes a problem for the Quayles and the Smiths.''

 &HT;    The writer who awoke the master
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jack Nicklaus will never forget him. He was his
motivator, the burr under his saddle, the guy who pricked his
self-esteem and brought his game alive for one more dramatic
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that might be a little strong, but you could never tell
John Montgomery that. The year was 1986. It had been 11 years since
Nicklaus last won the Masters. He was now 46 years old. You found
his name down around the journeymen of the PGA Tour, 160th on the
money list. His career was making the hard turn from playing golf
courses to building them. On his way to Augusta, he had stopped
over to see how work was going on his project at Country Club of
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, his partner in business, had reached their rented
house in Augusta first, and when Nicklaus arrived he found the
clipping attached to the refrigerator door. What Tom McCollister
had written in the Sunday sports section of these papers was what
``most of the media and many of his fellow competitors agreed _
that Jack Nicklaus' championship days were over,'' as it is written
in the Masters yearbook. But Tom had put it in print, that
Nicklaus' game was beyond championship caliber. He was through.
</P>
<P>
   Oft times, we in the press are inclined to overvalue the
influence that something written has on the outcome of a sports
event. Clippings on bulletin boards before football games, or
basketball tournaments. Horses can't read, or we might even take
credit for upsets in the Kentucky Derby. In this case, Nicklaus
left no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   He turned the back nine at Augusta National in 30 strokes that
Sunday afternoon. Seve Ballesteros knocked it in the water on 15.
Greg Norman missed the green on 18. Tom Kite couldn't make the putt
that would have forced a playoff. Nicklaus had won at age 46, and
one of the first things he did in the champion's interview was to
call for Tom McCollister. Not to hassle him, but to tell him what
an inspiration he had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked into the interview room, Tom said, `I guess I'm
the last person in the world that you want to see,' '' Nicklaus
recalled on Tuesday. ``And I said, `No, you're the first person in
the world I want to see.' ''
</P>
<P>
   I know of no man who loved golf more than Tom McCollister. He
loved to play, he loved to talk it, he loved to walk it. Once had a
hole-in-one in the Atlanta Classic pro-am. He had a sweet swing
that I envied. Mine looked like a logger trying to fell a tree. He
was good company on a golf course. I raged in despair. He took the
breaks as they came and moved on. That was just his nature, as it
was when he was moved from the golf beat to the snarling world of
stock-car racing. He took it and moved on, did well and soon had
the respect of those guys used to living at 190 mph.
</P>
<P>
   He had come to Atlanta in 1963, purloined from one of the
Jacksonville papers. He was a good journalist who could handle any
assignment and, for a long while, endured the most agonizing. What
we called ``working the slot'' in those primitive days, when we had
a staff of 15. (We have so many now, we should wear convention
tags.) That meant editing, moving copy, riding herd on plodding
writers, getting the section out on time and reaching for the
Alka-Seltzer.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably what drove him to try public relations with the
Atlanta Hawks. Even with Pete Maravich to glamorize, he found that
wasn't what it had seemed to be. He went to Birmingham, his
hometown, to try PR in the World Football League. When that league
up and died, he came back to The Constitution and finally made his
marriage with golf.
</P>
<P>
   After all those nomadic years on the stock-car run, this was to
be a homecoming. No more bags to pack, no more Holiday Inns, no
more accursed jams trying to get to the track. Home at last. Return
to the Masters. Back to what he loved. Golf. And what happens? One
mile from home, the car of another person he had never seen and his
car come together at an intersection, and Tom McCollister is gone.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the saddest days of our life around here. Not
that we'd seen that much of him around the office, but he was
always there in one form or another. He had a warm, easy laugh, a
pleasantness toward everyone, and he was a professional. I don't
know how old he was, but it didn't matter. He was always young to
me. Life is not fair. Why is it death always reaches out for the
good ones?

 &HT;    Not-so-secret interview kicks off Lewinsky tell-alls
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't even pretend like it's over.
</P>
<P>
   The Year of Monica enters its 15th month and we're just now
getting to the good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbara Walters two-hour interview with Lewinsky airs at 9
tonight on ABC's ``20/20'' _ though its allure diminished Tuesday
when much of the interview was leaked. (Walters has a chance to
salvage her ratings and what's left of her ``exclusive'' on this
morning's ``Good Morning America,'' which starts at 7).
</P>
<P>
   The interview has become the worst-kept secret since the
semen-stained dress. Lewinsky quotes had been leaking in the media
since last week. ABC, tired of all the leaking, finally leaked its
own quotes Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some highlights from the interview, taped in ABC's New
York studios Feb. 20:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lewinsky, 25, said, ``I never will have an affair with a
married man again,'' and apologized to first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Chelsea Clinton, saying she was sorry for ``what
they've been through.'' She also said the president never discussed
his marriage with her, and never told her he loved her.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Bill Clinton's sensuality: ``I think he's a very sensual
man who has a lot of sensual feelings. And I think he also has a
very strong religious upbringing. And I think that he struggles to
. . . I think he struggles with his sensuality because I don't
think he thinks it's OK. And . . . I think he tries to hold himself
back. And then can't anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning there was a very intense sexual attraction,
and I don't necessarily think a sexual attraction is a bad thing,''
she said. ``I didn't feel that way _ and I still don't.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Linda Tripp: ``I pity her. I would hate to be her.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On how hurt she was when he didn't call after he hugged her at
the ``black beret'' event: ``That was the starting event . . . that
led me to be susceptible to making a bad judgment in confiding in
Linda Tripp. It was devastating, devastating for me . . . that he
didn't call. . . . This unexplainable behavior in my mind meant:
`It's over. He didn't really care about you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For those still interested after the Walters interview, there's
the tell-all book ``Monica's Story,'' as told to Princess Diana
biographer Andrew Morton, delivered to bookstores Thursday (NBC's
``Today Show,'' airing 7-9 a.m., interviews Morton on Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   There's also an overseas TV interview with Britain's Channel 4
on Thursday (which Channel 4 said Tuesday will not be available to
satellite dish owners in the United States). In that interview, for
which Lewinsky is being paid $660,000 and 75 percent of
distribution sales, interviewer Jon Snow told TV Guide,
``(Lewinsky) sees Linda Tripp as contributing to the very specific
moment when she did feel suicidal. . . . She literally runs out of
damnation for Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow also said Lewinsky is ``angry, very angry at (Kenneth)
Starr. . . . She feels completely let down and violated.''
</P>
<P>
   Will this be it? Not likely, though the media that people love
to hate might finally get its due: Hustler publisher Larry Flynt,
displayer of Republican sex scandals, recently told the Internet
magazine Salon he'll start investigating the sex lives of media
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the media moguls better look out,'' Flynt said.
``Apparently (one prominent anchor) is like a rabbit _ I mean, he's
got a revolving door to his office. Many of them have been divorced
four or five times. A lot of the divorce transcripts are
available.''

EYE ON THE PRIZE (2ND, THAT IS)  
 PROBLEM SOLVING  
 LONESOME RANCH  
 GOING LIVE, FOR ONCE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a ratings sweep month marked by success for
``event'' programs at most of the networks, the final outcome
remains in some doubt until two last events are figured into the
total numbers: the opening of an Egyptian tomb on Fox on Tuesday
night and, potentially the biggest event of all, the Barbara
Walters interview with Monica Lewinsky on ABC Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The results are important to the two networks because ABC is
still hoping to beat Fox for second place behind NBC in the
young-adult audience that all three networks regard as the main
field of competition. For several years' worth of sweeps, Fox has
beaten ABC among viewers between 18 and 49, and ABC would sorely
like to reverse that trend.
</P>
<P>
   That feat would require an enormous showing by the Lewinsky
interview because Fox was ahead of ABC by a substantial margin
going into Tuesday night. Neither network had any hope of
overtaking NBC, which will win the February sweep by a comfortable
margin in every ratings category. That amounts to a comeback of
sorts for NBC, which in November slid all the way to a near tie
with Fox among young-adult viewers and behind CBS among total
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC had an especially good month with several special
programs, including the miniseries ``The '60s'' and the movie
``Alice in Wonderland'' _ both big hits _ and the final appearance
by George Clooney as a regular on ``ER,'' which was the most
watched show of the month.
</P>
<P>
   CBS acknowledged that NBC had a more formidable sweep
performance in February, but pointed to a heavier total of special
programming on NBC. CBS said it used 86 percent of its regular
programs while NBC used 72 percent. Still, the biggest difference
for NBC may have been the presence in February of one new regular
series, ``Providence,'' which has become a hit on Fridays. That was
four hours' worth of hit ratings NBC did not have in November.
</P>
<P>
   CBS had effective special programs of its own, including a
miniseries called ``Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke'' and
the Grammy Awards. The latter did so well with younger viewers that
CBS, which usually ignores the ratings for the young audience that
the other network lust after, pointed out that the Grammy show had
its best young-adult ratings in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives said they had their most competitive sweep since
May 1997. One big reason was ABC's special event, a three-part
Stephen King movie, ``Storm of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   That helped push the four networks to one of their best overall
performances in some time. On the Thursday night when Part 3 of
that movie was shown opposite Clooney's departure from ``ER,'' the
four networks reached 72 percent of the total audience, up more
than 12 percent from the average network share for the season.
Scott Sassa, the president of NBC Entertainment, said those results
showed what the networks were still capable of doing when they
provided ``good programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how well the Lewinsky interview does for ABC on
Wednesday, three networks may improve on their performance from
November. Only Fox would be down.
</P>
<P>
   _ By BILL CARTER
</P>
<P>
   PROBLEM SOLVING
</P>
<P>
   The end of the sweep usually means a sudden flood of repeat
episodes for most of television's best shows (which have to hoard
most of their remaining episodes for use in the next sweep month,
in May). But ABC finds itself in a difficult position with its
drama ``NYPD Blue,'' because the first five episodes this season
all involved the illness and eventual death of the character played
by Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Bloomberg, the chairman of ABC Entertainment, said Tuesday
that the network felt it would be awkward to repeat episodes with
Smits, and besides, that repeats of ``NYPD Blue'' never did very
well anyway. So ABC is replacing ``NYPD Blue'' on Tuesday at 10 for
five weeks starting on Tuesday with a new series, ``Strange
World,'' an ``X-Files''-like look at an alien invasion of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The show was always intended as a regular series, and ABC
committed itself to making 13 episodes. But the network, looking to
kick up interest, is promoting the show as if it were a miniseries,
calling it ``an exclusive limited series from a producer of `The
X-Files.' '' The network hopes to give the impression that the show
is a special event and to let ``NYPD Blue'' fans know that their
show is in no danger of being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``Strange World'' shows any signs of life in this trial
run, it will continue after its ``limited run'' concludes in five
weeks.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   LONESOME RANCH
</P>
<P>
   Is there a booby prize? Not exactly, but during every sweeps
period there has to be a show that finishes last. This time, among
the major broadcast networks, the dubious distinction will go to a
UPN period drama, ``Legacy,'' about a horse-ranching family in
Kentucky in the 1880s. While it earned some critics' praise, few
viewers were interested. It clocked a 1.1 average Nielsen rating
for the February sweep period, or 1.09 million homes, and a 2
share, meaning 2 percent of sets in use.

   GOING LIVE, FOR ONCE
</P>
<P>
   ``All That,'' a sketch comedy and variety show that anchors the
Saturday night lineup on Nickelodeon, has often been called ``
`Saturday Night Live' for Kids.'' This weekend, it will be exactly
that.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate its 100th episode, the show is being produced live,
with plenty of star trappings. Cast members and other celebrities
will arrive to red-carpet-and-flashbulb treatment, mimicking the
Academy Awards. The teen-age pop star Britney Spears will sing (her
single ``Baby One More Time'' is No. 1), Busta Rhymes will rap and
Melissa Joan Hart (former star of the Nickelodeon hit ``Clarissa
Explains It All'') will be a guest star.
</P>
<P>
   Another teen-age pop star, Mya, will be host and will interview
celebrities in the audience, including the former cast members Lori
Beth Denberg, Alisa Reyes, Angelique Bates and Catrina Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell, both now 20, and Josh Server,
19, are the only cast members remaining from the original ``All
That,'' which first appeared in January 1995. Most of the others
are young teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out in theater, and Kenan and I still do live comedy
routines, so I'm not scared about it,'' said Mitchell, who with
Thompson also stars in ``Kenan and Kel,'' which usually follows
``All That'' on Saturday nights but will be bumped this week to
expand the 100th episode to an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger kids haven't done live stuff,'' he added, ``but
they're all psyched up for it. They're like our little brothers and
sisters, and we just tell them, if something goes wrong, you
improv. You say another quick line, something witty, and keep going
_ never panic, never stop.``

 &HT;    Southwest Texas State at 100: Notice us, we're getting better
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MARCOS, Texas _ The university that groomed U.S. President
Lyndon Johnson, country music star George Strait and syndicated
consumer columnist Heloise brings you this important message: The
school is better than you think.
</P>
<P>
   Today as Southwest Texas State University marks the the 100th
anniversary of its founding, the school is touting its academic
victories and trying hard to shed its party school image.
</P>
<P>
   Decades after its modest beginnings as a teacher training
academy, called a normal school, SWT remains a leading producer of
Texas teachers. But its mission today is far broader. And its
problems are as complex as those of most big schools.
</P>
<P>
   As a major liberal arts university, SWT now attracts more
prominent faculty and better-prepared students than at any time in
its history. After the school dramatically raised admissions
standards in 1992, a fourth of the students who used to be admitted
no longer were eligible, President Jerome Supple said.
</P>
<P>
   SWT boasts a geography department that was ranked first in the
country by the Association of American Geography; a master of fine
arts in creative writing program considered among the top 20
nationally and aspiring to be in the top 10 within five years; a
jazz ensemble that is one of the few college bands featured at the
Montreux Jazz Festival; and a physics program cited as exemplary by
the American Physical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty cited in recent years as the being among the best in
their fields by national organizations include physicist Carlos
Gutierrez, business educator Beverly Chiodo and speech
communication professor Steve Beebe, SWT spokeswoman T. Cay Rowe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just behind UT and Texas A&AMP;M as the third- or
fourth-most selective public university'' in Texas, SWT President
Jerome Supple said.
</P>
<P>
   Supple hopes to spread that word, especially during this
centennial year of campus festivities and lectures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've made a lot of improvements in quality over the
last several years,'' said Supple, who became the school's eighth
president in 1989. ``But we don't believe we've made equivalent
improvements in prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   Affecting SWT's prestige is its lingering party image, which
Supple said had been fading until it got national attention last
month. At separate fraternity parties, one student was beaten to
death by an ex-student; another was hospitalized with a blood
alcohol level more than five times the legal driving limit.
</P>
<P>
   Supple responded by taking the unusual step of suspending 12
fraternities. But he is not optimistic the drinking problem is
solved.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat ironic that a school that had strong prohibitions
against drinking for most of its history developed a party
reputation, said Ron Brown, an SWT history professor and acting
dean of general studies.
</P>
<P>
   When the school opened in 1903 to 303 students and 17 faculty
members, Principal Thomas G. Harris, a strict Baptist, preached
prohibition. He was so vehement that when prohibition foe Oscar
Colquitt was elected governor, Colquitt ordered Harris'
resignation, Brown writes in SWT's centennial history book, ``Up
the Hill, Down the Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris' successor, Cecil ``Prexy'' Evans, who was in office from
1911 to 1942, was equally strict but avoided Harris' fate. Not only
was drinking prohibited, he banned women from riding with men in
cars. Evans _ who had a major influence over aspiring teacher
Lyndon Johnson, a 1930 graduate _ called SWT ``a poor man's
school.'' It almost exclusively drew students from the Austin-San
Antonio corridor.
</P>
<P>
   That began to change as the school transformed from a teacher's
college to a liberal arts college under James McCrocklin, president
from 1964 to 1969. His also was the first administration to allow
alcohol at university functions, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Supple became president in 1989, SWT had grown
dramatically for more than a decade and was still growing. The
schools' main campus lies along the San Marcos River in the heart
of a city of 39,000 people, a fourth of whom are students. The
campus consists of 160 buildings spread over 428 hilly acres. SWT
enrolled 21,504 students in the fall, its second-highest. They came
from virtually every Texas county.
</P>
<P>
   Like most public institutions, SWT has turned to private sources
for support. On Saturday, it ended its first major capital campaign
with $67.5 million, well above the $60 million goal. That will help
boost the school's $29 million endowment, meager compared to the $7
billion Permanent University Fund that helps support the University
of Texas and Texas A&AMP;M University systems.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty salaries also are lower at SWT: an average of $46,865
compared with $64,546 at UT, which has many more prominent faculty
and is nationally known for its research.
</P>
<P>
   But SWT students and faculty said they like their school's focus
on undergraduate teaching. Faculty typically have their office
doors open, and are often seen chatting with students.
</P>
<P>
   Heather McKnight, 19, a freshman majoring in health care
administration, said that she was attracted to SWT from the Houston
area because ``it's a lot more friendly, and it's really beautiful
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although SWT is now the sixth-largest university in Texas, it
still feels small, students and faculty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when I would have regarded UT as more
prestigious, but now I'm not interested,'' said Faculty Senate
Chairman Jon Bible, who teaches business law. ``I'm happy here.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean SWT is problem-free, he said, citing large
classes and indications that research is getting much more
attention. Although SWT does not aspire to be a research
institution, ``some faculty fear, in practice, we are getting more
and more research-oriented,'' Bible said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Grant, a junior who is majoring in education and serves
as president of the Black Student Alliance, said she is happy with
the school. Even so, she said, she is aware some blacks feel
alienated on the campus, which had racial tensions last year after
three black football players were accused of raping two white
women. A grand jury found insufficient evidence to charge the
players, and they were reinstated on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are the largest minority group on campus, 18.1 percent
of the student body; black students make up 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More students are choosing SWT as their first choice for
college, Supple said. Without tinkering again with standards, the
school could balloon to 30,000 students in a half a dozen years, he
said. He wants enrollment capped at 26,000.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Supple expects the school to add doctoral degree
programs, beyond the one in geography. He also wants to improve
freshman retention. Almost a third of last year's freshmen did not
return as sophomores this fall. But before admissions standards
were raised, 42 percent were not returning.
</P>
<P>
   Retention affects graduation rates, and SWT needs to improve
that as well. Only 41 percent of students graduate in six years or
are still enrolled, Supple said.
</P>
<P>
   The school also plans to serve more working adults by expanding
the graduate school and its evening programs at the Westwood High
School in north Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Supple noted that the first edition of the yearbook, the 1907
``Pedagog,'' which still is being published, described the school's
role as a citizen-maker, not merely as a maker of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred years from now, he said, ``I would hope that we would
still see ourselves as citizen-makers.''

ANOTHER DAY TRADER SHUT DOWN BY BAY STATE REGULATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In yet another move against the increasignly popular
day-trading industry, Massachusetts securities regulators shut down
the Boston office of TCI Corporation Tuesday for allegedly making
``outrageous'' claims of guaranteed income.
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper advertisements and an Internet website,
California-based TCI claims day traders who speculate in the stock
market using TCI's ``formula'' for investing will make six-or
seven-figure profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see guarantees of success like that, we have to take
action,'' said Matt Nestor, Director of the Massachusetts
Securities Division. ``Everything we've seen around the country,
every bit of experience we have tells us that people don't make
money day trading, certainly not that kind of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Day trading _ which gets its name from the practice of holding
stocks for less than a day _ has become big business across the
country. Firms have sprung up nationwide catering to a growing
number of speculators who trade huge blocks of stock in
transactions that often last only seconds. Dedicated traders make
hundreds of such trades a day. And untold numbers have reportedly
taken up day trading at home using personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators, alarmed by day trading's sudden popularity, have
taken a dim view of the practice, saying it's little more than
gambling. Massachusetts led the nation with the first regulatory
action against a day trading firm last October, shutting down Block
Trading in Boston. Regulators from the state securities division
alleged that just one of a total 68 day traders at Block Trading
made money. Block denies the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the securities division has taken action against
local offices of Bright Trading Inc. for failing to register with
the state, All-Tech Investment Group for abuses ranging from
deceptive marketing to forging customers' signatures, and On-Line
Investment Services for deceptive marketing and churning accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In moving against TCI Tuesday, the securities division alleged
that TCI engaged in deceptive marketing with promises of huge
profits for investors. Secretary of State William F. Galvin has
said his office will move aggressively against any firm making such
claims.
</P>
<P>
   But Timothy Cho, TCI's founder, said he's outraged by Tuesday's
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand behind all our claims,'' he said. ``How can a
government agency come in here without any basis and close us down.
I thought this was America. It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   He said day traders who come to TCI pay $6,000 to learn the
firm's investment formula, which Cho claimed is a system of
indicators telling speculators the best time to buy and sell
stocks. He claimed all but a small percentage of those investors
make six-figure incomes, though he didn't have records that
specifically track the performance of TCI day traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an impeccable record,'' he said, adding that despite
the claims in TCI advertisements, ``everybody knows there's
absolutely no guaranty. Past performance doesn't guarantee what
will happen in the future.''

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ A hard-line political leader of the
Kosovo Liberation Army resigned on Tuesday, raising hopes among
diplomats that the ethnic Albanian guerrilla movement will sign an
autonomy plan proposed at peace talks last month.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Kosovo, meanwhile, Yugoslav tank and mortar fire
pounded the hillsides along the Macedonian border, striking at
rebel positions and driving thousands of ethnic Albanian civilians
from their homes in some of the heaviest fighting since the start
of the peace talks at Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   American and NATO officials said on Tuesday that the Yugoslav
military buildup in Kosovo was a clear violation of a cease-fire
reached in October. However, they said that NATO would probably
refrain from punitive strikes to avoid undermining efforts to reach
an accord between the Yugoslav government and the ethnic Albanians
once talks resume on March 15.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the Kosovo Liberation Army's political
representative, Adem Demaci, that he would step down was widely
interpreted as clearing the way for the rebels to accept the peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Demaci opposes the peace plan, which would grant Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, autonomy under the protection of a NATO-led
military force.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Demaci has argued
that the ethnic Albanians who make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's
population should hold out for full independence. He said he would
continue to campaign against the plan, but he is not expected to
rally much support for his position.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian delegation at the talks have already given
the deal conditional approval and is expected to make a formal
decision within a week.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is emerging as the dominant
political force on the ethnic Albanian side, accepts the autonomy
plan, the pressure will be on President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia to accept a NATO-led force in Kosovo to enforce the
peace, or face NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, however, Milosevic reiterated his refusal to accept
any foreign military force in a meeting in Belgrade with Knut
Vollebaek, the chairman-in-office of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. Yugoslav army and Serbian police forces
have meanwhile stepped up military operations, with heavy shelling
reported in the south of Kosovo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction to my proposal for an international force was
very, very negative,'' Vollebaek said on Tuesday of his meeting
with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   From Belgrade, Vollebaek traveled to Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo, to meet with ethnic Albanian leaders on Tuesday.
Afterwards, he expressed his grave concern about the stepped-up
fighting in the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movement of troops is serious and a cause for great
concern,'' Vollebaek said. ``A further escalation of the conflict
could put the whole peace process at great risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces have massed large numbers of tanks and armored
personnel carriers in the south of Kosovo along the Macedonian
border. All Tuesday morning, tanks, ranged on the main road close
to the border, shelled the hillsides where the KLA rebels holds
positions amid mountain villages.
</P>
<P>
   The shelling has caused thousands of people to flee their homes
over the last few days, and some 350 women and children have been
camping out for two nights in forests carpeted with snow.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has largely shown restraint in the face of broad attacks
from Yugoslav army and Serbian police units, according to the
international verifiers monitoring the October cease-fire. There
have been several incidents this week, however, in which Serbian
civilians and police have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt, however, that the major military
initiatives are being taken by Serbian forces, who are thought to
be deployed in Kosovo in greater numbers than ever before.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The KLA is a secretive organization, but its central leaders are
emerging as four commanders in their late 20s, all former student
activists and now possibly the most powerful military figures in
Kosovo. One of them, Hashim Thaci, who led the negotiating team at
last month in Rambouillet, France, is being viewed as a likely
prime minister in a new provisional government in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats had blamed Thaci for throwing away the ethnic
Albanians' best chance when they left the talks last month without
signing the peace plan. The delegates explained that they wanted to
return to Kosovo to consult with their people.
</P>
<P>
   But OSCE cease-fire verifiers, who are in contact with many in
the KLA leadership, say they sense that the majority in the KLA
support the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bear their responsibilities heavily,'' said one Western
verifier who has met several of the key commanders. ``They feel
deeply the loss of those killed. They regret every one and it does
make them look at the loss and at what Rambouillet could resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   William Walker, the American head of the OSCE verification
mission in Kosovo, said he was encouraged by a recent meeting with
a senior member of the KLA's general staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do see the agreement as their best option,'' he said this
week. ``There were difficulties of communication from Rambouillet,
but I think they are pulling together.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hill, the U.S. mediator at the peace talks, told
reporters much the same during a visit to Pristina on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty convinced that this deal is going to stick, that
we'll have Albanian signatures,'' he said. ``And I hope the Serbs
will come to understand that it's in their interest to sign.''

DEAL IS REACHED TO TURN 10,000 ACRES OF ANCIENT REDWOODS INTO A
PUBLIC PRESERVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After years of negotiations that were completed
only two minutes before the deadline of midnight on Monday, federal
and state officials and Pacific Lumber Co. have agreed to a
landmark $480-million deal that will turn the largest privately
owned grove of ancient redwood trees in the world into a public
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   The complex deal, which government officials said was as
significant as turning Yosemite and the Grand Canyon into national
parks, will preserve about 10,000 acres of giant redwoods in
Humboldt County, about 250 miles north of here, including the
majestic Headwaters forest and some smaller groves.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is significant because only 3 percent of the
nation's original redwood trees, some of them 2,000 years old,
remain unlogged, and it marks the biggest government acquisition of
land in California since the creation of Redwood National Park 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., an architect of the agreement,
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, Gov. Gray Davis, and President
Clinton all called the deal ``historic'' on Tuesday. Clinton said:
``I am truly grateful that we are able to bestow this priceless
gift on generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But some environmental groups were unhappy with the deal, saying
that it did not do enough to protect endangered species and
expressing deep skepticism about what the government may have
conceded to the lumber company at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, capping one of the longest-running environmental
stories in recent history, was more than 10 years in the making.
The most contentious part of the plan requires Pacific Lumber, the
largest private logger of old-growth redwoods in the country, to
agree to a 50-year Habitat Conservation Plan governing how it logs
its remaining 211,000 acres of timber.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, the boards of Pacific Lumber, based in
Scotia, on the northern California coast, and its Houston-based
parent company, Maxxam Corp., rejected the proposal, contending
that environmental restrictions added to the deal in recent months
would cripple the company and force hundreds of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Maxxam's stock price tumbled on Monday, in the first trading
after it rejected the deal, but it rose almost 24 percent on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both government and company officials said that the contract,
which was signed two minutes before the federal government's
$250-million offer for its share of the purchase was scheduled to
expire, was essentially unchanged. What differed, they said, were
interpretations of how much Pacific Lumber could harvest under the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The state had projected the company could harvest 136 million to
137 million board feet a year, far below the 210 million board feet
the company said it needed. Federal officials said that the state
figures were wrong and convinced the company that it could project
a harvest of 179 million or more board feet a year, said John
Campbell, president of Pacific Lumber. ``That's a figure that we
can accept,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In what sounded like another change in the deal, Campbell added
that Pacific Lumber would be able to cut trees selectively on about
60,000 acres of unstable ground even before watershed analysis is
done that will determine ``no-cut'' buffer zones around streams
where the endangered coho salmon spawn. ``They have decided it is
appropriate for us to selectively log while we do the watershed
assessment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Ahearn, a spokesman for Babbitt, said no concessions had
been made that would compromise the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Environmental Protection Information Center, a
watchdog that has filed numerous lawsuits against Pacific Lumber,
said that it sounded as though the federal government had given the
company a wink and a nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``You show me how you can come up with 45 million additional
board feet a year without changing a comma, and I'll show you
something fishy going on,'' said Kevin Bundy, a spokesman for the
organization. ``We're going to be looking at this very closely to
see whether the government is willing to sacrifice an endangered
salmon in order to help a company finance its debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber is $865 million in debt. In 1985, Charles
Hurwitz, the president of Maxxam, acquired the then-family-owned
logging company for $900 million in junk bonds in a hostile
takeover assisted by Michael R. Milken, later convicted of massive
securities fraud violations. Shortly after Maxxam acquired Pacific
Lumber, it tripled its logging output to finance its purchase. The
noticeable increase in logging set off continuous environmental
protests _ including the largest forest rally in the country in
1996 _ as well as lawsuits by environmental groups charging the
company with violating the Endangered Species Act and Clean Water
Acts.
</P>
<P>
   Under those acts, Pacific Lumber would not be able to log
Headwaters and other ancient redwood groves because of danger to a
number of threatened and endangered species, including the coho
salmon and the marbled murrelet, a seabird that nests on the tops
of old-growth redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   But Hurwitz sued the federal government, arguing that Pacific
Lumber was entitled to compensation for land that the government
was preventing it from using. The lawsuit, called a ``takings''
lawsuit, was expected to be a long and expensive headache for the
government, which decided to deal with Pacific Lumber rather than
engage in a costly and lengthy court fight.
</P>
<P>
   Congress appropriated $250 million for the Headwaters purchase,
and the state of California is to pay $130 million now and $100
million next year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Sierra Club applauded the deal, but some other environmental
groups said that they remain suspicious about whether the
government will be able to properly monitor whether Pacific Lumber
adheres to the plan. In the last three years, the company has been
cited for 128 violations of state forestry rules.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the California Department of Forestry suspended
Pacific Lumber's license to log, citing continual and egregious
violations. The suspension was cited for 180 layoffs out of a labor
force of 1,600 employees. But it did not affect the company's
ability to log because the suspension did not include logging done
by subcontractors for the company.
</P>
<P>
   In Berkeley, Calif., on Tuesday, members of a number of
environmental groups called a news conference to declare they would
continue protests against Pacific Lumber.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who calls herself Julia Butterfly, who has lived in a
tree for more than a year to protest the company's logging
practices, spoke at the conference by cellular phone from her tree.
``We will not rest, we will not give up, we will not go away until
we see the necessary protections for the forest,'' she said, as a
windstorm blew around her.

REPORT CONDEMNS CROATIA ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ Serbia and the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, are generally considered the pariahs in the Balkans, but
according to an international report, the verdict on Croatia and
its president, Franjo Tudjman, is equally harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no progress in improving respect for human
rights, the rights of minorities and the rule of law'' in Croatia,
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said in the
recent report, which has not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that summary, the report, which is astonishing for its
lack of diplomatic circumlocution, is filled with damning details _
about repression of the media by the Croatian government; about its
lack of cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in
The Hague, Netherlands; and, above all, about the government's
harsh treatment of ethnic Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small percentage of the approximately 300,000 ethnic
Serbs forced to flee their homes here during the war have been
allowed to return. Most fled when the Croatian army carried out its
own ``ethnic cleansing'' during military operations against
Serbian-controlled areas in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is harsh, but it is not an exaggeration,'' Andreas Stadler,
the deputy Austrian ambassador here, said about the report, which
was delivered in late January to the 54 member countries of the
organization. The organization, which includes the United States,
is charged with overseeing the development of democracy in former
communist countries.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman has been elected twice, most recently in 1997, but the
State Department, in a human rights report made public last week,
described Croatia as ``nominally democratic'' but ``in reality
authoritarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stadler and other Western diplomats said, the European
Union and the United States, which is the most powerful outside
influence here, must temper their criticism of Tudjman, in part for
strategic reasons: His cooperation is vital to the NATO-led
peacekeeping operations in neighboring Bosnia. Currently, for
example, Apache helicopters for use in Bosnia are being unloaded
from an American ship and assembled on the Croatian island of Krk.
</P>
<P>
   There are also concerns that criticizing the country too harshly
will give ammunition to the hard-liners in the ruling party, the
Croatian Democratic Union, who are in a fight with moderates over
who will succeed Tudjman, 76, as party leader. He has incurable
stomach cancer, and his condition has worsened in the last two
weeks, diplomats here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The delicate diplomatic quandary was reflected in the visit here
by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright last August. In her
meetings with Tudjman, Albright delivered a tough message about the
need for Croatia to become more democratic, to comply with the
Dayton accords, which ended the fighting in Bosnia, and to allow
for the return of the Serbian refugees _ all matters on which the
Clinton administration and Tudjman have fundamentally different
views.
</P>
<P>
   But after returning to Washington, Albright sent Tudjman a
letter, which so pleased the Croatian leader that it was promptly
leaked. A newspaper in the coastal town of Split described it as
having the ``taste of apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright wrote that while she was aware that her visit had been
difficult, ``I want to see you as a part of Europe where you
belong.'' Becoming part of Europe is a primary goal for Tudjman,
who bristles when his country is referred to as Balkan, but it is a
goal that will not become a reality unless Croatia becomes far more
democratic, European diplomats have told him repeatedly.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report by the European security organization did not address
the economic situation of the country, but that too is, in a word,
miserable. While a few at the top, political allies of Tudjman and
members of the ruling party, have acquired fabulous wealth _ which
they flaunt with flashy cars and expensive clothes _ the middle
class is quickly being squeezed into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   It requires $1,000 a month just to buy the minimum amount of
food for a family of four, said a woman in her mid-30s; but the
average monthly wage is about $400. Milk in neighboring Slovenia,
which, like Croatia, was once part of the former Yugoslavia, costs
the equivalent of about 60 cents a liter, while here it is more
than $2, a Croatian woman said Tuesday on returning from Slovenia.
She also bought cans of dog food there for one-third what they
would cost here, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the country's economic woes is quite simple: bad
government, or as one diplomat put it, ``corruption, nepotism and
mismanagement.''
</P>
<P>
   On the political score, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe says that under pressure from the United
States and the European Union, the Croatian government has made
commitments to freedom of the press. But Croatian Television, the
main source of news for up to 90 percent of Croatians, ``remains
subject to political control by the ruling party,'' the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   Croatian Television programs are marked by ``hate speech,'' the
report says, and news about the political opposition, Bosnia and
the international tribunal is ``misleadingly presented, distorted
by selection and by prejudicial terminology or comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Croatian foreign ministry declined to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   On the international war crimes tribunal, the report says the
Croatian government has embarked on a campaign to ``encourage
distrust and hostility'' toward it among the Croatian populace.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman, who diplomats say is convinced he will be indicted by
the tribunal, has declared that the tribunal has no jurisdiction
over anything that happened during the operations carried out by
the army when it regained control, in 1995, of territories in the
hands of Serbian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   During those operations, Serbian civilians were killed, villages
were burned to the ground and several hundred thousand Serbs were
forced to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The government has given repeated assurances to the United
States and the European Union that the refugees will be allowed to
return. But it is unlikely that they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have resolved the Serbian question,'' Tudjman declared,
referring to the 1995 military actions in a speech to his generals
at the opening of a war college in December. Then he added, ``There
will never be 12 percent of Serbs'' in Croatia, as there was before
the war.

CEPEDA NOMINATED FOR HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ When Orlando Cepeda arrived in Boston in
1973, there were detractors who said the Red Sox had hired a
wounded buffalo rather than the Baby Bull who had dominated the
National League with his big bat. They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As Boston's first designated hitter, Cepeda batted a solid .289
in 142 games with 20 home runs and 86 runs batted in. Anyone still
not convinced of his credentials can head to Cooperstown, N.Y., in
July when Cepeda and six others will be inducted into tbe baseball
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Cepeda was one of four men selected for induction Tuesday by the
Hall's Veterans Committee. A 12-man panel gave the necessary nine
votes (75 percent) to Cepeda, as well as late umpire Nestor Chylak,
who died in 1982; Frank Selee, a turn-of-the-century manager (1890
to 1905) in the NL with Boston and Chicago; and Negro Leagues
pitcher Smokey Joe Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a thrill,'' said Cepeda, who works in community relations
for the San Francisco Giants after playing 17 seasons in San
Francisco, St. Louis, Atlanta, Oakland, Boston, and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with Hall of Famers Juan Marichal, Willie McCovey,
and Willie Mays for many, many years. It's great to join them in
the Hall of Fame. The year with Boston saved my career. I had bad
knees but they still gave me a chance to stay in the game. That was
a wonderful year.''
</P>
<P>
   You had to like Cepeda's chances. He had the backing of
Marichal, a voting member of the committie for the first time, as
well as Ted Williams and Stan Musial. Others under consideration
for induction were Bill Mazeroski, former Sox outfielder Dom
DiMaggio, former Sox manager Dick Williams, and umpire Doug Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rookie on the Veterans Committee,'' said Marichal, ``I'm
glad he got in on my first year. He was the type of player who had
no fear, the type of player you wanted playing behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cepeda, 61, said he spent the morning in Buddhist prayer, hoping
for the best. Bad knees weren't his only problem. After finishing
his career in Kansas City, he was arrested a year later at an
airport for trying to pick up 160 pounds of marijuana. Cepeda was
sentenced to five years in prison but served only 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the moment that pays off for whatever I went through
in life,'' said Cepeda.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Cepeda missed by just seven votes in balloting
by the Baseball Writers Association of America. He was the NL's
Rookie of the Year in 1958 with San Francisco and the league's
first unanimous MVP in 1967 with St. Louis. The first baseman was a
lifetime .297 hitter, with 379 home runs and 1,365 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   It was widely believed that Cepeda's chances of making the Hall
of Fame were crushed by his conviction. But in the last two decades
he has been a model citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning,'' said Cepeda, ``it did work against me.
(The sportswriters) didn't know me. Maybe they heard some things.
Once they got to know me, it was better. I made a mistake. But I'm
only a human being. I've learned from my mistakes big time.''
</P>
<P>
   The veterans panel was down to 12 from its usual 15 because of
the retirement of longtime executive Buzzie Bavasi and the health
of writer Leonard Koppett and Hall of Fame shortstop Pee Wee Reese.
</P>
<P>
   Induction ceremonies will be held July 25 at Cooperstown, when
Nolan Ryan, George Brett, and Robin Yount _ elected by the writers
in January _ also will be enshrined.
</P>
<P>
   Chylak, the eighth umpire elected to the Hall, worked in the
American League from 1954-78 and called five World Series and six
All-Star Games. Williams, who died in 1946, pitched from 1910-32
with several teams, including the Homestead Grays and New York
Lincoln Giants.

BUSH ANNOUNCES FORMATION OF PRESIDENTIAL EXPLORATORY PANEL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush announced the formation of a
presidential exploratory committee Tuesday, saying only a total
flop in his support would keep him from seeking the GOP nomination
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A giant thud. A huge yawn. It turned out it was my mother they
were interested in,'' Bush responded when asked what could keep him
from running.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the eldest son of former President Bush and first lady
Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his exploratory committee's first task will be to
raise money while he tends to the state Legislature, whose session
ends at the end of May. Bush said he and his wife, Laura, will then
travel the country to see if there really is grass-roots support
for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a compelling reason to consider running for
president: I want the 21st century to be prosperous, and I don't
want anybody being left behind,'' Bush said. ``America must be
prosperous so people can realize their entrepreneurial dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 52, the father of twin, 17-year-old daughters, often has
expressed concerns about the impact on his family if he runs for
president. But Tuesday he said he believes that has been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced and Laura is convinced that our love for each
other is strong enough and our family is close enough to take
whatever life brings,'' Bush said. ``I'm committed to making sure I
spend quality time with Laura and the girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush said she also has come to grips with her husband
seeking the office his father won in 1988 and then lost in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was hesitant about is the ugliness that we all see in
political life. I dread criticism of my husband,'' Mrs. Bush said,
but added: ``I love George, and I'm very proud of him. And I know
he'd make a great president.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush wins his party's nomination and then the White House, it
would mark the first time a father and son have held the presidency
since John Adams and John Quincy Adams did more than 170 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his press secretary, Karen Hughes, chose Tuesday to
make the announcement because it was Texas Independence Day, not
because one of his father's former political rivals, conservative
commentator Pat Buchanan, was launching his own presidential
campaign in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan challenged Bush's father in 1992 and exposed the
weakness of the president's re-election bid by winning 40 percent
of the vote in the New Hampshire primary. Buchanan won New
Hampshire in 1996, but lost the GOP presidential nomination to Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Buchanan, other potential Bush opponents next year
include U.S. Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire, former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander, conservative activist Gary Bauer, U.S. Rep.
John Kasich of Ohio, U.S. Sen. John McCain, former Vice President
Dan Quayle, former Cabinet official Elizabeth Hanford Dole,
publisher Steve Forbes and broadcaster Alan Keyes. On the
Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore and former U.S. Sen. Bill
Bradley are running.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is pleased Mrs. Dole is in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is instructive to America that the first viable
female presidential candidate is a Republican,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will have a formal news conference Sunday to
discuss the details of his exploratory committee, which will be
officially filed with the Federal Election Commission on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to set a fund-raising goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have to be enough to make sure we can get out of
Texas, the early states and be able to endure on March the 7th,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten states, including New York, California and Florida _ where
Bush's brother, Jeb, is governor _ are expected to hold primary
elections March 7, 1999, The Texas primary is set for March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Bush friend Don Evans of Midland, Texas, is expected to
be named as campaign finance chairman. San Antonio lobbyist Tom
Loeffler is expected to be named as a finance co-chairman, as is
another longtime Bush friend, Los Angeles investment banker
Bradford Freeman. Loeffler and Evans are University of Texas
regents.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising activities are expected to be coordinated by Jeanne
Johnson of Dallas and Jack Oliver, who raised almost $3 million
last year for Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has until December to decide whether it will
accept federal matching funds for his primary campaign. If he takes
the money, he will be limited to certain spending levels in each
state and a total cap for the nominating process of about $45
million.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Bush can raise more than $45 million
without taking the $13 million to $15 million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a while to crank up our organization.
Unlike state politics, it's $1,000 at a time. That's a lot of
$1,000s to be competitive,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's state political fund has more than 12,000 donors who gave
$1,000 or more to his campaign. If those people donate again, Bush
could count on quickly having a presidential campaign fund of at
least $12 million. Bush's name recognition and popularity
nationwide _ as evidenced by the politicians from numerous states
that have urged him to run _ and a political network left over from
his father's campaigns make it likely Bush can raise significant
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said while the fund-raisers concentrate on raising money
for his campaign, he plans to concentrate on getting his agenda
through the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to finish the legislative session. I've told you all
numerous times that I'm going to stay home in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Democratic Party Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm said
Bush already is neglecting the job he was elected to do last
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he had done what he said he would do and kept his focus
on Texas until after the Legislature was over,'' Malcolm said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won election as governor over incumbent Democrat Ann
Richards in 1994 with 53 percent of the vote. He defeated
Democratic challenger Garry Mauro last year with 69 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush banned national news media from attending Tuesday's news
conference on the gated back lawn of the Governor's Mansion because
he ``wanted the Texas press and therefore my fellow Texans to hear
it from me first.''
</P>
<P>
   Hecklers chanted against Bush outside the walls of the mansion
grounds during the news conference. The protesters were from
American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today, or Adapt, and the
Coalition of Texans with Disabilities. People from both groups,
many in wheelchairs, were arrested at the mansion last month while
protesting housing choices for the disabled.

SUPREME COURT ASKED TO DECIDE WHEN A GIFT BECOMES A BRIBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.) (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Somewhere between bribing a federal official and
bestowing an innocent gift on one lies an illegal gratuity. Federal
law punishes giving a gratuity with two years in prison but, as a
Supreme Court argument on Tuesday demonstrated, it defines the
offense so imprecisely that the search for meaning is almost as
much an exercise in metaphysics as in law.
</P>
<P>
   The case before the court is an outgrowth of an independent
counsel's failed prosecution of Mike Espy, the former secretary of
agriculture who was acquitted three months ago of having accepted
illegal gifts from companies regulated by his department.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the independent counsel, Donald Smaltz, had obtained a
conviction of one of the corporate donors, Sun-Diamond Growers of
California, an agricultural cooperative of raisin and nut producers
whose vice president, Richard Douglas, was Espy's college classmate
and longtime friend. This was the case before the court on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The gratuity statute under which Sun-Diamond was convicted, for
giving Espy $5,900 worth of tennis tickets, luggage and other
gifts, makes it a crime to give ``anything of value'' to a public
official ``because of any official act performed or to be performed
by such public official.'' In accepting the independent counsel's
expansive interpretation of the law, the trial judge instructed the
jury that it could base a conviction on a simple finding that the
gifts were motivated by Espy's position, without respect to
anything the secretary had done or was expected to do.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court here overturned the conviction last
year, ruling that the 1962 law linked the prohibited gifts not only
to an official's status but to his actions, and to the giver's
efforts to influence those actions, albeit not by the outright quid
pro quo of a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing the appeal of that ruling before the justices on
Tuesday, a deputy independent counsel, Robert Ray, met a court that
appeared wary to the point of hostility toward efforts to
criminalize interactions between federal officials and interested
citizens that several justices described as innocent or even
commendable. Ray made little headway with his argument that to be
illegal, a gift need not be linked to any particular action as long
as it reflected the giver's awareness of an official's ``capacity
to act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we have such an extensive reading of a criminal
statute?'' Justice Stephen Breyer asked. The justice said that
ethics regulations could handle problems of questionable gifts, and
were preferable to ``bringing the blunderbuss of federal law into
the prosecutor's arsenal, where they can prosecute trivial
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer was obviously not reassured when Ray, in answer to a
hypothetical question, said a group of farmers might violate the
law if they invited the secretary of agriculture to come talk to
them on matters of farm policy and provided the secretary with an
airline ticket and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``So farmers who invite the secretary of agriculture to speak
are all committing federal crimes?'' Breyer asked. He added: ``I
would have thought it was good for secretaries of agriculture to
explain their policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony Kennedy asked Ray whether he realized that
``there's a huge gap between the general understanding'' of
acceptable official behavior and the independent counsel's
interpretation of the gratuity law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to bar access,'' Ray replied. ``We're talking
about buying access.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun-Diamond's lawyer, Eric Bloom, faced a friendlier audience.
But he also had some trouble defining his terms as he sketched for
the court a ``hierarchy of conduct'' in the area of gifts to
federal officials. Most serious, he said, was bribery, which he
defined as a quid pro quo, a gift ``with strings attached.'' Then
came a gratuity, defined as ``a reward, a tip, a thank you.''
Finally was a gift given solely ``because of an official
position,'' which Bloom said was not a crime but should be
``covered as an ethics matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom said that someone who liked to hobnob with high government
officials because it enhanced his prestige, and bestowed gifts
accordingly, would not be violating the gratuity statute unless a
prosecutor could tie the gift-giving to past acts or hoped-for
future acts by the officials. Gifts while particular regulatory
matters were pending could lead to criminal liability, Bloom said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the statute would not be violated in a situation
depicted by Justice Antonin Scalia, in which a hypothetical
chairman of AT&AMP;T gave ``enormous quantities of money'' to the
chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, without
reference to any particular issue, because ``you have been a friend
to AT&AMP;T over the years.'' Other prohibitions might well apply,
Bloom said, but not the gratuity statute.
</P>
<P>
   One unusual feature of this case, United States vs. Sun-Diamond
Growers, No. 98-131, is that the Justice Department, which would
ordinarily handle such a case, is only a bystander to an
independent counsel's prosecution. Solicitor General Seth Waxman,
in a brief filed as a friend of the court, conspicuously did not
endorse the disputed jury instructions that the independent counsel
was defending and generally offered a more nuanced view of the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although government prosecutors will have to live with whatever
the court decides, for purposes of this case, Smaltz _ seated at a
table in front of the courtroom as his deputy argued _ was the
government. When Bloom, Sun-Diamond's lawyer, referred to the
opposing side as the independent counsel, Chief Justice William
Rehnquist instructed him to say ``the government.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Separately on Tuesday, the court upheld a conviction under a
1994 law making it a federal crime to hijack a car ``with the
intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.'' The question in the
case, Holloway vs. United States, No. 97-7164, was whether the
carjacker actually had to intend to kill or harm the driver, or
whether it was sufficient to prove a ``conditional intent,'' namely
that if the driver failed to hand over the keys, the carjacker was
prepared to be as violent as necessary to get the car.
</P>
<P>
   Conditional intent sufficed, the court said in a 7-to-2 opinion
by Justice John Paul Stevens, who said that this was the ``common
sense reading'' of the law. Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas
dissented in separate opinions. Scalia said it was ``not at all
implausible'' that Congress had meant the law to apply not to
carjacking generally, but only to the ``particularly savage''
version of the offense that befell a personal friend whose father
was murdered after the car was handed over.

SENATE PANEL PREDICTS Y2K CHAOS ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)  (jw)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American industry and the government are generally
winning the race to fix year 2000 computer glitches by year's end,
but the problem is likely to cause widespread civil unrest and
economic disruption abroad, a Senate panel reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With only 304 days to go, most federal agencies, utilities and
large companies are solving the computer flaws that may spew out
faulty data or worse, the panel said. But its 160-page report
warned that the nation's health care industry ``lags
significantly'' in fixing the problem, as do millions of small
businesses and scores of state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   More chilling are the findings from abroad. Global
communications, financial systems, air transportation and oil
supplies could be interrupted for days or weeks, depending on the
country. Important allies like Japan, Mexico and Germany are nine
months to two years behind schedule in preparing for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed briefing at the Capitol, senators were told that
computer failures in Russia could blind early-warning radar systems
and lead to false alarms of nuclear attacks. Soviet-built nuclear
reactors in Russia and Eastern Europe could abruptly and perilously
shut down. And there is a ``low to medium'' probability that
terrorists will try to exploit the resulting chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country we will have a bump in the road but it will
not be crippling,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, who heads the
panel called the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Computer
Problem. He briefed his colleagues on the national security risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internationally, we think the chances of difficulty are much
higher,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, in its quest to resume a regular legislative agenda
after President Clinton's impeachment trial, took the unusual step
of devoting its entire day to aspects of the year 2000 problem.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 99-0 Tuesday morning, to authorize the
government to guarantee loans to small businesses to fix computer
problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, the Senate voted 92-6 to extend the
panel's work through February 2000 and approved its $800,000
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the House and Senate are considering bipartisan bills
that would limit litigation, lawyers' fees and damage awards from
breakdowns related to the problem. Lloyd's of London, the insurance
exchange, has projected that the worldwide legal costs may reach $1
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely coalition of insurers, high-technology companies,
and large and small businesses support the legislation, which is
opposed by consumer groups, trial lawyers and the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders have put the bills on the fast
track, making full consideration by the House and Senate likely in
the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As 2000 approaches, experts around the world are concerned about
computer crashes that might occur if software, written to recognize
the year by the last two digits, mistakes 2000 for 1900.

<P>
   Three decades after American college students defiantly threw
off the vestiges of curfews, dress codes and dormitory house
mothers, a revolution is under way in undergraduate life that may
be quieter but no less significant.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a range of societal changes _ consumerism,
litigiousness, a shift in intergenerational relations, and
increased fears about campus drinking _ colleges are offering and
students are often demanding greater supervision of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   What is evolving is a tamer campus and an updated and subtler
version of ``in loco parentis,'' the concept that educators are
stand-in parents. College administrators are struggling with the
two questions that are emerging as central: Are undergraduates
really adults? And should they be seen as the college's customers
or more as its products?
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently, we had an almost Darwinian experience for
students,'' said David Ward, chancellor of the University of
Wisconsin, referring to a sort of survival of the fittest mentality
at universities, which offered students little help as they tried
to adjust to college life.
</P>
<P>
   Recent changes at Wisconsin include the creation of residence
halls offering more interaction between students and adult staff
members through a host of programs such as theater outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1970s and '80s, we lost our way'' in educating students
outside the classroom, Ward said. ``We were staggered by what
happened in the late 1960s and in a state of sheer exhaustion. The
view then was, if you could go to war, you were an adult. But that
view was wrong. There needs to be an assimilative process in the
crucial years of 18 to 21. Undergraduates are quasi-adults and we
are asking, what kind of parents can we be?''
</P>
<P>
   The changes take many forms. Pennsylvania State University has
opened a renovated, alcohol-free, adult-supervised student center.
The University of Virginia is drafting rules to inform parents of
drinking violations, which would have been unthinkable during the
1970s, when some schools did not even send parents student grades.
Lehigh University has just banned parties on campus without a staff
member or other adult present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's young people are growing up in different
circumstances,'' said Graham B. Spanier, the president of Penn
State and a sociologist. ``We do not want to make them more
childlike. But parents are constantly contacting us asking what is
going on with their kids. They want in loco parentis. Parents say,
`Give them structure.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Parents stay in much closer contact with their college-age
children than did those of a generation ago. This is partly the
result of better access to telephones _ one per room rather than
one at the end of a long dormitory hall _ and the advent of e-mail.
And many parents are former students who worry that their children
will repeat their wild college years and who have much to say about
how college life ought to be led.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, students come from more varied and difficult
backgrounds than in previous decades. Some parents are divorced or
alcoholic or homosexual; some students have eating disorders.
Unlike in the past, they want to talk about it with someone. So
institutions take on a parental-like involvement.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Princeton University ended a 25-year tradition known
as ``Nude Olympics,'' in which sophomores ran naked at midnight
after the first snowfall. Harold T. Shapiro, the president of
Princeton, said that the drinking associated with the event posed
risks ``that we can no longer tolerate.'' Princeton and many other
universities worry about lawsuits that might arise from the abuse
of alcohol by students.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Dartmouth College announced that it was ending
single-sex fraternities, which served as the basis for the 1978
movie ``Animal House.'' Dartmouth is planning to invest tens of
millions of dollars in creating a new form of undergraduate
community life that better reflects the school's diversity and
intellectual mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students don't rebel against adult guidance in the way they
did 30 years ago,'' said James Wright, Dartmouth's president.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Biles, a 21-year-old senior at the University of
Virginia, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You change a lot in college,'' she said. ``When you get here
you are still a high school student.'' But students, she said,
``need a lot of direction at least in the first year and it is
almost comforting when someone steps in.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Virginia has postponed the fraternity rush
process from fall to spring semester of the freshman year to give
students a chance to explore other options for campus life.
</P>
<P>
   Many universities, like Lehigh in Pennsylvania, have extended
what was once a two-day freshman orientation to a full semester of
meeting weekly with a faculty member to discuss everything from
alcohol to a choice of major.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get paid not only to teach but to mentor and we better do
that well,'' said Lehigh's President, Gregory C. Farrington.
``There is a much greater focus on adult supervision today.''
</P>
<P>
   But some students are offended by what they see as a new
paternalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see all this as coming out of baby boomer guilt,'' lamented
David Schleicher, 21, a Dartmouth junior from New York City,
referring to the excesses of the '60s. ``I've had many wonderful
times at college but they have largely been outside of the
college-sponsored group-bonding events which I consider somewhere
between absurd and offensive. It's not so much Big Brother as a
kind of condescending big uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Mayer, 22, a University of Wisconsin senior who is
working on a project to offer alternatives to drinking in college,
disagreed. A history major from Clinton, Iowa, she was intimidated
by professors in her first years and only this year has she
realized that ``they are people, too.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds, ``When I think about the new learning communities vs.
the Animal House era of the 1980s, I feel it is just great. There
is an enormous need for structure and a certain comfort in
returning to the era of `Donna Reed' and `Leave It to Beaver.'''

</P>
<P>
   Even the word ``adult'' is noteworthy. Until the late 1960s,
18-year-olds were often called boys and girls. But, as Janina
Montero, dean of student life at Princeton, notes, feminism and the
Vietnam-era draft changed that. Feminist students were tired of
being called girls, and insisted that the word ``woman'' be
employed.
</P>
<P>
   Passions have cooled to the extent that students who were
drafting a survey on residential houses suggested the question, Is
there any adult in the Harvard community or some other adult with
whom you would feel comfortable sharing a personal problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that `adult' was the wrong word,'' Harry R. Lewis,
dean of Harvard College, recalled. ``It would offend some of their
fellow students.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis also found himself writing a guest column for the Harvard
Crimson this past Valentine's Day, taking exception to the editors'
suggestion that Harvard involve itself more closely in fostering
student interpersonal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I graduated from college in 1968 and the whole point of going
to college then was to get institutions and parents out of my
life,'' Lewis said. ``That is clearly no longer the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard already plays a much greater role in students' lives
than most. It has long run a system in which virtually the entire
student body lives in houses supervised by faculty members, staff
and resident tutors. Harvard's system is being studied by many
other universities seeking to emulate it in creating what are
called ``learning communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring of undergraduate life is partly a response to
the consumer values of recent decades. Students and their parents
are demanding better living quarters, better food, better safety
and better service for their tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the rise of interactive computer technology in the
past five years has raised the genuine possibility of obtaining a
college degree without ever setting foot on a campus. The result is
that colleges are looking for ways to increase the appeal of their
residential experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning has to go beyond downloading,'' Farrington of Lehigh
said. ``Undergraduate education can't be something we do on the
side to support our habit of research.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew S. Santirocco, dean of arts and sciences at New York
University, added, ``Distance learning and for-profit universities
are delivering one product. Our kind of university is delivering
something different, in loco parentis, a model of community with
mentoring and classroom interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Geshekter, a history professor at California State
University at Chico, points to the growth of offices of student
affairs, combined with parental neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the parents whose kids go to college have abdicated
their responsibility, so when the university takes it upon itself
to be the arbiter and source of this moral development, parents
agree,'' he said. ``The administration likes it because it can
proliferate itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger W. Howard, longstanding associate dean of students at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison, notes the huge growth in the
student body and in the research budget of the university in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faculty became entrepreneurs just at the time when student
culture became self-defined,'' Howard said. ``By the end of the
60s, there was no longer faculty oversight over student
organizations and discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard added that until about 1970, all undergraduates under age
21 were required to live in university housing that included
inspectors and house mothers. But after the National Guard was
dispatched to campus three times to quell student protests, things
changed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common life of the institution was dramatically eroded,''
he said. ``By the mid-1970s, there was no staff link to student
groups, no staff link to off-campus housing and there were no
faculty advisors for non-declared majors.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Wisconsin now places great emphasis on
freshman orientation, involving the parents in a separate program.
It also has two new ``learning communities'' based partly on the
Harvard house model and the similar Yale college model.
</P>
<P>
   In what used to be a dormitory, Chadbourne Residential College
has 400 undergraduates 25 faculty fellows and a total involvement
of 150 adults. There are bicycle trips, pumpkin carvings, dinners,
current events evenings all in an effort to integrate daily life
and intellectual pursuit. In its first year of operation, the
college turned away as many applicants as it accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts see the new structured environments as a
continuation of the day care centers, soccer leagues and summer
camps in which the current generation has been brought up. Those
institutions became far more prevalent after women began entering
the work force in large numbers in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Many say something else is behind the effort: the perceived need
to make their campuses more welcoming to those who had not been
part of them before the 1960s in large numbers _ minority groups
and women.
</P>
<P>
   By breaking down the old order _ fraternities, in particular,
but also a fend-for-yourself social scene _ colleges hope to build
a new model for American society.
</P>
<P>
   As Wright of Dartmouth put it, ``Campuses have become far more
diverse than 30 years ago and we haven't made them as fully
inclusive as they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics see the sensitivity training and community building as
the imposition of a liberal orthodoxy. Alan Charles Kors, a history
professor at the University of Pennsylvania, considers the changes
to be a kind of infantilization of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   Most administrators, however, see the shifts as healthy. Lewis
of Harvard is among those who generally applaud the narrowed
generation gap. But he has his concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about the narrowing impact that such a well-supervised
college experience might offer,'' he said. ``There is something
troubling about students working so hard to fulfill the dreams of
others. It makes it harder for them to discover something on their
own, get excited and pursue it.''

NEW FLARE-UP IN U.S.-EUROPEAN BANANA FIGHT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A protracted dispute over banana imports that has
pitted the United States against the European Union became more
contentious on Tuesday when the World Trade Organization failed to
come up with a figure for damages suffered by American companies
and started an inquiry into a U.S. law on trade retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to act angered the Americans. But it was unclear
whether the United States would proceed with a threat to impose 100
percent tariffs on $520 million in European goods.
</P>
<P>
   American officials announced weeks ago that they would penalize
a range of European imports for what they called the failure of the
the 15-member trading bloc to revamp its banana policy, which
favors former European colonies in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is not a banana exporter. But it has
complained because American fruit growers with operations in Latin
America have lost millions in sales to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The trade agency has previously ruled against the European Union
policy. Although the organization has not determined the
acceptability of recent adjustments, an arbitration panel had been
expected to quantify the damage to the Americans on Tuesday in a
widely awaited decision. But after repeated delays, the panel
chairman, Stuart Harbinson of Hong Kong, issued a brief statement
on Tuesday night, delaying its ruling on the ground that it needed
more data.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing tensions, the organization granted a European Union
request to investigate the legality of the American threat.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. representative, Rita Hayes, accused the European Union
of seeking a diversion from ``failure to implement rulings in the
bananas dispute,'' and ``retribution against the United States for
its attempt to exercise its rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief European Union delegate, Roderick Abbott, said the
dispute provoked the challenge to the trade law.

<P>
   After suffering a TKO in the Senate impeachment hearings,
Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  &UR; Henry Hyde &LR; , R-Ill.,
takes off the gloves in an interview in the National Review.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on an emotional speech by former Arkansas Senator
 &UR; Dale Bumpers &LR; , who described waiting with his father when he signed
up with the Marines, Hyde writes, ``The guy never heard a shot
fired in anger. He didn't go overseas or anything. To get a catch
in your voice over that is  &UR; Laurence Olivier &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Of Senator  &UR; Tom Harkin &LR; , D-Iowa: ``He takes an oath to do
impartial justice, and within minutes he's on television saying
that our program is a `pile of dung.' And of course, he hadn't
heard a damn word of it. But that's typical Harkinism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde says White House deputy counsel  &UR; Cheryl Mills &LR;  had ``played
the race card beautifully.'' He played the race card himself, noted
Roll Call, by not calling  &UR; Betty Currie &LR;  as a witness. ``And then
you get into the race issue,'' Hyde writes of that decision.

   An angry group of Indian and Hindu organizations has complained
to the producers of ``Xena: Warrior Princess,'' about an episode
broadcast Friday, in which Xena asks Lord Krishna to save her
lover, a woman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Smarandam Das &LR; , director of the Meditation Center in San
Francisco, says the episode undermines ``Vedic religion by treating
it as fiction.'' Furthermore, ``While `Xena' is financially
capitalizing on people's interest in Vedic spirituality, yoga and
Hinduism, it portrays a lesbian relationship between the lead
characters. The Vedic scriptures reject homosexuality as a
perversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Smarandam Das told Personals yesterday that members of the World
Vaishnava Association, American Hindus Against Defamation and other
groups had been in touch with the producers of the program for a
year and a half, hoping to stop the episode from being made, then
broadcast. After months of being treated ``flippantly,'' he said,
he received a phone call from the producers three days after the
broadcast, asking him to fax his complaints.

RADICALS KILLED TEXAS OIL EXECUTIVES TO DESTABILIZE PAKISTANI
ECONOMY, POLICE SAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trims) 
 
By MARION LLOYD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The 1997 slaying of four Texas oil executives
in Pakistan was a ploy by a radical anti-government group to
destabilize the country's economy, a top police official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police announced earlier this week that they have arrested two
members of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, a Karachi-based political
party with terrorist elements, in connection with the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The four Union Texas Petroleum auditors from Houston and their
Pakistani driver were shot and killed in November 1997 while
driving to the company's office in the Pakistani port city of
Karachi. The Houston-based Union Texas, which has since been
purchased by the Atlantic Richfield Co., is the largest foreign oil
company operating in Pakistan and accounts for about half the
country's oil production.
</P>
<P>
   The killings shook of the confidence of foreign investors at a
time when Pakistan was desperately in need of investment to prop up
its shaky economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (suspects) clear motive ... was that no foreigners should
come to Pakistan, there should be chaos in the economy, no
investment and Americans should vacate this place,'' Karachi Police
Chief Farooq Amin said in a telephone interview from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, Mohammed Saeed Eharim and Mohammed Salim,
confessed publicly to the killings Sunday during a press conference
in Karachi. However, officials from their party, known by its
initials as the MQM, say the confessions were extracted under
torture.

   Police Chief Amin denied the charge. He said the suspects were
``hardened killers,'' and were wanted in connection with at least
10 other murders in Karachi.

   He said the police were still looking for two other suspects,
also militants of the MQM. The group, a former ally of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif's Muslim League party, is fighting for
control of Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and its commercial
capital.

   The organization draws support from millions of Urdu-speaking
migrants, called Mohajirs, who came to Pakistan from India when the
subcontinent was partitioned in 1947. The Mohajirs claim they have

central government, which is dominated by residents of northern
Punjab province.

   Thousands of people have been killed in Karachi since the MQM
emerged on the political scene in the mid-1980s and launched a

police have accused the MQM of targeting foreigners.

   Party officials denied any involvement in the killings of the

with their families in the Houston area.

   A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan declined to
speculate on whether police had arrested the right suspects. ``It's
too early to say that these are indeed the culprits,'' Lee James
Irwin said from Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. ``There still has
to be a lot of investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Pakistani police were working in close collaboration
with the FBI, which has an agent permanently stationed in
Islamabad. U.S.-based FBI agents have also made several trips to
Karachi over the past 1 1/2 years to join in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin said he was not surprised that police had singled out the
MQM, though the group, the third-largest political party in
Pakistan, is not known to have anti-American sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   Police chief Amin said officers learned of the alleged MQM plot
to scare off foreign investment from another MQM member, Solat

South Africa. Mirza is charged with several high-profile killings.

   Amin said Mirza had told him the killings were part of a larger
MQM plot to scare off outside investment. The police chief
speculated that the order to kill the Americans must have come
directly from Altaf Hussain, who is living in self-imposed exile in
London.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Houston Chronicle last year, Hussain
denied any involvement in the slayings. He accused ``agencies'' of
Pakistan's government of orchestrating the killings in an attempt
to bring disrepute and financial insecurity to the MQM stronghold
of Karachi.

   After suffering a TKO in the Senate impeachment hearings,
Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  &UR; Henry Hyde &LR; , R-Ill.,
takes off the gloves in an interview in the National Review.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on an emotional speech by former Arkansas Senator
 &UR; Dale Bumpers &LR; , who described waiting with his father when he signed
up with the Marines, Hyde writes, ``The guy never heard a shot
fired in anger. He didn't go overseas or anything. To get a catch
in your voice over that is  &UR; Laurence Olivier &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Of Senator  &UR; Tom Harkin &LR; , D-Iowa: ``He takes an oath to do
impartial justice, and within minutes he's on television saying
that our program is a `pile of dung.' And of course, he hadn't
heard a damn word of it. But that's typical Harkinism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde says White House deputy counsel  &UR; Cheryl Mills &LR;  had ``played
the race card beautifully.'' He played the race card himself, noted
Roll Call, by not calling  &UR; Betty Currie &LR;  as a witness. ``And then
you get into the race issue,'' Hyde writes of that decision.

   An angry group of Indian and Hindu organizations has complained
to the producers of ``Xena: Warrior Princess,'' about an episode
broadcast Friday, in which Xena asks Lord Krishna to save her
lover, a woman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Smarandam Das &LR; , director of the Meditation Center in San
Francisco, says the episode undermines ``Vedic religion by treating
it as fiction.'' Furthermore, ``While `Xena' is financially
capitalizing on people's interest in Vedic spirituality, yoga and
Hinduism, it portrays a lesbian relationship between the lead
characters. The Vedic scriptures reject homosexuality as a
perversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Smarandam Das told Personals yesterday that members of the World
Vaishnava Association, American Hindus Against Defamation and other
groups had been in touch with the producers of the program for a
year and a half, hoping to stop the episode from being made, then
broadcast. After months of being treated ``flippantly,'' he said,
he received a phone call from the producers three days after the

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: IN A GLOVE COMPARTMENT, NEW CLUES TO `LEAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Put off by the prospect of any more radio blather
about Monica Lewinsky or Latrell Sprewell, I decided before setting
out on a recent drive to rummage through the glove compartment for
any books on tape I might have stored for future listening.
</P>
<P>
   There I found a recording of a BBC radio production of ``King
Lear'' with Alec Guinness as Lear that had arrived with a Modern
Library edition of Shakespeare's tragedies. Having always been
intrigued by ``Lear'' as supposedly Shakespeare's most difficult
play to stage and having once promised myself to understand its
text completely, I stuck the first of its two cassettes into the
tape deck and started off on my trip.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows the basic story of how Lear decides to divide up
his kingdom among his three daughters so that he can ``shake all
cares and business from our age ... while we unburthen'd crawl
toward death.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cordelia, his youngest, refuses to compete with her sisters
in declaring her love for her father, he disinherits her and gives
everything to Goneril and Regan, only to have them turn against him
and thereby drive him mad. I had read the play in school at least
twice and seen it in production several times, albeit several
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on listening to the tape I was immediately struck by how
nearly incomprehensible some of the language is. As always in
Shakespeare, the idioms are so dated as to seem a foreign language.
How is one to know just from listening that when Goneril's husband,
Albany, questioning her mistreatment of her father, concludes,
``Well, well, th' event,'' he means something like, We'll see what
happens when the time comes?
</P>
<P>
   Or that when Kent, disguised as Lear's messenger, gets into a
dispute with Oswald, Goneril's steward, and says, ``If I had thee
in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee care for me,'' he means,
``If I had you between my teeth ...,'' Lipsbury being a slang
place-name, like Lipsville, for mouth, and a pinfold being an
animal pound?
</P>
<P>
   Even when no idioms were involved, I sometimes foundered. A
simple example: What first-time spectator, even an Elizabethan with
an ear attuned to Shakespeare's language, could immediately catch
the meaning of the King of France when he chides the duke of
Burgundy for his devaluation of Cordelia:
</P>
<P>
   Love's not love
</P>
<P>
   When it is mingled with regards that stands
</P>
<P>
   Aloof from th' entire point.
</P>
<P>
   A little reflection is required to realize that the ``s'' at the
end of ``stands'' is probably extraneous, and that the statement
simply means that love isn't real when it gets mixed up with
irrelevancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lear'' seemed filled with such confounding passages. So when I
got home, I went straight to a text with annotations (``The
Riverside Shakespeare,'' edited by G. Blakemore Evans, Houghton
Mifflin, 1974) and read as much of the play as I had just listened
to.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I came to a difficult passage, I would study the notes
and keep rereading it until it more or less made sense. Then, when
I happened to be in the car once more, I would listen to the same
parts over again. Frequently I had to go back and forth between the
text and the tape several times before certain lines unveiled
themselves. In this obsessive manner, I worked my way through the
entire play.
</P>
<P>
   The experience was astonishing, far more gratifying than any
previous encounter I had ever had with Shakespeare, whether on the
stage or through reading. My gratification was largely irrelevant
to the quality of the particular production I was hearing or to the
Guinness performance, which seemed to me of high quality although
I'm not in a position to compare it with other noteworthy Lears.
(I'm certain that any of the other recordings of Lear available
would offer equal rewards.)
</P>
<P>
   What I found was that with each successive playing of the tape,
the play's meaning began to reveal itself like one of those
pictures that at first ap pears two-dimensional and then by a trick
of the eye suddenly opens up into three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lear'' seems at first to be a simple cautionary tale about
learning not to judge people too quickly from their words and
appearances. One might even complain that Lear's temper tantrums
are so sudden and unreasonable that the play is hard to take
seriously as deep tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But as your understanding of the language grows, you see that
Lear's blind impetuousness is a symbolic vehicle permitting
Shakespeare to explore the loss of power in old age, the
inevitability of generational conflict, the thinness of
civilization's veneer, the fragility of authority, the ambiguity of
sexual feeling, among a dozen other timeless and universal themes.
Most revealing are the exchanges between Lear and his Fool, which
often strike one as cryptic _
</P>
<P>
   FOOL. Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter
fool and a sweet one?
</P>
<P>
   LEAR. No, lad, teach me.
</P>
<P>
   FOOL. That lord that counsell'd thee
</P>
<P>
   To give away thy land,
</P>
<P>
   Come place him here by me,
</P>
<P>
   Do thou for him stand.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet and bitter fool
</P>
<P>
   Will presently appear:
</P>
<P>
   The one in motley here,
</P>
<P>
   The other found out there.
</P>
<P>
   LEAR. Dost thou call me fool, boy?
</P>
<P>
   _ but after repeated readings begin to resemble Beckett-like
exchanges between Lear and his alter ego, implying that he is
simultaneously going mad and becoming sane, which of course is more
or less what happens.
</P>
<P>
   But the point here is not to add to the mountains of verbiage
already written about the meaning of ``Lear.''
</P>
<P>
   I want simply to celebrate a form of reading unique to the
electronic age, when anyone with a tape recorder and a book can
both control the sound of the text and see it on the page.
</P>
<P>
   An even purer version of this experience would be to listen to
Homer, originally meant for only the ear. But you would have to
understand Greek. In English, the translator has already done the
knotty work of interpretation. Shakespeare offers you rich raw
material.
</P>
<P>
   Encountering ``King Lear'' in this way, you go by gradual
degrees from puzzlement to reflection to comprehension to a rush of
feeling to a tragic sense of pity and fear leading on to catharsis.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Stuck in a Manhattan traffic jam, feeling a kind of exhilarated
sadness after listening yet again to Sir Alec delivering Lear's Act
V speech to Cordelia about going off to prison together _
</P>
<P>
   So we'll live,
</P>
<P>
   and pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
</P>
<P>
   At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
</P>
<P>
   Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too _
</P>
<P>
   Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out _
</P>
<P>
   And take upon 's the mystery of things
</P>
<P>
   As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out,
</P>
<P>
   In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones
</P>
<P>
   That ebb and flow by th' moon.
</P>
<P>
   _ I felt I understood afresh what Aristotle meant by catharsis,
the purging of guilt feelings attached to one's identity with the
sufferer and exultance over escaping his punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Can there be a more satisfying way to experience a work of
literature?

NATO SAID TO RULE OUT KOSOVO REACTION

   (With KOSOVO)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although NATO remains poised to act, the United
States and its NATO allies have no intention of launching punitive
strikes against Yugoslav military targets at this point despite an
army buildup and renewed fighting in Kosovo, administration
officials and NATO diplomats said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's deployment of heavy weapons and increase in the
number of special police officers, as well as renewed attacks,
clearly violate the cease-fire agreement brokered last fall between
the Yugoslav government and ethnic Albanian insurgents fighting for
Kosovo's independence, the officials said. NATO said at the time
that it would enforce the cease-fire with military force, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
that a strike against Yugoslav forces now would scuttle efforts to
reach an accord between the two sides once peace talks resume near
Paris on March 15.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said it was hard for the NATO allies to
contemplate striking Yugoslav military targets when the rebel
factions have also violated conditions of the agreement with
ambushes and kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   With the rebels seemingly as reluctant as the Yugoslav
government to move toward a peace agreement at the last round of
talks last week in France, the case for NATO air strikes also was
weakened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back to square one again,'' a Pentagon official said on
Tuesday. ``NATO has pulled out the `we're ready to act' card way
too many times.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials said NATO could still resort to force, but only if
the Yugoslav violations of the cease-fire become much more grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't have at this point is a pre-agreed level of
violence at which NATO will respond,'' a NATO diplomat in
Washington said. ``It will be judged when it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and NATO have 430 planes ready to act if a
decision is made to go ahead, including 50 sent last month by
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's defense minister, George Robertson, acknowledged on
Tuesday that the October cease-fire agreement was ``creaking at the
edges'' but said it had not yet collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, visiting Macedonia, warned the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, that if forces now amassed on the border push
into Kosovo ``then action will be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting flared again on Tuesday in villages around Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, which is one of two republics in Yugoslavia. In
the heaviest fighting, Yugoslav forces used anti-aircraft
artillery, American intelligence reports said, which is explicitly
prohibited under the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting sent hundreds of refugees fleeing, an ominous echo
of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians who fled last
year's fighting in Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There have been repeated violations of the cease-fire agreement
almost from the moment it was brokered in October by Richard
Holbrooke, an American envoy to the region, and NATO's supreme
commander, Gen. Wesley Clarke. But in the week since the first
round of peace talks in France ended with only a partial agreement,
they have intensified, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Pentagon reported that 4,500 heavily armored
Yugoslav troops had massed on the Kosovo border, apparently in
preparation to attack. The Pentagon also reported that Serbian
commanders had moved into position tanks, armored personnel
carriers and artillery pieces that were supposed to remain in
garrison.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Clinton administration has focused its efforts on
persuading the two sides to agree to a settlement that would disarm
both sides and provide greater autonomy for Kosovo, where 90
percent of the population is ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   The administration plans to send Holbrooke to Belgrade, the
Yugoslav capital, next week to put new pressure on Milosevic to
accept a settlement. Holbrooke, the nominee to be the United
States' chief representative to the United Nations, has had
extensive dealings with Milosevic, going back to the negotiations
in Dayton, Ohio, that ended the civil war in Bosnia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The administration announced on Monday that it had enlisted Bob
Dole, the former Republican presidential candidate, to meet with
the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration's efforts faced bipartisan criticism on
Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., used an
appearance by Cohen before the Appropriations Committee to
criticize the administration for making demands and setting
deadlines it did not then enforce.
</P>
<P>
   He singled out Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
shepherded the inconclusive end to the first round of talks between
the two sides in France last week after warning several times that
NATO would act if Milosevic did not accept a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had us at war last week,'' Hollings told Cohen. ``You talk
to her some time and tell her to cool it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollings and Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., also expressed
opposition to the proposed deployment of 4,000 Americans as part of
a 28,000-member force that NATO plans to send into Kosovo if a
settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Milosevic is a problem, but I don't see a militarily
achievable goal,'' Nickles said. ``I see us being stuck.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican leadership debated a plan on Tuesday
that would force Congress to end the longstanding practice of using
Social Security money for other purposes _ but not necessarily
right away.
</P>
<P>
   Needing money to pay for tax cuts and additional spending, House
and Senate leaders discussed allowing Congress to dip into Social
Security funds for the next several years but then walling the
retirement system's money off from the rest of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of weaning the Congress from reliance on Social
Security's money has more support among House leaders than among
their counterparts in the Senate, many of whom favor putting the
retirement system's funds off-limits immediately, Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   Removing Social Security from the budget equation entirely,
though, has repeatedly proved politically impossible. Backers of
the gradual approach say theirs is the only realistic way of
imposing a new fiscal discipline on Congress and the White House,
while still giving Republicans the wiggle room they need to propose
the tax cuts and spending increases that they hope will be the
centerpiece of their electoral strategy in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposal's prospects remain unclear, Republican
leaders said they would have to make a decision soon since the
question of using Social Security will go a long way toward shaping
their tax and spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Armey, R-Texas, the House majority leader, said the
plan, while gradual, would be ``a remarkable accomplishment,
certainly far superior to any effort that has ever been made in the
past'' to keep Congress from mingling Social Security's money with
general revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But because it would leave their party exposed to attacks by
Democrats of endangering Social Security, Republicans said they
wanted to see how much bipartisan support the gradual approach
might attract before making a decision on how to proceed. Democrats
have rallied around President Clinton's proposal to address the
same problem by reserving 62 percent of total budget surpluses over
the next 15 years for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The debate illustrates the difficulties Republicans are having
in reconciling their desire for tax cuts and new spending with
their attempts to shore up Social Security and retain their claim
to fiscal responsibility. And it brought to life the complex
politics of the post-deficit world in Washington, where Democrats
and Republicans each vow to be more austere than the other side
even as they confront the likelihood of huge and growing surpluses
in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plan won support from a handful of moderate to
conservative House Democrats, it drew criticism from other
Democrats, including the House minority leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the general theory of taking Social Security monies out
of circulation is a worthy goal, to the extent we understand their
bill it's not an approach we would support,'' said Laura Nichols, a
spokeswoman for Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last 30 years, the federal government has run
deficits even after spending the revenue generated by Social
Security along with general revenues. Under the accounting used by
the government, the federal budget moved from deficit to surplus
last year and is projected to remain in surplus for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But last year's surplus of $70 billion was the result of a $99
billion surplus in Social Security more than offsetting a $29
billion deficit in the government's operating budget. Current
projections suggest that the government will run an operating
deficit this year and next year and then run operating surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposed budget for next year leaves the entire
surplus untouched but only by proposing tax increases and using
budget maneuvers that Republicans have already rejected.
</P>
<P>
   If adopted, the gradual approach to taking Social Security out
of the budget could make it easier in the short run for both
parties to pay for new spending they have proposed for the military
and education, among other programs, and could provide Republicans
with additional flexibility in financing the big tax cut that they
envision as the centerpiece of their legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the idea would be to make the money generated
by Social Security sacrosanct, thereby making it easier for the
government to pay all promised benefits in the coming decades as
the population ages. But by allowing some of the money to be spent
for the next few years, the gradual approach would put Congress in
the position of explicitly endorsing its longstanding practice of
papering over the country's remaining fiscal problems.

   The more austere proposal favored by many Senate Republicans _
to wall off Social Security immediately and completely _ would by
contrast insulate the party from Democratic attacks over spending
Social Security's money but would make the task of drafting a
budget that contains spending increases and tax cuts much more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who is chairman of the Budget
Committee, is leading the effort to require that Social Security be
left untouched when it comes to tax cuts and spending. But Armey
said after the leadership meeting on Tuesday that the differences
were narrowing and that he expected a compromise soon.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said even a phased-in approach to removing Social Security
from the budget would preserve more of the retirement system's
money than Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Walling off Social Security from the rest of the budget would
essentially mean using the money to reduce the national debt, a
step that most economists say would make it easier for the
government eventually to pay the baby boomers their retirement
benefits. But the two parties agree that reducing the debt alone
does not fully address Social Security's problems.
</P>
<P>
   The House plan for gradually taking Social Security out of the
budget was detailed on Tuesday in legislation introduced by Reps.
Wally Herger, R-Calif., and David Minge, D-Minn., who is among his
party's most fiscally conservative members.
</P>
<P>
   It would separate out from the federal budget the money
earmarked for Social Security, but do it over three years in a way
that would leave $89 billion in play for tax cuts or spending over
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   For the coming fiscal year, the plan would wall off all of the
$80 billion in excess payroll tax revenues that will be collected
on Social Security's behalf, but leave on the table $51 billion in
interest payments generated by Social Security's reserves. For the
following fiscal year, the plan would wall off all the excess
payroll taxes and half the interest payments, leaving a projected
$38 billion for Congress to play with.
</P>
<P>
   In the third year, all money derived from Social Security, both
payroll taxes and interest, would be taken off the government's
books for purposes of spending and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill, Herger and Minge
said they did not intend their bill to provide cover for ``a final
raid on the Social Security Trust Fund'' for either tax cuts or
spending increases.
</P>
<P>
   But the practical effect of their plan would be to allow the
money left on the table to be used for tax cuts or spending
increases. Rep. John R. Kasich, R-Ohio, who is chairman of the
House Budget Committee, has generally supported the approach as he
seeks to put together a tax and spending blueprint for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Herger and Minge said their bill would reserve $1.69 trillion
for Social Security over the next decade, while the president's
plan would reserve $1.59 trillion.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ The remains of the infant twin brother and sister
of Wilbur and Orville Wright might be reunited with other dead
members of the Wright family at Woodland Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson Wright, spokesman for the Wright family, said Tuesday
he would approve of such a move after it was proposed to him by
Woodland horticulturist Jim Sandegren.
</P>
<P>
   The Wright babies, Otis and Ida, were born to Susan and Milton
Wright on Feb. 25, 1870, and lived just a few days. They were
buried at Greencastle Cemetery, an old graveyard in southwest
Dayton. The almost forgotten site abruptly came into focus this
week when Thomas Bradley of Farmersville announced in a story in
Monday's Dayton Daily News that he had taken the twins' tombstone
to have it repaired or replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in complete satisfaction the twins will be taken back to
their mother and father,'' Bradley said Tuesday. He said the
original stone also would be moved to Woodland, at his expense if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Sandegren said the Wrights ``have a pretty good-sized lot up in
Section 101. It just strikes me as a matter of closure to have them
included in the family plot with the others. Why it was not done
sooner, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Greencastle's records were destroyed by the Great Flood
of 1913, historians believe the location of the Wright babies'
grave can be pinpointed. Whether anything remains in it is the next
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess they just had wooden coffins, and these were
tiny babies,'' Wilkinson Wright said. ``There can't be much there.
It is more of a token gesture.'' ``It would be pretty close to just
plain earth,'' Sandegren agreed. ``There could be bone fragments,
but it's not likely. But there would be a discoloration that would
differentiate it from the surrounding earth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1800s, the funeral business did not have today's
1,000-pound, precast concrete vaults. People who could afford it
had their graves lined with brick walls on a slate floor, the
coffin covered with slate before the dirt was put back, Sandegren
said.
</P>
<P>
   Greencastle trustee Jim Kitchen said he cannot prevent
disinterment of the babies if that is the family's wish, but he is
worried about possible damage to adjoining burials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to turn into a mess, a circus,'' Kitchen
predicted. ``They're going to tear up and disturb a lot of graves
if they go in there with a backhoe, just to get to these two little
babies. We don't know if they are side by side, end to end or
what.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandegren said the reburial would not be done until spring. He
referred the Wright family to an attorney who does work for
Woodland and said the family might have to obtain Probate Court
approval to open the twins' grave.

CENSUS FIGURES COST TEXAS $1 BILLION IN LOST FEDERAL FUNDING, GAO
REPORT INDICATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By JENNIFER DAY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas has been short-changed about $1 billion in
federal funding during the past decade because the Census Bureau
undercounted the state's population by almost a half-million people
in 1990, according to a U.S. General Accounting Office report.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report will be released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Medicaid fund was shorted nearly $85 million
annually, while programs ranging from adoption to the treatment and
prevention of substance abuse could have received as much as $9
million more per year if the national headcount had been more
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was entitled to $7.9 million more in federal funds
annually because the bureau overlooked about 67,000 people, said
Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're saving any money,'' Green said. ``Texas is
losing it, and somebody else is getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three states, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest
received more federal funding than they would have had the census
count been more accurate, according to the GAO report. Ranking
first in excess funding was Pennsylvania, which received $110
million annually that should have gone elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   California, which may have been entitled to about $2.2 billion
in federal funding over the decade, was the biggest loser of the 27
states that were shorted funds.
</P>
<P>
   Although the numbers over a 10-year period sound dramatic, the
overall effects are not that severe, said Chip Walker,
communications director for the House subcommittee on the Census.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO analyzed 15 federal programs that rely on population
counts to apportion funds to states. Of the $147 billion spent each
year on these programs, $449 million annually would have been
allocated differently had the census data been more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, for example, would have received a 1 percent increase, or
$93 million per year, over federal funding levels throughout the
1990s, the GAO report stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers to be redistributed have been greatly
exaggerated,'' Walker said. ``You have to recognize that half the
states are losers. This notion that everyone wins under sampling is
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court in January struck down a plan to use
statistical sampling rather than traditional enumeration to compile
the census, which is conducted nationwide every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping allocate federal funds to states, the
census is used to determine how many seats each state will receive
in the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, the Census Bureau announced a plan to
conduct two counts, one using enumeration for apportionment of
House seats and one using sampling that could be used to redraw
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have argued the Supreme Court's ruling permits
sampling to determine not only congressional redistricting but also
distribution of funds for federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Census, Rep. Dan
Miller, R-Fla., on Tuesday said having two sets of data will only
confuse people and inspire lawsuits. He also introduced a 10-point
plan to help make the 2000 census more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt said three of the
representative's initiatives would require contracts to be
renegotiated and may delay Census Day, which is April 1, 2000. Such
a delay could lead to even more inaccuracies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This depends on how long it takes Congress to make up its
mind,'' Prewitt said. ``We are at the point in the census, where if
we don't get about it, we don't get it done.''

REPUBLICANS CHALLENGE RENO AIDE ON VALUE OF COUNSEL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., S.C., Ark.)  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several House Republicans challenged an assertion
by the Clinton administration Tuesday that the independent counsel
law should be permitted to fade into extinction, using a hearing on
the law's future to pose pointed questions about what other
safeguards exist against unlawful conduct by high-ranking federal
officials.
</P>
<P>
   After Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. told a House panel
Tuesday afternoon that the administration considered the law so
irredeemably flawed that it should be scrapped upon its expiration
at the end of June, Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., wondered aloud just
what kind of shape that would leave the country in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried sick about the prospect of it dying without a
developed mechanism in place,'' Gekas, chairman of the House
subcommittee on commercial and administrative law, said during the
hearing. Gekas further demanded that the administration present a
proposal explaining precisely how allegations of official
wrongdoing would be credibly handled in the absence of an
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., joined Gekas in that call, telling
Holder, ``I think you owe that to the country. I think you owe that
to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder responded that while he thought he had been clear in his
testimony before the House subcommittee that the Justice Department
itself had powers and avenues of investigation that rendered the
independent counsel statute moot, he would be willing to spell out
the procedures for handling allegations of official wrongdoing in a
more detailed document.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll come up with something that's responsive,'' Holder said
as the hearing concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Holder's remarks reflected a remarkable turnaround by Attorney
General Janet Reno, who in the early days of the Clinton
administration was one of the independent counsel law's strongest
defenders and who, in fact, recommended the appointments of five
independent counsels to investigate President Clinton and various
members of his Cabinet. But she was heavily criticized for not
naming a counsel to investigate questionable fund raising by
Democrats in Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's hearing took place in the same room where the House
Judiciary Committee, in a vote that split along party lines, passed
articles of impeachment against Clinton last year, and it involved
some of the same players, themes and tensions that informed that
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Gekas and Graham had served on the team of House members who
prosecuted Clinton during his Senate trial, and their questions
Tuesday revealed suspicions about the administration's impartiality
in calling for an end to the statute that gave Kenneth Starr the
authority to investigate Clinton on a variety of fronts and
allegations, none definitively proven.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Democrats on the subcommittee railed about what
they portrayed as the excesses and abuses of Starr, and many of
them said that Starr's conduct had revealed inherent problems with
the statute.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the subcommittee, the elimination of the independent
counsel law appears to enjoy considerable bipartisan support, and
the drumbeat for letting the law expire _ or, at least, severely
curtailing it _ grew louder during the president's impeachment and
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The law was initially passed in 1978 in the aftermath of the
Watergate scandal, to meet concerns about the need for an authority
outside the government to be able to investigate the president and
other high-ranking federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel statute was reauthorized repeatedly over
the next two decades, though there was tinkering with its specific
provisions and it was allowed to lapse from 1992 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing Tuesday was the first that the House held to examine
the future of the law. In addition to Holder, three congressmen who
have drafted legislation to abolish or drastically amend the
statute testified. One was a Republican and two were Democrats, but
all expressed profound reservations with the statute.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They focused in large part on the many witnesses and targets of
these probes whose bank accounts had been cleaned out by legal fees
and whose lives had been shattered, with Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark.,
drawing special attention to the effect of so many investigations
by independent counsels in the president's home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a devastation,'' Dickey said. ``It's been like a
tornado has hit, like Sherman's march to the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder's testimony, the contents of which had already been
reported by several news organizations Tuesday morning, marked the
Clinton administration's first official statement of its position
on the law's future. Holder cited a litany of problems with the
statute, from the ease with which it triggers the appointment of an
independent counsel to its failure to rein in that counsel's
investigations and spending. He also said that as soon as an
independent counsel is appointed, that counsel has a vested
interest in justifying his existence and budget by ferreting out
even the barest traces of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the old adage, adopted from Mark Twain, goes: To a man with
a hammer, a lot of things look like nails that need pounding,''
Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   In light of this, Holder said, ``the Justice Department has
reluctantly come to the conclusion _ and I must emphasize
reluctantly _ that there are fundamental structural flaws with the
act. These flaws, we believe, pervade the entire statute.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the department ``joins the many experts who have
concluded that the fundamental flaws in the act will remain, even
if Congress addressed all of the other problems in the act.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said that with the exception of Watergate, the country's
history before the adoption of the independent counsel law in 1978
suggested that the Justice Department itself could be trusted to
handle the kinds of allegations now being referred to independent
counsels.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the Justice Department has the power, even
without the independent counsel law, to appoint special counsels in
circumstances where department officials might be perceived to have
conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation should not feel that it is somehow at risk if we
fail to reauthorize this act,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gekas and Graham pressed him to defend that statement in a
more detailed presentation to the subcommittee within the next 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to say 1978 is good enough, I'm going to ask
you to come back up here and explain why,'' Graham said, adding
that he worried that public distaste for Starr's tactics might lead
to rash decisions about a law that had drawn broad congressional
support when it was last reauthorized just four years ago.

BUSH GIVES TEXANS CAMPAIGN SCOOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Under the hottest sun of the year and with a
stiffening wind whirling the leaves into a frenzy, George W. Bush
and his wife, Laura, sat on patio chairs behind the governor's
mansion on Tuesday before several dozen reporters from Texas and
almost made the announcement that everyone has been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   The two-term governor and son of the former president said that,
no, this was not it, but he would officially announce _ on Sunday _
the formation of an exploratory committee to raise money and help
him decide whether to, sometime later this year, become a bona fide
candidate for president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Let the money flow.
</P>
<P>
   The message was a signal to those who had been urging Bush, the
consistent front-runner in national polls, to run that he has
overcome any lingering doubts about the effect of a presidential
bid on his family and would approach the campaign with a mind
toward winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced, and Laura is convinced, that our love for each
other is strong enough and our family is close enough to take
whatever life brings,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   And the 52-year-old governor _ who has admitted to youthful
indiscretions and wildness about which he has declined to
elaborate, except to say that they are behind him and he is now a
faithful husband and family man _ said that he had no fears that
opponents would unearth skeletons from his past to derail a
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had there been skeletons that would have destroyed a
candidacy, you'd have found them in 1994 or 1998,'' Bush said,
referring to his first and second campaigns for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters from national networks and publications were told not
to attend Tuesday's event, a tape of which was provided to The New
York Times by someone who attended. A CNN camera crew was halted at
the gate. This announcement, the governor's people said, was for
Texas media only, in keeping with a pledge the governor had made
last year that, when he made his presidential decision, he would
let his fellow Texans in on it first.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that the news had already kind of seeped out.
Some of the governor's top advisers and campaign aides had been
quoted, anonymously, in reports in the last two weeks predicting
that such an announcement was imminent. And last week, one of them,
chief political consultant Karl Rove, told The New York Times, for
the record, that Bush intended to make the announcement, a
statement that the governor later told Texas reporters was
premature. When the announcement was to be made, the governor said,
he would make it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, aides to the governor said that the apparent
suddenness of the announcement on Tuesday _ news of its scheduling
was not released until Monday night _ was not rushed by the recent
rash of pre-announcements. It had been decided a while ago that the
official announcement would be made next week and that, as a
courtesy and to keep his commitment to the Texas news media, Bush
would have a Texas-only pre-announcement this week.
</P>
<P>
   It was only left to Karen Hughes, the governor's press
secretary, to pick the date and she chose Tuesday, because it is
also Texas Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he came to his decision shortly after delivering
his inaugural address in January and only delayed letting the world
in on it to give the Texas legislative session time to get under
way and to allow some of his initiatives to begin winding their way
through the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to get more comfortable with the idea,'' he explained
on Tuesday. ``I began to feel more comfortable inside. I began to
get a sense of peace inside my soul and my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bush said, the process would be divided into two parts.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, when the exploratory committee takes official
shape, supporters will be able to donate money to a potential Bush
campaign. Only then, the governor said, will it become clear
whether the high level of support his pre-candidacy has shown in
the polls is matched by dollar support at the grass roots.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, will not be part of the effort, except perhaps to
send out a fund-raising letter. He said he would stay in Texas,
tending to business through the end of the current legislative
session in May. During that time, he will continue to hold
occasional briefing sessions with his policy advisers, including
Mayor Steve Goldsmith of Indianapolis (domestic policy) and Provost
Condi Rice of Stanford University (foreign policy).
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the legislative session ends, he and his wife will
begin a summer of barnstorming the country, raising money and
taking the pulse of the electorate. At some point later this year,
he is not sure when, Bush will make his absolute final formal
announcement that he is or is not running for president.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing, though, that would keep him from running would
be if his exploratory efforts were greeted with ``a great thud, a
huge yawn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had been saying for months that he was concerned that his
wife and twin 17-year-old daughters, Barbara and Jenna, would find
the rigors of a campaign too invasive. Now, he said, that concern
is behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush said that she, too, had come to terms with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hesitated about is the ugliness that we all see of
political life,'' she said. ``George and I lived through the 1992
election with his Dad and it was a very miserable year for us. I
dread criticism of my husband. On the other hand, I love my husband
and I'm very proud of him and I know he'd make a great president.''

 &HT;    Federated report more positive than expected

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Federated Department Stores Inc., operator of
Lazarus, Bloomingdale's, Macy's and other department store chains,
surprised analysts by reporting that fiscal 1998 net income jumped
19 percent before extraordinary charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati-based chain of more than 400 department stores in
33 states reported fully diluted net income per share of $3.06,
before charges, topping expectations of retailing analysts by four
cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Federated earned $1.88 per share, beating
consensus expectations of $1.82 per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``This past year was a very good one for Federated,'' said James
M. Zimmerman, chairman and chief executive, of the year's results.
``We were particularly pleased with our very strong performance in
the important fourth quarter, including both sales and gross
margin.''
</P>
<P>
   For fiscal 1998, Federated posted earnings of $685 million,
excluding an extraordinary charge related to early retirement of
debt. This compares with earnings of $575 million for the previous
fiscal year, which had unusual charges for debt retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Diluted earnings per share rose to $3.06 for fiscal 1998, versus
$2.58 for fiscal 1997, a gain of 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, net income was $408 million or $1.88 per
share, compared with $379 million, or $1.66 a share, in fiscal
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sales last year totaled $15.8 billion, up 1.1 percent. On a
comparable store basis, 52-week sales increased 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, sales totaled $5.2 billion, up 2.9
percent over the previous year's fourth quarter. On a comparable
store basis, fourth quarter sales rose 4.1 percent compared with
fiscal 1997

$50,000 OFFERED TO TALL, SUPER-SUPER SMART EGG DONOR

<TEXT>
<P>
   The advertisements started appearing last week in newspapers at
the nation's top schools _ Ivy League colleges, Stanford
University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the
California Institute of Technology. ``Egg Donor Needed,'' the
advertisements said, adding, ``Large Financial Incentive.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad said a ``loving family'' was looking for a 5-foot-10,
athletic woman who had scored at least 1400 on her SAT and who had
no major family medical problems. In return, she would receive
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Already, more than 200 women have responded to the offer of what
is believed to be the largest amount of money ever offered for a
woman's eggs. Darlene Pinkerton, who with her lawyer-husband,
Thomas Pinkerton, placed the ads on behalf of an infertile couple,
said that most respondents were from Ivy League schools, and that
she was starting to get calls from women in countries as far away
as Finland and New Zealand. Women from state schools are calling,
Ms. Pinkerton said, as are women who are too short or whose SAT
scores are too low.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Pinkerton said that when she ran the same ad in October,
without mentioning the price the couple would pay, she got only six
responses.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, ethicists argued whether $5,000 was too much to pay
for an egg donor. They debated whether it was coercive for couples
to ask for SAT scores or height or favorite books when they sought
egg donors. But, some ethicists say, a $50,000 price, in a donor
market that just a year ago was reeling from offers of $7,500 for
donors, makes them wonder whether the business is getting out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthy couple offering $50,000 wants to remain anonymous,
Ms. Pinkerton said. But, she added, they decided to offer $50,000
``because they can.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple also realized that it might be hard to find a donor
who met their criteria. They are ``highly educated,'' Ms. Pinkerton
said, and want a child who can be highly educated as well. They are
tall, so they want a child who is tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard that only 1 percent of the college population is
over 5 feet 10 inches with over 1400 SAT scores,'' Ms. Pinkerton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Andrews, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, is
taken aback by the level that payments are reaching. ``I think we
are moving to children as consumer products,'' Ms. Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When prices for donors reach $50,000, it gets to be a
meaningful, life-altering sum,'' Ms. Andrews added.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Sauer, who directs the assisted-reproduction program at
Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in New
York, said that he found women, even Ivy League women, who were
willing to donate for $5,000. And so, Sauer asked, why would a
couple want to pay $50,000?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand the motive for the donor _ it's like winning
the lottery,'' Sauer said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he said, it takes just three to four weeks to produce
eggs. The woman takes fertility drugs to stimulate her ovaries to
produce more than a dozen eggs, has regular ultrasound exams so a
doctor can follow the eggs' development, and then is anesthetized
while a doctor aspirates the eggs from her ovaries through a
needle.
</P>
<P>
   But, Sauer asked, what are the egg recipients thinking when they
offer to pay so much for a donor with such specific traits?
</P>
<P>
   ``What genetic textbook did they read,'' he asks, that would
tell them that they could order up a tall, smart, athletic child by
paying $50,000 for a donor?
</P>
<P>
   Other experts, however, say they fail to see what is so wrong
with looking for specific traits in a donor and paying $50,000 for
them. Dr. Norman Fost, who directs the program in medical ethics at
the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said it was not so crazy to
ask for height and SAT scores.
</P>
<P>
   Fost worries more, he said, about parents who try to engineer
their children after they are born, pushing them to get perfect
grades and to take endless SAT tutoring courses, or parents who
push their children to be superstars in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that genetic engineering is any more
pernicious,'' Fost said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the $50,000 payment to the egg donor, why not? ``It's
like offering someone a million dollars to play professional
football,'' Fost said. ``You are perfectly free to walk away from
it. People make these choices all their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he added, ``Whether children are valued and how they
are treated has very little to do with how they are conceived.''

BILL WOULD SUBJECT GUNS TO FEDERAL SAFETY CONTROLS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As cities and states prepare to battle the gun industry in the
courts, advocates of toughened gun control have opened a new front
by introducing a bill in Congress to end gun makers' exemption from
federal health and safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
   he bill, offered on Tuesday by Sen. Robert Torricelli of New
Jersey and Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, both Democrats,
would effectively abolish the gun industry's unique exclusion from
regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. But rather
than giving the new regulatory authority to the safety commission,
the legislation would make the design, manufacture and distribution
of guns subject to control by an agency with more expertise about
them, the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   The measure faces tough going, however, because it will be
strenuously opposed by gun makers and the National Rifle
Association, which have long wielded enormous influence on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the NRA, Congress has excluded firearms from
the health and safety standards of the Consumer Product Safety
Commission ever since the agency was established in 1972. The only
federal body with any regulatory authority over the industry is the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a Treasury Department
agency, but its power is largely limited to issuing federal
firearms licenses, collecting excise taxes and tracing stolen guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In almost every other aspect of American life, the government
sets minimum levels of safety, even for teddy bears, but not for
guns,'' Torricelli said on Tuesday. ``It's a great irony.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator said that his bill would enable the Treasury
Department to regulate the distribution of firearms so that gun
makers could not sell large quantities of handguns in states with
lax gun control laws, feeding a black market for handguns in states
like New York with tougher controls. A federal jury in Brooklyn,
N.Y., found last month that 15 gun makers had negligently
distributed their products in this fashion in Southern states, with
the result that the guns ended up being used in shootings in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   While that verdict was returned in a case brought by individual
citizens, several cities, some of them using the same argument,
have also filed suits against the industry in an effort to recover
their police and medical costs attributable to gun violence. About
15 other cities and at least two states, New York and
Massachusetts, are considering similar suits.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said that his bill would also enable the Treasury
Department to push for new safety devices like locks that would
help prevent children from accidentally firing their parents' guns.
</P>
<P>
   To responsible gun owners, he said: ``There is nothing in this
legislation for law-abiding citizens to fear.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Powers, director of public affairs for the National
Rifle Association, said: ``This is not about safety. The term
`safety' has been hijacked by these antigun politicians like
Torricelli and Kennedy to restrict the public's use and access to
firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' Powers said, ``is that no government
regulation can make people safer, just as no government mandate can
make people more moral.'' In addition, Powers said, ``violence is
not a safety issue, it's an issue of violent criminals, and to deal
with them the NRA believes we need more prison blocks and steel
bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Delfay, president of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition
Manufacturers Institute, a trade association, said: ``It is totally
incorrect and misleading to say that a teddy bear or toy gun is
more regulated than the production of firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   Delfay acknowledged that there was currently no federal
regulation for the design and manufacture of guns, but said that
the industry was subject to more than 400 standards set by the
American National Standards Institute, which helps private industry
set voluntary measures.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Torricelli-Kennedy bill was the work of the
Violence Policy Center, a research and advocacy group in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, the gun industry is going to have to submit
to government regulation,'' said Kristen Rand, a lawyer for the
Violence Policy Center. ``Congress could be presented with a
package of regulations, negotiated between cities, the courts and
the gun industry, as happened with the states and the tobacco
industry. And if that happens, this bill will be there as a
standard.''

8 TOURISTS, INCLUDING A U.S. COUPLE, KILLED IN UGANDA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Treks through the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest of southwestern
Uganda to see the rare mountain gorillas are small, exclusive
forays that begin in a tranquil agricultural valley.
</P>
<P>
   But that calm was shattered on Monday when some 30 tourists
scattered among three campsites were set upon by a band of Hutu
rebels armed with automatic rifles, machetes and spears _ remnants
of the murderous army that laid waste to Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the attack ended, four men and four women, all
tourists, lay hacked or bludgeoned to death in the jungle, while
four Ugandan park employees were slain in the campsites. The
foreign victims included four Britons, two New Zealanders and an
American couple who worked as executives for the Intel Corp., the
Oregon-based computer chip manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that I saw had their heads crushed in and deep
slashes,'' said Mark Ross, an American tour leader who was released
by the attackers after a forced march into the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women that we'd been told would be escorted back had been
killed on the spot,'' said Ross, speaking to reporters at a news
conference on Tuesday in the Ugandan capital of Kampala. ``It looks
like one was raped prior to being killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the attack apparently lies rooted in the murky
violence that has beset central Africa for years, gradually seeping
over the national borders linking Rwanda, the Congo and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors said as many as 150 ragtag soldiers materialized out
of the trees and sought out Americans and Britons among the
tourists. The soldiers were Hutu, the ethnic group that fled
neighboring Rwanda after killing over 500,000 rival Tutsi and
moderate Hutu in the mass killings of five years ago. Now regrouped
in the wilds of the Congo, the Hutu oppose American and British
support for the Ugandan military and others who are seen as
sympathizing with the Tutsi.

MARKET PLACE: 3COM FALLS SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Any doubts that technology stocks were undergoing a
correction evaporated Tuesday as yet another prominent maker of
computer equipment, 3Com Corp., announced that its sales and
earnings would fall short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   3Com, which makes computer networking equipment as well as the
popular Palm Pilot electronic organizer, said that an ``unexpected
slowdown'' in parts of its business would cause earnings for the
quarter ended Feb. 28 to be far less than Wall Street had
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies, which have led the entire stock market
higher since October, are having ever-greater difficulty
maintaining prices, and therefore corporate profits. In recent
days, Compaq Computer and Micron Electronics have warned that sales
of their personal computers were disappointing, as Dell Computer
did a few weeks ago. That, in turn, has led investors to edge away
from stocks of semiconductor companies, which make the chips for
computers, and other computer-related companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, technology stocks have now fallen more than 10
percent from their highs of last month and are slightly above where
they started the year. The Pacific Stock Exchange technology index
declined by nearly 2 percent Tuesday and is now 11.7 percent below
the high it reached on Feb. 1; at 456.72, the index of 100
technology stocks is 1.7 percent above where it started the year.
</P>
<P>
   The shortfall announced Tuesday by 3Com did not take everyone by
surprise. The company made its announcement after trading in its
shares was halted late in the day, but by then its stock price had
fallen more than $3, to $27. Volume was an exceptionally heavy 31.4
million shares, making it the second-most active stock on the
Nasdaq market Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In after-hours trading, the shares fell as much as $1 more, to
$26.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Claflin, 3Com's president and chief operating officer,
said in a telephone interview that the announcement was made ``as
soon as it became clear'' that the company would not meet growth
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also clear that there is something more broad going on in
the industry,'' he said, referring to recent announcements of sales
and earnings disappointments by companies like Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   3Com said it expected sales for the three months ended in
February to be about $1.41 billion, resulting in earnings of
roughly 23 cents a share. Analysts had been expecting sales of more
than $1.5 billion and earnings of about 36 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales and profit figures are nevertheless well
above those reported a year earlier. 3Com reported revenues of
$1.25 billion and profits, before merger-related adjustments, of 2
cents a share a year ago. In fact, sales appear to have accelerated
in the last nine months. For the quarter ended in November,
revenues grew 10 percent from a year earlier, twice the growth rate
of the previous quarter. And in the three months ended Feb. 28,
sales apparently grew at a 13 percent rate. Still, profit margins
are under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the disappointing financial results could be
traced to three areas of its business. First, 3Com said that some
independent distributors of its products experienced their own
unexpected shortfalls in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sales of 3Com's modems and other products to
personal computer manufacturers were lower than the company had
anticipated. That shortfall follows warnings in recent weeks from
Dell Computer, Compaq and other computer manufacturers that their
growth was slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, 3Com said that sales to commercial customers in the
United States and Latin America of the company's modems and its
switches, routers and hubs, which allow personal computers to
connect to networks, fell short of its growth plans. That
development echoes an announcement last month by Dell Computer
about disappointing sales to corporate customers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   3Com also said that the leader of its clients access unit _ the
division that markets 3Com's modems and internal cards that allow
computers to connect to networks _ would leave the company on June
1. Doug Spreng, a senior vice president, will be replaced by Jef
Grahman, general manager of its mobile communications division.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings warnings that technology companies have made in
recent weeks seem incongruous in light of the extreme popularity of
the Internet among individuals, who seemingly cannot get connected
quickly enough, and among corporations, which are rushing to do
business in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But Claflin said that Wall Street was disappointed by mostly
slowing rates of growth rather than declines in overall demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly at the unit level, volume is still going up at a
rapid rate,'' Claflin said. ``People are still buying modems, ports
and other products. But there is more price pressure,'' so the sale
of more units has not necessarily translated to comparable growth
in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Claflin also attributed some of the weakness announced Tuesday
to seasonal factors, noting that the first months of the calendar
year are the least active for many technology companies. But 3Com
investors in particular have suffered through more than their share
of disappointments over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company completed the acquisition of U.S. Robotics,
one of the largest makers of traditional computer modems, in
mid-1997, 3Com's shares have fallen from the high $40-a-share range
to the mid-$20s. Claflin, who was not at the company at the time of
the acquisition, said that despite the recent weakness in the modem
business, one of the company's most promising products was the Palm
Pilot organizers, which also came to the company in the U.S.
Robotics purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Investors surprised by the earnings warning will probably get
little comfort from the fact that several 3Com executives sold big
blocks of stock in December and January, when the company's stock
price was significantly higher.
</P>
<P>
   According to CDA/Investnet, which tracks sales and purchases by
corporate executives, 3Com insiders sold 3.8 million shares of
stock in December and January. A spokeswoman for 3Com said Tuesday
that the company did not comment on trading by its executives.

 &HT;    Bill would require insurers to pay for formula
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ After five miscarriages, Lydia Bogan and her
husband, Ed, of West Alexandria had reason to rejoice 16 months ago
with the birth of their daughter, Kaitlynn Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Severe food allergies, however, have made life a daily and
expensive struggle for Kaitlynn. She and her parents appeared at a
Statehouse news conference Tuesday with Rep. Gene Krebs, R-Camden,
to support legislation that would require health insurance
companies to pay for the special formula that has kept Kaitlynn
alive.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth Care of Ohio, the family's insurer, has declined to
pay for the formula, and the company's decision has been upheld by
the Ohio Department of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, we have found no material evidence that the
company has acted improperly, so we cannot require a change in
their position,'' Julie Phillips, an insurance department analyst,
said in a Sept. 28 letter to the Bogans.
</P>
<P>
   To pay the $1,000 a month for Neocate, the special British-made
formula, the Bogans have taken out a second mortgage on their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more than one-half of our monthly income,'' Mrs. Bogan,
44, said of the monthly expense. She is a licensed practical nurse
but currently is not working. Bogan, 45, is a technician at Mound
Metrology, a calibration lab in Miamisburg. The Preble County
residents have a son, Matthew, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Before doctors switched Kaitlynn to Neocate, the infant reacted
with ``blood-curdling'' screams to other nourishment, once for 18
hours straight hours, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   The baby had a look on her face that said, ``Mommy, please help
me,'' Mrs. Bogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaitlynn was diagnosed with an allergy to milk, soy and protein.
Her digestive system was unable to break down protein into amino
acids, causing adverse reactions. Less than half of 1 percent of
all infants are diagnosed with such an allergy, Mrs. Bogan said.
Neocate comes with the protein already broken down.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth Care said Neocate is classified as an
over-the-counter product that is not covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a food product. We do not cover those,'' said Karen
Fennerty, manager of process improvement for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The Bogans said Neocate has been more than food to their young
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was her source of life. The Neocate was what kept her
alive,'' Mrs. Bogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaitlynn now is able to tolerate small amounts of carrots,
squash and sweet potatoes, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that UnitedHealth Care recently has not returned phone
calls nor answered mail.
</P>
<P>
   Fennerty said she is confident that calls and letters have been
answered.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending the news conference were Joel and Tammera Busch
and their daughter, Emily, 1, who had an allergy similar to
Kaitlynn's. The Buschs, who live in Xenia, said that after some
discussions, their insurer, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, paid
for their daughter's special formula.
</P>
<P>
   Krebs said his legislation would require health insurance plans
to cover infant formula prescribed by participating doctors and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make an extremely compelling case,'' Krebs said of the
Bogans.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel Corp. recently blinked in a confrontation
with privacy advocates protesting the company's plans to ship its
newest generation of microprocessors with an embedded serial number
that could be used to identify a computer _ and by extension, its
user.
</P>
<P>
   But those on both sides of the dispute acknowledge that it was
only an initial skirmish in a wider struggle. From computers to
cellular phones to digital video players, everyday devices and
software programs are increasingly embedding telltale identifying
numbers that enable them to interact.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such digital fingerprints constitute an imminent privacy
threat or are simply part of the foundation of advanced computer
systems and networks is the subject of a growing debate between the
computer industry and privacy groups. At the heart of the argument
is a fundamental disagreement over the role of electronic anonymity
in a democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups argue fiercely that the merger of computers and
the Internet has brought the specter of a new surveillance society
in which it will be difficult to find any device whose use cannot
be traced to the user. But a growing alliance of computer industry
executives, engineers, law enforcement officials and scholars
contend that absolute anonymity is not only increasingly difficult
to obtain technically but is also a potential threat to democratic
order because of the possibility of electronic crime and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You already have zero privacy _ get over it,'' Scott McNealy,
chairman and chief executive of Sun Microsystems, said at a recent
news conference held to introduce the company's newest software,
known as Jini, which is intended to interconnect virtually all
types of electronic devices from computers to cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates contend that software like Jini, which assigns
an identification number to each device each time it connects to a
network, could be misused as networks envelop almost everyone in
society in a dense web of devices that see, hear and monitor
behavior and location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once information becomes available for one purpose there is
always pressure from other organizations to use it for their
purposes,'' said Lauren Weinstein, editor of Privacy Forum, an
on-line journal.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a programmer in Massachusetts found that identifying
numbers can easily be found in word processing and spreadsheet
files created with Microsoft's popular Word and Excel programs and
the Windows 95 and 98 operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, unlike the Intel serial number, which the computer
user can conceal, the numbers used by the Microsoft programs _
found in millions of personal computers _ cannot be controlled by
the user.
</P>
<P>
   The programmer, Richard M. Smith, president of Phar Lap
software, a developer of computer programming tools in Cambridge,
Mass., noticed a similar feature in the Windows operating system: a
unique registration number stored on each personal computer in a
small database known as the Windows registry.
</P>
<P>
   His curiosity aroused, Smith investigated further and discovered
that the unique number on his computer that allows connection to a
the network used in most office computing systems, known as the
Ethernet, was routinely copied to each Microsoft Word or Excel
document he created.
</P>
<P>
   The number is used to create a longer number, which is known as
a globally unique identifier. It is there, he said, to enable
computer users to create sophisticated documents comprising word
processing, spreadsheet, presentation and data base information.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those functions needs a separate identity, and computer
designers have found that the Ethernet number is a convenient and
widely available unique identifier, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The infrastructure relies a lot on serial numbers,'' Smith
said. ``We've let the genie out of the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ressler, a Microsoft product manager, said that if a
computer did not have an Ethernet adaptor, then another identifying
number was generated that was likely to be unique. ``We need a big
number, which is a unique identifier,'' he said. ``If we didn't
have it, it would be impossible to make our software programs work
together across networks.''
</P>
<P>
   An increasing range of technologies have provisions for
identifying their users for either technical reasons (like
connecting to a network) or commercial ones (like determining which
ads to show to Web surfers). But engineers and network designers
argue that identity information is a vital aspect of modern
security design because it is necessary to authenticate an
individual in a network, thereby preventing fraud or intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   Last month at the introduction of Intel's powerful Pentium III
chip, the company's executives showed more than a dozen data
security uses for the serial number contained electronically in
each of the chips, ranging from limiting access to protecting
documents or software against piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest chip maker, recently backed down
somewhat after it was challenged by privacy advocates over the
identity feature, agreeing to ship at least some of the processors
for the consumer market in a way that requires the user to activate
the feature.
</P>
<P>
   Far from scaling back its vision, however, Intel said it was
planning an even-wider range of features in its chips to help
companies protect copyrighted materials. It also pointed to
software applications that would use the embedded number to
identify participants in electronic chat rooms on the Internet and
thereby protect children against Internet stalkers.
</P>
<P>
   But in achieving those goals, it would also create a universal
identifier, which could be used by software applications to track
computer users wherever they surfed on the World Wide Web. And
that, despite the chip maker's assertions that it is working to
enhance security and privacy, has led some privacy advocates to
taunt the giant chip maker and accuse it of pursuing a ``Big
Brother Inside'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that by uniquely identifying each computer it will
make it possible for marketers or government and law enforcement
officials to track the activities of anyone connected to a computer
network more closely. They also say that such a permanent
identifier could be used in a similar fashion to the data known as
``cookies'' that are placed on a computer's hard drive by Web sites
to track the comings and goings of Internet surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's decision to forge ahead with identity features in its
chip technology may signal a turning point in the battle over
privacy in the electronic age. Until now, privacy concerns have
generally put industry executives on the defensive. Now questions
are being raised about whether there should be limits to privacy in
an Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Brandeis' definition of privacy was `the right to be
left alone,' not the right to operate in absolute secrecy,'' said
Paul Saffo, a researcher at the Institute for the Future in Menlo
Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Some Silicon Valley engineers and executives have responded that
the Intel critics are being naive and have failed to understand
that all devices connected to computer networks require
identification features simply to function correctly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they note that identifying numbers have for more than
two decades been a requirement for any computer connected to an
Ethernet network. (Although still found most widely in office
settings, Ethernet connections are increasingly being used for
high-speed Internet service in the home via digital telephone lines
and cable modems.)
</P>
<P>
   For example, all of Apple Computer's popular iMac machines come
with an Ethernet network connection that has a unique permanent
number installed in the factory. The number is used to identify the
computer to the local network.
</P>
<P>
   While the Ethernet number is not broadcast over the Internet at
large, it could easily be discovered by any software application
like a Web browser and transmitted to a remote Web site tracking
the identities of its users, a number of computer engineers said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they sau that other kinds of networks require identity
numbers to protect against fraud. Each cellular telephone currently
has two numbers. One is the telephone number, which can easily be
changed. But a second number, known an electronic serial number, is
permanently put in place at the factory to protect against theft or
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The serial number is accessible to the cellular telephone
network, and as cellular telephones add Internet browsing and
electronic mail capabilities, it will potentially have the same
identity capability as the Intel processor serial number.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples include Divx DVD disks, which come with serial
numbers that permit tracking the use of each movie by a centralized
network recording system managed by the companies that sell the
disks.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say that as the line between communications
and computing becomes increasingly blurred, every electronic device
will require some kind of identification to attach to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Making those numbers available to networks that need to pass
information or to find a mobile user and at the same time denying
the information to those who wish to gather information into vast
databases may be an impossible task.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates argue that even if isolated numbers may look
harmless, they are actually harbingers of a trend toward
ever-more-invasive surveillance networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we can do to actually minimize the collection of
personal data is good,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, one of three groups that are
attempting to organize a boycott against Intel's chips.
</P>
<P>
   The groups are worried that in the future the government will
require ever more invasive hardware modifications to keep track of
individuals. Already they point to the 1994 Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which requires that telephone
companies modify their network switches to make it easier for
government wiretappers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also, the Federal Communications Commission is now developing
regulations that in the future will require every cellular
telephone to have the capability to report its precise location for
``911'' emergency calls. Privacy groups are worried that this
feature will be used as a tracking technology by law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate danger is that the government will mandate that
each chip have special logic added'' to track identities in
cyberspace, said Vernor Vinge, a computer scientist at San Diego
State University. ``We're on a slide in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinge is the author of ``True Names,'' a science fiction novel
in the early 1980's, that forecast a world in which anonymity in
computer networks is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Intel executives insist that their chip is being misused by
privacy groups that have distorted the value of the identifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to start building security architecture into our
chips, and this is the first step,'' said Pat Gelsinger, Intel vice
president and general manager of desktop products. ``The
discouraging part of this is our objective is to accomplish
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   That quandary _ that it is almost impossible to compartmentalize
information for one purpose so that it cannot be misused _ lies at
the heart of the argument. Moreover, providing security while at
the same time offering anonymity has long been a technical and a
political challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find ways to distinguish between security and
identity,'' said James X. Dempsey, a privacy expert at the Center
for Democracy and Technology, a Washington lobbying organization.
</P>
<P>
   So far the prospects are not encouraging. One technical solution
developed by the cryptographer David Chaum made it possible for
individuals to make electronic cash payments anonymously in a
network.
</P>
<P>
   In the system Chaum designed, a user employs a different number
with each different organization, thereby insuring that there is no
universal tracking capability.
</P>
<P>
   But while Chaum's solution has been considered ingenious, it has
failed in the marketplace. Last year, his company, Digicash Inc.,
based in Palo Alto, Calif. filed for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I hate it, privacy never seems to sell,'' said
Bruce Schneier, a cryptographer and a computer industry consultant.
``Those who are interested in privacy don't want to pay for it, and
those who can afford it don't care about privacy.''

IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUCHANAN RIDES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., W.Va., Maine) (biobox follows; see also BUSH-POLITICS) 
(nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Patrick Buchanan, who in two previous
presidential forays fashioned himself the icon of the disaffected
worker and the iconoclast of the Republican Party, is back for a
third run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mount up and ride to the sound of the guns,'' Buchanan ordered
his loyalists Tuesday in announcing his latest bid for the White
House and offering up his familiar platform: for restoring
America's ``lost sovereignty,'' for trade protection, for a
moratorium on immigration and for ``the rights of the innocent
unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Added to his populist stew was a repudiation of President
Clinton, who, he said, has desecrated the White House by using it
``to shake down corporate executives, to lie with abandon to the
American people,'' and by turning it into ``a place to exploit
women.''
</P>
<P>
   It is time, he said, ``to call down the curtain on the sorry
soap opera in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's candidacy, which became abruptly evident when he took
a leave from his role as co-host of the CNN television program
``Crossfire'' just a week ago, is widely perceived as more of a
vanity run or even a mischief run than a serious campaign for the
White House. Friends say he was bored with his television job.
Although he is passionate about his crusade against what he calls
the elite global economists, even his fervent supporters say he has
no chance of becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Buchanan, who won the 1996 New Hampshire
primary, has the ability to shake up a Republican field crowded
with lower-wattage conservatives who have been unable to
distinguish themselves from one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will have a dramatic impact on the second- and third-tier
candidates who are trying to carve out a niche on the right,'' said
David Carney, a venerable New Hampshire Republican strategist who
is not affiliated with any presidential campaign. ``He may peter
out, but between now and Labor Day he will be the 800-pound gorilla
in that half of the party and will drive these other guys crazy
trying to figure out how to deal with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mueller, Buchanan's communications chief in 1992 and 1996,
said his old boss seemed driven by a preoccupation with economic
dislocation and believed it was an issue that no other candidate in
either party was addressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a cause and a mission that he's taken upon himself,''
Mueller said. ``He believes that the Republican Party must identify
with those working-class issues to rebuild the Reagan coalition to
take back the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the populist pitch to the downtrodden worker may have
less resonance in an economy that has now been expanding for eight
years, and it is unclear whether the 60-year-old Buchanan can
recapture the romanticism and the early momentum of his previous
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's announcement Tuesday took place at the scene of his
greatest electoral vindication _ his 1996 triumph over Bob Dole,
the party's eventual nominee, when Buchanan conjured up the image
of peasants ``coming over the hills'' with pitchforks and
overthrowing the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's rough-hewn individualists have always been good
to Buchanan, giving him 37 percent of the vote in 1992. George Bush
won New Hampshire that year, but Buchanan's strong showing was a
searing indictment of the incumbent president, who went on to lose
to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's event lacked the kind of full-dress, media-savvy
theatrics that Buchanan watchers have come to expect. The usually
spontaneous candidate, well practiced on his feet, read his speech
to about 200 people at a sterile, low-ceiling conference center
here. There was no music, no warm-up act, no grand entrance, no
sense that something historic or even new was happening. Only one
man came with a pitchfork, a smoothly carved work of art that was
actually crafted in Germany, an unintended illustration of
Buchanan's message that foreign-made goods are flooding the
American market.
</P>
<P>
   Except for his wife, Shelley, Buchanan has no entourage, no
spokesmen, no consultants, no advance team. In part, that is the
nature of his new insurgent candidacy. This year it also reflects
the fact that his 1996 aides are working for other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, for example, plans to sign up with Steve Forbes.
Perhaps the biggest absence is that of Bay Buchanan, Buchanan's
sister, who served as the central strategist in his previous
campaigns. This year she plans to keep her job as a commentator at
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan downplayed the need for such aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find the big entourages cost you an awful lot of money,''
and ``then you run out of money,'' he said in a brief interview as
he stepped off a commercial flight at the airport here. ``You don't
need all this in the early days. These consultants, I used to know
them when they were all kids. They weren't that bright then!''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Buchanan has little money, counting instead on his knack for
sound bites, his clear-cut message and his almost cult-like
following to propel him through the early primary states. This
self-reliance lends his candidacy the air of having kick-started
itself, picking up where Buchanan trailed off in 1996 after he
never officially dropped out and never officially endorsed Dole.
</P>
<P>
   At his announcement speech here, he was preaching to the
converted. The single pitchfork-toting supporter, Craig Henne, a
lumber salesman from Eliott, Maine, said that when he heard
Buchanan was running again, he ``dusted off'' his old Buchanan
bumper stickers from the last time around. He said that even if
Buchanan's campaign ``amounts to nothing,'' he wanted to show his
support for a man who says what he thinks and believes what he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time he was asked, `Would you have a homosexual in your
cabinet?' And he said, `No,' '' Henne said by way of example. ``He
didn't say, `I'll take a poll and tell you in two weeks.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Marie Therese brought two dozen schoolchildren from the
Immaculate Heart of Mary in Richmond, N.H., to hear Buchanan
because, she said, ``I wanted to give them someone to look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rally with 1,300 people on Monday in the gritty steel town
of Weirton, W.Va., Buchanan demonstrated something important _ that
he could conceivably win over support from those who had not voted
for him before. Weirton is a heavily Democratic town where the
steel mill has been stricken by the ``dumping'' of cheap foreign
imports, which has become a cause celebre of Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one well-known person who is taking an interest in
what is happening to us,'' said Janet Stagani, 55, a bookkeeper at
the steelworkers' union and a Democrat. ``If he's willing to take a
stand, regardless of the outcome, then I can support him,
regardless of the outcome. I'll see what my choices are down the
road. But right now, I want to give him a vote of confidence.''

 &HT;    Test show high levels of E. coli
 &HT;    By Peter Donald
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Tests on frozen mamey products
confiscated by the state have yet to isolate any of the germs
suspected of causing a typhoid fever outbreak in Florida, but
instead have identified alarming levels of E. coli bacteria, an
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These products are filthy,'' said Terry McElroy, a spokesman
for the Florida Department of Agriculture. ``We have isolated lots
of E. coli. What's significant is it identifies the presence of
fecal matter.''
</P>
<P>
   McElroy said the sheer volume of E. coli in the samples was
making it difficult to isolate Salmonella typhi, the bacteria that
cause typhoid fever. The samples were taken from the same stores
and brand names as those used by the 15 typhoid fever victims
reported in Florida since late December.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the patients were from Palm Beach County. The illness
can cause prolonged fever, constipation and other symptoms, but can
nearly always be successfully treated with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   The cases were unusual because health officials said people
appeared to have gotten sick from eating frozen mamey _ a tropical
fruit product used to make the popular shakes known as ``batidos''
in the Hispanic community. Usually, typhoid fever cases diagnosed
here were contracted by visiting other countries where the disease
is more common.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are focusing on two frozen mamey brand names
produced in Guatemala and Honduras _ El Sembrador and La Fe _
suspected in the typhoid fever outbreak and found to be tainted
with E. coli, McElroy said. He described the germs as a garden
variety that could make you sick, but not the potentially deadly
strain known as E. coli 0157:H7.
</P>
<P>
   The Guatemalan Embassy Office in Miami referred calls to a trade
representative who was traveling in Guatemala and unavailable for
comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Of 81 frozen mamey samples tested by state agriculture
officials, 17 were packed with germs, carrying counts of 1000 parts
E. coli per gram, officials said. Twenty-three samples had counts
of 100 parts E. coli per gram and another 13 samples had counts of
10 parts per gram.
</P>
<P>
   Although small levels of E. coli may be found on animal products
and can be killed through cooking, any amount of the germ is
unacceptable in raw fruits and vegetables, McElroy said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, health officials continue to comb the country for
additional typhoid fever cases that may be connected to frozen
mamey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally we're concerned that we have a health problem that
may be nationwide,'' said Joy Wells, a scientist with the Centers
For Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ``If it's determined
there's a more widespread problem, action will be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no new typhoid fever cases connected to frozen mamey
have been reported in states with huge Hispanic populations such as
California, New York and Texas, said Dr. Eric Mintz, chief of the
CDC's Diarrheal Diseases Epidemiology Section.
</P>
<P>
   But in an urgent health bulletin sent last week, the CDC warned
epidemiologists and directors of public health laboratories to
update their typhoid fever records because of the scare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enhanced our surveillance,'' Mintz said.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials suspect frozen mamey was tainted with typhoid
fever-causing germs because 73 percent of 11 patients in Miami-Dade
County ate frozen mamey in the four weeks before they got sick. In
contrast, only 19 percent of 48 healthy people studied had eaten
mamey products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The epidemiological evidence is strong,'' Mintz said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida agricultural officials have stopped the sale of frozen
mamey in the state and seized 200,000 pounds of the product from
store shelves. Whether all such imports should be stopped is up to
the Food and Drug Administration. So far, the FDA has only taken
the step of warning consumers not to eat frozen mamey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at lab results to determine what the next step
will be,'' said Lynn Issacs, an FDA public affairs officer in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Issacs said she expected the FDA to make an announcement on
frozen mamey in the next two days, but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   CDC investigators said that like most bacteria, Salmonella typhi
can survive in a frozen environment. In fact, they store bacterial
samples in their research collection 70 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``They live longer and better at lower temperatures,'' Mintz
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria's resilience at low temperatures could help explain
its presence in frozen mamey products. But investigators are still
trying to determine at what point the mamey could have become
tainted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly contaminated fruit, whether the contamination
occurred in the field through unsanitary irrigation or people not
washing their hands at the frozen processing phase,'' McElroy said.
</P>

Fla.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Robert Shapiro, the chief executive of Monsanto Co.,
occupies a modest cubicle on the ninth floor of the Merchandise
Mart in downtown Chicago, about 300 miles from the company's
headquarters in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   On most days, Shapiro, 60, arrives in a plaid shirt or a
sweater, with khakis. No tie. Employees call him Bob. In the nearly
four years that he has headed the company, formalities have been
dropped lower down the ranks, too: Discussion, through e-mail, is
encouraged, and nearly all top executives work in cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's better to have an open office rather than
dark-wood paneling and cuff links, where there's a message about
power and privilege,'' Shapiro said in a recent interview. ``You
want a place that doesn't look like it takes itself too
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that Shapiro is beating a drum for an open and
free-thinking corporate environment, however, he and other
executives are in merger negotiations with DuPont, a much larger
company with more traditional ways, according to executives who say
they have been briefed on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a peculiar courtship in recent months
between the two companies. Shapiro, these executives say, has been
searching for a way for Monsanto to be acquired by DuPont and still
retain its special character and habits, with its own compensation
and incentive programs, and possibly its own stock.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro declined to comment on the prospects of any deal. DuPont
officials also would not comment. The talks, according to the
executives who say they have been briefed, are still at a
preliminary stage and may go no further. In June, Monsanto agreed
to be acquired by the American Home Products Corp. for $34.4
billion, but that deal fell apart in October.
</P>
<P>
   Still, corporate culture is clearly important to Monsanto as it
slowly transforms itself from a chemicals concern to what is called
a life sciences company, making everything from arthritis drugs to
genetically modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   To revive flagging earnings, the $9 billion conglomerate is
trying to act like a small, high-technology start-up company,
favoring teamwork and spontaneity over hierarchy and convention.
While some critics have dismissed Shapiro's style as New Age
management, he says that a start-up's attributes _ being
aggressive, entrepreneurial and quick to market with new products _
are what Monsanto needs to compete with larger rivals like Novartis
and Rhone-Poulenc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Shapiro thought Monsanto had to set the metronome at a
higher speed to compete,'' said James Wilbur, an analyst with
Salomon Smith Barney. ``And so they adopted an environment to
accomplish that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the right environment may not be enough. Monsanto could use
a huge infusion of cash after spending more than $8 billion in the
last few years on acquisitions aimed at strengthening its
agriculture division. And to compete better against the giants in
life sciences, the company needs a bigger partner, like DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   Can Shapiro get Monsanto the size and cash it needs and still
preserve the company's freewheeling ways?
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts are skeptical, especially given their belief that
the deal with American Home Products collapsed in large part
because Shapiro and John Stafford, the chief executive of American
Home, clashed over who would control the company and how the two
different ways of doing business would blend. In meetings, one
Monsanto official said, the differences were stark: Monsanto
employees spoke up and disagreed with ``Bob,'' while American Home
officials deferred to ``Mr. Stafford.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The two companies did have different cultures, but there was
also a CEO ego conflict,'' said William Fiala, an analyst with
Edward Jones &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   A Monsanto spokeswoman would say only that the directors of the
two companies had decided it was not in their shareholders' best
interest to merge, echoing what a joint press release said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   But DuPont may want to strike a deal with Monsanto. Both
companies are increasingly focusing on life sciences. DuPont, which
has a small pharmaceuticals division, wants to expand its drug
business, while Monsanto's G.D. Searle &AMP; Co. unit is a small but
growing force, with strong cancer and arthritis drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a very complicated deal,'' said Robert House, a
professor of organizational behavior at the Wharton School of the
University of Pennsylvania. ``If it's managed as a holding company
manages an acquisition, things won't change for Monsanto. But that
would mean they're not taking advantage of the merger. So what's
the point?''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear whether Monsanto's insistence on doing
things differently is encouraging or hindering a big merger, its
approach has so far done little for the bottom line. After years of
spectacular earnings gains, the company faltered in 1998. Heavy
research spending and a string of high-priced acquisitions in the
seed business saddled the company with a huge debt load. Earnings
suffered, and heavy reorganization charges and layoffs were
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The stock tumbled in October after the deal with American Home
Products collapsed, and it has been treading water ever since. The
shares closed Tuesday at $44.375, down 6.5 percent so far this year
and a 31 percent drop from their 52-week high of $63.9375 in
August.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also come under sharp criticism, especially in
Britain, for its genetically altered seeds. When Shapiro was in San
Francisco last year, he was hit in the face with a pie thrown by
someone protesting ``Frankenstein foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto executives, however, say their long-term strategy is
sound. The company bought seed companies to speed its genetically
modified seeds to market. Monsanto says that such products have
been proved safe and could even bring great environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives say that a revolution is under way in food,
nutrition and health care, and that it involves using biology and
genetic science. So Monsanto has spent heavily on research and
development to create a pipeline of blockbuster drugs, like its
popular new arthritis drug Celebrex, and it is modifying corn and
soybean seeds to make their crops more productive and more
resistant to disease.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro and other Monsanto executives say that for the last few
years they have staked the future of Monsanto not just on what the
company plans to create but also on how it plans to create it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All companies think they have the smarter guys,'' Shapiro
said. ``So we came to the conclusion that our biggest competitive
advantage was our culture. If we got a higher percentage of
people's potential, we could win. In an environment where people
care about what they're doing and feel a personal bond, it will
release a lot of potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro talks about companies' having complex ecosystems, of
trying to create a setting where employees can be honest, of
channeling a worker's energy and creativity. And he says that the
right corporate environment comes down to two things: authenticity
and caring.
</P>
<P>
   He rejects traditional corporate structures as cold and
debilitating. When Shapiro, who has been with the company in
various capacities for nearly two decades, first visited Monsanto's
huge corporate campus in St. Louis, where the buildings are
lettered, he said that it was as if he could hear the voice of
Monsanto calling out to him, saying, ``We are very big and you are
very small.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four years after taking over as chief executive, Shapiro
has refashioned Monsanto as an open and free-thinking company,
executives there say, where bright cubicles are decorated with art
and flowers. In addition to abolishing executives suites, he
instituted flexible work schedules and work locations, including
his own. Each business unit has co-presidents. He has encouraged
free discussion, even something he calls an ``underground
newsletter'' _ a computer site where employees can post their
thoughts about the company anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob's really keen on how people feel when they work,'' said
Nick Rosa, a vice president at Monsanto who has worked with Shapiro
since 1982. ``He believes that the more you trust people, the more
honest and productive they'll be.''
</P>
<P>
   Few outside Monsanto seem to know much about its unconventional
working environment. Many of the Wall Street analysts who cover the
company say they don't know much about the company's corporate
culture or about Shapiro himself, other than that he plays the
Japanese board game Go and that he works out of Chicago, where he
lives with his wife and two children, ages 3 and 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro was born in New York City, the son of a corporate lawyer
turned chief executive. He went to Harvard but said he felt lost
there after he was given sophomore standing during his first year.
In the yearbook for the class of '59, he was one of the few
students not pictured.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I graduated, I wasn't into pictures and yearbooks
and `Fair Harvard' and all that stuff,'' he said. But those years
were important. ``Up until then I had defined myself as someone who
read a lot and got good grades. In those three years I discovered
that wasn't what life was about.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, he discovered folk music, playing the guitar
and hanging out with people like Joan Baez, who was a student at
Boston University. And, he said, he played lots of poker.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro went to Columbia Law School, and later taught law at
Northeastern University in Boston and at the University of
Wisconsin at Madison, where he offered a course on cities and how
they function. It was then, he says, that he came to believe that
the very culture of the cities, their fabric and environment, had
devastating social and emotional consequences for their
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was interested in how to design policies that were
good for people. It was this notion that he later brought to
Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving at Monsanto, though, he was general counsel for
the General Instrument Corp., under his father, who was the chief
executive. There, he said, he fell in love with business. He went
on to become general counsel of Searle, a small pharmaceutical
company in Chicago, which was later bought by Monsanto. From there,
he headed Nutrasweet, then a small unit of Searle, eventually
becoming chief executive of Monsanto in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's about as good a CEO as I've ever seen,'' said William
Ruckelshaus, the chairman of Browning-Ferris Industries and a
longtime Monsanto board member. ``He's a very inclusive type of
manager. He makes the decision, but he encourages and listens hard
to what everyone else has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts question, however, whether Monsanto can remain
Monsanto if the company is acquired. ``If history is any guide,
that cubicle thing may be short-lived,'' said Thomas Lys, a mergers
specialist at Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of
Management.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company's special qualities could survive a merger _
and perhaps even survive Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an expression of Shapiro's philosophy,'' Shapiro
said. ``This is a business philosophy of how you make money in life
sciences. And in a Darwinian world, this culture will prevail.''

FOR FIRST LADY'S VISIT TO NEW YORK, `INTENSE' EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-CLINTONS) 
(sw) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The trip was planned months ago as just another visit
of the first lady to a favorite city. But when Hillary Rodham
Clinton arrives in New York on Wednesday to give speeches, meet
with supporters and tour schools, the visit will instantly be seen
as the first exploratory trip of a potential Senate candidate from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Attention from the news media will rival, if not surpass, that
for a presidential visit, officials said. ``I think this is
probably as intense for us as it's gotten,'' said Marsha Berry,
Mrs. Clinton's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, organizations that do not routinely cover the first
lady's travels _ networks, newsmagazines and the foreign press _
deluged Mrs. Clinton's office with questions about the trip. A
secretary at a school in Queens that Mrs. Clinton planned to visit
on Wednesday morning described the atmosphere there as ``crazy.''
And Laura G. Ross, the head of a fund-raising group that Mrs.
Clinton was scheduled to address at lunch, said the event sold out
two weeks ago at 900 people and that there was still a waiting list
of several hundred.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always a draw, but this is bigger than ever,'' Ms. Ross
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices for the event range from $10,000 to $150. For
$10,000, for example, a donor can participate in a ``round-table
discussion'' with Mrs. Clinton and 49 others before lunch. For
$1,000, the donor gets a picture taken with the first lady. Ms.
Ross said the event had raised more than $500,000 for the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who said two weeks ago that she was giving
``careful thought'' to the possibility of running for the Senate
seat that Daniel Patrick Moynihan will vacate in 2000, planned to
speak on Wednesday morning on arts education at Intermediate School
25 in the Flushing section of Queens, then tour a classroom.
Afterward, she planned to appear at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan
for the fund-raising lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton planned to spend the afternoon in ``private time''
at the Waldorf-Astoria, where she is staying. In the evening she
expected to attend a dinner at the Manhattan home of Jurate
Kazickas and Roger C. Altman, an investment banker who was
President Clinton's deputy Treasury secretary and whose firm bought
The National Enquirer and Star magazine two weeks ago. The dinner
was described as a gathering of 15 people, not a fund-raising
event, that would include business executives and leaders of
nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Mrs. Clinton is to give an address at the
United Nations to commemorate International Women's Day, and on
Thursday afternoon will speak about Women's History Month and
female athletes at the Lab School at the O. Henry Learning Center
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much like all the trips she does where she tries to
highlight issues that are important to families and the general
public,'' Ms. Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   At I.S. 25, Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to release a study by the
President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities describing how
school districts can improve arts education. Community School
District 25 in New York, which includes I.S. 25 and 30 other
schools in northern Queens, is one of eight districts nationwide
that the report singled out as exemplary in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is also considering running for
Senate from New York, said this week that Mrs. Clinton was
highlighting a school program, Project Arts, that he had announced
financing for in his State of the City speech two years ago. He
joked that he hoped she would bring a check for the program from
Washington.

BRAZIL INTERVENES AS INFLATION FEAR SENDS CURRENCY DOWN
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By LARRY ROHTER 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Weakened by uncertainty about revisions
in the government's agreement with the International Monetary Fund
and growing fears of a rise in inflation, the Brazilian currency
continued its slide to a record low against the dollar on Tuesday,
forcing the central bank to intervene for the fourth time in a
week.
</P>
<P>
   The currency, the real, dropped as low as 2.22 to the dollar
before recovering somewhat and settling at 2.16 after the central
bank stepped in. In New York, the real edged up to 2.10 to the
dollar from 2.13 on Monday after falling 8.6 percent in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brazil devalued its currency in mid-January, it has
declined more than 40 percent, leading to sharp increases in prices
of imported goods and forcing the government to raise interest
rates to levels that threaten to suffocate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate cause of the sharp drop in the real's value over
the last two days was the need for Brazilian companies to pay
obligations to foreign creditors. The lenders, because of their
continued concerns about the economic crisis here, have been
unwilling to roll over about $2 billion in bonds and other payments
due this month, and Brazilian debtors have been forced to scramble
to obtain dollars. ``This is not really a run against the real,''
Paulo Ferraz, president of Banco Bozano Simonsen, said Tuesday.
``This is a specific demand for payments of Eurobonds, and once it
is met, I would hope the dollar will begin to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But market analysts said other factors, chiefly a sharp rise in
the rate of inflation, traditionally the Brazilian economy's great
worry, have also played a role in the decline of the real this
week. By official calculation, prices rose 3.61 percent last month,
more than double the 1.79 percent recorded during all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, which as recently as five years ago had been running
above 1,000 percent annually, is expected to increase further in
March and April, as January's devaluation makes the price of
everything from medicine to wheat more expensive. As a result,
interest rates, which already stand at a punishing annual rate of
41 percent, may soon be running behind inflation, increasing the
likelihood they will have to be raised more.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, has exacerbated fear that the recession brought
on by the collapse of the real will be longer and deeper than the
government is willing to acknowledge. Hence, the anxiety about the
precise terms of the new targets for spending cuts and taxes
contained in the revised agreement being negotiated with the IMF _
something made necessary after President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
abandoned the defense of the real in mid-January.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the decision to allow the real to float freely on the
foreign-exchange markets was announced then, the government
indicated that it would no longer intervene to prop up the
currency. The central bank reversed course once the real passed the
symbolic level of 2 to the dollar, but has acted inconsistently in
recent days, encouraging speculators to mount attacks on the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all, what is needed is a more active posture by the
economic team, especially the president of the central bank,'' said
Carlos Kawall, chief economist for Citibank. ``Absent a more
vigorous role as regards exchange policy and other initiatives, the
market will continue'' reacting unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
   The real's recent decline has come despite a statement Monday by
Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, that good news
would soon result from the negotiations with Brazil. The market
``was anticipating a quicker freeing up'' of IMF money and a return
of bank credit ``than we are seeing now,'' Kawall said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, impatience with the IMF and the deep spending
cuts required as part of its $41.5 billion aid package is growing.
Some of Cardoso's closest political allies have joined in the
chorus of complaints, spreading concern that the Brazilian Congress
may not agree to some of the IMF's demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that the government needs to go to the IMF,''
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the president of the Brazilian Senate and
Cardoso's most powerful political associate, said last week. ``But
that doesn't mean the IMF can interfere in national problems, above
all to create difficulties for the poorest sectors in Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   Arminio Fraga, president-designate of the central bank, has been
having acrimonious confirmation hearings in Brasilia. Opposition
senators have interrogated him mostly about his ties to the
financier George Soros, his previous employer. But some questions
have elicited indications that he intends to move ahead with an
austerity program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monetary policy in the next few months will necessarily have
to be characterized by a restrictive slant so long as the
transitory effects of the devaluation have not disappeared,'' Fraga
said on Friday. He warned that ``the next few months are going to
be difficult,'' with unemployment likely to rise and businesses to
go bankrupt.

 &HT;    Gov. Bush gets ready to run
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After months of soul-searching for reasons to
run for his dad's old job, George W. Bush hit upon the same ones he
came up with when he decided to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Tuesday he is convinced he can make a positive
difference for his country without making too much of a negative
difference for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a compelling reason to consider running for
president,'' he said at a news conference outside the Governor's
Mansion. ``For my family and every family in America, I want the
21st century to be prosperous. And I don't want anybody being left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Tuesday's announcement was a political baby step _ Bush
will form an exploratory committee to begin raising money for a
potential candidacy _ the governor left little doubt that he wants
to become the first son of a president to get the top job since
John Quincy Adams in 1825.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what could happen to prevent the exploratory effort from
blossoming into a full-fledged candidacy, Bush said: ``A giant
thud. A huge yawn. That it turns out it was my mother they were
interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Huge yawns and giant thuds greeted the last three Texans who
sought the presidency: Democrat Lloyd Bentsen in 1976, Republican
John Connally in 1980 and Republican Phil Gramm in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On the family front, Bush and wife Laura said they have decided
they can jump into the fishbowl without drowning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along the biggest hesitation is the impact on my
family,'' said Bush, father of twin 17-year-old daughters. ``I have
talked with Laura and the girls, and while there is some natural
concern about the potentially major change in our life, I am
convinced and Laura is convinced that our love for each other is
strong enough and our family is close enough to take whatever life
brings.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated next to her husband, Laura Bush said she is ready to go
down the presidential campaign path again, this time with a husband
instead of a father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows, I think, that I was hesitant about this,'' she
said. ``This is just one step, obviously, just the first step. What
I was hesitant about was the ugliness that we all see of political
life. George and I lived through a 1992 election with his dad. It
was a very miserable year for us, and I dread criticism of my
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' she added, ``I love George and I am very
proud of him. And I know he would make a great president.''
</P>
<P>
   As the news conference ended, Laura Bush talked about the
campaign the way some people talk about going to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prepared for it. I know what it will be like. I've been in
a couple of presidential races before. Not as the wife of the
candidate, but I'm prepared and I know what it is going to be
like,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if she sensed a tone more negative than she
intended, she added, ``Looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Months of speculation
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's step into the race comes after months of private
talks with potential supporters and polls that show him as an early
frontrunner for the GOP nomination. Though some have been
campaigning for years, Bush and former Red Cross President
Elizabeth Dole have topped recent polls by wide margins.
</P>
<P>
   As many Texans suspected, Bush said he made up his mind to head
down the presidential path weeks ago, right around the Jan. 19
inauguration that started his second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to get more comfortable with the idea,'' he said.
``It's a hard decision to make, and I began to feel comfortable
inside. I began to get a sense of peace inside my soul and in my
heart, and I began to think seriously about setting up the
exploratory committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he occasionally drifted into a tone that made a
full-blown candidacy seem like a sure thing _ ``One of these days
I'm going to be in Des Moines'' _ Bush insisted this really is an
exploratory effort to test whether people who have opened their
mouths in support are now willing to open their checkbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to have all the interested people fly down,''
he said of the stream of out-of-staters who have been to the
mansion to talk presidential politics. ``The next step is to
determine whether I can raise money. And that's what we are going
to start doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate goal is working toward a $25 million war chest.
Bush also must decide whether to take federal matching money for
his campaign. That cash comes with strings, including a limit on
campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the current legislative session, which ends May 31, is
his top priority and he has no political travel planned until after
then. The immediate schedule calls for a formal Sunday announcement
of the exploratory committee, which will allow him to raise and
spend money in furtherance of his candidacy, followed by a
pre-announcement tour during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura and I will begin to do some travelling around the
country to meet with people, to listen to their concerns and
explore on our own the prospects of becoming a formal candidate,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dispelling the rumors
</P>
<P>
   In addition to putting the fund-raising machine in motion,
Bush's announcement ended months of speculation that he might skip
the race because of something from his self-titled ``young and
irresponsible'' period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though most people in the political system have long
believed that he would run, there is a persistent rumor in
political circles that family considerations and past sins will
keep him out,'' said University of Virginia political scientist
Larry Sabato. ``And this goes part of the way toward dispelling
those rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said there is nothing in his past that would disqualify
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had there been skeletons that would have destroyed a
candidacy, you'd have found them in 1994 and 1998,'' he said of his
two gubernatorial races.
</P>
<P>
   Texas media only, please
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday news conference initially was intended as a briefing
for Texas reporters in advance of the formal announcement on
Sunday. It grew into a news conference of major proportions, with
about 30 television cameras. The national press, however, was
excluded. Those who showed up were turned away at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a briefing for the Texas media,'' Karen Hughes, Bush's
press secretary, told a CNN crew.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bush: ``I'm sure we did ruffle feathers by excluding the
national media. I respect the national media, but I hope the
national media respects my desire to fulfill a promise I made to
the Texas press corps.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments were occasionally accompanied by shouts from
about 12 people who gathered across Lavaca Street, behind the
mansion, to continue their protest of the state's decision to join
a court challenge of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan reactions
</P>
<P>
   Bush's announcement drew predictably partisan reaction.
Republican Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who would become governor if Bush
becomes president, said it sounds like a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``America needs a leader of his character, conservative vision
and compassionate, unifying philosophy,'' Perry said. ``It's his
decision to make, but a President George W. Bush would be great for
Texas and great for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Au contraire, said Texas Democratic Chairwoman Molly Beth
Malcolm, who declared Bush the wrong man at the wrong time. Despite
Bush's pledge that the current legislative session is his top
priority, Malcolm said, it sounds like Texas is about to have an
absentee governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that people that ran for office give their
total, undivided attention to this great state,'' she said. ``I
certainly doubt he is going to be able to pay the kind of attention
here he needs to in the middle of organizing a presidential
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's announcement came the same day that commentator Pat
Buchanan, a longtime nemesis of the elder George Bush, went to New
Hampshire to announce he will make a third bid for the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his announcement was timed to coincide with Texas
Independence Day, not Buchanan's entry into the race.

   ELECTRONIC SERIAL NUMBERS RAISE PRIVACY CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   From computers to cellular phones to home electronics, everyday
devices and software programs are increasingly embedding telltale
identifying numbers that enable them to interact. That trend is
generating a bitter dispute pitting the interests of security and
convenience against privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups argue that the merger of computers and the
Internet has brought the specter of a new surveillance society. But
a growing alliance of computer industry executives, engineers, law
enforcement officials and scholars contend that absolute anonymity
is not only increasingly difficult to obtain technically but is
also a potential threat to democratic order because of the
possibility of electronic crime and terrorism. ``You already have
zero privacy _ get over it,'' Scott McNealy, the chairman and chief
executive of Sun Microsystems, said recently.

   SINCE BIRTH, EURO HAS FIZZLED
</P>
<P>
   In the two months since the European single currency was
introduced, pretty much the only direction it has moved is down.
The decline has surprised most experts and puzzled the overseers of
the new currency at the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   CAR SALES STRONG IN FEBRUARY

<P>
   Major auto makers reported record sales for February. Ford Motor

   SONY INTRODUCES PLAYSTATION II
</P>

   Making what could be a quantum leap in the march to wed consumer

   BROADCASTER WANTS TO TRY BANKING
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster, wants to go into the

   RETAIL GIANTS POST GOOD PROFITS
</P>
<P>
   The retail giants Federated Department Stores and Dayton Hudson
reported quarterly profits that beat forecasts, aided by the
economy's strength, which spurred sales of home goods and clothing.
Shares of Federated gained 75 cents, to $40.625, while Dayton
Hudson fell $2.25, to $61.437.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER SHARES PULL STOCKS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Stocks ended lower, led by Intel and 3Com, on concern that
waning demand and increased competition will hurt profits in the
computer industry. Nasdaq fell 36.15 points, or 1.6 percent, to
2,259.03. The Dow industrials fell 27.17 points, or three-tenths of
a percent, to 9,297.61. The S.&AMP;P. 500 declined 10.66 points, or
nine-tenths of a percent, to 1,225.50.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 2432, to 942632.
Its yield fell to 5.61 percent, from 5.66 percent on Monday.

 Remember Lucent? Don't Write Off HP's Misfit Measurement Unit  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Don't be so eager to dismiss Hewlett-Packard's laggard measurement
business as the runt.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, sure HP's better-late-than-never decision to emancipate
its core computer business from its disjointed test-and-measurement
businesses should unlock the value of HP's listless shares.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate bump in HP's stock price is most assuredly one of
the obvious benefits to shareholders after the proposed velvet
divorce occurs sometime over the next 12 to 18 months. In fact, HP
jumped &UR;  &LR; 4 percent to $65.63 on the news yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   However, investors should not be so quick to conclude that HP's
proposed carve-off is a turkey when it comes to its measurement
operations. Remember Bell Labs? It was once considered the runt of
Ma Bell's litter when Washington directed the mother-of-all telcos
to bust up its cozy monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the prized offspring were the regional telephone
companies, such as Pacific Bell, which is now a unit of SBC
Communications of San Antonio (formerly Southwestern Bell).
</P>
<P>
   But something funny happened on the way to the Information Age.
Many of the gadgets that dowdy Bell Labs made became integral to
the explosion of the Internet. So, AT&AMP;T repackaged boring Bell Labs
with a slick new name and spun off the once-unrespected division as
a sexy reborn technology company.
</P>
<P>
   Voila, Lucent Technologies was born. And it has made its
long-term holders very happy. If it were not for a 2-for-1 split,
Lucent shares would be trading at about $200, up sizeably from
their April 1996 IPO price of $27.
</P>
<P>
   Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not predicting that HP Test and
Measurement Inc. (or whatever moniker the spin-off adopts) will be
the second coming of Lucent. It's just that Edward ``Ned''
Barnholt, the measurement unit's new chief executive, may be in
position to turn his stepchild into a better investment than most
people realize at this point.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPIN CYCLE &LR; : Speaking of unlocking shareholder value, one of
Street Smarts' favorite targets (pun intended) for a spin-off,
sell-off or some form of divestiture is Dayton Hudson of
Minneapolis. The retailing giant and parent of discount juggernaut
Target Stores and middlebrow also-ran Mervyn's of Hayward, reported
its year-end earnings yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by Target, DH reported that profit from operations
soared 27 percent to 97 cents a share, 7 cents better than the Wall
Street consensus estimate. Despite the stellar showing, DH shares
slipped about 3 percent to $61.88.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET03 (87780 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  As regular readers of this column are aware, Street Smarts thinks
that DH should unload Mervyn's and /or its department store
division to unlock the value of Target, which could then allow DH
shares to perform more in step with those of retail stock superstar
Wal-Mart. (Full disclosure: I have been beating this same drum
since I covered the company for a Chicago publica tion several
years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   In response to a recent column whereby Street Smarts reported
that Kohl's of Wisconsin showed interest in Mervyn's (a story I
stand by), Mervyn's President Bart Butzer suggested that we focus
our coverage on his company's performance.
</P>
<P>
   OK, here goes. Mervyn's pretax profit for the fiscal year ended
on January 30 was $240 million, down 14 percent from the previous
year. In addition, total sales were down about 1 percent for the
fiscal year. Mervyn's comparable sales for stores open a year or
longer _ a key retail measurement _ increased barely 1 percent.
Target's comp-store sales, on the other hand, rose about 6 percent
for the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me, that's hardly evidence of a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a Mervyn's spokeswoman put a positive spin on the
results (Butzer was unavailable for comment), pointing out that
same-store sales for the fourth quarter were up more than 4
percent. And same-store sales growth is what DH chief executive
Robert Ulrich is asking from Butzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with that performance. That's what Dayton
Hudson wants to see from us,'' says Mervyn's spokeswoman Carol
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Mervyn's needs to continuously grow same-store sales
to prove that it is on the right track and worth keeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to meet that commitment,'' Johnson says. ``(Anything)
beyond that would be speculation as to what would become of
Mervyn's.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, nothing was said by DH management regarding
potential divestiture during yesterday's conference call with large
investors and research analysts, according to analysts on the call.

 Workforce Coalition Lashes Out at Cypress CEO  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The head of a community group pushing for greater diversity in
Silicon Valley's workforce yesterday criticized Cypress
Semiconductor CEO T.J. Rodgers' for saying on television that the
Rev. Jesse Jackson was ``like a seagull that flies around leaving
droppings.''
</P>
<P>
   John Templeton, founder of the ad hoc Coalition for Fair
Employment in Silicon Valley, said he was ``appalled'' because
Rodgers' ``scatological'' remark was insulting to Jackson and
African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it crossed the line,'' Templeton said. ``This is the
leading black preacher in the country. I took it as an insult and
would expect any black person who saw it to take it as an insult as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, whose comments were broadcast on KRON-TV during a news
report on Jackson's visit Sunday and Monday to Silicon Valley,
could not immediately be reached for comment. He has a reputation
for being blunt and stirring up controversy.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman, though, said the remark was not meant as a
racial insult, but was a comment about Jackson interfering in
Silicon Valley's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Wing, statewide coordinator for Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition, said he had no comment until he discussed the issue with
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights leader was in the Bay Area to launch a Silicon
Valley version of his Wall Street Project. His Rainbow coalition is
buying small amounts of stock in publicly traded companies as a way
to encourage boards of directors to hire and do business with more
women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers has long contended that Silicon Valley's booming
technology industry is a meritocracy, where talented people of any
race and gender can get ahead.
</P>
<P>
   However, a story in The Chronicle last year revealed that
Cypress' workforce in 1996 was only 3 percent black and 6 percent
Latino. Rodgers told The Chronicle last year, ``We hire the best
people for the job, regardless of race, color or creed, and we find
that we end up with a pretty fair mix of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Templeton was originally upset that KRON-TV chose to air
Rodgers' comment but later said his group would focus its protests
on Cypress Semiconductor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comments that Mr. Rodgers made were quite strong and quite
striking,'' KRON news director Dan Rosenheim said. ``Coming from a
prominent leader of the Silicon Valley business community and head
of a major semiconductor company, I think those comments were very
newsworthy. So we felt it ought to be aired.''

 Cisco Systems Seeks to Build New Campus  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon and Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Cisco Systems, growing so rapidly that it's bursting at the seams,
said it plans to build a $1 billion, 400-acre campus in Coyote
Valley, about 14 miles south of downtown San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The networking company, which has added more than 8,500
employees in the past two years, said it needs more space to
accommodate its growing workforce. The new site could house as many
as 20,000 employees and would double both Cisco's employment
worldwide and its real estate holdings in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're announcing today is really the future growth of
Cisco,'' John Chambers, Cisco president and chief executive, said
at a press conference yesterday at the company's San Jose
headquarters. The expansion is the largest in Cisco's history, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, which makes much of the plumbing that runs the Internet,
has expanded rapidly since it was founded by a husband-and-wife
team in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cisco employs about 17,000 workers worldwide, with about
10,000 in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   As competition in the networking industry heats up, Cisco has
made no secret about its intention to continue growing. The company
has announced hundreds of new hires almost every quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco currently operates from 40 buildings on about 300 acres in
San Jose but is rapidly running out of room. Cisco officials said
the company had been looking to expand for several months and
settled on Coyote Valley because of its proximity to the main
campus on Tasman Drive in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers said the new site may also provide some transportation
and housing relief to employees. Besides being adjacent to the
Caltrain route, the location is closer to affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the new campus is contingent upon approval from
the city of San Jose, which needs to give Cisco building permits
and pay to upgrade roads and other infrastructure in what is now a
mostly rural area. Neither Cisco nor the city would disclose how
much the company plans to contribute toward those costs.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of CISCO03 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Approvals may be required from the Santa Clara Valley Water
District, the U.S. Department of Fish and Game (because of a nearby
creek) as well as the city zoning board, planning commission and
the San Jose City Council, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to make this happen in the near future,''
said San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales. Once San Jose gives its approval,
the campus should be complete within three to five years _ not a
moment too soon for a company that is experiencing explosive
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, which makes routers and switches that transmit data
across the Internet, has been growing rapidly through expansions
and internal hires. Cisco has acquired more than 30 companies over
the past several years and is expected to buy additional technology
companies in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company that plays to win and that's what they've
done,'' said Michael Cristinziano, senior vice president and equity
analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Cristinziano and others expect Cisco's revenue to grow by at
least 30 percent over the next few years, boosted by sales of
networking equipment to service providers, such as telephone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies and other businesses are looking to networking
companies like Cisco to help manage their corporate voice and data
networks. The amount of data traveling across networks now outpaces
the amount of voice traffic. Companies want to shift voice and data
onto a single network so it can be managed more efficiently. Cisco
just happens to have the technology and the products to help
achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, such as Lucent Technologies and Northern
Telecom, are also developing that technology and going after the
same customers, but Cisco has managed to grab significant market
share.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of CISCO03 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Cisco has really grown their revenues and profits much faster
than their peers,'' said Megan Hackett, senior technology analyst
with S&AMP;P Equity Group in New York. ``The company has been superior
in executing its business strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco has also been helped by the popularity of the Internet,
which is powered by much of Cisco's equipment. That has boosted
Cisco from obscurity to a company that's now considered one of the
computer world's Big Three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cisco has achieved the status of a Microsoft or an Intel,''
Cristinziano said. ``They are one of the real leading companies.
Now they're even starting to advertise on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Cisco is attempting to create name recognition and
the addition of a new campus are signs that the company is geared
for battle, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The new campus) is a strong statement as to how much they've
grown and how much they intend to grow,'' Hackett said. ``Cisco is
definitely a company arming itself for this new market.''

 Editors: Note ``UNDERSCORE'' in Web address should be
replaced  with underline   More Tax Tips for Small Firms 
 &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Is it necessary to keep receipts, canceled checks and
other records for business expenses under $75? Some small-business
friends say you don't have to but when I called the IRS, the
official line is you need to have documentation for even the
smallest expense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  It is true that many companies don't require receipts
for small expenditures, like $10 for office supplies. But the
Internal Revenue Service can disallow any deduction you don't have
a receipt for, says CPA Rich Gunn of the San Francisco firm Burr
Pilger &AMP; Mayer. Nevertheless, many businesses establish a cutoff of
$50 or $75, he says, because they figure it's not cost effective to
track and maintain the records for every paper clip and plastic
pen. Ultimately, not maintaining all records is based on your level
of risk and willingness to lose an unsubstantiated deduction if
confronted by an eagle-eyed auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If you are traveling on business, instead of keeping
records of your meal expenses and deducting the actual cost, you
can generally deduct a standard meal allowance ranging from $30 to
$42 depending on where and when you travel. For more information on
business travel expenses and restrictions, refer to Tax Topic 511,
or Publication 463, Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses.
Federal business tax information is available online at
( &LR; www.irs.ustreas.gov/ &LR;   &LR; prod/bus(UNDERSCORE)info &LR; ).

<P>
   Road Worrier
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband is self-employed and to cut down on the cost of
flying and renting a car, he often drives from San Francisco to Los
Angeles. Should he take a standard mileage deduction or deduct the
cost of gasoline and actual expenses?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not sure how your husband values his time, or whether he
charges clients for his road work. In any case, there are two ways
to account for business travel: You can take actual expense plus
depreciation, or you can take the standard mileage deduction of 31
cents per mile. Do the computation both ways for the entire year to
see which yields the higher deduction.
</P>
<P>
   You must stick with one method to figure your annual costs,
according to CPA Rich Gunn. No deductions are allowed for personal
use of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the total deduction and depreciation you can take on a car
you first used for business in 1998 cannot exceed $3,160 unless it
is a ``clean fuel'' vehicle. Check the section 179 deduction at the
IRS Web site mentioned above.

</P>
<P>
   Welfare Benefits
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the tax benefits for hiring people coming off of
welfare?
</P>
<P>
   A: Businesses can definitely do well by doing good. The
welfare-to-work credit lets companies that hire qualified long-term
family assistance recipients deduct $3,500 of the first $10,000 of
qualified wages paid each worker against their tax liabilities in
the first year. In the second year, they can offset half of the
first $10,000 of qualified wages directly against their taxes. The
program applies to those who begin work after Dec. 31, 1997, and
before July 1 of this year.
</P>
<P>
   To get the credits, companies must hire workers through programs
certified by the IRS and remember to apply for credit within 30
days of hiring the employee. If you wait until you file your tax
return, Gunn warns, you're too late. Check the IRS tax guide for
small business, or Form 8861.
</P>
<P>
   Vexing Vacation Rules
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the changes in deducting vacation pay or other
employee benefits?
</P>
<P>
   A: Employers who use the accrual method of accounting used to be
able to deduct vacation and severance pay even if employees didn't
receive it until 2-1/2 months after the end of the tax year. Now
employers are limited from deducting these expenses until the year
they actually occur. For tax years ending after July 22, 1998,
vacation and severance benefits are not considered ``paid'' until
the tax year the employees receive them.
</P>
<P>
   Self-Employment
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have recently made the leap from working for a company to
being self-employed. What are the main tax consequences?
</P>
<P>
   A: The two biggest problems for those who used to work for
someone else and now work for themselves is ``not realizing the
amount of taxes they must pay now that they are self-employed and
not making estimated tax payments,'' says San Francisco CPA Bruce
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers accustomed to having Social Security and Medicare
taxes (6.2 percent and 1.45 percent of gross wages, respectively)
taken out of their paychecks automatically often fail to realize
the impact of the self-employment tax.
</P>
<P>
   They must pay about 12 to 13 percent of their net profit in
self-employment taxes in addition to federal income taxes (15
percent to 39.6 percent) and California taxes (1 percent to 9.3
percent). To avoid underpayment, a self-employed person must pay
100 percent of the prior year's tax or 90 percent of the current
year's tax in four equal installments due by April 15, June 15,
September 15, and January 15. For those whose adjusted gross income
exceeds $150,000 on a joint return or $75,000 for a spouse who
files separately, the 100 percent is replaced by 105 percent for
the 1999 tax year.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of GROW03 (31777 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  So what do you do if you had a good job and paid a lot of taxes
last year but now face an uncertain future in the ranks of the
self-employed? Instead of using the above formulas, you are allowed
to use ``the annualized income method'' and make four installment
payments based on actual income, expenses, deductions, credits,
etc. for the periods ending March 31, May 31, August 31 and
December 31. However, Hall cautions, these calculations can be long
and tedious.
</P>
<P>
   Correction
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five percent of health insurance premiums for the
self-employed are deductible for 1998. That is up from 40 percent
in 1997, not 25 percent as I suggested in last week's column. For
California taxes, the deductible amount remained at 40 percent in
1998.

 Entrepreneurial Double Dipping  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The father-and-son team of John and Tom Heffernan liked Gelato
Classico so much they bought the company _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   Retired executive John Heffernan first bought the San Francisco
maker of Italian-style ice cream when it was a little two-shop
business. He and Tom built the business and sold out to
Baskin-Robbins, which was itself part of a much larger British
conglomerate that also operated Dunkin' Donuts and the Hiram Walker
liquor business.
</P>
<P>
   But like many big companies that diverge from their main
corporate menu, the new owners messed with the successful formula
and ultimately lost their appetite for running the business.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Tom Heffernan stepped in to buy it back at a bargain
price.
</P>
<P>
   Many entrepreneurs buy and build businesses and then sell out to
a corporate giant for a sweet price. But few get to buy them back.
And even fewer redeem their enterprises for less than they sold
them for in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known local example of entrepreneurial double dipping
is Charles Schwab, who sold the discount brokerage bearing his name
to BankAmerica Corp. in 1983 for $57 million. Four years later, he
bought it back in a deal that cost $328 million. Today, the company
is worth close to $30 billion, or nearly 100 times as much, and
Schwab's personal stake is worth about $3.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Caffe Classico, as it is now called, is a
pip-squeak, but its story illustrates the promise _ and perils _ of
building a business.
</P>
<P>
   The company began to take shape in 1976 when Charles Boles, a
local glider flight instructor and tow-plane pilot, was looking for
a way to give his income a lift. By chance, he heard about a pair
of Italian gelato-making machines and agreed to pay $7,000 over two
years for them.
</P>
<P>
   By 1979, Gelato operated two stores in San Francisco. Its creamy
vanilla, coppa mista and other ice creams and fruit sorbets were
creaming the competition in taste tests, and there were lines out
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Enter John Heffernan, who had recently wrapped up an executive
career at the Kaiser family of companies and then managed an Amazon
jungle project for world-class entrepreneur Daniel Ludwig. Infected
by the startup bug, Heffernan saw Gelato as a cool opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People called all the time and wanted me to reveal my secrets
over the phone,'' Boles recalled. ``Or they wanted to buy the
business for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Heffernan was different. ``He was gentlemanly, professional
and persistent,'' said Boles. After a few months of negotiations,
Heffernan agreed to pay Boles' asking price of $309,000 _ about
what it made in annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in heaven,'' Boles remembers. ``This was the first time
I had money in the bank and freedom. It was wonderful to be paid
for all your troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   While Boles took off for southern France for a couple of years,
John and Tom Heffernan began to grow the business, boosting
manufacturing capacity and developing franchises. Then in 1985, the
Heffernans began adding other attractions, starting with espresso
and other drinks, then pastries and soup, salads and sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that a retail store that didn't open until noon
and sold only gelato couldn't have peak sales throughout the day,''
explained current President Tom Heffernan, 36. To better fit the
new concept of a European sidewalk cafe, the company changed its
name to Caffe Classico from Gelato Classico.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the company's pricey ice cream and concept of offering
other products to draw traffic and spread expenses from morning to
night attracted the attention of Baskin-Robbins. With about 3,500
domestic outlets, Baskin-Robbins had pretty much saturated the
market and was looking for new concepts, Tom Heffernan said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GELATO03 (91286 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  As a sign of its seriousness, the ice cream giant reportedly paid
an acquisition search firm a fee of $2 million to find just the
right opportunity. John Heffernan wasn't looking for a buyer, but
the takeover offer of about 100 times earnings was ``too good to
refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   After nine months of negotiations, Caffe Classico, which had 31
stores at the time, agreed to sell out for an undisclosed price.
Baskin-Robbins and its corporate parent, Allied Domecq Plc, also
committed about $12 million to grow the business, according to Tom
Heffernan. ``They were talking about having 1,000 retail stores,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners quickly invested about $1 million in new ice
cream-making machinery and coffee roasting equipment to fuel the
expansion. That was fine with Tom Heffernan, who remained in charge
of production and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   But Baskin-Robbins also expanded the number of managers from
three to a dozen, and Heffernan said the amount spent for
management salaries soared from about $200,000 a year to $300,000 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners also elected to double the size of new stores to
about 1,200 to 1,400 square feet, which tripled the capital
investment to about $300,000 per unit. And also opened in
higher-rent locations.
</P>
<P>
   Heffernan was alarmed and offended by the meddling with Caffe
Classico's nonbureaucratic, low-overhead strategy. Looking back at
Baskin-Robbin's fat purchase price, he wonders, ``Why pay so much
for something you are going to change?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Allied put Baskin-Robbins and Caffe Classico under the
wing of its Dunkin' Donuts division. That change made it even more
clear to Heffernan that his business was just a crumb on the plate
of Allied, which aside from food is the world's second-largest
liquor-maker.
</P>
<P>
   For about a year, Heffernan said he was told to sign no new
leases or sell any new franchises, in other words, ``to stay
still.'' It was great for his golf game, but not his psyche. ``I
realized they will sell it or shut it down,'' he said. ``But in
either case, it's not good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   So Heffernan approached a senior director of Dunkin' Donuts, a
man he respected who had started out cutting doughnuts when there
were only four stores. ``I said `(Caffe Classico) is losing money,
so let me take it off your hands,''' Heffernan recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate owners agreed to sell. The price has not been
disclosed, but Heffernan insists it was well below what
Baskin-Robbins had paid and invested in new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   John Heffernan, who has invested in real estate and the stock
market since he was bought out eight years ago, said that when
Baskin-Robbins bought Caffe Classico in 1991, his lawyer told him
he ``shouldn't be surprised if they would later offer the company
back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is apparently somewhat common when a very large company
acquires a very small one, they fail with their effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, Tom Heffernan has quietly returned to
practices that made Caffe Classico successful &UR;  &LR; at the company's
unmarked manufacturing plant and office off of Seventh Street in
San Francisco. He also has altered strategy. &UR;  &LR; Caffe Classico is
adding a few stores in Arizona, Southern California and elsewhere.
But adding franchise outlets is no longer the principal way to make
fuller use of the company's underutilized ice cream-making and
coffee-roasting machinery.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Heffernan is expanding sales to hotels, restaurants
and other retailers. Customers include Hyatt Hotels, restaurateurs
Jeremiah Tower and Wolfgang Puck, and recently Nordstrom cafes. The
company also has talked with United Airlines about serving its
gelato to first-class customers, and it may license some chain
stores to put gelato freezer cabinets and neon signs in their
stores.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of GELATO03 (91286 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  With its new wholesaling efforts, Heffernan said the company had

 New Rules Try To Bring Order to Tracking Web Ads  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
In a big step toward imposing order on the wild and woolly world of
Internet advertising, an industry group yesterday published
voluntary guidelines for tracking the viewership of Web ads.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Web sites, ad-serving networks like DoubleClick and
third-party tracking services such as Media Metrix employ vastly
different methods and technologies to measure the viewership of a
given Web ad. The varying results frustrate advertisers, who need a
reliable system for evaluating who is seeing their messages and how
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the top reasons advertisers aren't putting more
money into the Web,'' said Jim Spaeth, a member of the FAST (Future
of Advertising Stakeholders) Steering Committee, which developed
the guidelines (posted at  &LR; www.fastinfo.org &LR; ). ``There's really
been chaos in measurement.''
</P>
<P>
   The new protocol is designed to standardize audience tracking
across the Web and also bring it in line with conventional media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is comparability,'' said Spaeth. ``When a media
planner sits down to do a plan for the brand, he looks at outdoor
and radio and magazines and matchbook covers and online. If the
data for all of them don't reflect the same comparative value, the
planner has no way of judging'' which media will meet his
viewership goals.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed standards catch on, Web ad measurements should
be accurate within 5 percent, according to FAST. A 45-day comment
period on the protocol began yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the initiative's key elements is its definition of the
impression, the basic unit of Web audience measurement.
</P>
<P>
   FAST defined an impression as an ``opportunity to see,'' which
means that the ad appeared on a page that was viewed by a Web
surfer, even if the visitor did not necessarily see the ad. For
example, if an ad appears at the bottom of a page and the visitor
never scrolls to the bottom, it is still counted as an impression.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chose this criterion, although inexact, because it
is used by other media. Television viewership, for example, is
based simply on whether the tube is turned on, not on whether
anyone is actually watching it.
</P>
<P>
   The FAST standards also address one of the biggest hurdles in
counting impressions, which is caused by a process called
``caching.''
</P>
<P>
   Caching happens when elements of a Web site are automatically
stored in a computer's memory to make downloading quicker on the
next visit. But most Web trackers can't measure the later visits.
This glitch causes a significant undercounting of ad and site
viewership.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of NETADS03 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  To ensure that visits using cache memory are counted, the FAST
group proposed that every Internet ad be embedded with a code to
alert the site where it appears that it has been viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Briggs, a vice president of Millward Brown Interactive, a
Web marketing research firm, said the guidelines are important
because they ``make the ground rules clear.''
</P>
<P>
   But bigger questions remain about the effectiveness of Web ads,
he said. ``What the senior marketing people are hung up on is
whether (the Web) is the most effective way to reach consumers and
how it can be used to build relationships with consumers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   FAST is supported by the Advertising Research Foundation, which
Spaeth chairs; the Internet Advertising Bureau; and major
advertiser and ad agency trade associations.

BLACK FARMERS ARE DIVIDED ON SETTLEMENT OVER RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., name Stephon in 3rd graf is CQ) 
(HLW) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A split emerged in court on Tuesday among a group
of black farmers who had sued the federal government charging that
the Department of Agriculture had discriminated against them in
denying or delaying approval of loans.
</P>
<P>
   At an emotional hearing in federal district court before Judge
Paul Friedman, a number of black farmers urged that the
$400-million settlement reached in January in a class action
lawsuit be rejected as inadequate and failing to root out racism
within the Agriculture Department's loan program. Among those
dissenting from the settlement was Timothy Pigford, a North
Carolina farmer whose original complaint led to the class action
suit and for whom the case, Pigford vs. Glickman, is named.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no meaningful relief that talks about systemic change
in the department,'' said Stephon Bowens, a lawyer who represents
some of the black farmers who dissented from the settlement. ``All
of us here agree that there are systemic problems and that they're
pervasive.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, which could cost the government at least
$400 million, black farmers who say they were discriminated against
by federal farm loan officials could receive damage awards of up to
$50,000 that would be virtually free of federal taxes. The
settlement also called for the Agriculture Department to forgive
any outstanding direct loans it made to black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Tuesday's hearing was a three-cornered affair with
Justice Department lawyers and those representing the 13 original
plaintiffs teaming up to fend off complaints from other black
farmers who said the cash settlement was too meager and that the
deal did not address the problem of racism within the Agriculture
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the farmers say Agriculture Department policies have
shrunk the number of black farmers from a high of 925,710 in 1920
to fewer than 20,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs and the government argued that the
settlement was one of the best deals ever negotiated in a class
action discrimination suit. They said that the $50,000 award was
larger than the average of $20,000 that was paid to Japanese
Americans who were interned during World War II, and more than the
$37,000 awarded to victims of the infamous Tuskegee experiment in
which unsuspecting blacks were injected with the syphilis virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case, this proposed settlement represents a watershed for
justice for blacks in places like Alabama and Georgia,'' said J.L.
Walnut, a lawyer representing the original plaintiffs who
negotiated the deal. ``It's not the end. It's just the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of black farmers _ a few in suits, a few in bib
overalls, most in open neck casual shirts _ and their supporters
squeezed into Friedman's courtroom. They took up every seat,
including those in the jury box, and leaned against walnut-paneled
walls under gilt-framed portraits of white men and women who were
former judges. Most of those in court appeared to be against the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman cast aside the usual court decorum and permitted
spectators to emit the occasional ``Amen!'' or break into applause
when they agreed with a speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also allowed non-lawyers to speak, including the Rev.
Joseph Lowery, the former head of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference who supported the agreement, but asked for some modest
changes. Lowery and other speakers at times brought the emotion and
cadence of Southern Baptist preachers to the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for a change,'' said one of the dissenters, Mattie
Mack, a farmer from Brandenburg, Ky., who at one point wiped tears
away from her checks. ``Change the policy. Let the farmers be free.
That's what the Lord wants for us, to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman did not give any indication of how soon he would rule.
But throughout Tuesday's proceedings, he gave broad hints that some
of the objections that were raised about the settlement were beyond
the scope of his authority to fix. For example, he noted that he
agreed with some of the problems with how the Agriculture
Department runs its loan program, specifically the amount of power
it delegates to local county agricultural committees. But he added
that such changes required political, not legal solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the Congress,'' he said. ``I'm not a state
legislature. I'm not the secretary of agriculture. There are things
I can do and pressure that I can bring to bear. But I think
everybody has to understand that all I can do is approve the
settlement of the lawsuit or not approve the settlement of the
lawsuit.''

PAT ROBERTSON IN PHONE BANKING VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Fla., Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster who built a fortune
from businesses affiliated with his ministry and ran for president
in 1988, now wants to go into the banking business.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and the Bank of Scotland applied for a charter to
operate a new national bank that will have no branches, but will
instead deal with customers by telephone and mail, as the Bank of
Scotland already does in Britain. The same model is used for
dealing with donors to Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network
and his political arm, the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The bank hopes to begin accepting deposits in three or four
months and to issue credit cards and mortgages later, said Tom
Smellie, a spokesman for the Bank of Scotland. The new bank has not
been named, Smellie said, but it will not include either Scotland
or Robertson's name in the title.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, the founder and chairman of the Christian Coalition,
will be ``a very significant minority shareholder'' in the bank and
will be chairman of its American holding company, said C.A. Volder
III, a spokesman for Robertson Financial Services, the unit that is
investing in the new bank.
</P>
<P>
   Several banking experts said the arrangement could be highly
successful if it tapped even a small part of the vast audience that
regularly tunes into Robertson's daily religious and news broadcast
program, ``The 700 Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Volder said the bank would not advertise on ``The 700 Club'' and
that neither the program's mailing list nor the Christian
Coalition's would be used to solicit bank business. ``Of course the
fact that he is endorsing the product is important,'' Volder said,
``and his co-host may say, `Dr. Robertson, I hear you are going
into the banking business,' and ask him about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the bank, which is not expected to face major
obstacles to regulatory approval, would be a natural extension of
Robertson's existing operations, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, he is a bank on the deposit side already,'' said
Seamus McMahon of First Manhattan Consulting Group, which advises
financial institutions on marketing. ``He is one of the biggest
fund-raisers in the U.S. between his religious, political and
charitable interests. Although he will be going after the same
people, he is trying to get a bigger share of their wallets. So
today he may get $50 or $150 as a gift, but he is looking to get
$2,000 and $3,000 and $4,000 in deposits.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hartz, chief operating officer of Security First Network
Bank, which operates over the Internet and has one office, in
Atlanta, said that ``not having brick and mortar is a great
advantage.'' A big expense in operating a bank, he added, is simply
getting the word out. ``If you are Citibank with its phenomenal
branch network, you just drop brochures in all the branches to tell
people how to reach you,'' Hartz said. ``Bank of Scotland can
accomplish this by teaming with Robertson, who has a pretty strong
followership.''

<P>
   The idea for the deal grew out of a business loan that Robertson
sought last June from the Bank of Scotland, which has $4 billion of
commercial loans in the United States. He learned that the bank had
attracted about 800,000 customers to its telephone business, which
it started in 1997 in partnership with J. Sainsbury, the big
British grocery store chain.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon and others said that Robertson's high public profile and
polarizing reputation could be a liability for domestic banks with
established names, but not for a foreign bank seeking to enter the
U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Robertson has made remarks that have drawn
complaints from gay activists and members of other minority groups.
Last year, for example, Robertson took note of banners welcoming
gay people to theme parks in Orlando, Fla., and said: ``I would
warn Orlando that you're right in the way of some serious
hurricanes, and I don't think I'd be waving those flags in God's
face if I were you.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's fortune rests on his creation of the Family Channel,
which was spun out of the Christian Broadcasting Network and sold
in 1997 to Fox Television for $1.9 billion.

JONES APPAREL TO ACQUIRE NINE WEST FOR ALMOST $900 MILLION IN CASH
AND STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jones Apparel Group Inc., a leading women's clothing
company, said Tuesday night that it would acquire Nine West Group,
one of the nation's largest shoe companies, in a deal valued at
nearly $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, worth $26 a share in cash and stock for Nine West's
shareholders, will combine two giants that market women's retail
apparel to many of the same customers: women who are willing to pay
moderate to high prices to fill their closets.
</P>
<P>
   It will also force Jones Apparel, a New York-based company that
sells suits, dresses and sportswear under such brands as Jones New
York and Evan Picone, to quickly master the business of footwear.
Jones will also take on problems now faced by Nine West, including
slowing sales and an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission
into the company's pricing practices.
</P>
<P>
   According to the companies, Nine West, which will be operated as
a separate unit, will get a new chairman when the deal closes: Mark
J. Schwartz, the president of Palladin Captial Group, a leveraged
buyout firm, and a member of Jones' board, will replace Nine West's
chairman, Jerome Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who founded Nine West with Vincent Camuto in 1977, will
become a consultant to Nine West, the companies said. It was not
clear whether Camuto, now Nine West's chief executive, will keep
his title. The companies' statement said only that Camuto ``will
continue to be actively involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Schwartz said that he believed Nine West
had already begun to reverse its disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see strong positve trends in their business,'' Schwartz
said. ``Customers are responding very positively to new spring
product. Positive steps have and will continue to be taken to
improve the operating performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But before the companies' announcement was made, some Wall
Street analysts who cover Jones Apparel said they had concerns
about a potential merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't make sense,'' said one Wall Street analyst who
would talk only on the condition of anonymity. ``Other than sharing
the same customer base, the strategic benefits to Jones are not
obvious, given that their background is in apparel and their
knowledge of footwear is limited.''
</P>
<P>
   The analyst said the business of selling footwear was much more
complicated and difficult than the business of selling apparel.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came hours after regulators halted trading of
the companies' stock because of rumors of the pending merger. The
last price for Nine West was $22.8125.
</P>
<P>
   But while the price of Nine West's stock has risen in the last
two weeks on rumors of a merger, Jones Apparel's shares have been
slipping. Jones' stock price was $25.9375 on Tuesday when trading
was halted, down $1.375 from Monday's closing price and down $4.125
from a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, each Nine West share will be acquired for 0.5011
of a Jones share and $13 in cash, adding up to $26 a share. The
cash and stock portion of the deal will total about $885 million,
and Jones will also assume Nine West's hefty debt, making the
overall obligation about $1.4 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The transaction is expected to close by the end of June and will
require approval of Nine West stockholders and antitrust
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have long sold their merchandise in large
department stores. But in recent years, Nine West has also begun
selling shoes in its own retail stores. The shoe company now has
more than 1,000 retail stores in the United States and another 169
stores in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Susan B. Silverstein, an securities analyst who covers Nine West
for Nationsbanc Montgomery, said one question the companies must
answer was what they would do with those stores. It might be
difficult for Jones to market its clothing in the current stores
because of the shoe stores' small size, and so the companies might
decide to close some stores, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West, which is based in White Plains, was once a darling
among retail stocks, selling shoes under brands like Enzo
Angiolini, Easy Spirit and Bandolino. But sales have slowed in the
last three years, and the stock price fell in May 1997 when the
company announced that securities regulators were investigating its
financial reporting practices.
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, executives of NIne West announced that
regulators had told them they had ended the investigation and did
not plan to take any action.
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Trade Commission is currently investigating the
shoe company's pricing practices. And in January, lawyers filed a
lawsuit against the company on behalf of millions of women who have
purchased Nine West shoes at large department stores, contending
that the company conspired with the stores to fix prices illegally.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second major acquisition in six months for Jones
Apparel. In September, the company said it was buying the clothing
maker Sun Apparel Inc., which holds the license for Polo Jeans Co.
clothing, for $212 million in cash and stock. That purchase added
to the lines of clothing that Jones already made that are marketed
under the label of Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Jones reported 1998 earnings that were better than
expected and up 30 percent from 1997.

PAT ROBERTSON IN PHONE BANKING VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Fla., Great Britain)  (Duplication warning: Also moved in `f' category) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster who built a fortune
from businesses affiliated with his ministry and ran for president
in 1988, now wants to go into the banking business.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and the Bank of Scotland applied for a charter to
operate a new national bank that will have no branches, but will
instead deal with customers by telephone and mail, as the Bank of
Scotland already does in Britain. The same model is used for
dealing with donors to Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network
and his political arm, the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The bank hopes to begin accepting deposits in three or four
months and to issue credit cards and mortgages later, said Tom
Smellie, a spokesman for the Bank of Scotland. The new bank has not
been named, Smellie said, but it will not include either Scotland
or Robertson's name in the title.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, the founder and chairman of the Christian Coalition,
will be ``a very significant minority shareholder'' in the bank and
will be chairman of its American holding company, said C.A. Volder
III, a spokesman for Robertson Financial Services, the unit that is
investing in the new bank.
</P>
<P>
   Several banking experts said the arrangement could be highly
successful if it tapped even a small part of the vast audience that
regularly tunes into Robertson's daily religious and news broadcast
program, ``The 700 Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Volder said the bank would not advertise on ``The 700 Club'' and
that neither the program's mailing list nor the Christian
Coalition's would be used to solicit bank business. ``Of course the
fact that he is endorsing the product is important,'' Volder said,
``and his co-host may say, `Dr. Robertson, I hear you are going
into the banking business,' and ask him about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the bank, which is not expected to face major
obstacles to regulatory approval, would be a natural extension of
Robertson's existing operations, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, he is a bank on the deposit side already,'' said
Seamus McMahon of First Manhattan Consulting Group, which advises
financial institutions on marketing. ``He is one of the biggest
fund-raisers in the U.S. between his religious, political and
charitable interests. Although he will be going after the same
people, he is trying to get a bigger share of their wallets. So
today he may get $50 or $150 as a gift, but he is looking to get
$2,000 and $3,000 and $4,000 in deposits.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hartz, chief operating officer of Security First Network
Bank, which operates over the Internet and has one office, in
Atlanta, said that ``not having brick and mortar is a great
advantage.'' A big expense in operating a bank, he added, is simply
getting the word out. ``If you are Citibank with its phenomenal
branch network, you just drop brochures in all the branches to tell
people how to reach you,'' Hartz said. ``Bank of Scotland can
accomplish this by teaming with Robertson, who has a pretty strong
followership.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the deal grew out of a business loan that Robertson
sought last June from the Bank of Scotland, which has $4 billion of
commercial loans in the United States. He learned that the bank had
attracted about 800,000 customers to its telephone business, which
it started in 1997 in partnership with J. Sainsbury, the big
British grocery store chain.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon and others said that Robertson's high public profile and
polarizing reputation could be a liability for domestic banks with
established names, but not for a foreign bank seeking to enter the
U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Robertson has made remarks that have drawn
complaints from gay activists and members of other minority groups.
Last year, for example, Robertson took note of banners welcoming
gay people to theme parks in Orlando, Fla., and said: ``I would
warn Orlando that you're right in the way of some serious
hurricanes, and I don't think I'd be waving those flags in God's
face if I were you.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's fortune rests on his creation of the Family Channel,
which was spun out of the Christian Broadcasting Network and sold
in 1997 to Fox Television for $1.9 billion.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They cause traffic jams of epic proportions. They
hold so many Manhattan fund-raisers that even their Democratic
allies complain. They have endorsed policies that have infuriated
labor unions, hospital officials, advocates for the poor,
immigrants and, oh yes, Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   So why is it that Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton seem so
popular in New York?
</P>
<P>
   That is a question many New Yorkers may be asking themselves
these days as they watch Mrs. Clinton's very public exploration of
whether to run for the U.S. Senate from New York next year.
</P>
<P>
   They may also be pondering the question as they sit in midtown
traffic awaiting Mrs. Clinton's motorcade to pass Wednesday and
Thursday. The first lady is in town to deliver speeches before a
women's political group and the United Nations, meet with local
Democratic supporters and tour public schools in Queens and
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the idea that New Yorkers would embrace a former
governor of Arkansas and his Illinois-born wife still seems a bit
improbable. Neither has lived or worked in New York, and except for
occasional excursions to Manhattan or the Hamptons, they have not
even vacationed here much. Most of their visits have been to
campaign or to raise money. And they have feuded with a host of
local officials, including the Democratic senior senator, Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring next year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet their connection to New York is strong for a range of
reasons, including their deep base of support among major
Democratic voting groups, the large number of New Yorkers in their
inner circle, widespread distrust of their conservative opponents
and the sense among some people that they radiate New York-style
panache and sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus of New York pollsters say both Clintons' ratings in
New York state tend to be several points higher than nationwide.
Clinton's job approval ratings in New York have been hovering in
the 60-percent range for more than a year now. And recent polls
show Mrs. Clinton scoring between 60 and 70 percent favorable
ratings statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Voters seem to respect her even in traditionally Republican
strongholds in the suburbs and upstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers like the Clintons,'' said John Zogby, a pollster
from Utica. ``Period.''
</P>
<P>
   The clearest reason is that New York is a Democratic state _
registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a ratio of 3 to 2 _
and the Clintons, despite their many scandals, have been the
country's most successful Democratic political couple in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   But it is more than that, political analysts assert. New York,
they say, has higher concentrations of the major voting groups that
are the Clintons' most ardent supporters nationwide: professional
women, homosexuals, Jews and black and Hispanic residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are groups that are important to the Democratic Party
nationally,'' said Philip Friedman, a Democratic public relations
consultant in New York. ``But they are absolutely central to the
New York state Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of those groups were big fans of the Clintons during the
early years of the administration. But through politics and
policies, the Clintons have won them over. Many Irish-Americans, a
major New York voting bloc that is no longer reliably Democratic,
like Clinton for his role in helping to broker peace in Northern
Ireland, while Jewish-Americans have come to view the
administration as a stalwart defender of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And a preponderance of blacks view Clinton as not only
sympathetic to their concerns about racism, but also
extraordinarily in tune with their culture, black politicians and
intellectuals say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton is functionally an African-American politician,''
said Manning Marable, the director of African-American Studies at
Columbia University, noting that the president gets higher approval
ratings among blacks than many black officials.
</P>
<P>
   But will the administration, and Clinton's, high job ratings rub
off on Mrs. Clinton if she runs for the Senate? Marable says yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a general perception that she is to his left,'' he
said. ``And that is just fine. Because ideologically, black
politics is social democratic. There is a deep belief in state
intervention to redress social problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The same may not be true with other groups. Mrs. Clinton may be
less trusted by Jews because of her open support for a Palestinian
state. Wall Street barons who like the administration's economic
policies may be uncomfortable with Mrs. Clinton's more expansive
view of government. Centrist Democrats and Republicans may view her
as too liberal on crime or social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is identified ideologically with the left,'' said Mitchell
Moss, the director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York
University. ``That helps her in New York City, and it mobilizes her
core constituency. But New York state has not been electing
liberals for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and some pollsters also say that the moment Mrs.
Clinton becomes a candidate, her poll numbers will drop as she is
pressured to explain her positions in detail and demonstrate her
understanding of New York, a place she has never lived. State law
requires only that she be a resident as of Election Day next year
to seek the Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Politics aside, the Clintons clearly have a social affinity for
the city, one that many New Yorkers relish. There was the whirlwind
birthday party for their daughter, Chelsea, a couple of years ago,
complete with stops performances on Broadway. And there were the
visits to the Hamptons, featuring the omnipresent shoulder-rubbing
with society and Hollywood types.
</P>
<P>
   But what amazes some analysts is the fact that the Clintons have
received such loyal support from core Democratic groups despite
having taken positions that have angered those groups on numerous
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Many blacks objected vehemently to the 1994 crime bill that
expanded the federal death penalty and established mandatory
sentences for many crimes. Black and immigrant politicians in New
York were also furious with the president for signing the sweeping
welfare bill in 1996 that sharply curtailed benefits.
</P>
<P>
   New York hospital officials perennially fight proposed
administration cuts in health care spending. Most labor unions
hated the North American Free Trade Act, which the president
championed. Gays were deeply disappointed in 1996 when he signed
legislation allowing states to outlaw same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   But what has helped the Clintons overcome such anger has been an
even greater antipathy among New Yorkers toward the first couples'
opponents, many political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican revolution of '94 and '95 really just scared
the hell out of New Yorkers, including moderate Republicans,''
Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Marable said, ``Even though African-Americans have had many
criticisms of this administration, from the crime bill to the
welfare bill, on balance, in the era of the Contract With America,
in the era of the Christian Coalition, in the period of attacks on
affirmative action, Clinton looks almost like a positive good
rather than a necessary evil.''

</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' enemies may have helped them on another issue:
impeachment, which appears to have solidified Clinton's support in
New York and raised Mrs. Clinton favorable ratings, analysts say.
The first Lady has long been popular among professional women. But
her stoic, steadfast defense of her husband last year won her
additional support among more traditional, conservative women,
pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the year softened her image,'' said Lee M. Miringoff,
director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``People can, in different ways, identify with
the trauma she's gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hope, chairwoman of the New York state Democratic Party,
said Mrs. Clinton should therefore benefit in a race against New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is considering a run for the
Republican Senate nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think New Yorkers see her as the personification of the new
woman in transition,'' Ms. Hope said. ``That she has juggled a
child, a job and a loss of personal privacy with such style and
grace really inspires women.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may be vulnerabilities hiding inside Mrs. Clinton's
apparent strengths on the impeachment issue. While many people like
Mrs. Clinton for standing by the president, a smaller but still
substantial number of people seem to dislike her for exactly the
same reason.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Mrs. Clinton may benefit from the competition
between New York City, a place she professes to love, and
Washington, a town she seems to despise. Many New York politicians
assert that their hometown is more sophisticated than the nation's
capital, more drawn to independent women, less upset by sexual
scandals. It may also help that some of her closest advisers are
New Yorkers, including Harold M. Ickes and Susan Thomases.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Manhattan might be the ideal place for both
Clintons to settle after he leaves office, whether she runs for the
Senate or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers love people who live near the margins,'' said
Moss, the NYU political scientist. ``The very qualities that make
people like Billy Martin or Joe Namath helps explain why they like
the Clintons. New Yorkers like risk takers.''

   CHARITY-IRS-NYT (moved on Thursday, Feb. 11)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, Feb. 11,
about a Federal appeals court ruling that upheld the tax-exempt
status of a charity that hired fund-raisers who kept most of the
money they collected referred incompletely to the involvement of a
lawyer, Thomas Troyer. Besides being a nonprofit law specialist at
the firm of Caplan &AMP; Drysdale in Washington, he has been counsel of
record for a group that filed a brief opposing the charity's
position.
</P>
<P>
   The obituary of the director Jose Quintero sent by the New York
Times News Service on Friday, Feb. 26, referred incorrectly to his
birth date. It was Oct. 15, 1924, not Oct. 16, and was the day
before the playwright Eugene O'Neill's 36th birthday, not the day
after his 37th.

 UNDATED: the Tutsi.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though the border with Congo is easily within an hour's
walk from the entrance to the forest park, the violence there
seemed far away on Monday as the camp was gradually coming to life
at 6:45 a.m. The sun was up, but it had yet to peek over the
surrounding hills.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tourists were shaking themselves from sleep at that
point since the starting time for the trek up into the hills was at
8 a.m. They never made it.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels burst into the camp with a blast of grenades and
automatic weapons fire. The Ugandans _ a game warden and three park
rangers _ were killed in the initial assault. The rebels looted the
buildings, setting a few on fire and torching the vehicles they
came across as well.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors said that initially the rebels herded 31 tourists into
the Abercrombie and Kent encampment and began stripping them of
their valuables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly some soldiers came in the tent and they asked for
money, for jewelry, for watches,'' said Anne Peltier, the French
deputy ambassador to Uganda, who was among the survivors
</P>
<P>
   At first the rebels seemed to be treating the tourists well, but
some of those captured had a foreboding of what was to come by the
treatment of one group of British tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Adams, 54, from California, was among the 15 hostages
rounded up and sent into the jungle with the troops about 40
minutes after the first attack. She had already seen that the
British man sitting next to her had purple toenails from where he
had been beaten on the feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British people were being forced to walk barefoot if they
had no shoes,'' said Mrs. Adams, who feigned an asthma attack and
waved her inhaler as the march got underway. The soldiers let her
walk back into the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Studd, the mother of Susan Studd, a 46-year-old Oregon
woman who survived the attack, said she talked to her daughter in
Kampala on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She said her daughter and her daughter's husband, Robert
McLaurin, 44, were awakened in their tent in the Abercrombie and
Kent encampment by grenade explosions and gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They heard a woman scream, so they got out the back of their
tent and went into the bush and hid there,'' said Mrs. Studd. ``It
was just a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Another American, Elizabeth Garland, 29, a Fulbright scholar
from the University of Chicago, told her father that she escaped by
hiding in her tent. Her father, James Garland, the president of
Miami University in Ohio, told The Associated Press that his
daughter, too, had been awakened by gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments had already warned tourists against
traveling through much of western Uganda because of rebel and
bandit activity near the border with Congo. Until now, however, the
Bwindi gorilla reserve had been considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   The attack struck a blow at Uganda, itself on the mend after
years of chaos. The State Department warned American citizens to
postpone travel to the region until further notice and at least two
tour companies said they were suspending trips to the region until
further notice.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Acacia Expeditions said six of the people killed were
on one of its tours. Its travelers, known as ``overlanders,'' are
generally budget tourists who spend weeks traveling across Africa
in large, open trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The other tour group, the upscale Abercrombie and Kent, which
ran the most exclusive tent encampment at the forest, announced on
Tuesday that it was closing the facility until it had assurances
that security could be maintained. Its clients would be offered
full refunds or alternative trips, said Alistair Ballantine,
president of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their income level, the tourists at the Impenetrable
Forest all lived in fairly close proximity in a series of clearings
that resembled a small village built near the entrance to the park.
</P>
<P>
   The most budget conscious tourists _ including most of those
sent by Acacia _ camped in a clearing. Nearby was a series of round
African huts known as bandas and a lodge run by the African Pearl
safari tour company. The Abercrombie and Kent Gorilla Forest Camp
was a series of 10 tents with concrete floors that were tucked in
amongst the trees for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a sight of the mountain gorillas had become
especially popular after the 1988 movie ``Gorillas in the Mist,''
which starred Sigourney Weaver as the researcher Dian Fossey who
dedicated her life to saving the gorillas in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday, the Impenetrable Forest was considered the last
safe place to seek out the gorillas because civil strife had put

 &HT;    Wright Flyer to catch a wave of wind
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNNYVALE, Calif. _ Perched on its mount in the middle of a
giant NASA wind tunnel, the Wright Flyer replica looked ready to
catch the wind.
</P>
<P>
   But a large group of NASA workers and volunteers was still
working around the delicate craft Tuesday evening to make sure it
was indeed ready before the immense wind tunnel powered up to
gather the first full-scale data on the world's first airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The tunnel is a part of NASA's Ames Research Center here at
Moffett Field, a former Navy air station. The Ames center is
supporting a volunteer effort called the Wright Flyer Project to
test a full-size reproduction of the airplane the Wright brothers
flew at Kitty Hawk, N.C. in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles chapter of the American Institute of Aeronautics
and Astronautics, which developed the project, had hoped to start
wind tunnel tests on Monday, but preparations took longer than
expected. It was still uncertain Tuesday afternoon whether a test
would be run Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Tuesday, project chairman Jack Cherne carefully
jockeyed a large electric cart around the flyer, rising up and down
on the cart's swaying platform to make adjustments. Others used a
laser to align the flyer precisely in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The tunnel can generate winds up to nearly half the speed of
sound to test models of jets, but it will limit winds to 30 miles
per hour for the flyer. That's about the top speed it attained at
Kitty Hawk, project members said.
</P>
<P>
   Orville and Wilbur Wright made just four brief flights on Dec.
17, 1903, before a gust of wind wrecked the flyer as it stood
unattended. They knew their machine lacked stability, but Wright
Flyer Project members say no full-scale aerodynamic studies have
ever been done to find out exactly how the machine performed.
</P>
<P>
   Project members say they have an educational goal of learning
more about the airplane that changed the world, but they also hope
the data will aid in the building of another Wright Flyer replica
that they can fly safely at Kitty Hawk in 2003, on the 100th
anniversary of the first flights.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the poor stability of the flyer was a tribute to the
Wrights' flying skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that their first flight was 120 feet and their last
one was 852 feet shows they were learning,'' Watson said.

OFFICIALS DOWNPLAY DANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 and ELAINE PORTERFIELD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ ``Chester the Molester,'' as the cops called him,
accosted six women last year in the Los Angeles International
Airport garage.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh time, police were ready.
</P>
<P>
   An officer monitoring cameras at each entrance saw the suspect
drive up, and ``Chester'' is now behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is just one of the airports around the nation using
cameras and heavy patrols to fight crime in airport lots _ measures
that are lacking at Sea-Tac.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer found that the Sea-Tac garage is patroled
an average of less than once a day, that the few cameras in the lot
are linked to maintenance rather than security, and that a
half-dozen of the port's own police officers had warned of security
gaps long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sea-Tac's police force also is stretched more thinly than at
those airports, the P-I found.
</P>
<P>
   Port Commissioner Paige Miller Tuesday said she has asked port
staff to review how Sea-Tac differs from other airports in patrols
and surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reasonable,'' she said, ``to ask what other airports are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But like other three other port commissioners interviewed, she
stressed that the garage has been the scene of very few violent
crimes. Miller said it's important to note that most crimes at the
garage have been crimes of property, like car prowls, and not rapes
or assaults.
</P>
<P>
   And that leaves little reason for boosting garage staffing, said
Aviation director Gina Marie Lindsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``History doesn't seem to warrant throwing a lot of folks and
technology at the garage,'' Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
   A woman shot two years ago in the huge Sea-Tac garage is suing
the port for negligence, but port officials say no security
measures could prevent that kind of sudden attack.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with police at other airports around the country
show that they devote special resources to keeping their garages as
safe as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Police at Washington's Dulles aim cameras to cover every blind
spot at the lot. At Boston's Logan, troopers sometimes stake out
BMWs and other fancy cars on the chance thieves will target them.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's lots are watched by private security guards on
every floor, while L.A. officers sometimes use military
night-vision goggles to watch the sprawling airport lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of proud of what we've been able to do,'' said L.A.
airport police Capt. John Bangs. ``Every garage gets patrolled at
least a couple of times every shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed with the lawsuit indicate that the Sea-Tac
garage is not routinely patrolled, though officers from other beats
sometimes make checks there.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at other airports _ as well as nationally recognized
experts on parking _ say garages require special vigilence. They're
where people leave one of their most valuable and treasure-filled
possessions, and any theft that's interrupted has the potential to
turn violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security should be at the top of the mind of anyone who's
offering parking to the public,'' said Brad Parrish, president of
V.P. Services, a consulting firm for parking operators.
</P>
<P>
   Another Seattle parking consultant, Greg Jacobson, said visible
security is simply good business, making people more more likely to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling,'' he said, ``is spend the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Many garage planners at malls and other facilities follow that
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Below downtown Seattle, the 1,200-stall Pacific Place garage is
literally as bright as day thanks to white metal-halide bulbs
cranking out an average of 7.5 foot candles of illumination.
</P>
<P>
   That's about 14 times the brightness given off by the amber
lamps at the Sea-Tac garage, where Jacobson said the lighting level
is about one-half a foot candle _ roughly the visibility of the
desert in a full moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was really key for us,'' said Pacific Place spokeswoman
Jane Lewis, ``is that from the drawing board on up, the security
and comfort of the user were important.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Place designers also enhanced security by painting the
walls a reflective white and by removing such hiding places for
crooks as columns near car doors or areas with dark shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Port of Seattle officials have prepared a capital-budget
proposal to boost the lighting levels in the Sea-Tac garage, but no
date has been set, said Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras monitored by security personnel, while not provided at
the 10,000-stall Sea-Tac lots, are an increasingly common safety
feature of large garages, said Norman Bottom, a Miami security
expert and author.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one location is more dangerous than a parking garage _
that's an external ATM,'' Bottom said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kingdome, movable cameras are used in the parking lot,
said Gene Willard, chief of security. If a person of interest is
seen in the lot, they can use the camera to zoom in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find surveillance cameras are excellent tools,'' Willard
said. ``The guard at the gate can find the suspicious person on the
camera and another guard can respond.''
</P>
<P>
   They also use employees to patrol rows of parked cars on foot
during events, along with a guard in golf carts to make rounds, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say cameras are part of an array of security devices and
visible uniformed patrols that ward off would-be criminals. Sea-Tac
airport's own employees are protected by some of those measures:
barbed wire surrounds their lot, which is controlled by a
round-the-clock employee.
</P>
<P>
   But the garage that travelers use needs more attention, said Don
Riser, a retired King County police sergeant who provides security
to car rental companies at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the port should put more security within the
structure itself,'' Riser said. ``It's dangerous, no question about
it ... if they can't afford cops, at least they could hire security
guards.''
</P>
<P>
   What would be especially helpful are patrols by bike or golf
carts, said Riser, who has worked in the garage since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bike guys in these kind of situations are great,'' he
said. ``The information they can pick up is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bike officers do sporadically patrol the Sea-Tac garage,
officials said, but the airport's police staffing is stretched
thinly as the growing number of flights brings a more visible
problem: lines of drivers clogging the pick-up and drop-off lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Sea-Tac ranks last in the size of its police force in a survey
of nine airports done by the Port of Seattle's own police in 1995 _
and recently updated by the Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   Portland, Orlando, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Denver,
Vancouver, B.C., Boston and San Francisco all had more police
officers in 1994 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sea-Tac travelers also were more likely to be crime victims than
at those at the seven airports for which statistics were available.
Vancouver did not report equivalent crime statistics, and
Portland's were incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five port commissioners said Tuesday that port
police have never come to them with any concerns about security at
the garage. Miller, president Pat Davis, and commissioners Jack
Block and Clare Nordquist said recent requests for more police
officers have revolved around congestion on the drives.
</P>
<P>
   Though commissioners had not been alerted to any garage-security
concerns, the shooting victim's lawsuit turned up prior written
warnings of security lapses sent to superiors by a half-dozen of
the port's own police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Pat Davis said the port must base its police
staffing decision on the numbers of serious crimes at the airport,
and not what meaures other airports are taking to combat crime.

PACIFIC LUMBER SELLS REDWOOD TREES FOR $450 MILLION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif.) 
 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pacific Lumber Co., the Northern California logging
operation owned by Houston-based Maxxam, pulled off a last-minute
deal to sell a stand of centuries-old redwood trees to the federal
and California governments for $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after declaring the agreement to sell the Headwaters
Forest all but dead, the parties announced Tuesday they had
salvaged the 1/2-year-old effort to preserve the largest grove of
ancient redwood trees left in private hands.
</P>
<P>
   And while the participants may differ over whether the final
agreement is substantially different from the proposal rejected
last week, they agreed the signing just minutes before the deadline
represented a monumental achievement.
</P>
<P>
   California's Democratic Gov. Gray Davis said the benefits of
preserving the Headwaters will live on ``long after our mortal
footprints will be swept away by time,'' while Pacific Lumber
President John Campbell called it ``a sound and sensible solution
to a decade of controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord creates a 7,500-acre preserve near Fortuna, Calif.,
to protect the soaring redwood trees of the Headwaters _ some of
which date back 2,000 years or more _ as well as several, smaller
stands of old-growth redwood trees.
</P>
<P>
   To safeguard rare species like the marbled murrelet, the spotted
owl and the coho salmon, the agreement also restricts Pacific
Lumber's logging practices on its remaining 211,700 acres for the
next half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is providing $250 million, while
California is contributing $130 million. In addition, the
California Legislature has agreed to spend $112 million more to
purchase an additional 2,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the federal and state governments will pay $492
million, with $450 million accruing to Pacific Lumber and the rest
going to another timber company and the local communities.
</P>
<P>
   To call the Headwaters deal an 11th-hour agreement does not do
justice to the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress authorized the federal share back in 1997, it
required the money to be spent by March 1. The parties used a
tortured interpretation of the deadline to give themselves until
11:59 p.m. Monday _ California time _ to cut a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, who had so beat up on Maxxam on Monday, celebrated
the news of a deal Tuesday. Maxxam shares rose 9 13/16 to close at
57 11/16 on the American Stock Exchange, capturing most of the
ground lost when the deal seemed imperilled.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Friday, Campbell had complained the combination of
state and federal restrictions would so limit the company's ability
to produce lumber as to wreck its financial viability.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement bars any logging within 100 feet of fish-bearing
streams and within 30 feet of other waterways. They also ban
logging operations in about 8,000 acres of old growth set aside as
conservation zones for the marbled murrelet.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said those and other restrictions would have slashed
the company's lumber production to about 136 million board feet,
down 42 percent from the company's plan for about 233 million board
feet and well shy of what the company considered necessary to
remain economic.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Campbell said the federal and state officials had
provided enough flexibility to give the company confidence that it
could produce a minimum of 200 million board feet annually.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will, for instance, allow the company to cut
selected trees in landslide-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Department officials, conceding earlier projections of
136 million board feet were inaccurate, calculate the company will
be able to harvest about 177 million board feet annually, David
Hayes, counselor to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said Tuesday.
And he contended that the agreement is no different from the
agreement that state and federal regulators had proposed last week.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who had called Maxxam Chief Executive Charles
Hurwitz last week in an effort to keep the talks alive, called the
redwoods of the Headwaters ``a natural treasure, as much a part of
our legacy as the world's great libraries and cathedrals.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt argues the real significance of the deal is the habitat
conservation plan drawn up as part of the agreement, which he
contends will be a guide for many future logging plans.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, who have battled Hurwitz for years in an
effort to ensure the redwoods of the Headwaters were not cut down
to make lumber for hot tubs, fence posts and leisure decks, reacted
cautiously to the agreement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Ratner, president of the Oakland, Calif.-based Rose
Foundation, said it was too early to tell if the agreement would
truly protect the environment. ``It certainly is a good deal for
the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the agreement will really end the battle that has raged
in Northern California between the environmental community and
Maxxam for more than a decade remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Earth First, a more radical environmental group, held a
demonstration in Northern California Tuesday to protest the
Headwaters deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people know how much land is being saved in the
Headwaters agreement,'' said Earth First activist Darryl Cherney.
``What they don't realize is how much land is being destroyed. It's
a license to kill endangered species.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia ``Butterfly'' Hill has spent nearly 15 months perched in
one of Pacific Lumber's old-growth redwood trees. She has no plans
to climb down from the tree she calls Luna.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement ... is based on the premise that a bare minimum
needs to be protected for endangered species recovery, and from the
beginning it has failed to require what is biologically necessary
to accomplish even that,'' Hill said in a prepared statement issued
by her Luna Media Services.

 &HT;    Texas Independence Day celebrated Austin-style
 &HT;    By Chuck Lindell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Brian McGill was standing under the Capitol dome
amid the costumes and pomp of Texas Independence Day when a certain
governor locked eyes and crooked a finger in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   Thus summoned, McGill brought forward his son Garrett, a
21-month-old who became the envy of many a Republican leader _
eyeball to eyeball with Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The governor smiled, the child stared. The governor talked, the
child stared. The governor produced his palm, the child slapped.
</P>
<P>
   A ``high five'' with a probable presidential candidate on the
day Texas declared independence from Mexico 163 years before?
That'll give Brian and Kelly McGill a little family history to pass
along once Garrett grows older.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we live in the Austin area, we're going to make
this (celebration) our Texas tradition,'' Brian McGill said, still
smiling moments later. ``I'm a native Texan and proud of my
state.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day for women in bonnets and men wearing string ties. A
drum and fife corps played ``The Yellow Rose of Texas,'' and
couples two-stepped under the dome.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, hundreds of people chewed and talked beneath large red
and white tents, free servings of barbecue slopping over the sides
of their paper plates.
</P>
<P>
   Kay McAnnally, 2, and her nanny, Ailana Larson of Austin, picked
at their food and waived small Texas flags. It being near Kay's nap
time, Larson had to carry almost all of the conversation. Mostly,
she said, Tuesday's events will make a wonderful lesson in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good thing to teach our heritage,'' Larson
said. ``We went to the Alamo a couple of weeks ago, so we're just
getting a big run of Texas history here.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos, who acted as emcee during the
Capitol celebration, promised even larger festivities in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to celebrate this like it ought to be celebrated.
Next year, it's going to be five times bigger. We'll probably have
to hold it outside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go around all over the world and brag about being Texas.
But if you ask people, I'd say about three-quarters don't even know
when Texas Independence Day is,'' said Barrientos, D-Austin. ``It's
part of our culture. It's part of our history.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Texas, a celebration of a different sort
began several hours later, one that glorified the quiet heroes who
valued intellectual activity, books and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone who came then was rough and ready, loud and
brash,'' said Tom Hatfield, dean of continuing and extended
education.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from the Alamo Diary, an account of the Alamo battle
attributed to a Mexican officer, UT Center for American History
director Don Carleton held the audience of 300 spellbound.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Jose Enrique de la Pen(tilde)a describes a battle of
unimaginable horror, where Mexican soldiers ``climbed over the
bleeding bodies of comrades,'' Carleton read. After the Mexican
army breached the walls, several defenders refused to hide,
including William Barrett Travis, the Alamo commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a few steps and stopped, turning his proud face toward
us to discharge his shots. He fought like a true soldier,''
Carleton read. ``Finally, he died, but he died after having traded
his life very dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Liz Carpenter, author and speechwriter for former President
Lyndon Johnson, said the story of the Alamo continues to resonate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson for us today is that rallying cries for great
causes _ for justice, for liberty _ do bring recruits. A handful of
committed people still create legends, in peace as well as war,''
Carpenter said, praising those who fought for civil rights, women's
equality and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we have our own Alamos of ignorance and poverty and
despair,'' she said. ``A few idea-driven people can make a
difference in making a more civilized society.''

 &HT;    Top Baptists show confidence in Bush
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Two native Texans that lead the nation's largest
Protestant denomination say they are comfortable a George W. Bush
presidential campaign will favor the conservative Christian agenda,
despite rumblings in religious-right circles that the governor may
be too moderate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican nomination is his to lose,'' said the Rev.
Paige Patterson, president of the Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Richard Land, president of the commission that furthers
the denomination's position on public policy issues, said that
unless Bush changes his message somewhere along the presidential
hopeful road, the governor will more than likely get a strong show-
ing of support from conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that most of the pro-life, conservative
evangelical Christians I know are very excited about some of the
things George W. Bush is saying and doing,'' said Land, whose
Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission is holding its annual
conference in Austin through today.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson and Land are quick to point out they cannot endorse a
presidential candidate because of their high-profile positions in
the denomination, which never endorses political candidates. But
even a nod of confidence from the leaders of the almost 16
million-member Southern Baptist Convention may go a long way to
quell any concerns conservative Christians might have about a Bush
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be challenged from the right by several GOP
contenders, including commentator Pat Buchanan. Some Christian
conservatives in Texas have expressed concern about whether Bush is
a strong enough voice on their key issues, including abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect I'm not going to appeal to all the people all the
time,'' Bush said Tuesday when he announced formation of an
exploratory committee for a probable presidential race. ``I've got
a record. It's a good solid record, and people can analyze it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a United Methodist, spoke to Land's conference Monday
night at Great Hills Baptist Church. His talk was closed to the
media at his request, Land said.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson and Land say they have a good relationship with the
Bush family, particularly with former President Bush. Patterson is
the president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake
Forest, N.C. Land works in the denomination's national headquarters
in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Governor Bush has shown a remarkable ability to tell
some really hard truths to folks that lets them know he really
cares about them,'' Land said. ``I think what he is going to do is
couple that in inclusivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' slogan is getting across
to Americans what evangelical Christians have been advocating all
along, Land said. The governor is able to package the message in a
way that shows the conservative agenda is not a mean-spirited
critique of people's lives, but a way for the country to care for
its people and reclaim its values, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone like Governor Bush comes along and says, 'Look,
we all made mistakes and we all made poor judgments, and the
question is, what have we learned from them?' I think that kind of
helping hand will resonate enormously among conservative
evangelical Christians and the American population at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Flood, executive director of Austin Metropolitan
Ministries, a nonpartisan interfaith organization that represents
150 congregations, said the governor is well-received in the
religious community.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the jury is out in regards as to how individuals
are going to vote,'' Flood said. ``It is going to be interesting to
observe how he deals with the extremes in his own party.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush chooses to run and wins the nomination, Flood said
not to count out presidential hopeful and current Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a Southern Baptist, so how will that filter out?''

TALLAS SECURE IN BACKUP ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rob Tallas didn't wear the usual number for a goalie in
his first training camp with the Bruins, back in September 1994. He
was given No. 80 when he tried to make the team as a free agent out
of Seattle of the Western Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas, now the backup to Bruins starter Byron Dafoe, has that
jersey framed in his bedroom so he can stare at it whenever he
wishes. It's a reminder of where he has been in his struggle to
beat out other goalies, some of them draft choices, in a bid to
make the big club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reminder of what it took to get here and the dues I had
to pay,'' said Tallas, who has a 2.68 goals-against average and
89.9 save percentage in 14 appearances this season. ``Sometimes you
take it for granted when you get caught up in the middle of the
season. It's nice to look at it. It's something I take a lot of
pride in.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas has other sweaters from his rookie year, but none is
framed. ``I knew (No. 80) was a keeper,'' he said. ``You look at it
as a challenge, an obstacle as a walk-on, and you stay here five
years later and you're part of a strong organization. The jersey is
a large part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The jersey didn't even have Tallas's name on it at first. While
everyone else had their names sewn on, Tallas's name was in velcro
when he played in an exhibition against the Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never looked at it as anything negative,'' Tallas said. ``I
was so excited to be here and be around the guys and just to be
playing. That's what my focus was. Now that I look back on it, it
was such an uphill battle for me and I made it. It's a story some
guys respect and they look at it as a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas, who has a 6-5-2 record, always has done well in training
camp. ``I spend a lot of my time during the summers getting ready
for camp, always making sure that I'm in shape, spending a lot of
time focusing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how the Bruins discovered him is not your
run-of-the-mill tale. The team spotted him while he was playing for
Seattle at Kamloops, British Columbia, in a game broadcast on The
Sports Network. Tallas shined, winning, 3-1, and ending Kamloops's
31-game home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a neat way for me to get here,'' Tallas said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Jim Carey has moved from the Bruins' Providence AHL
affiliate to the St. Louis Blues, Tallas said he feels relief, even
though the move eventually could mean Tallas will be exposed in the
expansion draft. Carey, the former Vezina Trophy winner, made more
than $2 million per season, and could have taken Tallas's spot with
the big club this season. For a while, at least, Tallas can sleep
soundly again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if management realized the pressures that were on
me,'' said Tallas. ``Every day in practice I had to work hard.
That's a lot of pressure. With Byron playing so well and me and him
getting along so well, it's always in the back of your mind that
(Carey) could be called up. There are guys down there who always
want your job. We have to realize that. It pushes us to work hard.
I thought about it a lot. It's a relief to see him go.''

BUSH INCHES A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO PRESIDENTIAL RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Saying he has a ``compelling reason to consider
running for president,'' Gov. George W. Bush announced on Tuesday
that he is taking the first formal step toward launching a bid for
the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will file papers next week creating an exploratory
committee which will allow him to raise and spend money exploring a
national campaign before making a final decision this summer.
</P>
<P>
   At a packed news conference in Austin, the eldest son of former
President George Bush declined to lay out in detail his vision for
America, but he did indicate he has one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the 21st century to be prosperous,'' Bush said. ``I
want prosperity to spread its wings across America. I don't want
anybody left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's announcement came on the same day that Pat Buchanan, the
arch-conservative television commentator, vowed a fiery race for
the GOP nomination at an appearance in New Hampshire, where he
embarrassed President Bush in 1992 by finishing a close second
behind the incumbent president.
</P>
<P>
   The governor passed up a chance to comment directly on
Buchanan's announcement, but vowed a positive campaign that will
take him around the nation this summer as he explores a candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush laid to rest any notion that putting his wife and twin
teenage daughters through the ``meat grinder'' of presidential
politics _ a worry he has voiced again and again _ would keep him
out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Seated before some 30 television cameras and dozens of
journalists in the back yard of the Governor's Mansion, Bush and
his wife Laura both said they no longer fear the well-known
disruptions of a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our love for each other is strong enough to take whatever life
brings,'' Bush said. ``We've discussed some ways to try to keep a
normal family life. I'm committed to making sure I spend quality
time with Laura and the girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor was visibly moved when his wife responded to the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dread criticism of my husband. On the other hand, I love
George, and I am very proud of him,'' she said, turning toward the
governor. ``And I know he would make a great president.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush added that she was ``looking forward,'' to a
campaign. Bush said the two will travel together when he embarks on
a national tour.
</P>
<P>
   With the family concerns put to rest, Bush, who is deemed an
early favorite for the Republican nomination, was asked what could
keep him from turning his ``exploratory'' effort into a full-blown
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``A giant thud,'' Bush answered, provoking howls of laughter
from the assortment of journalists, aides and supporters. ``A huge
yawn. That it turned out it was my mother (former First Lady
Barbara Bush) that they were interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   As for timing, Bush said he would stay at home to fight for his
agenda during the legislative session, which ends May 31. After
that, he'll hit the campaign trail, visiting, for example, the
traditional first caucus and primary states of Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to raise money without leaving (Austin),''
Bush said. ``I need to be here now. Now one of these days I'm going
to be in Des Moines and around ... I hope the people of Iowa and
New Hampshire and America understand I was elected to do a job.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with Bush's promise to tell Texas about his plans
first, Tuesday's media briefing was for Texas reporters only. A
representative of Time magazine and CNN's Charles Zewe, for
example, were turned away at the gate by Bush aides.
</P>
<P>
   But it only took a few minutes for a crew aboard a CNN satellite
truck from Dallas to copy a local affiliate's videotape of the
event and shoot it up on a satellite in time for ``Inside
Politics.'' Broadcast network affiliates did the same routine.
</P>
<P>
   The approach allows Bush to get a ``two-fer'' out of the
announcement of the exploratory committee, said University of
Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato _ one now and one Sunday
when Bush briefs national reporters. Aides already have requests
from 50 journalists for that session.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that Bush would run for president has been raging
for months, though nothing formal had been announced until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Bush has been carefully assembling a team of
advisers and heavyweight fundraisers, the latter expected to start
collecting contributions this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Though his advisers have been helping him study up on national
issues, Bush stuck mostly to broad themes on Tuesday, applying much
of what he said on the campaign trail in Texas to a larger,
national audience.
</P>
<P>
   He did add a populist note to his long-standing call for a new
``responsibility era,'' saying he envisions a world in which
``corporate America understands that they're responsible for their
employees, and responsible for the clean water and clean air of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   As for possible rivals, the only candidate Bush specifically
talked about was Elizabeth Dole, the former head of the American
Red Cross and wife of former presidential candidate Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he found it ``instructive to America'' that the first
viable woman presidential candidate is from his own Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Buchanan, Bush said he looks forward to seeing ``all
these people should I decide to run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have a few differences here and there,'' added Bush,
who nevertheless vowed his campaign would be ``above board,
positive, energetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush even declined to draw contrasts between his possible
administration and the one that replaced his father's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let the historians judge President Clinton,'' Bush said,
adding that he would talk about his possible agenda for Washington
at the ``appropriate time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who sprinkled Spanish into his answers for the benefit
of some Spanish language media outlets, said he believes a
presidential administration could ``change the tone of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a huge responsibility, and I'm awed by the
thought and humbled by the opportunity should I decide to go
forward,'' he said.

IN COMPROMISE, SILBER WOULD QUIT EDUCATION BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John R. Silber offered to resign as chairman of the
state's board of education Tuesday, an act of political
self-sacrifice designed to break an impasse over the selection of a
new education commissioner. The showdown has proven a major
embarrassment for Silber's boss, Governor Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Silber called on Cellucci to replace him as chairman with James
Peyser, whom the governor initially wanted as the next education
commissioner but who had failed to win enough support from the rest
of the administration-appointed board.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation would also clear the way for the board to
appoint David Driscoll, Peyser's rival, as commissioner on a
permanent basis. In an initial vote last week, Driscoll, the
interim commissioner, received five of the necesssary six votes for
the job, while Peyser received four.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman oversees the board's work, which involves setting
statewide education policy and regulations. The commissioner
implements them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although this will not give the Department of Education
leadership by the best qualified candidate, this solution is better
than the alternative of impasse,'' Silber said in a letter
delivered to Cellucci late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of education reform is far more important than my
continuance on the board or the continuance of any other of its
members,'' said Silber. He was appointed to the post in early 1996
by Governor William F. Weld in a move calculated to shake up the
education establishment and challenge the politically powerful
teacher unions. Silber has not been paid for his work as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday night, Cellucci said he would consult
with the rest of the board over the surprise development. But
administration sources said the governor would eagerly accept
Silber's resignation because it would resolve a standoff that has
become a major political gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like this compromise is going to fly,'' said one top
Cellucci adviser, who described the deal as a ``win-win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We get Peyser, who will take the lead on setting education
reform policy. Driscoll will do the day-to-day management. And
Silber gets to hand off the baton to someone he has confidence
in,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the compromise would represent an about-face for
Cellucci, who along with Silber has privately argued that Driscoll
is too tied into the education establishment to carry out needed
overhauls.
</P>
<P>
   Peyser, executive director of the Pioneer Institute, a
conservative think tank, is viewed as much more committed to
sweeping changes to the system. However, his advocacy of vouchers
and charter schools has alienated teachers' unions and other
educators.
</P>
<P>
   Administration sources said Driscoll was told by a top Cellucci
aide late Tuesday that the job was virtually his. And Peyser said
of the chairman's job, ``If it were offered, I would take it.''
Peyser recently resigned his position on the board to be considered
for the commissioner's job.
</P>
<P>
   Silber's made his announcement at a news conference after he and
two other board members met with Driscoll in a session said to ease
their concerns about having the career educator as commissioner.
Cellucci learned of Silber's decision early Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Although the possibility of Silber's resignation had been
floated by the administration, until midday Tuesday Cellucci had
held out hope he could resolve the standoff in a way that kept the
Boston University chancellor at the helm of the education board.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cellucci unsuccessfully pressed Roberta Schaefer and
Abigail Thernstrom _ two board members he and Weld had appointed _
to switch their support from Driscoll to Peyser. Tuesday morning,
according to several sources, Cellucci made another appeal to
Thernstrom, only to be rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Silber's resignation would remove a hard-edged personality who,
for all his educational expertise, had polarized the board and
alienated several key board members who otherwise share the
governor's philosophy on education. Several of those members have
refused to back Peyser.
</P>
<P>
   While saying his departure from the board may be necessary for
education reform to advance, Silber Tuesday continued his attack on
those members _ particularly Thernstrom and Schaefer _ saying they
should bow to the governor's wishes and back Peyser for the
commissioner's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have already said that I thought those who couldn't support
the governor who appointed them to the position should resign,''
Silber said.
</P>
<P>
   Silber's relationship with Thernstrom and Schaefer had
deteriorated in recent months, to the point where they were arguing
over seating arrangements at board meetings. Thernstrom hailed the
proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Driscoll is made commissioner and Peyser is made chairman
of the board, this is the best of all possible worlds for Governor
Cellucci,'' she said. ``He has got his man in the top policy
position . . . and we have got a wonderful man to carry out that
policy, who has tremendous credibility in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   But she defended her stand against Peyser as commissioner. ``I
am not on the governor's staff,'' she said. ``I am a member of an
independent board, and voted the way I have thought long and hard
about during the search.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer hailed the compromise as an ``excellent combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was so positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was totally unfair to the board members that differ
with (Silber) and unclear how this offer will really resolve the
impasse,'' said Paul Reville, a professor of education at Harvard
University and chairman of the Massachusetts Education Reform
Review Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting that paved the way for Silber's gambit, sources
say, Silber; Edwin Delattre, a board member and Silber supporter;
and Charles Baker, recently appointed by Cellucci to the board,
talked with Driscoll in Silber's Boston University office on Bay
State Road for several hours Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   One person familiar with the conversation described it as
productive, saying that Driscoll made progress in allaying concerns
Baker and Delattre _ who had backed Peyser for the commissioner's
post _ had about him.

MAJOR AUTOMAKERS REPORT RECORD SALES FOR FEBRUARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., N.Y.)   (jw)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ March blew in like a lion for the auto industry as
major automakers, including Ford Motor Co., DaimlerChrysler AG and
American Honda, reported record sales for the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the end of the General Motors strike in August, the
industry has had an incredible run of monthly records,'' David
Healy, an auto analyst for Burnham Securities in New York, said.
``The reasons are the usual suspects. Car prices are reasonable, if
not declining. Employment levels and consumer confidence are very
high. Used-car prices are strong, making trade-ins worth more and
causing people to buy new cars instead of used ones.''
</P>
<P>
   At Ford, sales of Ford, Mercury, Lincoln and Jaguar cars and
trucks rose 8 percent to 319,340 vehicles from the preceding
February, surpassing the previous February sales record set in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler reported sales of Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler and
Plymouth cars and trucks totaled 215,450 units, also up 8 percent
over a year ago and beating the previous record set 1996.
Mercedes-Benz posted slightly lower sales from a year ago. Several
other companies, including General Motors Corp., have not yet
reported sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's sales rose on the strength of trucks, most notably the
full-size Ford F-Series and compact Ranger pickup trucks as well as
sport-utility vehicles like the Ford Explorer and Expedition.
Ford's total truck sales climbed 20 percent to 193,779 vehicles.
F-Series sales rose 27 percent, breaking the previous monthly sales
record set in 1978; Ranger sales rose 46 percent for the best
February since 1978. Combined sales of the Explorer and Expedition
set new records, and the redesigned Ford Windstar and Mercury
Villager minivans also posted increases.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's car sales, however, dropped to 125,561 vehicles, down 6
percent from a year ago, because of lower sales to daily rental
fleets, Ford said. Excluding fleet sales, retail car sales rose 12
percent, the company said. Sales of the redesigned Ford Mustang and
Mercury Cougar were higher, but sales of Ford's high-volume Taurus
fell. A redesigned Taurus will be unveiled at the New York auto
show in April and put on the market in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   At DaimlerChrysler, truck sales rose 7 percent to 145,436
vehicles, setting a new record for the sixth month in a row. Sales
of sport utilities led by the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango
and minivans, especially the Dodge Caravan, contributed to the
increase. The automaker's car sales rose 9 percent to 70,014
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Honda also reported record February sales for its Honda and
Acura brands. Its car and truck sales totaled 81,910 units, up 14
percent from a year ago. Honda's new Odyssey minivan and redesigned
Acura TL entry-level luxury car had triple-digit gains.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen reported its best February in 18 years; Audi had the
best February since 1986. Volvo, Subaru and Kia also reported
higher sales.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers said the continued upswing likely would carry through
to spring, typically the strongest season of the year, with March
sales already coming in strong.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There is very little doubt that March sales will be higher
than a year ago,'' said Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president
for marketing, sales and service, in a statement. ``After that, the
mountain is going to get a little steeper because the sales rate in
the second quarter of 1998 was very fast. Still, momentum is on the
side of a strong U.S. economy and confident U.S. consumers.''
</P>

   Indeed, Healy of Burnham Securities said he was uneasy with the
industry selling significantly above recent levels. When the rest
of the auto companies, including General Motors, report sales
Wednesday, Healy said he expected the seasonally adjusted rate
would be at a lofty 16.7 million for cars and light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems too good to last, but I don't see anything to spoil
it,'' he said. ``Every month I raise my forecast, and I suppose
I'll keep raising it.''
</P>
<P>
   Automakers are also increasing their forecasts for this year's
vehicle sales. DaimlerChrysler's early February forecast put car
and total truck sales for 1999 at 15.6 million vehicles. ``We've
increased the forecast every month for the last three months, and I
wouldn't be surprised if March gets off on a good foot and the
forecast ticks up a little more,'' said Jamie Jameson, vice
president for sales and marketing operations at DaimlerChrysler.

   It's a bird. It's a plane. It's ... Strauss? Pokemon cartoon
characters? The Union Jack? Actually, it is all three _ or soon
will be at airports around the world, as more and more airlines
discover that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an Austrian Airlines Airbus 321 not only now
emblazons the name ``Johann Strauss'' in large letters across its
fuselage, but a 40-foot image of the legendary waltz king playing
his violin runs from fuselage to tail. In addition, Strauss is
depicted surrounded by treble and bass clefs, and animated quarter
notes and eighth notes in a waltz rhythm. Altogether, it required
180 man-hours to glue the decoration to the newly painted aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Characters from Pokemon, a popular game and television cartoon
series, now decorate four All Nippon Airways jets, including a
747-400 that flew from Tokyo to New York last Friday and is now
being used on the Japanese carrier's routes to North America.
</P>
<P>
   And Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic, whose maverick founder,
Richard Branson, delights in tweaking his bigger rival, British
Airways, announced two days ago that Virgin would soon change its
corporate logo but would continue to use the Union Jack on the
fuselage of its planes _ in part a jab at British Airways for
replacing its abstract design of the British flag two years ago
with multicultural images.
</P>
<P>
   In all three cases, the immediate reason for the colorful
designs is to call attention to the airlines that own the planes,
but the longer-range reason is strictly business. Virgin Atlantic,
for example, coupled its announcement of the new corporate look
with the promise of new routes and more frequent flights _ aimed at
winning more corporate accounts.
</P>
<P>
   All Nippon Airways already flies 49 flights a week between Japan
and New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington and Honolulu,
and has applied to the Japanese government to begin daily service
April 13 between Tokyo and Chicago. More than 250 Japanese
companies have offices in Chicago, the airline said, and the city
is one of the most popular destinations for Japanese visitors. If
and when it begins flying to Chicago, the airline's code-share
flights to other American cities will increase by five, including
Cincinnati and Miami, for a total of 12.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian Airlines, having named its colorful airplane in
commemoration of Strauss, who died 100 years ago, plans to fly it
only to Paris; London; Berlin; St. Petersburg, Russia, and other
European destinations this year. It is the same plane that from
1996 through 1998 carried portraits of 24 prominent Austrians,
including Strauss, Mozart, Beethoven, Freud and Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has daily nonstop flights between Vienna, Austria,
and New York, and Vienna and Atlanta. It also has daily flights
between Vienna and Washington via Zurich, Switzerland. The Austrian
carrier serves 26 American cities through its code-share with Delta
Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Update
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons hotel opened in Las Vegas on Tuesday, the only
luxury hotel on that city's strip that does not have a gambling
casino. But there is a casino in the 43-story tower that the Four
Season shares with the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Amenities
include private bars in each room, 24-hour concierge and room
service, twice-daily housekeeping service and free overnight
shoeshines.
</P>
<P>
   Add the Omni Ambassador East in Chicago to the growing list of
hotels that want to rent out for New Year's Eve 1999. The 275-room
hotel, the home of the well-known Pump Room restaurant, is asking
$450,000 for rooms, food and beverages for two days and two nights
_ Dec. 31, 1999, and Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Not Yet Spring
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks from spring, many fliers might naturally assume the
worst of winter travel is behind them. But there is still plenty of
time for ice and snow to disrupt even the best-laid travel plans,
and if winter storms result in canceled flights, passengers should
be aware that they are not entitled to compensation from the
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the carriers have written right into their tickets that
they are not responsible for weather-caused delays,'' said Robert
Jarvis, professor of law at Nova Southeastern University in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. ``If the airline cancels the flight, it has to
give you your money back or put you on the next available flight if
you still want to go. But passengers are responsible for hotel
costs, missed opportunities or ruined vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   That is all the more reason, said Jarvis, one of the authors of
``Travel Law'' (Carolina Academic Press, 1998), for travelers
booked on tours, cruises or other expensive trips to guard against
such contingencies by buying trip insurance.

VP WEST BACK AFTER SHORT BREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A coach was fired and a controversial power
forward arrived, but Jerry West didn't stick around the Forum to
watch the results of those moves.
</P>
<P>
   West, last seen in public last Wednesday when the Los Angeles
Lakers fired Del Harris, took the next several days off to recover
from the mental stress, even skipping the press conference to
announce Kurt Rambis' appointment as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just getting away from the craziness of this business . . .
trying to get away from you people,'' the club vice president told
a small group of reporters Tuesday. Trade rumors involving Eddie
Jones, the acquisition of Dennis Rodman, which West adamantly
opposed, and the decision to dismiss Harris, a friend, made for a
difficult week. ``It hasn't been a very pleasant time for me
personally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he dropped out of sight. ``It kind of helps to step back and
look at things from a different perspective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   West watched the Lakers' four-game winning streak on television,
and while he's just as pleased as anyone, he stopped far short of
declaring the team's troubles over. He praised the work of Rambis
and called Rodman ``a genius'' but said the Lakers are far from
championship contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a honeymoon now, guys,'' West said. ``We've won four
straight games and I know someone is gonna be happy because we've
won four straight games. . . . We SHOULD be a good team. Are we
striving for something that we're not capable of at this point in
time? I don't think anyone knows that. We need to see improvement
in a lot of areas, and I think we will see improvement, I really
do.''
</P>
<P>
   How much better are the Lakers than the team that lost to Denver
and Vancouver a week ago? Hard to say. Two wins over the Clippers
don't mean much, but the wins against the Rockets and Suns did. Now
the Suns come to town for a rematch, and Seattle and Utah are up
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think by the end of this week we'll have a little bit better
idea how we shape up and are we making some improvements,'' West
said.
</P>
<P>
   __ West on the Worm: Privately, West fumed over the addition of
Rodman, and privately, he probably still is. But publicly, he
sounds like his biggest fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geniuses come in all different shapes. And as a basketball
player he has a genius to rebound, but he also has a genius to know
how to play the game. And that's a pretty good combination,'' West
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch him play, he's exactly what (was expected) _ an
infusion of energy, incredible basketball intelligence. Those are
the things this team probably needs, more people that can do the
things he has. . . . My goodness, you wish everyone had the same
effort he has when he's on the basketball court.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Taking it easy: Rambis held an optional practice Tuesday, and
11 of 15 players showed for light workouts. Only Rodman, Shaquille
O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Eddie Jones took the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys haven't had a true day off in a long time,'' Rambis
said. ``We've got some tough stuff coming up. We dragged a little
bit in the game (Monday). I just thought it was time for a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Elden Campbell, out two games with the flu, practiced for about
45 minutes and should be available tonight.

IN LANGUAGE SUNG BEST BY ITS OWN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It should be no surprise that Americans heavily populate foreign
opera companies. The soprano from Indiana University is usually
better educated than a lot of her counterparts elsewhere. Her voice
is healthy by virtue of what is coming to be known in the world as
the American technique of singing.
</P>
<P>
   She can negotiate three or four languages. Most likely, she has
played the piano since prepubescence. Italy, as a voice teacher
from Lucca once told me, has relatively few pianos, much less
people who learn music from playing them.
</P>
<P>
   Then why is it that Americans (with splendid exceptions) are
valued internationally more for their usefulness and versatility
than for intimate personal contact with Verdi or Puccini? And why
do Italians, often with sketchy musical backgrounds and faulty
technique, sometimes penetrate their roles more convincingly. As
Rodolfo, Richard Leech makes a beautiful sound; Luciano Pavarotti
in his best years inhabited the part.
</P>
<P>
   The question is easy to answer. Italian is the Italian's
language, and Puccini begins with words. Melody, harmony and rhythm
are his way of getting words off the printed page and into our
ears. Italian singers don't imitate their language's distinctive
vowels and consonants; the right sound is a birthright. And when a
word in a libretto bears specific emotional baggage, the Italian
shapes it without thinking.
</P>
<P>
   This all came up as I listened to Dawn Upshaw sing songs by
Vernon Duke on a Nonesuch CD and, not long after, heard songs in
English from the American years of Kurt Weill in Weill Recital
Hall. I'm not sure that Ms. Upshaw's operatic fastidiousness,
bordering on fussiness, or her operatic vibrato is right for Duke's
music, but I knew even before the piano introductions to ``April in
Paris'' or ``Autumn in New York'' had started that I would
understand the words. That is again no mystery: English is Ms.
Upshaw's language and mine.
</P>
<P>
   So never think that our hypothetical Italian is more musical or
has a bigger heart than our hypothetical American. The Italian is
at home in Puccini, and the American is just visiting. It works
both ways. Anyone who has listened to Enrico Caruso, Renata Tebaldi
or even such an eminent musical intelligence as Placido Domingo
struggle with English texts knows how close to ridiculous they can
sometimes sound. It's not their language. It's ours.
</P>
<P>
   Language and music are indistinguishable in other ways. The
flatness of American vowels not only captures a Cole Porter song;
the Cole Porter song may not have been imaginable without them. The
soft and recessed consonants of German must have something to do
with similar qualities in German-trained voices. And when the
French sing off key, it is not flat, as so often with the rest of
us, but sharp: above the pitch. Listen to the rising cadences of
French speech and its occupation of the nasal passages, and that is
also not hard to understand.
</P>
<P>
   When language fails music, singing as a dramatic language fails
as well. Hence the repertory of arm-waving, staggering and
head-holding that passes for theater in the opera house. These
exercises scarcely work as drama. They are more like a capitulation
_ a throwing-up of hands _ to the impossibility that music and
language will operate equally in the modern theater.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of big opera houses and the big, engulfing
technique needed for singers to be heard in them, even the
pleasures of Italian sung by Italians stand little chance. The
listener has two alternatives: first, to accept opera as an excuse
to hear beautiful singing, or second, to use the intermediaries of
titles to get at what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   The second gives you drama in the form of hearsay; it distracts
as much as it informs. The first gives you no drama at all. Anyone
who questions the death of words in the opera house need only note
the use of English titles for English-language librettos.
</P>
<P>
   For Monteverdi, Purcell and other operatic pioneers of the 17th
century, music was a conveyance for poetry aimed at small groups of
people. I don't think anyone will be purveying poems in the
Metropolitan Opera House (3,900 seats). Spaces like it, and even
those a lot smaller, dictate that opera will be a magnificent
musical and visual art. Similarly, vocal concerts with full
orchestra will be about sound, not texts.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Weill songs, in a hall holding only a few hundred,
``September Song'' and ``Speak Low'' spoke as well as sang. Weill's
music without the words of Maxwell Anderson or Ogden Nash was
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe opera as true theater has the best chance of reviving
itself in places like this, or in the living room, through
television and the record player. Ms. Upshaw makes contact one on
one by way of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Operas like Berg's ``Wozzeck'' manage to be text-driven, but
there are few like it. Still, we can all dream about a
studio-produced ``Boheme'' for television, a production shrunk to
conversational dimensions and as detailed in execution as an
episode of ``N.Y.P.D. Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Puccini's best opera is at heart chamber music, filled
with intricate ensembles and subtle exchanges. It is the thin
person trapped within the enormous fat of Franco Zeffirelli's Act
II at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   Big and spectacular opera has simply evolved, and it provides
great joys. But maybe there is room in small spaces for another
kind of opera, actually an old kind of opera that technology and a
little modesty might help us regain.

A MUSEUM FITTED OUT WITH FINNISH FLAIR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAULA DEITZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ Throughout the galleries at Kiasma, the new
Museum of Contemporary Art here, a ubiquitous black chair stands
like a silent fixture that could even be mistaken for sculpture. In
the cafe just off the street is another chair, one of translucent
green fiberglass that appears to float above the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The two types of chairs illustrate how the museum's designer,
the New York architect Steven Holl, incorporated Finnish design
into his plans for the new building and its furnishings. At a time
when much new architecture is almost interchangeable from country
to country, Kiasma is distinctive for the way it expresses the
national character of Finland and its landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The name itself describes an intertwining of genetic material,
but here it takes on a more metaphoric meaning, evoking the
confluence of the urban streets that surround the museum.
</P>
<P>
   On a dark wintry afternoon, the spectacle of the building's
curved, translucent glass wall, glowing from within like an
illuminated sheet of ice, has become a welcome lantern to people as
they wend their way home between snow drifts. The look is akin to
Finnish glass designs like Tapio Wirkkala's famous 1960 block of
cast glass called ``Paadar's Ice.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Holl, in the country that produced Alvar Aalto
and Eliel Saarinen, was how to design and furnish a museum that
lived up to their standards. One day, standing atop Aalto's
Finlandia Hall near the site of the new museum, Holl is reported to
have looked across the road at Saarinen's National Museum and said,
``Aalto did not borrow any details or furniture from Saarinen, and
out of respect we will avoid using any of Aalto's.''
</P>
<P>
   To discover the essence of Finnish design, Holl traveled to the
countryside to visit a craft village called Fiskars. Situated
between Helsinki and Turco, it is a collection of 19th-century
industrial buildings and workers' housing once occupied by the
Fiskars metalworks company, manufacturers of the popular
orange-handled scissors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, artists, designers and artisans have
moved into the vacant buildings, and the village, along with its
cooperative exhibition gallery, has become an important showcase of
Finnish design.
</P>
<P>
   The village is especially picturesque blanketed in snow on a
bright sunny day with mists rising from the river that winds
through the town. The gallery Holl visited was just above the
rapids in an old copper smith's workshop.
</P>
<P>
   Among the furniture exhibits was a simple chair designed by Kari
Virtanen, regarded as one of the best cabinetmakers in Finland. He
recalled Holl having said during his visit, ``This is a good chair
because it is a silent chair and not overdesigned.''
</P>
<P>
   Holl saw the chair as a perfect fit for Kiasma's spacious
galleries, which he views as empty barnlike spaces for the display
of art.
</P>
<P>
   Fabricating the chair then became a local industry.
Square-looking with square legs and a slightly tilted back rest
that fits the small of the back, the chair was fashioned of birch
and painted dull black to blend with the black-dyed concrete floors
of the galleries. (The original design was altered slightly so that
the chairs could be stacked when not in use.)
</P>
<P>
   Virtanen and his crew made 174 such chairs, 60 for children and
various tables, including the director's desk.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe chair drew on another traditional Finnish design
industry: shipbuilding. Since the cafe was to be a lively public
space, it required a different sort of chair. Holl, who is also
well known for his watercolors, did a sketch of a chair in green
with a tongue-shaped seat. Vesa Honkonen, the project architect for
Kiasma, recalled that the sketch reflected Holl's fascination with
Andy Warhol's trademark green sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   When the cost of manufacturing the chairs in plastic became
prohibitive, the designers resorted to fiberglass and the
experience of Finnish shipbuilders to achieve a high-quality
translucency and the right shade of green. To make the chair appear
lightweight, the sand-cast aluminum legs had to be fabricated as
separate parts.
</P>
<P>
   A Finnish sculptor, Ilona Rista, fashioned the legs in wood as a
model for the mold. The cafe tables with aluminum pedestals are
topped by reddened brass like that on the facade above the entrance
to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the blown glass lights in the cafe that sparkle like
ice cubes, these chairs are another example of Holl's ideas about
natural light and translucency that make the museum a luminous
presence in the urban landscape.

SUSPECT SAYS TREASURY FUNDS RETURNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN AND LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The defense strategy emerging for the businessman
charged in the alleged theft of $6.5 million from the state's
Unpaid Check Fund will be that he attempted to give the money back
to the state, according to Robbins' lawyer and others.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Albert F. Cullen Jr. said in an interview Tuesday that
Martin Robbins sent a check for $6.5 million, plus interest,
written on his account at BankBoston to the state treasurer's
office on Feb. 11. Delivered by a courier service, the check was
made out a day after Robbins was rebuffed in his effort to withdraw
the money in cash.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter that accompanied the check, Robbins wrote that he
was returning the money on the advice of his attorney and
accountant because he had learned that the Cambridge Economic
Development Corporation, which had been given the money three
months before, was ``not in existence.'' Robbins had secured the
money from the Unpaid Check Fund by claiming that he represented
the firm as an ``heir finder,'' those who track down the rightful
owners of uncashed state checks, in return for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   The defense strategy for Robbins recalls that of another
defendant in a celebrated local corruption case: former state
senator Vincent Piro of Somerville. In 1985, Piro was acquitted of
charges that he accepted a $5,000 bribe from a federal undercover
agent after successfully arguing that he had been entrapped into
accepting the money and that he had returned it three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   However, to convince any jury to acquit Robbins, Cullen will
have to confront key discrepancies in Robbins' account of why he
gave back the money, as well as other allegations that point to his
involvement with co-defendant John F. Trischitta in the $6.5
million theft.
</P>
<P>
   They include:
</P>
<P>
   --Robbins paid Trischitta, who headed the fund, a $50,000 bribe
to get him to approve the issuance of the $6.5 million check to
Cambridge Economic Development Corporation, according to the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   --Robbins' bank account contained another half-million dollars
that investigators believe may have come from other apparently
illegal withdrawals from the Unpaid Check Fund.
</P>
<P>
   --Trischitta cooperated with investigators, at least until the
time of his arrest on Feb. 19, and, according to sources, confirmed
some of their suspicions about his dealings with Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Carol Ann Starkey said at
Trischitta's arraignment that in exchange for ``services and
information,'' Robbins had paid Trischitta the bribe money and
agreed to split a third of all fees he gained as an heir finder.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Starkey, Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly, nor
State Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien made reference to Robbins'
effort to return the money in their Feb. 19 press conference
announcing that Robbins and Trischitta had been charged in the
case. Spokesmen for both Reilly and O'Brien declined to comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Following Robbins' arraignment in Boston Municipal Court on Feb.
22, Cullen told reporters that Robbins had returned the money to
the state when he became concerned about the validity of his claim
to it. Robbins called unnamed officials at the Cambridge Economic
Development Corporation, and on learning that the corporation was
not owed any money from the state he returned it, Cullen said.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, dated Feb. 11, to Trischitta, Robbins wrote: ``I
am returning these funds based upon advice received from my
attorney and accountant since the Cambridge Economic Development
Corporation is no longer in existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullen confirmed the wording of the letter but declined to
answer other questions about the case against Robbins, of Peabody.
According to sources, the envelope containing the letter and check
was delivered by a messenger from Boston Bicycle Couriers to
Trischitta's office on the 12th floor at 1 Ashburton Place on the
morning of Feb. 12. State Police investigators, having been alerted
to Robbins' attempt to withdraw the money in cash on Feb. 10, were
already in Trischitta's office and took control of the check and
the letter.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston spokesman Bruce Spitzer declined comment, saying:
``We cannot confirm or deny any specific details because of the
ongoing investigation by law enforcement officials.''
</P>
<P>
   But a source said Robbins transferred the money from an escrow
account he had set up under the name of ECDEV _ apparently a
reference to Cambridge Economic Development Corporation _ to one in
the name of his heir-finder firm, Robbins Associates. The source
said he then wrote a Robbins Associates check to the Commonwealth.
There were no BankBoston signatures on the check, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investigators have seized documents from
Trischitta's office that cast doubt on Robbins' version of events,
sources said. They include the power-of-attorney document that
Robbins submitted under the signature of the former treasurer of
Cambridge Economic Development Corporation stating that Robbins is
authorized to receive the $6.5 million on behalf of the firm.
However, Robert DeGregorio, the former treasurer, has already told
investigators that his signature on the document is a forgery,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, although Robbins contended in his letter that the
Cambridge Economic Development Corporation was defunct, state
records show that an identically named company had been
incorporated six weeks before. The president and treasurer of the
company is listed as Judith Fagin, of New York, whom a former
employee of Robbins' heir-finder business told the Globe had worked
for Robbins last year. Fagin has not returned calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reilly Tuesday called for an end to the heir-finder
industry in Massachusetts. ``We should end this practice right now
until people have an opportunity to evaluate other alternatives,''
Reilly said. ``It may very well be the state can do this.'' He was
referring to the practice of having state employees work as heir
finders.
</P>
<P>
   Treasurer O'Brien said she wants to have four heir finders on
staff at the Abandoned Property Division, which is where unpaid
checks are moved after being outstanding for 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Former treasurer Joseph D. Malone had two state heir finders,
both of whom have left. His predecessor, Robert Crane, had eight
in-house heir finders. ``I think there should be a happy medium,''
O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she also wants to cap at 10 percent the fee heir
finders can charge when reuniting owners with their unpaid state
checks. Currently there is no limit on what heir finders can charge
individuals and firms owed money from the state's Unpaid Check
Fund, even though they are restricted to a maximum 10 percent fee
when locating people who are owed assets from the Abandoned
Property Division.

U.N. PANEL CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL TO TRY TOP KHMER ROUGE
OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing) (sw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A U.N. panel has recommended that a new
international tribunal be convened to try about a dozen senior
Khmer Rouge officials on charges of crimes against humanity while
they ruled Cambodia, according to diplomats and senior
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Under the recommendation, a separate Cambodian truth commission
would consider all other cases.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the growing tensions between China and the
United States, the Chinese have told administration officials who
are actively lobbying for a tribunal that Beijing will veto the
idea if it is brought before the U.N. Security Council, these
officials said. The Khmer Rouge relied almost exclusively on
Chinese support during their reign that led to the deaths of nearly
two million Cambodians from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has always emphasized it defers to the domestic decision
of Cambodia,'' said a senior Clinton administration official who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The only way the Chinese will
not veto this is if the Cambodian government goes to the U.N.
Security Council and asks for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation for a tribunal was given to the Cambodian
prime minister, Hun Sen, last week, but will not officially be made
public for several weeks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In contradictory statements over the last two months, Hun Sen
has alternatively complained that the world is at least a decade
late in condemning the Khmer Rouge, has given half-hearted support
for an international tribunal, and has questioned whether a trial
would lead to new violence.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Hun Sen has grown closer to China, signing
five new agreements in Beijing last month that provide Cambodia
with increased trade and economic benefits. Meanwhile, Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan of China said last month in Bangkok that
Western nations, especially the United States, had come up with the
idea of trying the Khmer Rouge, which he said was inappropriate
since ``these are internal problems of Cambodia'' and should be
decided only by the Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has outmaneuvered the United States once again,'' said
Stephen R. Heder, a Cambodia scholar at the School of Oriental and
African Studies in London. ``It's highly unlikely that Hun Sen can
be turned around. He's been prepared to have a trial or not have a
trial depending on the highest bid, and China and its friends are
willing to give him economic benefits, security guarantees and
general diplomatic support that the United States can't offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, however, does contain a way to circumvent a
possible Chinese veto. The proposed International Criminal Tribunal
for Cambodia could be put before the U.N. General Assembly for a
vote should it be blocked in the Security Council. But the five
permanent members of the Security Council, including the United
States, are wary of setting such a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Written by three outside experts, the proposal for a Cambodia
tribunal includes innovations based on the experiences in
Yugoslavia, Rwanda and South Africa, among other countries,
according to officials. To set up the tribunal quickly and to save
money, the offices of the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and
Rwanda would be used. The trial of the top dozen or more officials
would be held outside Cambodia, either at the Hague, in Manila or
in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   The truth commission, which was the idea of Thomas Hammaberg,
the U.N. secretary general's special representative on human rights
in Cambodia, would be established in Cambodia and would allow
Cambodians to have a full airing of what went on in one of this
century's worst cases of mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good balance of the twin imperatives of justice and
national reconciliation,`` said Craig Etcheson, program director of
The International Monitor Institute and the former head of the
Cambodian Documentation Center. ``You establish a record through
the tribunal and at the same time you allow Cambodians to feel that
their suffering has been acknowledged and to find their way to
reach social reconciliation within their community.``
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen also said he is reticent about approving a tribunal
because world powers ignored his requests for nearly two decades to
set up a Khmer Rouge trial, waiting until it suited the timetable
of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   From 1979 to 1991, Cambodia was hostage to the Asian cold war,
and the United States, among other countries, would not officially
acknowledge that the Khmer Rouge had committed mass killings for
fear of upsetting China. Thereafter, the Khmer Rouge signed a peace
treaty with the other warring parties in the Cambodian civil war,
and other countries were reluctant to upset Cambodia's delicate
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in 1997 that a real push began, stimulated in part
by Hun Sen and his then co-prime minister, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh. They petitioned the secretary general that June asking
``for the assistance of the United Nations and the international
community in bringing to justice those persons responsible for the
genocide and crimes against humanity during the rule of the Khmer
Rouge from 1975 to 1979.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that Cambodia did not have the ``resources or the
expertise'' to conduct a trial on its own, Hun Sen argued in this
letter that ``only in this way can this tragedy be brought to a
full and final conclusion.``
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, however, Hun Sen overthrew Ranariddh and his
ardor for a trial has cooled ever since.
</P>
<P>
   There is little dispute over which Khmer Rouge leaders should be
tried and whether there is sufficient evidence to convict them. At
the top of the list is Nuon Chea, second to Pol Pot, the head of
the regime, followed by Ta Mok and Khieu Samphan. Nuon Chea and
Khieu Samphan turned themselves in to Hun Sen's government last
December and are living in a western Cambodian city with other
Khmer Rouge defectors. Ta Mok is at large in the jungles of western
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against the Khmer Rouge has been growing since
their government was overthrown in 1979 and has been collected
through the Cambodia Documentation Center under a grant from the
State Department in cooperation with Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   While Secretary General Kofi Annan has yet to read the proposal,
senior U.N. officials say he is worried about the precedent set by
the arrest in Great Britain of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former
Chilean dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary general is listening to the Pinochet argument
that it is better to bury the mistakes of the past,`` said one
senior U.N. official.

CHRONICLERS OF WAYWARD SOULS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Country has long been packaged as the classical music of simple
American folks. The transformation of hillbilly entertainment into
an official repository of our national traditions has extended from
the fancy naming of the Grand Ole Opry in 1927 to the appointment
of William Ivey, the director of the Country Music Hall of Fame, to
the chair of the National Endowment for the Arts in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Not only Nashville's music industry, but also the
``alternative'' country made by rock- and folk-schooled rebels can
be discouragingly orthodox, its vintage trappings turning cultural
preservation into historical tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet country music is also grounded in dislocation _ in the
stories of people facing upheaval in their home towns, their
families, their daily life. This is a modern music, tied like the
blues to the journeys of working people across America and the
encroachment of the city on rural life.
</P>
<P>
   The poor wayfaring stranger is as much a honky-tonk cliche as
Mama making cornbread, and as country's patina grows ever more
nostalgic, even that character's vagrancy becomes strangely fixed.
Exile has become another form of home in country, invoked with a
warm glow.
</P>
<P>
   Country music finds its power in the tension between nostalgia
and the need for change, a contradiction mined on two new albums by
established iconoclasts. ``The Mountain,'' by Steve Earle with the
Del McCoury Band, investigates country's most classical form,
bluegrass. ``What I Deserve,'' by Kelly Willis, is more eclectic.
Both Earle and Ms. Willis succeed where many of their
contemporaries fail by keeping their focus on restlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mountain'' (E Squared, CD, CD 1063-2) is an art project in
denim and work boots, a self-conscious effort by Earle to pay
homage to the bluegrass pantheon if not enter it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My primary motive in writing these songs was both selfish and
ambitious _ immortality,'' he writes in the album's liner notes,
and on some songs he has achieved an almost eerie timelessness.
It's hard to believe that the murder ballad ``Carrie Brown'' or the
funeral hymn ``Pilgrim'' hasn't been sung by anonymous town criers
for a century, but it's also easy to forget that the plaintive form
of ``country jazz'' that Earle is reproducing emerged a mere half
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Working with the virtuoso ensemble the Del McCoury Band, Earle
matches venerable themes of heartbreak and war, workingman's
struggles and outlaw romance to his casually expert compositions.
His patented rocker's snarl meshes with Del McCoury's unearthly
wail to form a link across the generations of country renegades.
</P>
<P>
   The album's musicianship is notable; its guest roster features
many of bluegrass' finest players plus the alternative-country
stars Emmylou Harris, Gillian Welch and Iris DeMent. But Earle's
songs make ``The Mountain'' more than a fine generic exercise as
they trace a path of displacement throughout American history.
</P>
<P>
   Earle has often chronicled the violence of modernization; his
early forays into country-rock updated that theme with a
Southernized Springsteen sound and a countercultural attitude. Like
those early albums, ``The Mountain'' uses its musical focus to
further a strong social agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Earle seeks a common voice grounded not in wistful memory but in
thorny reality; his ramblers are the former high school football
heroes, drug dealers, gas station attendants and homeless people of
the New South. ``The Mountain'' finds counterparts for those
characters in Civil War tales and corny love songs.
</P>
<P>
   The album begins with ``Texas Eagle,'' an ode to trains made
unsentimental by its acknowledgment of the American rail system's
economic woes. It moves through Irish immigration and the
Depression's Dust Bowl before settling in heaven's waiting room
with ``Pilgrim.'' There is nothing but motion on ``The Mountain,''
nothing but anxious progress.
</P>
<P>
   Earle drives this point home with the album's title track, in
which the miner who declared his undying pride of place in ``Harlan
Man'' finds his beloved mountain ravaged and himself devastated by
the march of industrial capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   In Earle's ruthless vision, those who stand fast against cruel
change can only hope for obsolescence. By setting his anthology of
wandering to the lonesome tones of bluegrass, Earle disturbs the
complacent aura that can sometimes overwhelm country classicism.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Willis challenges a different set of rules with ``What I
Deserve,'' her new album for the independent label Rykodisc (CD,
RCD 10458). Ms. Willis made three albums for MCA Nashville in the
early 1990s and had modest success, but she never fit into the
industry machine. Living in Austin, Texas, she allied herself with
the line of singer-songwriters that travels between country, folk,
and rock.
</P>
<P>
   Free to explore fully the place where those poles meet, Ms.
Willis has emerged with a rich representation of the unsettled
life. It begins, like so many in pop, with a bad love affair.
``Take Me Down,'' written with Gary Louris of the Jayhawks, is a
sweet swoon of co-dependency; the title track, also written with
Louris, chronicles a more complicated crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Set to a loping beat knocked off-kilter by Chuck Prophet's
phase-shifted guitar, ``What I Deserve'' is the confused lament of
an ambitious woman. Refusing to take solace in prayer, the beauty
of nature or any other old-fashioned balm, Ms. Willis lambastes
herself for never slowing down and the world for suggesting that
she should.
</P>
<P>
   This particularly feminine, very current perspective on
emotional ambivalence enriches ``What I Deserve.'' Ms. Willis has a
honey-lemon voice that can be as soothing as a lozenge, and it
works that way on a lullabye like Paul Kelly's ``Cradle of Love,''
but she mostly she uses it in the service of more wayward desires.
</P>
<P>
   She offers painful tales of lost love but then expresses the
resolve to move on. Hovering between romantic fantasy and deflated
realism, Ms. Willis taps a rare subtlety of feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I Deserve'' often returns to the subject of contentment,
something Ms. Willis doesn't pretend to grasp fully. ``If I ran so
far that my life can't follow me, would it keep the world from up
and swallowing me?'' she sings in ``Fading Fast''; with such a
phrase, she makes the saga of the wayfaring stranger internal and
completely contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Like Earle, Ms. Willis knows that the itinerant world is no
paradise, but she's not willing to pretend that there's any other
place like home, even for a simple country girl.

UCLA PRESSES ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Without injured center Dan Gadzuric, the Bruins
believe the best way to combat late-season pressure is with
pressure of their own _ a swarming, relentless, full-court press
that created 81 turnovers in three games against Syracuse and the
Washington schools.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past years, when a shallow bench and fear of fatigue
prevented them from pressing, the Bruins have the manpower to
attack as often as they like. Tactically, it makes sense.
Gadzuric's absence has forced them to mask their weakness (size) by
accentuating their strength (speed).
</P>
<P>
   ``We were building towards wanting to press and we've
accelerated the use of the press because Dan got hurt,'' UCLA coach
Steve Lavin said. ``In past years, we couldn't stay with it for
sustained periods of time. But with the combination of depth and
Dan's absence, we have to extend our defense to create the tempo we
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Three factors have made the press productive:
</P>
<P>
   __ Forward Matt Barnes, with his 6-foot-8 frame and long arms,
is an ideal front man. His size forces opponents to throw bounce
passes and lob passes upcourt, and they're easy to intercept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is no straight-line passes,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Baron Davis thrives as the center fielder. Stationed near
midcourt, Davis' job is to snatch long passes. Usually, he does it
with space to maneuver, accelerating UCLA's conversion from defense
to offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's special back there,'' Lavin said. ``He's like Lester
Hayes or Ronnie Lott. He's good at reading and anticipating. He
reads the eyes of the passers.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Davis' dream was to play safety for Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Bruins have become more efficient. Instead of stealing
the ball directly from an offensive player, they're stealing the
passes, enabling them to pressure without fouling.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success, the Bruins might not apply constant
pressure this weekend. More likely, they'll use it to increase
tempo at selected moments. It's also an effective means of
preventing Arizona point guard Jason Terry from dictating play.
</P>
<P>
   __ The healing begins: Gadzuric has started a preliminary
rehabilitation program to prevent muscle atrophy and restore range
of motion in his left knee. In about six weeks, when his repaired
meniscus cartilage has healed, he'll begin a more strenuous
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be able to resume normal activity in about three
months and there should be no permanent effects from the injury,''
said Dr. Matthew Shapiro, who performed the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Guard Earl Watson (bruised quadriceps) and
forward JaRon Rush, who was briefly knocked unconscious against
Washington, are expected to play Thursday at Arizona State. Rush
did not practice Tuesday because of the flu. . . . Thursday's game
begins at 5:30 p.m. and will be broadcast on a tape-delayed basis
at 10 p.m. on Fox Sports West 2.

   NEW YORK _ One day after a federal jury found a veteran Nassau
County jail guard liable for the brutal beating of a mentally
retarded inmate, Nassau officials abruptly agreed on Tuesday to pay
the former inmate $500,000 to settle his civil rights lawsuit
against the county.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement put an end to a four-day trial that had already
painted a damaging portrait of one man's ordeal at the jail and
would have raised an array of allegations against several other
guards, had it continued. It also ended the possibility of a huge
jury award against the county.
</P>
<P>
   The guard found liable, Salvatore Gemelli, a 15-year veteran,
was dismissed by Sheriff Joseph Jablonsky on Monday, shortly after
a U.S. district court jury ruled that he had violated the civil
rights of Thomas Donovan Jr. by attacking him at the jail in 1993.
The beating left Donovan with broken ribs and spinal fractures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liability judgment speaks for itself,'' Jablonsky said.
``Obviously, Mr. Gemelli was involved in improper behavior. It is a
black mark against the entire department, starting with me all the
way down.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement concluded the fifth brutality case to be filed by
former jail inmates against Gemelli. Together, those cases have
cost the county $900,000 in jury awards and out-of-court
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's father, Thomas Donovan Sr., said he was pleased with
the settlement. ``I am totally satisfied that justice has been
done.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped the case would encourage Nassau County
officials, who have spent years investigating brutality charges
with little results, to change what many critics say is a
systematic pattern of abuse at the jail. ``If my little son, with
his limited IQ, can beat these guys,'' Donovan added, ``then why
can't the DA, with all his resources, beat them?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the jail remains the focus of an investigation by the
U.S. attorney's office into other reports that jail guards have
beaten inmates. That inquiry began after the Jan. 13 death of
Thomas Pizzuto, 38, an inmate whose family says he was beaten by
guards and then left untreated for days.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Barber, the president of the unit of the Civil Service
Employees Union that that represents 1,000 Nassau County
correctional officers, said Gemelli's dismissal was an attempt by
county officials to avoid any blame in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a personal attack on Sal because he's a union
official,'' Barber said.

TURNING BACK FROM FILMS TO LONG FORGOTTEN PHOTOS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (David Hay is a playwright and journalist who writes about the arts
from Los Angeles.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Standing in the courtyard of Harold Becker's
Hollywood Hills home is a 10-foot-tall wooden frame that bears a
striking resemblance to a guillotine. Halfway down, however, rests
not a murderously sharp blade but rather an old-fashioned camera,
its black bellows extending nearly three feet from the lens to an
11-by-14-inch glass panel at the rear.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like a piece of elegant furniture, perfectly
appropriate for a house belonging to the director of ``Sea of
Love'' and ``City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than 30 years ago, before he got into movies, when he
was a commercial photographer in New York, Becker restored this
1920s camera to working order. He used it to take a series of
abstract portraits of the female form.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the camera's unusually large format, the texture of
the skin and the contours of the body could be revealed in surreal
detail. In a photograph titled ``Nude Study No. 3,'' for example, a
viewer first sees a vast map of tiny cracks in the skin of a
model's shaved leg before being surprised by a harsh callous
protruding from her heel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This image is included in an exhibition of Becker's photography
that opened in Los Angeles last month at the New Alchemy Gallery.
The show is the fifth in a series titled ``Still/Moving'' and runs
through April 6. Since last May, it has been a showcase for the
still photography of Hollywood professionals, for the most part
cinematographers.
</P>
<P>
   Becker, sitting in his office at the Warner-Hollywood Studios,
confessed that the invitation to be part of ``Still/Moving'' had at
first sent him into a panic. The original photographs had been an
experiment; he had never envisioned exhibiting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not framed the bulk of the work, and I hadn't kept track
of where any of it was,'' he said. Digging through boxes in his
house, he was relieved to discover the negatives. Printed once
again, the results surprised him. ``I like them better now than I
did then,'' said Becker, who is 65. ``They have some weight to
them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The unearthing of his photographs mirrors the experience of many
of the Hollywood professionals whose work is being shown in the
``Still/Moving'' series. Few had picked up their still cameras with
the idea that the results would be seen in public. Whatever
photographs they took were rarely on display, even in their own
homes. Most had forgotten about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense we have discovered art that otherwise
wouldn't have existed,'' said Laurie Frank, a screenwriter and a
curator of ``Still/Moving.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the most startling discoveries were early photographs
taken by the Academy Award-winning cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond,
who is now 68. Fleeing his native Hungary in 1956, he left his
negatives behind; luckily, a close friend and cinematographer,
Tibor Vajyoczky, went to Zsigmond's apartment and picked them up.
When Zsigmond next returned to Budapest, in 1966, Vajyoczky handed
them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't ever think about them; I was so sure they were
lost,'' Zsigmond said. One of his photographs has become the
best-selling print at the exhibitions: a 1954 self-portrait, titled
``Vilmos' World'' by the curators in an obvious nod to Andrew
Wyeth's ``Christina's World.'' Zsigmond had originally placed his
girlfriend in the composition before deciding, on a whim, to use
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for ``Still/Moving'' came when Ms. Frank's
partner, Floyd Byars, also a screenwriter, attended a benefit
auction for the Open Magnet Charter School in Los Angeles. On the
block was a photograph of the Los Angeles riots, ``Pico Boulevard
at 6:45 P.M., 4/30/92.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture had been taken by Phil Parmut, a cinematographer on
the Academy Award-winning documentary ``Harlan County.'' Byars took
one look at the photograph and snapped it up. At the framing shop,
he got into a discussion about the fact that many cinematographers
were also excellent still photographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two months later, I was walking down Melrose Avenue, and I ran
into the guy from the framing store,'' Byars said. ``He had now
opened his own gallery on Melrose.''
</P>
<P>
   The gallery was the New Alchemy and the owner was Thomas Parker,
who suggested that they put on a show. Byars demurred but
remembered that he had ``a friend with good taste and a Rolodex the
size of the Ritz.'' This was Ms. Frank. Twelve hundred people
turned up at the opening of the first ``Still/Moving'' exhibition,
which showed the work of Zsigmond alongside that of Parmut.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent exhibition featured the photographs of two-time
Oscar winner Haskell Wexler as well as huge photographic collages
assembled by the documentary cinematographer Christine Burrill.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In October, Stephen Goldblatt, the cinematographer on ``The
Hunger'' and ``Batman Forever,'' exhibited some of his London
shots. They included his 1968 portraits of the Beatles, the last
taken of the group. In the same show were sensuous desert
landscapes by Karl Herrmann, the visual-effects camera operator on
``The Right Stuff'' and ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another ``Still/Moving'' exhibit featured 100 miniature
photographs by Mike Figgis, the director of ``Leaving Las Vegas.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the curators will present stills taken by three
generations of cinematographers in the Suschitsky family: Peter
Suschitsky, who photographed ``The Empire Strikes Back'' as well as
David Cronenberg's ``Dead Ringers,'' will be joined by his his son,
Tom, and his father, Wolfgang.
</P>
<P>
   The positive reaction to the ``Still/Moving'' series in Los
Angeles has led the curators to seek exhibitions in New York and
Paris. They have also created a Web site, www.still-moving.com,
where the photographs from the exhibitions can be seen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult task facing the two curators, who became
friends when they wrote the screenplay for the 1987 film ``Making
Mr. Right,'' was persuading the cinematographers to let their
photographs be shown. ``We had to plead with Vilmos Zsigmond,''
recalled Ms. Frank, an elegantly thin woman in her mid-40s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such resistance comes about in part because cinematography is a
group activity, so when cameramen pick up their still cameras they
are looking for peace and privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are taking your pictures, there is no one there with
you, no director, no production designer, none of the crew,'' said
Zsigmond, who rarely goes out without his 35mm still camera. The
result is more personal. ``A movie frame you can't claim as your
own,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The still photograph also challenges the ways in which these
cinematographers compose an image. ``The moment of capturing an
instant on still film is so different from the continuous imaging
of shooting a movie,'' said Lisa Rinzler, a New York-based
cinematographer, in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rinzler, who is 45, won the award for best cinematography at
the recent Sundance Film Festival for her work on the forthcoming
``Three Seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to her photograph of a 1992 boxing match in the
Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, Ms. Rinzler said that if she had
been shooting the event with a movie camera, she would have been
``all over it.'' With enough carefully shot footage, the meaning of
this scene to her _ how boxing is both violent yet intimate _ would
be there somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas,'' she said, ``in still photography, the question
always is, Am I going to get it in a single image?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The photographs in the ``Still/Moving'' series, which rarely
center on the film industry, serve as records of the private lives
and passions of these Hollywood insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Parmut, for example, who has shot independent features like
Alexander Rockwell's ``In the Soup,'' exhibited 20 photographs
taken over two decades in such places as Haiti, Israel and New
York. Captured in moments of crisis, his subjects look directly,
often harshly, into the lens.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that sort of crucible, people are more likely not to be
hiding behind their normal facades,'' said Parmut, 56. He did not
have to travel far for his powerful images of Los Angeles' riots;
they were photographed barely a block from his apartment in the
Carthay Circle area of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The artistic freedom and solace offered the still photographer
has yet to persuade any of those featured in the ``Still/Moving''
exhibitions to leave their industry jobs, although Becker confessed
that rediscovering his stills had reawakened something in him.
``When I look at these stills,'' he said, ``I get scared that they
will draw me back into that world all over again.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After years of negotiations that were completed
only two minutes before the deadline of midnight on Monday, federal
and state officials and Pacific Lumber Co. have agreed to a
landmark $480-million deal that will turn the largest privately
owned grove of ancient redwood trees in the world into a public
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   The complex deal, which government officials said was as
significant as turning Yosemite and the Grand Canyon into national
parks, will preserve about 10,000 acres of giant redwoods in
Humboldt County, about 250 miles north of here, including the
majestic Headwaters forest and some smaller groves.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is significant because only 3 percent of the
nation's original redwood trees, some of them 2,000 years old,
remain unlogged, and it marks the biggest government acquisition of
land in California since the creation of Redwood National Park 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., an architect of the agreement,
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, Gov. Gray Davis, and President
Clinton all called the deal ``historic'' on Tuesday. Clinton said:
``I am truly grateful that we are able to bestow this priceless
gift on generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But some environmental groups were unhappy with the deal, saying
that it did not do enough to protect endangered species and
expressing deep skepticism about what the government may have
conceded to the lumber company at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, capping one of the longest-running environmental
stories in recent history, was more than 10 years in the making.
The most contentious part of the plan requires Pacific Lumber, the
largest private logger of old-growth redwoods in the country, to
agree to a 50-year Habitat Conservation Plan governing how it logs
its remaining 211,000 acres of timber.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, the boards of Pacific Lumber, based in
Scotia, on the northern California coast, and its Houston-based
parent company, Maxxam Corp., rejected the proposal, contending
that environmental restrictions added to the deal in recent months
would cripple the company and force hundreds of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Maxxam's stock price tumbled on Monday, in the first trading
after it rejected the deal, but it rose more than 20 percent on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell, president of Pacific Lumber, said the revival of
the deal had nothing to do with the stock's plunging.
</P>
<P>
   Both government and company officials said that the contract,
which was signed two minutes before the federal government's
$250-million offer for its share of the purchase was scheduled to
expire, was essentially unchanged. What was different, they said,
was the interpretation of how much Pacific Lumber could harvest
under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The state had projected the company could harvest 136 million to
137 million board feet a year, far below the 210 million board feet
the company said it needed. But federal officials said that the
state figures had been interpreted incorrectly. ``That's a figure
that we can accept,'' he said. The government said the figure was
more like 179 million.
</P>
<P>
   In what sounded like another change in the deal, Campbell added
that Pacific Lumber would be able to cut trees selectively on about
60,000 acres of unstable ground even before watershed analysis is
done that will determine ``no-cut'' buffer zones around streams
where the endangered coho salmon swims. ``They have decided it is
appropriate for us to selectively log while we do the watershed
assessment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Ahearn, a spokesman for Babbitt, said no concessions had
been made that would compromise the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Environmental Protection Information Center, a
watchdog that has filed numerous lawsuits against Pacific Lumber,
said that it sounded as though the federal government had given the
company a wink and a nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``You show me how you can come up with 45 million additional
board feet a year without changing a comma, and I'll show you
something fishy going on,'' said Kevin Bundy, a spokesman for the
organization. ``We're going to be looking at this very closely to
see whether the government is willing to sacrifice an endangered
salmon in order to help a company finance its debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber is $865 million in debt. In 1985, Charles
Hurwitz, the president of Maxxam, acquired the then-family-owned
logging company for $900 million in a hostile takeover using junk
bonds. Shortly after Maxxam acquired Pacific Lumber, it tripled its
logging output to finance its purchase. The noticeable increase in
logging set off continuous environmental protests _ including the
largest forest rally in the country in 1996 _ as well as lawsuits
by environmental groups charging the company with violating the
Endangered Species Act and Clean Water Acts.
</P>
<P>
   Under those acts, Pacific Lumber would not be able to log
Headwaters and other ancient redwood groves because of danger to a
number of threatened and endangered species, including the coho
salmon and the marbled murrelet, a seabird that nests on the tops
of old-growth redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   But Hurwitz sued the federal government, arguing that Pacific
Lumber was entitled to compensation for land that the government
was preventing it from using. The lawsuit, called a ``takings''
lawsuit, was expected to be a long and expensive headache for the
government, which decided to deal with Pacific Lumber rather than
engage in a costly and lengthy court fight.
</P>
<P>
   Congress appropriated $250 million for the Headwaters purchase,
and the state of California is to pay $130 million now and $100
million over five years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Sierra Club applauded the deal, saying it was satisfied that
habitats would be protected. But some other environmental groups
said that they remain suspicious about whether the government will
be able to properly monitor whether Pacific Lumber adheres to the
plan. In the last three years, the company has been cited for 128
violations of state forestry rules.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the California Department of Forestry suspended
Pacific Lumber's license to log, citing continual and egregious
violations. The suspension was cited for 180 layoffs out of a labor
force of 1,600 employees. But it did not affect the company's
ability to log because the suspension did not include logging done
by subcontractors for the company.
</P>
<P>
   In Berkeley, Calif., on Tuesday, members of a number of
environmental groups called a news conference to declare they would
continue protests against Pacific Lumber.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who calls herself Julia Butterfly, who has lived in a
tree for more than a year to protest the company's logging
practices, spoke at the conference by cellular phone from her tree.
``We will not rest, we will not give up, we will not go away until
we see the necessary protections for the forest,'' she said, as a
windstorm blew around her.

JUDGE TO INTERVIEW GRAND JURORS IN POLICE SLAYING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Bronx judge said on Tuesday that he would interview
members of the grand jury hearing evidence in the Amadou Diallo
shooting case before making a final decision on whether to delay
and possibly move the inquest to a secret location.
</P>
<P>
   There have been demonstrations nearly every day outside state
Supreme Court in the Bronx, a block from where the grand jury is
impaneled in Criminal Court. And lawyers for three of the four
police officers involved in the killing of Diallo, 22, filed the
motion seeking to delay the proceedings and change the venue last
week, asserting that the ``inflammatory atmosphere'' outside the
courthouse had unduly influenced the grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not delay the grand jury proceedings on Tuesday,
Justice Robert Seewald declined to close the door on the issue,
saying he wanted to determine whether the jurors had been tainted
by the wealth of publicity surrounding the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made a tentative decision, denying at this juncture to
stay the proceedings or move the grand jury,'' said Bruce
Goldstock, Seewald's clerk. ``But that could change, depending on
the outcome of the interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstock said that Seewald would conduct separate, closed-door
interviews with each of the 23 jurors sometime within the week.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury was convened on Feb. 16 to decide if charges
should be filed against the four officers who fired 41 shots at
Diallo, who was unarmed, on Feb. 4, as he stood in the vestibule of
his apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   If indicted, the four officers _ Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon,
Richard Murphy and Kenneth Boss _ could face charges ranging from
criminally negligent homicide to second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the judge's decision was a sensible approach
to a potentially thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge is saying that he is going to make sure there is no
improper influence, which I think is a reasonable action for him to
take,'' said Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University
School of Law. ``But I don't think that the judge's subsequent
inquiry will change the result of his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx District Attorney's
office, would not comment on the judge's move. But Stephen Worth, a
police union lawyer who is representing Officer McMellon in the
inquiry, said that while Tuesday's decision was far from a victory
for the officers, he was pleased that the judge ``had the courage
to recognize the extraordinary situation occurring here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although none of the officers involved in Diallo's killing have
agreed to testify before the grand jury, Worth said that he and the
lawyers representing Murphy and Boss would be more likely to offer
up their clients if the motion was decided in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is required is for the drums to stop beating, for the
daily media events to stop and let a period of time pass so that
the grand jury can focus their attention on what is happening in
the grand jury room, instead of what's happening outside,'' he
said. ``Then, our clients would in all likelihood testify. We all
made that point today.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, did not join in the motion
and has publicly stated that his client would not testify. Kornberg
said he had not made his client available to the grand jury because
he believed that the indictment of the four officers was a ``fait
accompli.'' But he also hinted at another motive Tuesday, noting
that if one of the defendants testifies before a grand jury and the
district attorney then attempts to use that defendant's testimony
at trial, ``I will have the option of seeking a separate trial.''

MISTRIAL DECLARED IN FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., N.Y., Calif.)   (jw)  
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After almost two weeks of deliberations, a U.S.
district court jury here said on Tuesday that it could not agree on
whether a Syracuse, N.Y., businessman was guilty of orchestrating
one of the largest financial frauds in American history and a judge
declared a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   The jury did find the businessman, Patrick Bennett, guilty of
seven counts of perjury and obstruction of justice, to which
Bennett had admitted on the witness stand. He could face decades in
prison for these crimes, although such a stiff sentence is unlikely
under federal guidelines. But the jury declared itself at a
stalemate on the more substantive charges, including more than 50
counts of securities fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud and money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   After Chief Judge Thomas Griesa declared a mistrial, Robert
Khuzami, chief of the securities and commodities fraud task force
at the U.S. attorney's office, said authorities would try again to
convict Griesa.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from the collapse of Bennett Funding Group,
which purported to be in the business of financing the leases of
office equipment like copiers and fax machines. Some of these
leases were sold to investors, who also lent money to Bennett's
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of investors in New York, New Jersey, Florida and
other states lost about $700 million after the company went
bankrupt in 1996, according to the court-appointed trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's lawyers, while not denying that investors suffered
huge losses, said that their client was just a bad businessman, not
a crook. Bennett was ``unprepared, untrained, unqualified _ a
hard-working guy who was in way over his head,'' said David Levitt,
one of the public defenders.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the defense's story of a ``country bumpkin,'' the
prosecution marshaled more than 30 witnesses and hundreds of
documents, contending that Bennett had deliberately sold leases on
equipment that did not exist and falsified his books, while taking
money out of the business to buy himself gambling properties,
including a racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, witnesses identified papers and discussed the arcana
of receivables and lease-back transactions. The jury of seven women
and five men visibly struggled to stay alert throughout the
proceedings, even when Bennett himself admitted on the stand last
month that he had lied to try to thwart a federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors continue to believe that their losses were caused
by fraud, as does Richard Breeden, the former chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, who is now running the bankrupt
Bennett estate. Though the bankruptcy has been extremely
contentious and convoluted, lawyers involved in it say, investors
are likely to recover more than 36 cents for every dollar lost,
which is unusually high.

CHANGES FOR MONDESI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Raul Mondesi swears he worked hard in past
spring-training camps but never like he's worked this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although he arrived at camp 15 pounds over his playing weight _
he's since cut that in half _ it was a marked improvement over
previous springs. And he said he's running and working out much
more than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure my body is healthy and in good shape to
play 180 games,'' the Dodgers right fielder said. ``That's how many
games you have to play to make it to the World Series. Every year I
have to watch these other teams in the playoffs, and I don't want
to watch them. I want them to watch me.''
</P>
<P>
   In his five full seasons with the Dodgers, Mondesi is averaging
25 homers and 82 RBI per year. He's one of baseball's best
defensive players, but questions of his commitment and work ethic
have haunted him.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros was cautious in his
observation of Mondesi but did say he noticed a change in Mondesi's
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not getting here right before we go on the field and he's
not leaving right after we're done,'' said Karros, who dresses next
to Mondesi. ``I think (the Dodgers brass) has been waiting for that
the last couple of years. He's obviously someone with a lot of
talent and a lot of ability. He has as much ability as anybody in
the game. No question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Shaw due in today: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson might have
been right when he said ``Maybe their calculations were off'' on
the due date for Jeff and Julie Shaw's third child.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told the Shaws the birth might not take place until
mid-March, so the right-handed closer is expected to arrive at
Dodgertown today. He'll fly back to Washington Court House, Ohio,
for the birth.
</P>
<P>
   __ Signings: As expected, the Dodgers signed former Chicago Cubs
catcher Rick Wilkins to a minor-league contract Tuesday. He broke
into the major leagues in 1991 and hit 30 homers for the Cubs in
1993. Wilkins, who lives in Jacksonville, drove to an open tryout
Monday at Dodgertown and agreed to the contract Tuesday morning. .
. . The Dodgers announced they have reached contract agreements
with the 18 remaining members of their 40-man roster, which
included third baseman Adrian Beltre and outfielder Trenidad
Hubbard.

N.J. LAWMAKERS SEEK TALK WITH CLINTON ON COMPLAINTS AGAINST
TROOPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Three members of the state Legislature's Black
and Latino Caucus said they would speak to President Clinton when
he visits New Jersey on Wednesday to urge him to speed up a federal
investigation into allegations of racial profiling by state
troopers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers _ Assemblyman LeRoy Jones Jr., state Sen. Shirley
Turner and Assemblyman Nellie Pou, all Democrats _ said they would
greet Clinton at Newark International Airport on Wednesday
afternoon when he arrives to attend a fund-raiser for Democratic
U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli at the New Jersey Performing Arts
Center in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Goldberg, a spokesman for the White House press office,
said the lawmakers would be among several people in the welcoming
party. ``I think it is inaccurate to characterize it as a
meeting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, the Justice Department has been reviewing
complaints that New Jersey troopers single out minority drivers in
searching for drug traffickers. But the issue generated renewed
attention on Sunday when Gov. Christie Whitman dismissed the state
police superintendent, Col. Carl Williams, for suggesting in an
interview with The Star-Ledger of Newark that cocaine and marijuana
traffickers were most likely to be members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time we have what could be direct evidence of an
attitude, perhaps of a policy of the state police coming from the
department itself,'' said Assemblyman Joseph Charles Jr., chairman
of the Black and Latino Caucus. ``We need to get a complete
investigation so that the cloud that currently exists over the
state police will either be removed or be dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   The caucus also announced that starting in April, it would hold
statewide hearings into complaints of racial profiling and police
brutality by state troopers, said Charles, who is from Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus also joined calls for a delay in the nomination of
the state attorney general, Peter Verniero, to the state Supreme
Court until the federal investigation is complete. Verniero
oversees the state police. Whitman nominated him last week to fill
the place of Associate Justice Stewart Pollock, who will retire on
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman continued to oppose any delay, and on Tuesday, she
submitted a formal notice of the nomination to the state Senate,
said her spokesman, Jayne O'Connor.

L.A.'S TRADE BUSINESS NO. 1 DESPITE ASIA WOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Asian economic crisis cut into Los Angeles'
trade business last year, leading to the area's first decline since
1982, a top analyst reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Asian flu was not enough to keep the region from being
the top trade area in the country for the fifth straight year, said
Jack Kyser, chief analyst with the nonprofit Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the ill winds blowing out of Asia, Southern
California actually did pretty well,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   According to an LAEDC analysis of U.S. Department of Commerce
figures, imports and exports at Los Angeles International Airport
and the ports of Long Beach, Los Angeles and Hueneme slipped 2.4
percent to $181.5 billion last year. But even with the decline, the
Los Angeles Customs District -- as it's known -- squeaked past New
York's 1998 trade total of $180.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser estimated that trade this year will grow by 3.3 percent,
spurred in part by recovering Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, local trade in 1998 benefited from a flood of Asian
goods that have become cheaper because of struggling Asian markets,
Kyser said. The value of total imports to Los Angeles increased 5.3
percent to $117.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That increase was more than offset by declining exports,
however. According to Kyser, total exports from the region fell
13.9 percent to $63.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the decline in dollar figures does not necessarily mean that
Los Angeles trade is suffering, said Art Wong, spokesman for the
Port of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The port recently posted its highest trade volume in history,
with over 4 million TEUs, or Twenty-foot Equivalent Units, passing
though in 1998, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade still looks to be very strong,'' Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Winter, executive secretary with the Foreign Trade
Association of California, agreed that the region is poised for
growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll see an increase compared to last year, assuming
we don't see any major labor disruptions,'' he said. ``A lot of the
Asian economies are coming back.''

MERRILL LYNCH'S NEW CAMPAIGN PUTS BULL OUT TO PASTURE (SORT OF) 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch is bullish on _ mankind?
</P>
<P>
   According to an unconventional campaign that begins Thursday,
the employees and executives of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. are as devoted
to furthering ``human achievement'' _ as the theme of the ads
proclaims _ as they are to selling stocks, offering financial
advice and making deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always viewed ourselves as an engine for human
progress as we move capital around the world from areas with
surplus to areas with need,'' Paul W. Critchlow, senior vice
president for marketing and communications at Merrill Lynch in New
York, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to capture the voice of Merrill Lynch in a way that
differentiates us from the incredible noise and clutter in a
competitive category where we think most others are narrowly
focused,'' he added. ``This captures the fact we stand for
something with a higher purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising, with a budget estimated at $75 million, is
intended to appear around the world and ranges from print and
television to the Internet and radio. The campaign, to be
introduced in phases in the next several months, is the first from
J. Walter Thompson New York since the agency was awarded the
Merrill Lynch account in June.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from Merrill Lynch and the agency gave a preview of
the campaign at an hourlong meeting at the Thompson office in
midtown Manhattan. One recurring question was whether the
achievement theme _ replacing a theme, ``The difference is Merrill
Lynch,'' which has been in use since 1993 _ was too lofty and
ethereal for a financial services marketer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we've researched it, we've found it is not up in the
clouds,'' said Thomas C. Cotton, executive vice president and
global business director on the Merrill Lynch account at Thompson.
``Prospects and current clients say it's very relevant and
persuasive and meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly true in the financial services field, said
Dan J. Haughton, first vice president and senior director for
marketing services at the Merrill Lynch Private Client Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human relationships become important,'' Haughton said. ``When
people get more money, they say, `I don't have the same level of
comfort I did as when I was starting out and didn't have
anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign arrives at a moment fraught with possibilities, and
risks, for both agency and client. The response to the unusual ads
will be crucial to efforts by Thompson New York to regain a
reputation for creativity. The campaign was supervised by Bill
Hamilton, a new worldwide creative director at the Thompson New
York parent, the J. Walter Thompson Co. unit of WPP Group P.L.C.
</P>
<P>
   The ads also arrive as WPP is completing discussions with
Charlotte Beers to join Thompson, most likely as chairwoman. If WPP
hires Ms. Beers, who formerly led the Thompson sibling Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather Worldwide, she would help Chris Jones, the Thompson chief
executive, with current clients and work on attracting additional
blue-chip advertisers like Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   For Merrill Lynch, the campaign comes as the company is
scrambling to confront challenges from scrappy, upstart online
brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not see technology as an end,'' Critchlow said, ``but as
a means to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest retail broker, will soon
begin a limited online trading service; later stages of the
campaign are intended to remind consumers that the company also
provides broader services like tax advice and estate planning.
</P>
<P>
   And Merrill Lynch finds itself continually steering customers
through the turbulence roiling the global financial system. In
fact, the campaign was supposed to start in January, but work on it
was postponed last fall in favor of creating ads that were intended
to reassure nervous investors after a worldwide plunge in stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign seeks to be ``a re-presentation of the firm as it's
evolving,'' Cotton said, invoking ``values like optimism, the long
view versus the short, principles driving performance, the wisdom
of the firm and the indomitable human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The posture and tone of the campaign contemporizes the
brand,'' he added. ``That's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Critchlow said, ``We see this as the next chapter in the
evolution of the Merrill Lynch brand, from making the financial
markets accessible to Main Street to being `Bullish on America.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some elements from past campaigns that focused on the familiar
Merrill Lynch bull will continue to appear. But results from
consumer research show that concentrating more on the bull would be
counterproductive, said Charles V. Mangano, first vice president
and senior director for marketing at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quote that seemed to sum it up,'' Mangano said, ``was
someone in a group we showed the new ads to, who said, ` ``Bullish
on America'' is about them; ``Human achievement'' is about me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The initial print ads and television commercials are practically
spiritual in their attempts to build the Merrill Lynch brand.
</P>
<P>
   One print ad begins, ``If you want to see something done, just
tell some human beings it can't be done.'' And it ends: ``Dangle
the undoable in front of the world. Then, consider it done.''
</P>
<P>
   One commercial features a young girl who is meant to symbolize
the changes the world has undergone since 1989. She appears, in the
manner of Forrest Gump or Zelig, amid historical events from the
fall of the Berlin wall to the arrival of democracy in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A second spot about techno-mania shows the blues singer B.B.
King and his guitar Lucille. The spot contrasts technology, which
an announcer asserts is ``plastic and metal and wire,'' with
people, who represent ``brilliance and discernment and vision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Admire machines,'' the announcer concludes. ``Worship their
inventors.''
</P>
<P>
   In a third commercial, a man on a rainy Manhattan street gives
up his taxi to a woman and her children. ``If you're looking for a
hero,'' an announcer declares, ``look around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jeffrey, who joined Thompson New York as president 11 months
ago, said: ``Great brands link up with people more one-on-one on
`soft' issues, not just `hard' ones. In financial services, people
want a company that cares about more than performance; they want a
company they can like, a `company that understands me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent parts of the campaign include an eight-page magazine
insert and commercials promoting the U.S. private client business
of Merrill Lynch, comparing a family to a business with the theme
``Your Life Inc.'' In addition, print ads aimed at high-technology
entrepreneurs will praise the Merrill Lynch capital-raising efforts
for companies like Cisco Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``CEO's and players don't see us as the fast-moving investment
bank we really are,'' Cotton said.
</P>
<P>
   That must be some kind of achievement, too, when an agency
executive uses ``us'' and ``we'' to refer to a client rather than
``them'' and ``they.''

CSUN'S HARRIS STILL A NO-SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ It appears Rico Harris' season with the Cal State
Northridge men's basketball team is over, and his future as a
Matador is also in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN head coach Bobby Braswell had not heard from his suspended
forward Tuesday, two days before the Matadors' first-round game in
the Big Sky Tournament at Ogden, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't spoken to him,'' Braswell said Tuesday morning.
``I'm going to try to reach him at his mom's house. . . . At this
point, if we don't get this thing resolved, it probably won't be
resolved this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors (17-11) leave for Utah today. They play Montana
State (15-12) Thursday night at 8:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' unknown whereabouts put a damper on a day when senior
guard Derrick Higgins was named All-Big Sky Conference. Higgins,
CSUN's leading scorer at 13.7 points per game, was the Matadors'
only first-team representative. Sophomore center Brian Heinle was
an honorable-mention selection.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a junior transfer from L.A. City College, was suspended
with junior guard Greg Minor last week and missed CSUN's last two
regular-season games at Weber State and Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel Rico made his decision and his decision was not to
be with this team,'' Heinle said. ``Rico is his own person. He has
his life to lead. We're not going to dwell on (his absence).''
</P>
<P>
   Minor met with the team and coaching staff Monday, offered an
apology, and was reinstated. Harris did not show at the meeting
despite phone messages from Braswell.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I just don't want any distractions or anything
that is going to keep this team from being focused,'' Braswell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris (6-foot-9, 250 pounds) appeared in 20 games this season,
starting 10. He missed five games with injuries and also was
suspended for the Matadors' game at Tennessee on Nov. 17 for
violating a team rule. He was the Matadors' top rebounder (6.6 per
game) and third-leading scorer (11.7).
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has won eight of its last 11 games and established a season
high in points in a 99-65 win at Sacramento State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell said team morale has been better since the suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any second-guessing or doubt that they
can win (the tournament),'' he said. ``They are locked in. Right
now, our morale is higher than it's ever been. I look at these guys
hanging out with each other . . . hugging and talking and
laughing.''

NO MARGIN OF ERROR: CEPEDA ELECTED TO HALL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Five years after he missed election to the
Baseball Hall of Fame by seven votes on the writers' ballot,
Orlando Cepeda gained election Tuesday with not many more votes
than that.
</P>
<P>
   An abbreviated version of the Veterans Committee elected the
first baseman; an umpire, Nestor Chylak; a turn-of-the-century
manager, Frank Selee, and a Negro leagues pitcher, Smokey Joe
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 members of the 15-man committee attended the annual
meeting, meaning nine votes _ three-fourths _ were needed for
election. The committee did not disclose the number of votes
received by those elected or those who were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to,'' Joe L. Brown, the committee chairman and
former general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, said when asked
why the committee would not give vote totals.
</P>
<P>
   Cepeda, who hit 379 home runs and drove in 1,365 runs in a
17-year career that ended in 1974, was not elected in 15 years on
the ballot of the Baseball Writers Association. In his last year on
the ballot, 1994, he received 335 votes, seven short of the 75
percent needed for election. This was the second year he was
eligible for consideration by the Veterans Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that Dom DiMaggio, Joe Gordon, Mel Harder and Bill
Mazeroski were among others who were considered, but he also
declined to give their vote totals. Committee members can vote for
as many as 10 players.
</P>
<P>
   Cepeda, hampered by bad knees throughout his career, said he
believed his arrest in Puerto Rico in 1975 for smuggling marijuana
had worked against his earlier election.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know me,'' he said of the writers who voted.
``Maybe they heard some things about me that weren't too cool.
Later on, I don't think they felt that way. When they got to know
me, they knew I was a human being who made mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cepeda, who works for the San Francisco Giants in community
affairs, said he closely followed the recent debate involving
Lawrence Taylor's election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. ``I'm
glad they voted for him,'' Cepeda, who served a 10-month prison
sentence, said. ``When you are human beings, you can make mistakes.
I learned from my mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent to his arrest, Cepeda became a Buddhist and Tuesday
he said he believes he will be the only Buddhist in the Hall of
Fame when he is inducted July 25 with Nolan Ryan, George Brett and
Robin Yount, whom the writers elected last month.
</P>
<P>
   Cepeda was a unanimous winner of the National League rookie of
the year award with the Giants in 1958 and of the NL's most
valuable player award with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1967. He also
played for Atlanta, Oakland, the Boston Red Sox and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Chylak was elected 17 years after he died at the age of 59. He
served as an American League umpire for 25 years, from 1954 through
1978, and is the eighth umpire elected to the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Selee began managing the Boston Beaneaters, later the Braves, in
1890. He remained in Boston through 1901, then managed the Chicago
Cubs until tuberculosis forced him to retire during the 1905 season
while assembling the nucleus of the Cubs' dynasty in the
Tinker-Evers-Chance years. His career record, 1.284-862, gave him a
.598 winning percentage, fourth best in history.
</P>
<P>
   Williams pitched from 1910 through 1932 for five Negro league
teams, including the Homestead Grays and the Pittsburgh Crawfords.
In 1952 he was elected to an all-time Negro leagues all-star team,
edging Satchel Paige by 1 vote.

practical reasons: Tough meat needed to be made tender, it needed
to be preserved, and, with humans ever attuned to improving their
lot, it needed to be flavored. But from ranch to refrigerator,
almost everything has changed about meat and the way it is treated
today. Everything, that is, except marination. By Eric Asimov.

   WINE-MICROWAVE (New York) _ A new question is creeping into wine
service in New York: How do you want that cooked? For many years,
Americans have confounded the rest of the world by drinking their
white wines too cold and their red wines too warm. Sommeliers no
longer hesitate when diners ask that a luscious Corton-Charlemagne
be plunged into an ice bucket. They just do it. It's easy. Red wine
poses a different problem. If it arrives at the table with slight
chill, and the diners want it the temperature of a blood
transfusion _ fast _ the sommelier must resort to wiles, and the
wiliest wile of all, it turns out, is the microwave oven. By
William Grimes.

 &HT;    Plan calls for 40,000 homes on border
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The new executive director of the Texas
Department of Housing and Community Affairs is proposing a
five-year, $2 billion program to build 40,000 single-family homes
along the Mexico border. It would be the largest housing-assistance
program ever undertaken by the state in the border region.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy Stiner said the program would be an ambitious undertaking
to help eradicate substandard neighborhoods known as colonias,
where a mostly Hispanic population lives in ramshackle construction
with leaking septic tanks and inadequate roads.
</P>
<P>
   She outlined the proposal last week before the Senate's Special
Committee on Border Affairs. Legislators and housing advocates were
surprised by the scope of the plan. The state traditionally has
relied mainly on the federal government for housing assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The plan could not proceed without legislation, and the
prospects for that are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a program yet; it's a concept,'' Stiner said. ``The
details will have to be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the state would hire a large-scale homebuilder
to build prefabricated houses. Building a large number of houses
would keep the purchase price to $50,000 per house. The monthly
mortgage, utility and insurance payments would total $375 for a
typical family with an annual income of $15,000. Down payments
would be financed by a no-interest loan or a government grant.
</P>
<P>
   The largest share of the $2 billion plan, $1.3 billion for
single-family mortgage loans, would come from bonds issued by the
state. Depending on the type of bonds, voter approval could be
required. Down payment assistance totaling $730 million would come
from general state revenues or federal funds.

RJR NABISCO SELLING INTERNATIONAL ASSETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An official of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. said on
Tuesday that the company was seeking to sell its international
tobacco operations and had received bids from at least five other
companies, including the Philip Morris Cos.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a
winning bidder could emerge as early as this week, but added that
the process could go on for longer.
</P>
<P>
   RJR Nabisco, a tobacco and food company, has seen disappointing
results from its international tobacco operations in recent years.
To offset falling cigarette sales in both Eastern Europe and the
countries of the former Soviet Union, it has taken a number of
steps to reduce staff and shutter plants.
</P>
<P>
   While the company is the second largest domestic producer of
cigarettes, it has lagged badly in the international market behind
both Philip Morris and BAT Industries PLC, a tobacco company based
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The company's leadership is also facing a challenge from the
investor Carl C. Icahn, who recently raised his stake in RJR
Nabisco to 5.6 percent and renewed his call for the company to spin
off its Nabisco cookie and cracker business.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of RJR Nabisco on Tuesday climbed 50 cents, to $27.875.

IN BOOK, LEWINSKY LASHES OUT AGAINST STARR
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a book to be published later this week, Monica
Lewinsky is so critical of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr that
several of her friends and associates say they fear Starr will
become angry and try to revoke her immunity agreement and prosecute
her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky says in the book, ``Monica's Story'' by Andrew
Morton, that she was so despondent at her treatment by prosecutors
who confronted her at a hotel in suburban Virginia on Jan. 16,
1998, that she briefly considered killing herself in their
presence, said a person familiar with the contents of her book.
</P>
<P>
   Plato Cacheris, one of her lawyers, said Tuesday night that
neither he nor her other lead lawyer, Jacob Stein, had seen the
book's manuscript or galleys. ``Monica and Andrew Morton did this
on their own,'' Cacheris said. ``We did not vet the book.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speculate about how Starr would react.
</P>
<P>
   But several friends of the Lewinsky family said Tuesday that
they were very concerned that Ms. Lewinsky's remarks might
backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big concern to us,'' an associate of Ms. Lewinsky said.
``She's bound by this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the immunity agreement under which Ms. Lewinsky testified
about her affair with President Clinton and efforts to cover it up,
Starr forbade Ms. Lewinsky to discuss his office's conduct in an
interview with Barbara Walters to be broadcast Wednesday night on
ABC. But Ms. Lewinsky was free to discuss Starr's office with
Morton because her agreement did not apply to the book.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Ms. Lewinsky says that after one of Starr's
prosecutors told her that she faced 27 years in jail if she refused
to cooperate with their criminal inquiry of Clinton, she
``contemplated throwing herself'' through a plate-glass window on
the hotel's 10th floor, where she stood at the time with several
prosecutors, the person who had read the manuscript said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky also complains in her book that her initial
attempts to call her lawyer and her mother were rebuffed by
prosecutors and agents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky says that prosecutors on Jan. 16, 1998, confronted
her with a copy of her false affidavit in which she swore that she
did not have an affair with the president. But at that time, Ms.
Lewinsky's lawyer, Francis Carter, had still not filed the
affidavit yet with a federal court in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office had been sent the affidavit anonymously by James
Moody, a lawyer for Linda Tripp who had obtained it from lawyers
for Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors are facing an inquiry by the Justice
Department on their conduct in the Lewinsky inquiry, including
whether they improperly attempted to coerce Ms. Lewinsky to
cooperate with their investigation while her lawyer was not present
and had improper contacts with lawyers for Ms. Jones that were not
disclosed to Justice Department attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky also says in her book that prosecutors rebuffed her
first requests to call her mother and her lawyer, the person said.
During her grand jury testimony, Ms. Lewinsky said that after she
had said she needed to consult her mother, Marcia Lewis, prosecutor
Jackie Bennett told her: ``You're 24. You're smart. You're old
enough. You don't need to call your mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   Under her immunity agreement, Ms. Lewinsky is not permitted to
speak with the media without Starr's permission. For months, Starr
insisted that Ms. Lewinsky remain silent. Several weeks ago, he
permitted Ms. Lewinsky to speak with Ms. Walters only after
insisting that she not discuss her knowledge of their ongoing
investigation or any issues involving Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Lewinsky reportedly tells Ms. Walters during their
interview that she is not ``allowed'' to discuss her treatment by
Starr's prosecutors. But that same admonition did not hold for her
book, which was not covered by her immunity agreement, her lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past two days, Ms. Lewinsky's friends and lawyers
have become aware of the criticism of Starr's prosecutors. One
associate, who has not seen the book, said Tuesday night,
``Apparently she is very, very critical of Starr's people, and
we're worried about how they will react.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly III, spokesman for Starr, did not return phone
calls Tuesday night. But in the past, Bakaly has defended the
treatment of Ms. Lewinsky as ethical. During his testimony before
Congress in November, Starr said that Ms. Lewinsky was incorrect in
saying that prosecutors had barred her from calling anyone she
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it clear to the witness that she was, in fact, free to
leave,'' Starr said then. ``And the Ritz-Carlton, shall I say, is a
fairly comfortable and commodious place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has told associates that she resented her treatment
by prosecutors after she struck her agreement in late July 1998.
She met with prosecutors nearly 20 times and was asked repeatedly
to describe ``intimate details'' of her relationship with the
president, an associate said Tuesday night. ``She just thought it
was truly humiliating,'' the associate said.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Ms. Lewinsky also recalls how she felt when she
realized that her friend, Mrs. Tripp, had betrayed her. She had
bumped into Mrs. Tripp later that afternoon in the Pentagon City
mall. Ms. Lewinsky recalls how she told Mrs. Tripp, sarcastically,
``Thanks a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp replied, ``They did it to me, too,'' meaning that
Starr's prosecutors had also tricked her.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Erick Barkley and Tyrone Grant, their low voices
spiked with bravado, had a conversation recently that turned civic
pride on its head _ debating which one of them came from the worse
Brooklyn neighborhood. Grant _ from Brownsville, ``a few blocks
from Mike Tyson,'' he noted _ brought the debate to a quick
conclusion when he conceded that Barkley's was ``the worst
neighborhood in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either be a drug dealer or play basketball,'' Barkley
said in perhaps an overstatement about the Farragut houses in Fort
Greene. ``You took one side of the road or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Barkley can still look out her apartment window at
Farragut and see the concrete court below where her small son took
his first underhand shots when he was 6 and began to make that
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was terrible; ``I was an ant,'' he said. But basketball
led him on a circuitous course fraught with the perils of the urban
ghetto, a course he managed to navigate from childhood games
against Stephon Marbury to a key role in the elevation of St.
John's to a top 10 ranking this season. From the chaos rose the
consummately controlled, reticent fulcrum of St. John's offense, a
freshman who will be on display this week in the Big East
Conference tournament, which begins Wednesday at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Good point guards, St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis said, give teams
the chance to win every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for Erick, we wouldn't be in the top 10,'' said
Grant, the senior center. ``He's made all of us better. His
decision-making has been perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   His decision-making off the court has been nearly as good.
Barkley was born in 1978 and grew up during the crack scourge, when
one early mentor used to hear gunshots and gang fights as he
escorted young Erick home from the gym. Shirley Barkley, an
evangelist, did not want Erick, the youngest of nine children, in
the projects then, and still tries to dissuade him from visiting
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was drug-infested,'' she said. ``You couldn't help it. I
never had any problems with Erick, though. He was always a good
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was the beneficiary of what now looks like the smooth
exchanges of a practiced relay team: a handoff from mother to
church league coach to high school to concerned friends to a
fortuitous trip out of town to improve his grades, to college.
</P>
<P>
   It was not so smooth, of course. When Erick was still in high
school, Shirley Barkley left her son behind with friends and went
to Georgia, a move she made to get away from the neighborhood, her
son said. And Barkley struggled so much academically in high school
that there were doubts he would be eligible to play for St. John's
this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the inner city has forged that most legendary of New York
athletes _ the playground point guard _ and Barkley figured out
that he could steal the moves from the good ones like Marbury and
still avoid the pitfalls that swallowed other street phenoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball was his salvation,'' said Bob Oliva, Barkley's
coach at Christ the King High School in Queens. ``I've never
coached a player who had such a one-track mind. Erick's social life
was going to the gym and playing basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Francis knew that from the first time Barkley showed up for
a St. Ann's Catholic Youth Organization practice. Barkley was about
6 then, and very small. Francis, a dean at Xaverian High School,
has a picture of Barkley standing next to a water fountain; the
fountain is taller than Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Francis became one of the people Shirley Barkley relied on to
rescue her son. He shooed away the gang members when they tried to
woo a 12-year-old Barkley, and Francis' gym became the haven for
Barkley and the place where the first glimmers of his future became
clear.
</P>
<P>
   He once scored 20 points in a half during a 12-and-under
tournament, when Barkley encountered Marbury at a Christmas
tournament in Coney Island. Barkley was 9 and Marbury was 11. The
final score was 54-48.
</P>
<P>
   ``His team had 48 and Steph had 44,'' Barkley said. ``We won the
game and I was the MVP. I will never forget that game.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he got to Christ the King, Barkley was already a
standout player _ Oliva said he was the most controlled freshman he
had seen _ and the team won the Catholic league championship in
Barkley's sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   The personal turning point came before Erick's senior year, when
Shirley Barkley moved to Georgia. Mother and son agreed that Erick
would stay in New York and then go to prep school to help his
grades.
</P>
<P>
   Francis talked to the family of Craig (Speedy) Claxton,
Barkley's close friend, who is now Hofstra's point guard. Yvette
and Steve Claxton run a quiet household where the television is off
and the schoolwork is done. They have seven children, the oldest of
whom is about to graduate from medical school. When Barkley moved
to the Claxtons' home in Hempstead, on Long Island, it was his
first brush with the dynamics and discipline of a middle-class
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw that people could live better, so that's the way he
chose to go,'' Shirley Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Claxton said: ``When he moved in with me, it was a nice
neighborhood, and he didn't have a choice about getting into
trouble. My father drove my sister to school every day, so he had
to go. It's tough on you if you don't have somebody looking after
you telling you to go. They treated him like another part of
family. I think he was more friendly and easier to get along with
afterwards. Living with my parents, it opened him up to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley is now so quiet and composed that an on-court flare-up
between him and Ron Artest during a game against Connecticut in
January was shocking. But in high school, Barkley displayed a fiery
temperament, and he was ejected from a diocesan championship game
for scuffling with an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was uncoachable,'' Barkley said. ``I had a bad attitude. I
didn't listen. At Christ the King, I would mumble something under
my breath if things didn't go my way. I'd point my finger at
somebody else. My temper was so quick.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed when Barkley got to Maine Central Institute in
remote Pittsfield, a prep school powerhouse Barkley attended to
improve his grades. He got the test score he needed, and with the
change in scenery came a change in style. His coach, Max Good, told
him that the innate New York suspiciousness and street-tough
attitude would have to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Erick came to visit he said, `Coach, let me use your
car.' '' Good said. ``I tossed him the keys. I don't think he
really wanted the car; he wanted my trust. His host parents said he
hardly left the driveway. When I gave it to him it had an eighth of
a tank of gas. When I got it back, it was full. I think he learned
to trust people here.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As his personal life settled down, so, too, did his game. The
temper faded and so did the flashy plays. Barkley had seen
prodigies whose games were so full of juking and thread-the-needle
passes that colleges spent two years changing their style. Why, he
wondered, shouldn't he just develop a stripped-down game from the
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never used to settle for the easy play,'' Barkley said. ``At
Maine, I was watching a lot of games. I really liked John
Stockton's game a lot. One move, and he'd go right by them. Being
flashy doesn't get you anywhere. Being a fundamental point guard
gets you places.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's is going places with him. Barkley's minimalism _
crisp passes and simple moves _ has enabled him to play four games
this season with no turnovers, and seven games with just one. He
has 74 steals. He is the point guard St. John's didn't have during
the Felipe Lopez era. Last season, St. John's two point guards,
Tarik Turner and Collin Charles, turned the ball over 113 times and
made 169 assists. Barkley has 62 turnovers and 133 assists.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's is where it needs to be, a likely third seed when the
national tournament brackets are announced Sunday. Shirley Barkley
is back in town for a while, too, to see her son finish his season.
The latest handoff has been made. Barkley is taking St. John's to
the top level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of games, I was nervous and I tried to make
everybody feel I was perfect,'' Barkley said. ``Once I got that out
of my head, it's worked out. I guess I've got a game.''

EDITORIAL: THE FIGHT IN GEORGE BUSH'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 3:
</P>
<P>
   Since so many Republicans have proclaimed Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas as their choice for president, it came as no surprise on
Tuesday when Bush announced that he would form an exploratory
committee. But moving from someone widely mentioned to someone
actively running for the job is a huge leap in American politics,
especially with a party in such disarray. A clear sign of the
troubles Bush would be stepping into also came on Tuesday, as
Patrick Buchanan announced his candidacy. Buchanan's full-throated
opposition to free trade and immigration is certain to be
challenged by Bush if he runs.
</P>
<P>
   The incipient conflict highlights the challenge awaiting the
Texan. He is a political figure who is both famous and unknown. To
lead a party that is fractured and hungry for victory, he has to
move quickly to define himself before others do the job for him. At
this stage, the Republican contest consists mostly of second-tier
candidates scrambling for attention while both Bush and Elizabeth
Dole float above in the polls. Their popularity is hardly
surprising. There has, after all, been someone named Bush or Dole
on the Republican ticket of every presidential election since 1976.
But Republicans are divided today as they have not been since the
era before Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Besides trade, the Republican candidates are split on
income-distribution issues, with Buchanan and Dan Quayle appealing
to blue-collar conservatives. They are also split on tax cuts, with
Steve Forbes and John Kasich demanding across-the-board reductions.
Many Republicans are wary of a grand assault on the tax system or
on the government's role in Social Security and the environment.
Bush is vague on domestic issues. On foreign policy, he has begun
surrounding himself with some of his father's advisers. But
Republican elders are at odds over whether to allow American troops
in the Balkans, push China on human rights or contain Russia in its
newest incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion issue also remains to be addressed. Bush has sent
signals to the right-to-life movement that he opposes abortion. But
he is also telling moderates that while certain limits on abortion
can be enacted now, abortion itself cannot be outlawed until there
is a change of heart by the American voters. Whether the governor
tries to re-position the party on this issue to accommodate
pro-choice suburban Republicans is one of the things to watch in
his campaign. Both Bush's father and Bob Dole stumbled on the
abortion issue. Many Republican leaders do not want to see it trip
up their next candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Bush has been an unusually effective governor with a
record of spending money on education and showing tolerance toward
minority groups, homosexuals and immigrants. He could bring a great
deal to his party if he stands up for inclusiveness and defends
some form of affirmative action. But he will not be given a free
ride by Buchanan or other conservative opponents if they sense that
he is trying to redefine the GOP in the kinder, gentler direction
given lip service by his father. It was a good idea for Bush to
make his move now, so that the process of debating the Republican
future can unfold even before the primary season begins.

 &HT;    No calls on child keep cops puzzled
 &HT;    By R. Robin McDonald
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The shoelaces on a pair of small brown boots signaled
DeKalb County, Ga.'s forensic investigators that someone cared
about the child whose remains were found last Friday in a stand of
pines below an aging cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   They were double-tied.
</P>
<P>
   Those shoelaces, knotted so they would not trail along the
ground are, in part, why investigators are puzzled that no one has
come forward with information that would help them to identify the
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing not to have gotten any calls,'' said Paul
Kelhofer, chief forensic investigator at the DeKalb County Medical
Examiner's Office. ``Somebody who cared about the child may not
know this child has been found.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators do know that the body _ a black child about 4 feet
tall between the ages of 5 and 7 _ is not one of 50 children and
teens who have been reported missing to DeKalb police and whose
whereabouts are still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The body does not match that of any children reported missing in
metropolitan Atlanta, police said.
</P>
<P>
   It does not match the nearly 100 missing black children between
the ages of 5 and 7 whose names and descriptions were provided to
DeKalb investigators by the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children, Kelhofer said.
</P>
<P>
   Medical examiners are awaiting the results of DNA tests that
will tell them the sex of the child, whose decomposed remains were
in the wood for three to six months before a gravedigger found them
last week. Pathologists have not yet determined a cause of death.
No signs of trauma, either old or recent, were detected, said Dr.
Gerald Gowitt, the county's chief associate medical examiner. But
investigators do suspect foul play.
</P>
<P>
   There are no firm figures available on the number of children
now missing in this country, said Cathy Nahirny, a spokeswoman for
the federally funded National Center for Missing and Exploited
Children. ``That's the real problem,'' she said. ``There is no
mandate that requires every missing child in America to be reported
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But a U.S. Justice Department study published in 1990 _ the most
recent available _ estimated that in 1988, 163,200 children
disappeared when parents embroiled in divorces or custody battles
fled the state of residence or country with them.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 133,500 children ran away from home. And another
127,100 children were ``thrown-aways'' _ children who were ordered
out of the house by their parents or guardians; who ran away but no
one made any effort to find them; and children who were deserted or
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The report listed 139,100 children as injured, lost or missing.
</P>
<P>
   But, Nahirney acknowledged, finding a body of an unidentified,
dead child is rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a child abuse situation where they (a parent or
guardian) get so violent punishing the child that the child dies,''
Nahirney said. ``Maybe it was an accident. Maybe it wasn't. But
instead of reporting the child missing, they just dispose of the
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad reality is that parents do that.''

WILL SILVER CHARM ANSWER CRITICS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ For a sports star in the media age, Silver
Charm gets off easy. All that glory, none of those pesky
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   America's richest active thoroughbred has people to answer for
him when the nabobs of negativism come a-nattering. Has Mark
McGwire thought of this?
</P>
<P>
   And Silver Charm's reputation as the strong, silent type is
coming in particularly handy this week, when reporters and
horse-race handicappers wonder if the vulnerable favorite for
Saturday's $1 million Santa Anita Handicap is an athlete in
decline.
</P>
<P>
   The burden of rebutting the horse's detractors falls heavily on
his jockey, Gary Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to rebut anything,'' Stevens said on Santa
Anita's grandstand steps Tuesday morning as he watched one of
Silver Charm's rivals work out. ``He's made a lot of money, he's
one of the best horses we've seen, and he'll either win or lose
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His races speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't stop everyone else from speaking about Silver Charm,
the 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness champion with the knack for
winning the close ones. He's the talk of any race he runs, whether
he's the lone attraction, as is often the case, or one of a handful
of horses with Grade I credentials, as in this unusually deep Big
'Cap.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita, which is advertising its signature race as ``Silver
Charm vs. (an) All-Star Field,'' figures the chatter will add 5,000
to a turnstile count that has straddled the 30,000 mark in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Until lately, the talk of Silver Charm was uniformly flattering
(as if he's susceptible to flattery).
</P>
<P>
   He didn't just have gray good looks and popular connections in
Stevens, trainer Bob Baffert and owners Bob and Beverly Lewis of
Newport Beach. He had two-thirds of a Triple Crown, a victory over
some of the world's best in the 1998 Dubai World Cup, and a
sensational string of 15 races at the beginning of his career
without a finish as low as third.
</P>
<P>
   He went into this, his 5-year-old season, unquestionably the
nation's top older horse, since 1998 Horse of the Year Skip Away
and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Awesome Again had retired. With
$6,513,006 in the bank, he gazed down a clear path to Cigar's
career earnings record of $9,999,815.
</P>
<P>
   The questions began, strangely enough, following a
season-opening victory in the San Pasqual Handicap at Santa Anita.
In a first-time occurrence that Stevens calls ``a mystery,'' Silver
Charm dropped more than eight lengths behind the leader midway
through the 1 1/16-mile race before rallying to win in an
unimpressive time.
</P>
<P>
   To handicappers, the performance indicated Silver Charm had lost
his early speed and maybe his interest in racing.
</P>
<P>
   The new skeptics seemed to be vindicated three weeks later when
Silver Charm, racing for the first time at Gulfstream Park near
Miami, dropped a little farther off the pace in the 1[-mile Donn
Handicap and this time finished third to Puerto Madero and Behrens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signs of a Fading Star?'' headlined a Daily Racing Form
column.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the question that everyone keeps asking me _ me as a
jockey not even involved with Silver Charm!'' said Kent Desormeaux,
who rides Puerto Madero, leader of a Richard Mandella-trained
troika in the Big 'Cap. ``People are asking me if I think this
horse is done . . . `Is he going to come back? . . . Is this horse
finished? . . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was Puerto Madero who Stevens watched train on Tuesday
morning. The rival's half-mile workout in a sharp 47 1/5 seconds
didn't shake the jockey's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm's Florida race, Stevens argued, was better than it
appeared. They started from the far outside in a 12-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't sluggish from the gate,'' Stevens said. ``He broke
half a length in front of most of the rest of the field. I had to
decide really quick if I was going to take him back and save ground
or use (precious energy) to get up with the leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens applied the brakes and tried to settle in midpack, close
to the rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the field spread out and instead of being four lengths
back as I wanted, I was 11 lengths back,'' Stevens said. ``I knew
three-eighths (of a mile from the finish) I was toast. He overcame
a lot to be third.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Stevens and Baffert have tried to drill the speed
back into Silver Charm with a series of fast workouts, the latest a
five-eighths-of-a-mile blast Monday whose 57-second clocking was
best of the morning by 1 3/5.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who was aboard, said that's as well as Silver Charm has
ever trained.
</P>
<P>
   It's dangerous to discount the old boy. He has been as good when
he isn't favored (4 for 7, including the Derby and Preakness wins)
as when he is (6 for 13). So his opponents' handlers take nothing
for granted this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never throw out Silver Charm,'' Desormeaux said.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of gamblers will throw him out, looking for a big
payoff in the Big 'Cap. If they're right, the questions will
continue from here to Dubai, where Silver Charm is scheduled to
defend his championship later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   He won't have to answer there either, having never learned
Arabic.

FROM SPIN CYCLE TO SOAP OPERA 
SRO AT THE PLAZA FOR A HILLARY EVENT 
DESIGNER'S PONCHO, WITH A TWIST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif., Conn.)  (nk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if the line between fiction and reality on television was not
blurry enough, consider this: when the fictional character Ally
McBeal has a daydream, it involves a real person talking about her.
Specifically, former White House press secretary Michael D.
McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   There he was on the Fox nighttime soap opera on Monday, telling
reporters about Ally's guilt-ridden love of Billy, a colleague she
once dated. Billy is now married to Georgia, another partner in
their law firm. Last week, Ally and Billy went so far as to kiss.
</P>
<P>
   This time, McCurry did not say he was out of the loop, though he
was. (More about that later.) He simply explained her feelings
better than she had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, she feels remorse,'' McCurry said. ``She's
embarrassed. But she didn't lie to Georgia. She just didn't
volunteer information.''
</P>
<P>
   So why was McCurry on ``Ally McBeal?''
</P>
<P>
   He and the executive producer, David E. Kelley, have known each
other since 1975, when Kelley was a freshman at Princeton
University and McCurry was a senior and his resident adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had this bright idea for a cameo,'' McCurry said, ``and it
sounded like it would be fun to do on a layover on the West Coast.
It took all of about 20 minutes to actually tape.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the four sentences that McCurry said on camera, ``He
actually wrote that,'' McCurry said, referring to Kelley. ``His
script minders wanted to make sure I said that word for word, no
impromptu allowed. I'm not used to being so programmed in my
responses.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, about McCurry being out of the loop when it came to the
goings-on on ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>

   ``I have to confess that being a baby boomer who usually falls
asleep by 9 o'clock at night, I have yet to see a complete

<P>
   SRO AT THE PLAZA FOR A HILLARY EVENT
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled to be there. George A. Dean,
a 69-year-old former advertising executive from Southport, Conn.,
is not.
</P>
<P>
   Dean wanted to buy a ticket to what is likely to be Wednesday's
hottest fund-raiser, a lunch at the Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But the event is sold out. The Democratic National Committee
said 300 people on a waiting list had to be turned away.
</P>
<P>
   This was after the Democrats expanded the guest list to 900, 400
more than when the lunch was scheduled three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was before all the talk about whether Mrs.
Clinton should, would or could run for the Senate seat being
vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I was disappointed'' to have been turned away, said
Dean, adding that he is not a Democrat. ``I used to be a
Republican, but I voted for Ralph Nader last time.''
</P>
<P>
   He became a fan of Mrs. Clinton's after he heard her speak last
year in Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have her as a senator from here in Connecticut,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his career is pretty much over. It's conceivable if
she wins in the Senate, in 2004 or 2008, she could be running
against Liddy Dole for the presidency. Stranger things have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Designer's Poncho, With a Twist
</P>
<P>
   First Andy Warhol, then Keith Haring, now the fashion designer
Kate Spade.
</P>
<P>
   Warhol and Haring did paintings of Absolut vodka bottles that
appeared in advertisements. Ms. Spade, who is known for accessories
like handbags, messenger bags and cosmetic bags, has created a
plastic rain poncho for Absolut. She will sell it for $25 in her
stores in SoHo, Boston and Los Angeles, with $20 from each sale
going to the Horticultural Society of New York.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, she drinks the product. She said she likes vodka
martinis, straight up with an olive.

TIMES' TOP AD POST CHANGES HANDS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Daniel H. Cohen, the senior vice president for
advertising at The New York Times, is resigning to start a
television production company that will work in tandem with the
Times Electronic Media Co., developing programming to attract an
audience of young people more wedded to television than to print
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Janet L. Robinson, the newspaper's president and general
manager, announced Cohen's departure Tuesday and said that Jyll F.
Holzman, an advertising executive with wide experience in magazine
publishing, would succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Holzman has been a vice president for advertising at the
Times since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the newspaper became the first publication ever to
generate more than $1 billion in advertising revenues in a year.
Ms. Robinson, in a statement, noted that Cohen ``has been
instrumental in the growth of the print expansion of the Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, 46, joined the company in 1983. Earlier, he was vice
president for business affairs at Fort Worth Productions, an
independent film production company. He began his career as a
broadcast journalist and director at WESH-TV in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is the son of Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger, a director of the
Times Co., and a cousin of Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and
chief executive of the company. In a memo to the staff Tuesday,
Sulzberger said of Cohen, ``Even as he led the Times to
unparalleled levels of print advertising revenue, he has been a
strong voice for our electronic future, both on the Internet and in
broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   Sulzberger continued: ``Dan, at heart, has always had a strong
streak of the entrepreneur in him. He must be related to Adolph
Ochs.'' Like Sulzberger, Cohen is a great-grandson of Ochs, who
purchased the Times in 1896.
</P>
<P>
   ``This next stage of Dan's life will give him the freedom that
every entrepreneur needs,'' Sulzberger said. ``But he will be very
much missed from our day-to-day activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Holzman, 46, has worked at the Times Co. for five years,
starting as advertising director of Child magazine, part of a group
that the company sold in 1994. After working for a year for the
magazine Family Fun, owned by the Walt Disney Co., she joined the
Times in 1995 as a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   One of her immediate challenges will be to sustain advertising
revenue growth at a time when newspapers from Los Angeles to Boston
and New York have been experiencing weakness in help-wanted
classified advertising, the segment that traditionally produces the
largest profit margins.

<P>
   Treks through the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest of southwestern
Uganda to see the rare mountain gorillas are small, exclusive
forays that begin in a tranquil agricultural valley.
</P>
<P>
   But that calm was shattered on Monday when eight tourists,
including an American couple, were hacked or bludgeoned to death in
the jungle by a band of Hutu rebels armed with automatic rifles,
machetes and spears _ remnants of the murderous army that laid
waste to Rwanda in 1994. Four Ugandan park employees were slain in
the campsites.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign victims included four Britons and two New Zealanders
as well as the Americans, who were executives for Intel Corp., the
Oregon-based computer chip manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that I saw had their heads crushed in and deep
slashes,'' said Mark Ross, an American tour leader who was released
by the attackers after a forced march into the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women that we'd been told would be escorted back had been
killed on the spot,'' said Ross, speaking to reporters at a news
conference Tuesday in the Ugandan capital of Kampala. ``It looks
like one was raped prior to being killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the attack on the 31 tourists apparently lies
rooted in the murky violence that has beset central Africa for
years, gradually seeping over the national borders linking Rwanda,
the Congo and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors said as many as 150 ragtag soldiers materialized out
of the trees and sought out Americans and Britons among the
tourists. The State Department said the soldiers were Hutu, the
ethnic group that fled neighboring Rwanda after killing over
500,000 rival Tutsi and moderate Hutu in the genocide of five years
ago. Now regrouped in the wilds of the Congo, the Hutu oppose
American and British support for the Ugandan military and others
who are seen as sympathizing with the Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon couple who died were identified as Robert Haubner,
48, and Susan Miller, 42, who had spent their honeymoon in Africa
and had returned with some friends from Intel for their third trip.
</P>
<P>
   Haubner, a 16-year Intel employee, was the worldwide director of
customer support. His wife, who had worked there 15 years, was a
senior trade show manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shocked and stunned by this news,'' said Bill Calder, a
spokesman for the company. ``These were two valued employees with
very distinguished careers. They loved to travel around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Foreign Office said the names of the British victims
would be released Wednesday. New Zealand Foreign Ministry officials
told Reuters that Rhonda Avis, 27, and Michelle Strathern, 26, were
believed to have been slain and that Ms. Avis' husband had
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Britons killed was Mark Lindgren, 23, a recent
graduate of Nottingham University, a young British man who was on a
three-month tour of Africa before concentrating on his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London quoted his father, John Lindgren, as saying,
``Mark was kindhearted, generous, bright and loved life.'' His
father said he was ``respected by the people he worked with and he
had a bright future ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the border with Congo is easily within an hour's
walk from the entrance to the forest park, the violence there
seemed far away on Monday as the camp was gradually coming to life
at 6:45 a.m. The sun was up, but it had yet to peek over the
surrounding hills.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tourists were shaking themselves from sleep at that
point, since the starting time for the trek up into the hills was
at 8 a.m. They never made it.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels burst into the camp with a blast of grenades and
automatic weapons fire. The Ugandans _ a game warden and three park
rangers _ were killed in the initial assault. The rebels looted the
buildings, setting a few on fire and torching the vehicles they
came across as well.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors said that initially the rebels herded 31 tourists into
the Abercrombie and Kent encampment and began stripping them of
their valuables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly some soldiers came in the tent and they asked for
money, for jewelry, for watches,'' said Anne Peltier, the deputy
ambassador to Uganda for France, who was among the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At first the rebels seemed to be treating the tourists well, but
some of those captured had a foreboding of what was to come by the
treatment of one group of British tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Adams, 54, from California, was among the 15 hostages
rounded up and sent into the jungle with the troops about 40
minutes after the first attack. She had already seen that the
British man sitting next to her had purple toenails from where he
had been beaten on the feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British people were being forced to walk barefoot if they
had no shoes,'' said Mrs. Adams, who feigned an asthma attack and
waved her inhaler as the march got under way. The soldiers let her
walk back into the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Studd, the mother of Susan Studd, a 46-year-old Oregon
woman who survived the attack, said she talked to her daughter in
Kampala Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She said her daughter and the daughter's husband, Robert
McLaurin, 44, were awakened in their tent in the Abercrombie and
Kent encampment by grenade explosions and gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They heard a woman scream, so they got out the back of their
tent and went into the bush and hid there,'' said Mrs. Studd. ``It
was just a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Another American, Elizabeth Garland, 29, a Fulbright scholar
from the University of Chicago, told her father that she escaped by
hiding in her tent. Her father, James Garland, the president of
Miami University in Ohio, told The Associated Press that his
daughter, too, had been awakened by gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments had already warned tourists against
traveling through much of western Uganda because of rebel and
bandit activity near the border with Congo. Up until now, however,
the Bwindi gorilla reserve had been considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   The attack struck a blow at Uganda, itself on the mend after
years of chaos. The State Department warned American citizens to
postpone travel to the region until further notice, and at least
two tour companies said they were suspending trips to the region
until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Acacia Expeditions said six of the people killed were
on one of its tours. Its travelers, known as ``overlanders,'' are
generally budget tourists who spend weeks traveling across Africa
in large, open trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The other tour group, the upscale Abercrombie and Kent, which
ran the most exclusive tent encampment at the forest, announced
Tuesday that it was closing the facility until it had assurances
that security could be maintained. Its clients would be offered
full refunds or alternative trips, said Alistair Ballantine,
president of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their income level, the tourists at the Impenetrable
Forest all lived in fairly close proximity in a series of clearings
that resembled a small village built near the entrance to the park.
</P>
<P>
   The most budget-conscious tourists _ including most of those
sent by Acacia_ camped in a clearing. Nearby was a series of round
African huts known as bandas and a lodge run by the African Pearl
safari tour company. The Abercrombie and Kent Gorilla Forest Camp
was a series of ten tents with concrete floors that were tucked in
amongst the trees for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a site of the mountain gorillas had become
especially popular after the 1988 movie ``Gorillas in the Mist,''
which starred Sigourney Weaver as the researcher Dian Fossey, who
dedicated her life to saving the gorillas in Rwanda.

XYLAN HAS SEEN STAR RISE LATELY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. -- Tuesday's announcement that Alcatel SA,
Europe's No. 2 phone equipment maker, has bought Xylan Corp. for
nearly $2 billion caps what has been an impressive five-year run
for the local electronics manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Xylan makes computer network equipment -- high-tech routers and
switches that speed information through data networks like the
Internet and corporate ``intranets.'' The company's 4,000-plus
customers include telecom companies like Sprint and MCI-WorldCom,
data-reliant firms such as IBM and 3M Co., and educational
organizations including Texas A&AMP;M University and the Getty Center
museum.
</P>
<P>
   With the volume of global data traffic worldwide growing far
faster than that of voice calls, firms like Xylan have been in the
ascendancy of late, while traditional phone equipment makers like
Alcatel have been playing catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   To bridge the gap, telecom giants have been gobbling up
data-equipment makers, highlighted in January by Lucent
Technologies' agreement to pay $20 billion for Ascend
Communications. Xylan, which generated about one-tenth that price
from Alcatel, is simply the latest in that trend.
</P>
<P>
   The Calabasas company in suburban Los Angeles County was formed
in 1993 by Douglas Hill, who developed the company's marketing
team; Steve Kim, now the chairman and chief executive; Yuri
Pikover, who built the company's sales force; and John Bailey, who
built the engineering organization. Together the team raised $30
million in start-up capital, then went public in early 1996 with a
stock offering that generated $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   Xylan turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 1995, and
in the last two years has been growing at an impressive 65 percent
annual rate based on revenues. The company had 1998 sales of $348
million, has no debt and is sitting on about $200 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said his company ``has grown beyond anyone's expectations
over the last five years'' and the deal with Alcatel will give
Xylan ``a dramatic boost.'' He noted in frustration that part of
the impetus to sell was the fact that the company's share price had
not kept pace with its sales and earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   But as buyers go, Alcatel seems a logical fit. Xylan got more
than 12 percent of its fourth-quarter revenue from sales to
Alcatel, and the French firm already owned 6 percent of Xylan's
stock from a 1995 deal.
</P>
<P>
   The $37-per-share price Alcatel has offered should also help
smooth the transition. According to Xylan spokeswoman Kim Kadish,
most employees have some degree of stock options, which last year
were revalued to an exercise price of $15.8125. At a $37 purchase
price, that means each option can now be cashed in for more than
$21 profit before taxes and transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the biggest winners from the stock option program are
the founders and other top executives like Kim, Pikover and Bailey,
who have between 7,000 and 130,000 options each, according to the
company's most recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings,
in addition to the hundreds of thousands of shares they already
own.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, for example, owns 3.3 million shares and Pikover owns 2.4
million. After Tuesday morning's announcement of the deal, shares
of Xylan soared 32.7 percent, increasing Kim's stake in the company
from $89.6 million to $118.9 million.

FRENCH TELECOM BEHEMOTH ALCATEL CONFIRMS XYLAN DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. -- The rumors are finally right: Xylan Corp.
is being bought.
</P>
<P>
   French telecommunications giant Alcatel SA said Tuesday it will
pay nearly $2 billion for the Calabasas-based maker of network
switching equipment, ending months of speculation over Xylan's
future.
</P>
<P>
   The Calabasas company in suburban Los Angeles County had been a
rumored takeover target for more than 18 months, with Paris-based
Alcatel always considered a likely bidder. The reason: The
Internet. Amid slowing sales of its voice equipment, the Xylan
purchase will boost Alcatel's position as an equipment supplier to
telephone companies looking to become or expand their roles as
Internet service providers, and to large corporations with growing
data networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something Alcatel really needed,'' said analyst Marc
Woodward at Battery Ventures in San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Alcatel's dearth of in-house products in the data
network arena has been an albatross around its neck. Due in part to
the Internet business it lost to competitors last year, the company
was forced in September to announce it would miss earnings
estimates, sending the firm's share price into a nose dive that
erased 38 percent of its value in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   The company tried to make do by buying from a variety of
hardware suppliers including Ascend Communications, Cisco Systems,
Xylan and others. But as several of those companies were themselves
bought by Alcatel competitors, the field of potential dance
partners quickly narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   Cash-rich after a three-year reorganization that saw it sell off
$4.7 billion worth of assets, Alcatel last year began a shopping
spree which, even with the Xylan deal, does not appear to be over.
It paid $4.4 billion in stock for DSC Communications Corp. of
Plano, Texas, beefing up its U.S. sales team and adding several
North American clients. And in December it bought Packet Engines
Inc., a computer-networking company based in Spokane, Wash., for
$315 million cash.
</P>
<P>
   The January purchase of Ascend, the No. 4 network equipment
maker, by Lucent Technologies for $20 billion added extra urgency
to the situation, and may have been what prompted Alcatel to move
on Xylan now.
</P>
<P>
   Already owning 6.5 percent of Xylan from a 1995 deal -- and
accounting for more than 12 percent of the smaller firm's fourth
quarter sales -- Alcatel offered the company $37 per share for its
remaining stock and stock options, a 37 percent premium over the
issue's closing price Monday. Xylan shares had already risen nearly
40 percent in recent weeks on speculation that some sort of deal
was in the works, and the issue closed up $8.8125 Tuesday at
$35.75, a one-day gain of 32.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk said on Tuesday that his firm
would likely buy another company by week's end. He declined to say
which firm was being considered, but said it would provide Alcatel
with the ability to link mobile computers to local networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of communications and networking is undergoing
fundamental changes,'' Olivier Houssin, executive vice president of
Alcatel Telecom, said in explaining the flood of recent deals.
``Voice and data are converging. The new world will not contain
voice companies and data companies. It will only contain
information companies.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping round out Alcatel's bullpen, Tuesday's
proposed purchase, which must still be approved by regulators on
both sides of the Atlantic, is seen as a plus for Xylan, too. The
company, which will remain a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcatel,
was already being overshadowed by larger players such as Cisco and
Ascend, a trend that would likely have continued without a large
parent to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of industry giants, Xylan has grown beyond
anyone's expectations,'' Chairman and chief executive Steve Kim
said Tuesday. Still, Kim said, he had been frustrated because even
as its sales grew, the company's stock price until very recently
did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's investors are favoring the large companies,'' Kim told
the Associated Press. ``They see us as still small.''

HARRY L. ROSSOLL, WHO DREW SMOKEY BEAR, IS DEAD AT 89
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry L. Rossoll, a Forest Service illustrator whose ``Smokey
Says'' newspaper cartoons helped make Smokey Bear almost as famous
as Santa Claus and an almost universally recognized symbol of
forest fire safety, died last Thursday at a hospital near his home
in Atlanta. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Rossoll, an illustrator in the Forest Service's regional office
in Atlanta since the mid-1930s, was in the Navy in San Francisco,
drawing morale-boosting posters for the Treasure Island base when
Smokey Bear was created by committee in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when lumber was critical for the war effort and the
Forest Service's firefighting corps was being depleted by the
military draft, Smokey grew out of a joint effort by the Forest
Service and the Advertising Council to put the public in the battle
to prevent forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Smokey made his first appearance, on a poster by a
Saturday Evening Post illustrator, Albert Staehle, the organizers
had rejected many other animals, including Bambi, whose services
were offered by Walt Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Rossoll recalled that before leaving for the Navy
in March 1944, he had submitted some suggestions of his own,
including a friendly human ranger, a firefighting beaver and even a
little bear, which, he thought, just might have been the original
Smokey.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, in researching his 1994 biography, ``Smokey Bear 20252,''
(a reference to Smokey's personal ZIP code), William Clifford
Lawter Jr. could find no evidence that officials at the Forest
Service's Washington headquarters had ever seen Rossoll's work.
</P>
<P>
   But once he returned from the service in late 1945, Rossoll was
soon on the Smokey bandwagon, turning out weekly cartoons with
their familiar cautionary tales of what happens when campers are
careless with matches.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with what became the official Smokey, an almost
military-looking figure with his neat Forest Ranger cap and ever
present shovel, the early Rossoll version was a decidedly
disheveled character, with a World War I campaign hat complete with
chin strap, baggy dungarees, a paunch and such a bulbous nose it
appeared he had been spending more time raiding backwoods stills
than hunting honey bee nests.
</P>
<P>
   In time, however, Rossoll's comic Smokey began conforming to the
official image, which had been developed in 1948 by Rudolph
Wendelin, a Forest Service artist who reproduced the image for the
40th-anniversary commemorative Smokey stamp issued in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Wendelin recalled Tuesday that he had produced the standard
Smokey image by softening a bear produced by the artist James
Hansen for an early Smokey poster.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his role in creating Smokey, Rossoll was soon so
identified with the bear that he was in demand to give talks to
rangers, children and others.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he retired in 1971, Rossoll had drawn close to 1,000
Smokey cartoons, which were supplied free by the Forest Service to
some 3,000 newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   For Rossoll, a native of Norwich, Conn., Smokey was just an
accidental detour in a life devoted to art. The son of German
immigrant factory workers who wanted him to go into chicken
farming, Rossoll, who once said his earliest memories were of
wanting to be an artist, got an early start. When he was a
youngster, he recalled, his mother let him draw murals on the
kitchen and bathroom walls.
</P>
<P>
   The family was also musical and Rossoll became such an
accomplished trumpet player that he played in New York jazz clubs
in the 1920s and in various Georgia groups after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Norwich without finishing high school, Rossoll studied
commercial art in Chicago and at the Grand Central Art School in
New York in 1929 before he and his wife moved to her home state,
Mississippi, and settled in Jackson, where he eked out a living in
the early years of the Depression painting billboards and affixing
polka dots to women's shoes and other items during a 1930s polka
dot craze.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Forest Service, Rossoll continued to work as
an artist, setting up his own studio and producing among other
works, a series of murals on display at a museum at the Beavers
Bend State Park in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   That commission led to a new bear venture. At the request of a
major lumberman, he developed Tree Bear, who has appeared in
magazines and trade journals with seedlings to spread the message
about how much the world owes to trees.
</P>
<P>
   At Rossoll's request, his niece, Dr. June A. Bradlaw, a
microbiologist from Rockville, Md., said Tuesday that she had
produced a children's book featuring Tree Bear, which, together
with her uncle's drawings, she hoped would soon find a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Rossoll, whose wife died several years ago, leaves no immediate
survivors.

ABOUT NEW YORK: THE DRAPERIES TRY TO MATCH THE SHOPPERS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite the promise of Orchard Street's sylvan name,
who needs trees lining its sidewalks? This Lower East Side shopping
paradise is a bargain-hunter's Garden of Eden, with dozens of
leather jackets and bags dangling from awnings and waiting to be
plucked. And while it isn't exactly a pastoral symphony, the
kinetic come-ons from hawkers provide a steady sound track for a
stroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got leathers for less,'' one vendor shouted to no one and
everyone. ``Check it out. Check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   No spiel-makers are needed at Beckenstein Home Fabrics, a home
decorating business that has lured generations of design-savvy
shoppers to its store inside a former telephone company switch
exchange at 130 Orchard St. It is part of a small empire that
Samuel Beckenstein started some 80 years ago selling rags from a
pushcart on Water Street. He grew the business and diversified into
men's tailoring, women's clothing, draperies and upholstery. Other
businesses came and went in the neighborhood, but Beckenstein's
stayed and prospered.
</P>
<P>
   But like the immigrants who passed through the nearby tenements
on their way to success, uptown beckons. Garry Greenberg, 46, the
third-generation president of the home fabric store, is moving to a
new location at Fifth Avenue and West 20th Street in the Flatiron
district later this month, the better to compete with the other
upscale home decor stores in that area.
</P>
<P>
   His explanation for the move is similar to what he tells
customers who are overwhelmed by the thousands of imported fabric
swatches and custom room designs he displays in his store. ``All
this reflects a variety of choices, but in reality there are few
answers,'' he said. ``This is definitely a great neighborhood for
people who want to stretch the buck. But it's a different type of
person now. Nothing is wrong with that. It's just not my
clientele.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes that brought about this move began decades ago. The
clothing stores that attracted plenty of curious shoppers to the
block could not compete with uptown department stores that sold
discounted mass-produced suits. The 1970s repeal of the city's blue
laws, which had made stores close one day a week, ended the
advantage of local Jewish shopkeepers who were off on Saturdays and
open for business on Sundays. Older merchants either leased their
buildings to other businesses or converted them into apartments.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Greenberg saw his competitors moving uptown. He
also lost sales to those new, big-box stores that were opening up
in the Flatiron district. By last year, he had decided to move. His
father, Murray, who started the home decor division, agreed it was
a smart decision, even if his son was leaving the area both of them
had known for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to go with the times and the times are uptown,''
Murray said. ``Today, you can't go on emotion. You have to go where
you can cover your overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   Or where you can make your own mark. Garry is in awe of his
grandfather, who came to this country from Poland and built up his
business while managing to get his family out of Europe before
World War II began. Samuel Beckenstein had enough ingenuity to find
a profitable niche in making trousers to match worn-out suits.
While he made a tidy sum off the seats of other people's pants, he
ran his business with an expertise that was hardly seat of the
pants. Relatives knew something big had happened when he asked how
to spell ``million.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm baffled,'' Garry said. ``He grew a business and he didn't
even write English. The only way he communicated with the business
community was through his accountants and lawyers. Here I am, a
well-educated man, there's no way I could duplicate his success. He
identified opportunity. The second generation maintained the
accomplishments of the first. And my generation just spreads it out
a little bit. But no one ever took it to another level. That's what
I'm trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's moving uptown, Garry still comes across as sincere
and unassuming. Celebrities shop at his store, but he remains
unfazed, much as he was in the 1980s when the Indian Prime
Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, and his wife shopped at Beckensteins.
Months later, they invited him to a state dinner in Washington. He
declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was during the summer and I'm a big Hamptons guy,'' he
explained. ``I'm not giving up a weekend in the Hamptons to sit in
the Rose Garden. I let my father and mother go. I went to the
beach.''

EDITORIAL: UNEXPLANED STRATEGIES ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 3:
</P>
<P>
   Without ever saying as much, the White House seems to have
shifted its military strategy in Iraq to advance the goal of
toppling Saddam Hussein. The change has become clear in recent days
as Washington escalated its air strikes against Iraq. The bombing
raids appear designed to punish the Iraqi military in hopes that
disgruntled officers will lead a rebellion against Saddam rather
than suffer further losses of men and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the new American strategy, President Clinton or
Defense Secretary William Cohen should let the American people and
Congress know. The air raids are no secret in Iraq, and the
potential threat to Saddam is no doubt well understood in Baghdad.
Many Americans might support an effort to unseat Saddam. But the
application of American force overseas should never be a matter of
mystery and speculation at home or exempt from congressional
consultation. One of these days an American or British pilot may be
captured or killed, and the reasons for placing him in danger ought
to be explained before that day arrives.
</P>
<P>
   It no longer seems plausible to suggest, as the Pentagon does,
that the daily air attacks are merely a response to Iraqi efforts
to shoot down American and British planes. Iraq has challenged the
flights, but the expanding American rules of engagement give pilots
greater latitude to strike an assortment of air defense,
communications and other military targets.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also needs to answer reports that American spies
manipulated the United Nations weapons inspection program in Iraq.
The latest account was provided on Tuesday by The Washington Post,
which reported that Americans had secretly wired a U.N. microwave
transmission system to allow Washington to monitor a wide range of
secret Iraqi military communications without the knowledge of U.N.
officials. Washington's desire to collect information on Iraq's
military is understandable, but data should not be gathered in a
way that compromises the United Nation's independence. That will
only make it harder to carry out disarmament under international
authority in the future, and will hinder American efforts to
counter the spread of prohibited weapons worldwide.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 3:
</P>
<P>
   The ethics commission empaneled by the U.S. Olympic Committee
has provided an excellent template for reforming the International
Olympic Committee and eliminating its graft-friendly culture. The
recommendations, which the commission chairman, former Sen. George
Mitchell, released Monday, champion structural changes that can
help inoculate the IOC, national Olympic committees and competing
cities against the kind of vote-buying that helped Salt Lake City
boosters win the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell panel's proposals include a ban on all gifts but
those of nominal value to members from candidate cities; selection
of a majority of IOC members by national Olympic committees and
other qualified groups; term limits and strict conflict-of-interest
policies, and annual independent audits of IOC books that would be
made public.
</P>
<P>
   As a private entity under Swiss law, the IOC is currently
accountable to no one. But in a potentially strong deterrent to
corruption, the commission urged the IOC to become a ``public
international organization'' as defined by a new global convention
on combating bribery in business transactions. This agreement calls
for the United States and other signatories to expand anti-bribery
laws to cover officers and agents of public international groups.
All President Clinton need do is designate the IOC as a public
international organization and persuade other nations to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Although the commission lacked subpoena power, it estimated that
Salt Lake City boosters had spent between $4 million and $7 million
since 1989 on IOC members and relatives. The panel also raised a
thorny question. Beyond two executives and several trustees who
have resigned, were any other trustees of the Salt Lake committees
aware of the improprieties? Only the investigations being conducted
by the Department of Justice and Utah's attorney general can
provide the answer.

HORACE TAPSCOTT, JAZZ PIANIST AND COMMUNITY ADVOCATE, DIES AT 64
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Texas)  (nk) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Horace Tapscott, whose accomplishments as a jazz pianist and
bandleader were matched by his legacy as a local community
organizer, died on Saturday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his manager and publicist, Corine Hunter,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Few jazz musicians with an individual style and a recognized
name reject the promise of an international solo career, but
Tapscott, for the most part, stayed at home. His anchor was the
Union of God's Musicians and Artists Ascension (Ugmaa), a
collective that he set up in the Watts neighborhood in 1961 to find
employment for musicians, dancers and visual artists in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He also taught and guided hundreds of youths who could not
afford music lessons. One of his methods of teaching young students
was to enlist them in his Pan-Afrikan People's Arkestra, a group he
conducted, supplied with compositions and kept together until his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Tapscott was born in Houston and was taken to Los Angeles at the
age of 9 by his mother, a stride pianist and tuba player named Mary
Lou Malone. They lived close to Local 767, the city's black
musicians union, and he often spent time around older musicians and
friends of the family like Buddy Collette and Gerald Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Tapscott was a trombone player during the golden
era of Central Avenue, which was the Los Angeles equivalent of New
York's 125th Street _ a mecca of black American entrepreneurship
and entertainment. Among his friends were soon-to-be-famous young
players from the area including the trumpeter Don Cherry, the
saxophonists Eric Dolphy and Frank Morgan and the clarinetist John
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early 1950s the scene had changed: The black and
white musicians' unions integrated, enabling blacks to find work
playing on film and television soundtracks, and simultaneously the
Central Avenue clubs sputtered out. After spending four years in
the Air Force during the 1950s, Tapscott began to think about new
ways that jazz could gain some measure of respect and support
within the black population of Los Angeles; a disillusioning tour
of the South that he took with Lionel Hampton's big band in 1958
sharpened those ideas and led him to organize his own union.
</P>
<P>
   The organization limped along until 1965, when the Watts
neighborhood of Los Angeles erupted in riots. Tapscott and his
Arkestra rode through the thick of it, playing on the backs of
flatbed trucks. In the aftermath of the riots, the union got some
state and federal funding, and the Arkestra began to cohere through
weekly performances, often in universities and churches.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Tapscott composed and arranged music for a memorable
album by the alto saxophonist Sonny Criss called ``Birth of the New
Cool.'' The first recording under his own name, ``The Giant Is
Awakened,'' appeared in 1969 and introduced the saxophonist Arthur
Blythe, who would become an important player in New York a decade
later.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkestra was not recorded until 1978, and despite all its
continuous activity _ musicians like David Murray, Butch Morris and
Azar Lawrence were members for a time _ it never became a touring
band; its first European concert was in 1995. (Tapscott himself had
never played a significant concert in New York until he was booked
at the Village Vanguard in the summer of 1991.)
</P>
<P>
   He began playing the piano in the late 1950s, after a car crash
that weakened his embouchure for the trombone. He developed a
loose-limbed, Thelonious Monk-inspired style, with banged
dissonances and dark, seductive harmonies; it suited the percussive
vamps and odd time signatures of his writing. Seven of his
recordings since the mid-70s were released by the small record
label Nimbus; other recordings since the 80s appeared on the Hat
Hut and Arabesque labels. The latest, from 1997, is the trio
recording ``Thoughts of Dar es Salaam.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapscott is survived by his wife, Cecilia; a sister, Robbie Byrd
of Dallas; nine children; 21 grandchildren, and two
great-grandchildren.

IRIDIUM WILL MISS QUARTERLY SALES TARGET
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By REBECCA ROWLING  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
Iridium, the global satellite tele phone network dreamed up by
three Motorola engineers in Chandler, said Tuesday that it does not
expect to meet its sales and customer goals for the quarter. Its
stock price fell 12 percent on the news.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iridium LLC said it will likely fail to meet the minimum sales
and subscriber targets for the first quar ter of 1999 that were set
in the company's $800 million senior se cured credit agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The report drove Iridium stock down 2 to close at 21, well below
its 52-week high of 72 reached in May.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium blamed its troubles on difficulty in getting its phones
to customers and building a fully trained sales force.
</P>
<P>
   Although the service was launched in November, it wasn't until
the middle of February that Kyocera Corp. of Japan, one of the two
companies making Iridium handsets, began shipping the prod ucts.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Kyocera has resolved software problems with the phones,
it can start distributing them to a waiting list of customers
around the world. Iridium isn't saying how many are waiting for
phones but says the demand is especially strong in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium wholesales its service to 15 franchises around the world
that are responsible for sales in their region. Some of the
franchises, including Iridium North America, rely upon service
providers like Sprint PCS to sell the phones to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium has certified 85 service providers, another 85 are
undergo ing certification and 50 more have signed up to become
providers. The expanded sales force should help the company sign up
more custom ers.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium maintains that demand for its costly service is high. An
Iridium phone costs $3,000, and calls cost between $2 and $7 a
minute. Some analysts have ques tioned how many people would be
willing to pay that kind of money to use the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The causes of the delays in Iridium's subscriber ramp-up have
not been associated with the level of market demand for our
product, which we believe to be strong,'' an Iridium statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium was expected to have $30 million in accrued revenue from
subscriber billings and at least 52,000 subscribers by the
quarter's end.
</P>
<P>
   It had only 3,000 subscribers and $186,000 in accrued revenue at
the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium said it expects to begin discussions with its banks,
Chase Manhattan Corp. and Barclays Plc, to renegotiate its
agreements. Ana lysts expect the banks to be willing to deal, since
it's in nobody's interest for Iridium to default.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium said its shortfall will not affect its ability to meet
its debts.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. lowered Iridium's corporate and secured
bank loan debt rating one notch upon word that the company would
not meet its goals.
</P>
<P>
   At least one analyst said that the bench marks were too high and
that it was no surprise that Iridium failed to the meet them.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium says it's ``very confi dent'' it will meet its
previously announced goal of 500,000 to 600,000 customers by the
year's end.
</P>
<P>
   That's because strong demand exists and Iridium is working out
the kinks of being a global business from the first day of
operation, spokeswoman Michelle Lyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola characterized Iridium's troubles as the growing pains
of a start-up company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motorola is very confident that the market segment exists for
the Iridium system and they will be able to capture that market
here with time,'' spokesman Robert Edwards said. &QL;

MARY J. LOWE, 74, U.S. JUDGE NOTED FOR HER RULINGS ON BIAS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judge Mary Johnson Lowe, a federal judge in the Southern
District of New York who was known for her rulings in
discrimination cases, died Saturday at a hospital in Las Vegas. She
was 74 and had homes in the Bronx and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, and she had been in declining
health, a daughter, Leslie H. Lowe, said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lowe was the second black woman appointed to the federal
judiciary, according to The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education.
She was recommended by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and
appointed by President Carter in 1978. At the time, there were 400
federal trial judges, 15 of whom were black and 5 of whom were
female.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior judge, a status she acquired in 1991, she sat on the
bench in New York for part of the year, and had been doing some
judicial work while in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, in District Court in Manhattan, she issued a widely
noted injunction barring New York City from ``refusing to allow
homeless individuals to register to vote on the ground that they
fail to inhabit traditional residences.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the city's Board of Elections had defined the term
``residence'' to exclude ``an entire group of otherwise eligible
voters,'' estimated at the time at 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, she said that voter residency requirements could
be satisfied by ``homeless individuals identifying a specific
location within a political community which they consider their
home base, to which they return regularly, manifest an intent to
remain for the present, and from which they can receive messages
and be contacted.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 she ruled that a New York City pension system, which
assumed that women lived three years longer than men, discriminated
illegally against women by requiring them to make higher
contributions even though they received lower monthly benefits when
they retired.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 ruling issued in Nevada, she held that the Las Vegas
Fire Department had illegally discriminated in hiring, training and
promoting black firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   She was a visiting lecturer at Harvard Law School. The honors
she received included a New York State Bar Association award for
her ``outstanding judicial contribution to the criminal justice
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lowe was born in Manhattan and grew up in Harlem. She
received a bachelor's degree in 1952 from Hunter College, and a law
degree with honors in 1954 from Brooklyn Law School, where she was
president of her class and the first black editor in chief of the
law review. She also received a master's degree in 1955 from
Columbia Law School.
</P>
<P>
   She was in private practice as a trial lawyer in criminal cases
before going on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lowe's marriages to Edward Hatfield Lowe and Ivan A.
Michael ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two daughters, Bess Michael of Washington,
and Leslie, of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Edward H. Lowe of Edison,
N.J.; a granddaughter; two sisters, Eddie Johnson Carkhum of
Teaneck, N.J., and Ann J. Bolton of Los Angeles, and four brothers,
Harry Johnson and Dr. James J. Johnson, both of Teaneck, and Dr.
John William Johnson and Robert Johnson, both of the Bronx.

President Blenda J. Wilson announced Tuesday she is ending her
sometimes stormy seven-year tenure at the college and taking a job
with an education foundation on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said after graduation ceremonies in early June she will
leave to serve as president and chief operating officer of the
newly founded Nellie Mae Foundation. The Braintree, Mass.-based
nonprofit organization provides educational grants to low-income
and disadvantaged students across New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was offered the perfect job for me, to promote access,
quality and effectiveness in education,'' said Wilson, 56, the
first African-American president in the CSU system and Northridge's
first woman president.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said by leading the foundation she can help improve the
quality of K-12 learning, pointedly noting 67 percent of CSUN's
incoming freshman need remediation in math and 62 percent in
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our higher education system is the best in the world,'' she
said. ``The threat to education is that our schools are not
performing. This gives me an opportunity to focus entirely in
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said she chose to leave the suburban Los Angeles campus
voluntarily, although she added: ``I regret that I can't be here
and some place else at the same time too . . . that I will not have
been here as long as I would've liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who had been one of the top finalists for the
president's post at Wayne State University in Detroit in August
1997, has been highly praised for reopening CSUN in time for the
spring semester four weeks after the devastating 1994 Northridge
Earthquake and for leading the herculean rebuilding program that
continues today. The quake caused more than $400 million in damages
to the San Fernando Valley campus approximately 25 miles northwest
of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared written statement, California State University
Chancellor Charles B. Reed praised Wilson, saying she has ``made an
indelible impression at CSUN.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She had the courage and vision to keep classes open (after the
earthquake),'' Reed said. ``We thank her for her contributions and
wish her well in her new endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   But the university's image also has suffered at times under her
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, former women's basketball coach Michael Abraham
was arrested on allegations of crack cocaine possession and
distribution. The case triggered the resignation of athletic
director Paul Bubb and his assistant, Judy Brame.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, Wilson came under harsh criticism for announcing
that four popular men's sports would be cut to balance the athletic
department budget and meet gender-equity requirements. Student
athletes and community members blasted the decision, calling it
abrupt and void of public input.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, the Federal Emergency Management Agency
investigated allegations of misuse of federal funds, including
reports that moving crews working on quake repairs moved office
equipment for Wilson's husband, Louis Fair Jr.
</P>
<P>
   While FEMA eventually dropped its investigation, the California
State University conducted an independent audit and found Wilson
exerted ``undue influence'' over movers, who may have felt
pressured to help the president. It was undetermined whether work
was performed on FEMA time or on the workers' own time.
</P>
<P>
   A separate, routine audit of CSUN's finances and management,
done every two years, will be released next week, said CSU
spokeswoman Colleen Bentley-Adler.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership has been unstable. At least six high-ranking campus
officials -- including Bubb and Brame -- have resigned over the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President of Student Affairs Ron Kopita, whose tasks
included overseeing athletics, announced in early February he will
leave his post by June 5 to consider other career options,
including teaching at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President of Administration and Finance Art Elbert,
who was in charge of overseeing FEMA funds, stepped down last
December to take a re-assignment at the CSU Chancellor's Office in
Long Beach. Part of his time is spent at the Northridge campus.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence O'Toole, the Nellie Mae foundation's chief executive
officer, said Wilson was selected to become the foundation's first
president from 200 candidates nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted to have her,'' he said. We ``selected her
because of the caliber of her intellectual curiosity and the
emotional commitment she displays toward helping kids learn.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN student body President Joaquin Macias called Wilson's
announcement ``a real loss for the university.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's terrible. You're killing me,'' Macias said when he
learned the news. ``I know she's been working real hard to get CSUN
back on its feet. She's held up real well under all the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stennis, a CSU trustee from Los Angeles who has served
on the board for six years, said Wilson is ``one of our best
presidents and most popular ones.'' He said Reed told trustees the
news Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Stennis said he doubts controversies pressured Wilson to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that. Knowing Blenda and the kind of person she
is, that would not affect her taking the position at all,'' Stennis
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bentley-Adler, a nationwide search will be
conducted for Wilson's replacement and an interim president will
likely be named to steer the campus after Wilson departs in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get a national search done in that short amount of
time,'' she said. ``It takes at least six months to do a search.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson previously was chancellor of the University of Michigan
at Dearborn from 1988-92 and served on the governor's cabinet as
executive director of the Colorado Commission on Higher Education
from 1984-88.
</P>
<P>
   She began her career in higher education administration at
Rutgers University in New Jersey in 1969 and was associate dean at
the Harvard University Graduate School of Education from 1972-82.

ROSE VISITS DODGERS

<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Pete Rose didn't look like the hit king on
Tuesday at Dodgertown. He wore blue sweats, a white, long-sleeved
shirt and a Dodgers promotional cap.
</P>
<P>
   But fans knew him. A crowd flocked around as he watched his son,
Pete Jr., play in an intrasquad game. They wished him well and
brought him anything they could find to be autographed.
</P>
<P>
   And while baseball has banished Rose, he hasn't banished
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made mistakes, so let's not say I was an angel, but the
game . . . was very, very good to me,'' said Rose, who splits time
between homes in Boca Raton, Fla., and the Studio City section of
Los Angeles. ``I miss the competitiveness of the game. I miss the
teaching of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose arrived at Dodgertown the day the veterans committee added
Orlando Cepeda, former umpire Nestor Chylak, turn-of-the-century
manager Frank Selee and Negro Leagues pitcher Smokey Joe Williams
to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Many people believe Rose, whose 4,256 career hits are tops in
baseball, should be enshrined in Cooperstown, N.Y., but a lifetime
ban makes him ineligible.

HEAT NIP KNICKS IN OVERTIME, 85-84 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ All the animosity and pride that have formed the
foundation of the Heat-Knicks rivalry bubbled to the surface on
Tuesday night. It provided fuel for the Knicks. They would not fold
in their third game in three nights. They would stand up and keep
attacking until the end.
</P>
<P>
   The end came in overtime when Patrick Ewing missed a 13-foot
running jumper over P.J. Brown as the Heat prevailed, 85-84, at the
Miami Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Playing 43 minutes, Ewing ended the game with 31 points and 16
rebounds, while his Georgetown buddy, Alonzo Mourning, had 28
points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Two free throws by Terry Porter with 54.8 seconds left gave the
Heat the deciding margin. Tim Hardaway returned after missing one
game with a hyperextended knee and added 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment, it looked as if the fumes were catching up
to the Knicks (9-6) in the fourth quarter. A lively Larry Johnson
started to fade as he missed five consecutive shots down the
stretch, and gave the Heat a chance to take a 68-67 lead on a
baseline jumper from Brown.
</P>
<P>
   One possession later, Brown gobbled up an offensive rebound, and
fired it back out to Rex Walters, who nailed a 3-pointer with seven
minutes left in the game. That gave the Heat a 71-67 lead and
ignited the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But Ewing came back with a dunk and then Allan Houston came back
from a dreadful night. After hitting just 2 of his first 12 shots,
he popped off a screen and delivered an 18-foot jumper with 34.3
seconds left to tie the game. Each team had a chance to issue the
final blow, but Ewing missed on a running jumper with 3.2 seconds
left. And then Porter, driving the baseline with 2.8 seconds left,
failed to get the call as he smacked up against Ewing. A failed
tip-in by Mourning, and the game went into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being satisfied with an inspired first half, the
Knicks refused to give in to fatigue and a quick Heat lead to tie
the game at 53 on a 15-8 run. Yes, the Knicks lashed back. The
bodies were banging, the intensity was rising and was punctuated by
hard fouls and a pileup on loose balls.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing gave the Knicks the lead back on a breakaway dunk
opportunity that turned into a hard foul by Brown. Ewing collected
his body, then hit two free throws to give the Knicks a 55-53 lead.
After a back-and-forth, he stepped back for a jumper over
Mourning's outstretched arms. Ewing kept on coming, and went to the
free-throw line to deliver four consecutive times.
</P>
<P>
   As an encore, he twisted on a reverse tip-in off a deflected
shot. Ewing, and Ewing alone, gave the Knicks a 65-62 lead as a
raucous third quarter ended. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one could have been sure that the Knicks _ and specifically
the 36-year-old Ewing _ would have this kind of effort in reserve
as they faced their third game in three nights.

<P>
   Richard R. Shinn, a retired chairman of the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co., who was active in the arts and civic affairs and
helped stave off New York City's fiscal crisis in the 1970s, died
Friday at his home in Greenwich, Conn., after a long battle with
leukemia. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Rider College in Trenton, N.J., Shinn
began his career at Metropolitan Life in 1939 in the mailroom. He
was paid $15 a week.
</P>
<P>
   By 1953, he had become an assistant vice president for the group
insurance division and was named vice president in charge of the
group in 1963. In the post, he was responsible for major contracts
with General Motors, General Electric and other large insurance
customers. He became executive vice president in 1966 and senior
executive vice president in 1968 in charge of all the company's
life and health insurance administration and sales operations. He
was elected president and a member of the board of directors in May
1969, and became chief executive in October 1973. He became
chairman of the board in 1980, the ninth person to head
Metropolitan since it was founded in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, the company phased out its traditional home
collection business and entered into the property and casualty
insurance and reinsurance businesses. In order to provide better
local service, he also established 10 subsidiaries. Metropolitan
Life also purchased the 59-story Pan Am Building on Park Avenue
north of Grand Central Terminal in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Shinn was a visionary leader who contributed over many
years to the history of Met Life and helped propel the company into
its prominent place in the financial services marketplace,'' said
Robert H. Benmosche, the company's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn retired as chairman in 1983 but remained active in civic
affairs and the arts during his retirement. Named executive vice
chairman of the New York Stock Exchange in 1986, he served as
chairman of an eight-member committee that the exchange set up the
following year to monitor its own self-regulatory system in the
wake of an insider trading scandal.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-1970s, at the request of Mayor Abraham Beame and
Gov. Hugh Carey, he served on several panels to help avert the
city's financial default. Recommendations from one of those panels,
composed of Shinn and three other executives, led to the creation
of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which helped resolve the
city's recurring short-term debt problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the discussions that led to the birth of the Municipal
Assistance Corporation, Dick Shinn was always a tower of
strength,'' Felix G. Rohatyn, the U.S. Ambassador to France, who is
the former head of the corporation, said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the crisis, and a compromise reached between the
mayor and the Municipal Assistance Corporation, Beame formed a
management advisory board to review city operations, which Shinn
led from 1975 through 1977. The commission recommended pay
increases for city officials, which were vetoed by Beame.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn led several New York City commissions, including one in
1983 that resulted in an increase in Mayor Ed Koch's salary from
$80,000, to $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn served on the board of directors of numerous corporations
including Chase Manhattan Bank, the Allied Corp., May Department
Stores, the Sperry Corp. and Consolidated Edison of New York. Shinn
was also a trustee of the Conference Board, an independent research
institute, and a member of the board of the Metropolitan Opera
Association, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the Ladies
Professional Golf Association.
</P>
<P>
   He holds honorary doctor of law degrees from Colgate University,
Rider College and Iona College. Shinn was also a trustee of St.
Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center, Vanderbilt University,
Barnard College and the Inner-City Scholarship Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn was also an avid golfer. When playing, ``speed was of the
essence,'' said his executive assistant, Bill Toppeta, a
Metropolitan Life senior executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always rushing to get to the next thing,'' Toppeta
said. ``I asked him what he was afraid of and he said we should all
be afraid of becoming obsolete. Half his mind was on that and half
was on what was coming next. He was always anticipating the next
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Shinn was born in Lakewood, N.J., in 1918. He is survived by his
wife, Marion; two daughters, Kathleen Clark of Greenwich, Conn.,
and Patricia Grossthanner of Germany; a son, John, of Doylestown,
Pa.; seven grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.  &QL;

RANGERS TIE STARS, 2-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a wonderfully rugged game at Madison Square Garden
on Tuesday night, the New York Rangers played the best team in the
National Hockey League to a 2-2 draw in an inspired effort that
sometimes brought the fans to their feet to chant and cheer and
scream at the referee.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, the playoff-seeking Rangers led the Dallas Stars, who are
a top contender for the Stanley Cup. Twice, the Stars came back to
tie. Twice, Rangers goalie Mike Richter played unprotected when his
helmet and mask were knocked from his head and face in collisions
around his net. But the Rangers never lost face, and both teams
settled for a point in the standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure both teams probably felt they should have won the
hockey game,'' said Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   On most nights, either team would have. Each team had at least
10 good scoring chances. Pucks rolled through painted creases,
trickled near goal lines and clanged off posts. Bodies banged
against the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Playing their third consecutive game without defeat and without
their superstar center Wayne Gretzky, the Rangers got a balanced
effort, especially from their three top centers: Petr Nedved, Marc
Savard and Manny Malhotra.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Graves and Scott Fraser scored for the Rangers. For Graves,
it was goal No. 30 in a comeback season. Jamie Langenbrunner and
Joe Nieuwendyk scored for Dallas. All goal were at even strength.
The Stars had seven power plays and the Rangers had only three.
Although the Ranger fans didn't like the decision-making of referee
Paul Devorski, Hitchcock joked that it was his team that got the
worst of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really got cheated,'' Hitchcock said. ``He didn't give us
the opportunity to decline all those power plays. That was the
worst thing that happened to us all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the top penalty-killers was Graves, who seems to have
added a dimension to his game as he approaches unrestricted free
agency at the age of 31 this summer. Graves has been ragging the
puck, protecting it with his stick, skates and body, wearing out
the opposition even when it has the manpower advantage. And he has
scored six goals in his last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you lose the greatest player that ever played the
game, it's a huge void,'' Graves said of Gretzky, who will miss
about two weeks with a disc problem near his neck. ``Everyone has
to take on more responsibility. I think guys are enjoying the
opportunity and trying to take advantage of it and playing as hard
as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Fraser, called up three games ago to replace Todd
Harvey, who is out for about a month with a broken thumb. Fraser
has two goals in those three games and has added a element of speed
to what has not been a fast team.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler said Fraser is now showing why the Rangers picked him up
last summer as a free agent from Edmonton. He struggled early in
the season, but skates now as if he does not plan to return to the
minor leagues. Overall, of the team, Muckler said:
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe in themselves. They're playing as a team. They're
working hard. They trust each other. We're very positive in our
thinking. We're very aggressive in our thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Devorski gave the Stars more power plays than the
Rangers, the Rangers came close to winning during a brief power
play in overtime. And they also came close while killing a penalty
late in the third period, when Niklas Sundstrom's shot hit a post
behind Dallas goalie Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Graves scored the first goal of the game at the 70-second mark
of the first period. Graves got open in the left-wing face-off
circle during a forechecking foray and beat Belfour high on the
glove side with a soft shot that deflected off a defenseman after
Nedved had passed the puck to Graves from the corner. MacLean got
the other assist.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars tied the score at 1-1 at 16:26 of the first period on
a goal by Langenbrunner, who stood in front of Richter and
deflected a shot by Jere Lehtinen, who fired from the slot after
Mike Modano won the puck and worked it out from behind the goal
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took their second lead of the game at 3:04 of the
second period on an even-strength goal by Fraser, who scored for
the second time in three games since being recalled from the
Hartford Wolf Pack farm team to replace the injured Todd Harvey.
With Belfour down after stopping Marc Savard's shot, Fraser took
appropriate time before flipping the puck high and under the cross
bar to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas tied the score at 2-2 in the final minute of the second
period when Joe Nieuwendyk finished off a play that evolved when
the Rangers had trouble clearing the puck out of their zone along
the wall. Shawn Chambers got the assist at 19:32.
</P>
<P>
   The result gave the Rangers a three-game undefeated streak and a
4-1-1 record in their last six games. The Stars are 8-1-2 in their
last 10.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rangers' struggle for the eighth and final playoff berth
in the Eastern Conference, with a quarter of the season remaining,
three of the four closest Ranger rivals played on Tuesday night and
all of them won. Boston, holding the eighth place, beat Phoenix.
The Bruins now have 62 points, 2 ahead of idle Florida, which holds
ninth. Montreal and Washington, which began the night behind the
Rangers, also won.
</P>
<P>
   The tie gave the Rangers 58 points, good for a 10th-place tie
with Montreal and 2 behind ninth place Florida. The Capitals, now
in 12th, have 57.

ARIZONA FORESTS THREATENED WITH FIERCE FIRE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forest fire expert Dave Killebrew remembers all too well the
bone-dry March that led to the Lone fire incinerating the Four
Peaks area three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the hellish dry winds of May and June 1990 that preceded the
state's deadliest fire ever, the Dude fire north of Payson.
</P>
<P>
   So take it to the bank when Killebrew, fire specialist for Tonto
National Forest in Phoenix, issues a warning. This is the driest
winter for vegetation in the forest since records have been kept of
such things, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take significant moisture in March and April to
even get us up to the level of dryness of those earlier years,''
Killebrew says.
</P>
<P>
   The indicators of a potentially horrific fire season are
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In what is normally the peak time of year for snowpack,
firefighters battled significant blazes near the entrances to the
communities of Pine and Strawberry and in other areas near Payson
during the past week. One of the fires even broke out at night,
which fire observers say is unprecedented this early in the year.
At even higher altitudes southeast of Flagstaff, they fought a
pesky 30-acre fire they burned for four days.
</P>
<P>
   Runoff into the six lakes of the Salt River basin is less than
one-fifth of normal and expected to stay that way the next few
months. The Arizona Snowbowl ski area gave up and closed Sunday
after never being able to open more than half its runs and having
its second-worst season on record up to this point.
</P>
<P>
   Flagstaff normally has had 71 inches of snow by this time each
winter. It has had only 23 inches this season. Prescott and Payson
have also had less than a third of their normal precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   There's little hope for relief as a high-pressure ridge
continues to hang around the Southwest, bouncing La Nina storms
from the Pacific Ocean to the north. La Nina is a weather
phenomenon caused by abnormal cooling of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture estimates by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration indicate that the Southwest will be up to one-third
drier than normal for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   The parched forest has already led to talk among public-lands
officials of closures, manning of fire towers and mobilization of
firefighting equipment two months before the normal time. Prescott
National Forest workers have already placed their signs warning of
extreme fire danger in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is very troubling to Paul Coe, chief of the
Pine-Strawberry Fire District.

   After the scare from the fire near the south entrance to Pine
last week, he said he suggested to the Forest Service that it
conduct a ``controlled burn'' in the area to try to reduce the
vegetation.

   ``They did it, and it looked like a fire from the height of the
fire season,'' Coe said. ``The fire was going into the crowns of
the trees and the lengths of the flames were going up to 25 and 30
feet. I don't think anyone can believe how dry things are.''

<P>
   So dry that a fire broke out shortly before 9 p.m. Monday at the
6,000-foot level about a mile east of Pine. It took a valiant
effort by 18 firefighters to keep it from climbing the nearby
Mogollon Rim, Coe said.

   ``If it had been daylight, it would have gone over the top of
the Rim,'' Coe said. ``I mean, whoever heard of a forest fire on a
winter night? And the ignition source apparently was something
which had smoldered for a few days. It wasn't even a campfire.''

   Larry McCoy, a ranger for Coconino National Forest southeast of
Flagstaff, also said that fire specialists were shocked when a
wildfire broke out last week at the 7,000-foot level between
Marshall Lake and Walnut Canyon.

   ``To put it mildly, people were surprised when they saw smoke in
the air. But we really do have late May conditions in early
March,'' McCoy said. ``We've got higher fire danger now than we had
in 1996. But we're in better shape than the Tonto and Prescott
forests because we got some moisture in October and November and
they got none.''

<P>
   The winter of 1995-96 has been the driest on record.

   According to Scott Harelson, a spokesman for Salt River Project,
only 132,000 acre-feet of water ran off from the watershed of the
Salt and Verde rivers that year. In a normal year, 850,000
acre-feet will run off into the six reservoirs north and east of
the Valley. SRP officials are predicting a runoff of 161,000
acre-feet this year, although that estimate may be high, Harelson
said.
</P>
<P>
   An acre-foot is the amount that would cover an acre to a depth
of 1 foot, or 325,851 gallons. It would meet the needs of a family
of five for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I overheard one of our hydrologists talking about how this
looks like it will be the worst year for dryness since 1710, using
tree-ring data as a measure from that time,'' Harelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of moisture is also taking a toll on the reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Harelson said that Horseshoe Lake on the Verde River is at only
13 percent of capacity and Roosevelt Lake on the Salt River is only
40 percent of capacity. SRP will increase its groundwater pumping
in the Phoenix area this year but has not determined by how much,
Harelson said. &QL;
