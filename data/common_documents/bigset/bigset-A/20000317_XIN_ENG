ISLAMABAD, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Muhammad

discipline, integration devotion and selfless sacrifice for the
progress and prosperity of the country.
</P>

In their separate messages on the eve of the Muslim Sacrifice

saint prophet in Quran) and Ismail (son of Ibrahim), who teaches
us moral imperatives, laudable character, determination and
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive in his message said, "We all need more than
ever the spirit of sacrifice, selfless devotion and solidarity to
boost the happiness of the holiday of Eid-ul-Azha."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Implement Food Security Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
is to implement a food security program in its poorest provinces,
Agriculture and Land Affairs Minister Thoko Didiza said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ensuring that households have enough to eat remains a priority
for the government, the minister said while introducing debate on
her department's budget vote.
</P>
<P>
"All our policies, including those guiding land reform,
international trade and rural development must result in greater
availability and accessibility of food at the household level,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the food security program, in partnership with the
Food and Agriculture Organization, had two main components --
irrigation rehabilitation and diversification of crops.
</P>
<P>
This would improve the production capacity of subsistence
farmers and those with limited resources in the Northern Province,
Eastern Cape and KwazZulu-Natal, she said.
</P>
<P>
Didiza said the government remains committed to "delivering" 30
percent of agricultural land to black people. So far, only 0.6
percent of it has been transferred "but we have made some dents",
she said.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Clash in South Nigeria Kills 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five persons have been
killed since Tuesday night in the recrudesced community clash
between the towns of Ife and Modakeke in Nigeria's southern Osun
State, official news agency said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the death toll
during the clash starting from March 3 between the two Yoruba
communities has amounted to 75.
</P>
<P>
Although the state government had since last week imposed a
dusk-to-dawn curfew on the troubled area, combatants took the
advantage of the poor logistics of the police for rekindling the
fighting during which both parties of the clash wantonly maimed
and killed people as well as torched houses.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the violence, which had killed 50 by
Tuesday, is due to a land dispute between the two Yoruba
communities.
</P>
<P>
More and more residents in Ife and Modakeke, both of which are
inhabited by Yorubas, one of the three main ethnic groups in
Nigeria, have been fleeing from the troubled towns to nearby areas
including the country's economic hub Lagos State.
</P>
<P>
The residents of the two towns have a long-standing rivalry
over the land ownership and political supremacy in the area that
has sporadically led to violence since 1997.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Muslims Pray for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Moslems including
Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu Thursday prayed for peace in the
country's economic capital Lagos to mark the Islamic holy holiday
of Eid-el-kabir.
</P>
<P>
At the Obalende praying ground in Lagos, Chief Imam of Lagos
State Alhaji Ibrahim urged Muslims in the state to maintain peace
and learn to tolerate people of other religions.
</P>
<P>
He reminded them of the need to live in accordance with the
dictates of the holy Quoran, which exhorts them to help the poor
and avoid ostentation.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned the Muslims against spreading unfounded
reports which, he said, had led to various crises in the country
in the past.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Moslems and Christians in the country's
northern State of Kaduna and some southeast states over the
introduction of Islamic Sharia law last month killed about 1,000
people.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian population is almost evenly divided between Moslems
and Christians. Most of the Christians are living in the southern
area of the country, including Lagos.
</P>
<P>
But as the biggest city and former capital of the West African
nation, Lagos also enjoys a large Moslem population.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the prayer, Tinubu put co-existence
between different religion faithfuls as a panacea for the
country's corporate existence and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The governor's wife, Remi Tinubu, a Christian, also said at the
occasion that she was at the praying ground to show solidarity
with Muslims in the state.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Government Identifies Priorities of Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
identified decentralization, participatory justice and economic
development as the priority areas for its work, Rwanda News Agency
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Decentralization is important for good governance to be
attained and for encouraging participation of all in the
leadership and in the management of their own society," Minister
of Local Government Nyandwi Desire was quoted as saying at a
two-day seminar which brought together all prefects in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The government is continuing with the policy of decentralizing
power to the population and elections of consultative and
executive committees at prefectural and communal levels will take
place in September this year, Desire said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "participatory justice has to be applied for unity
and reconciliation to be attained."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Forestry
Ephraim Kabaija noted that "over 90 percent of Rwanda's population
depends on agriculture hence the need to develop the sector."
</P>
<P>
"Rwandans should learn how to manage the limited resources for
survival and should avoid depending on foreign assistance," he
said.

LAGOS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is leading a campaign of
the United Nations to monitor the flow of conventional arms into
Africa as part of its initiative to rid the continent of
conflicts, the News Agency of Nigeria reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria wants to play a key role in the campaign because it is
also a signatory to the agreement on the importation and
manufacture of small arms of the Economic Community of the West
African States (ECOWAS), the report quoted Nigerian president's
Special Envoy on Conflict Resolution Raph Uwechue as saying in the
country's capital Abuja on Wednesday.

''It is in everybody's interest to promote peace and stability
instead of pursuing the short-term benefit of selling arms,'' he

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes U.S. Move to Ease Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Friday welcomed the U.S.
move to ease sanctions as "positive" and said that Tehran would
respond by importing U.S. grain and medicine.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome (the U.S move to allow) exports of Iranian
foodstuffs and carpets to the U.S. and see it as positive," Iranian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency as
saying that "in response to this, the U.S. will be able to export
grain and medicine to" Iran.
</P>
<P>
Asefi was reacting to a speech by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to the American-Iranian Council in Washington
earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Albright announced that the U.S. Administration
would allow Americans to purchase and import Iran's non-oil goods
such as carpets, dried fruits, nuts and caviar, a move seen as the
boldest attempt yet by the Clinton administration to try to improve
relations with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Foreign Ministry would make further
necessary response after conducting a comprehensive study on
Albright's speech.
</P>
<P>
"There were positive and negative points in this speech, on the
one hand past accusations were repeated, but on the other the U.S.
secretary of state has tried to admit America's past mistakes and
present a new and different attitude toward the Islamic Republic of
Iran."
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Albright wished the Iranian people a happy new
year and added: "Surely, the time has come for America and Iran to
enter a new season in which mutual trust may grow and the quality
of warmth supplant the long cold winter of our mutual discontent."
</P>
<P>
However, she reiterated U.S. allegations that Iran sponsors
terrorism, seeks weapons of mass destruction and persecutes
religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move indicated a shift in Washington's policies, which
came after Iranian reformists won an overwhelming victory in the
parliamentary elections last month over the powerful conservatives,
who dominate the country's most important organs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Iran severed relations in 1980 following the
takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran by fervent Iranian students
in the heydays of the Islamic revolution, which toppled the former
pro-U.S. shah's regime.
</P>
<P>
The two countries tuned down their hostilities against each
other after President Mohammad Khatami, who came to power in 1997,
called for people-to-people contacts to bring down the "wall of
mistrust".
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been trying to export grains to Iran, but Iran
insisted that the U.S. should allow the flow of Iranian goods to
American markets.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians to Resume Talks on March 21 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators will begin their new round of peace talks under U.S.
auspices on March 21 at Bolling air Force Base in Washington, the
State Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"On Tuesday, March 21, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will
resume permanent status negotiations at Bolling Air Force Base,"
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. will be working with both sides to facilitate
progress," Rubin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The primary focus of the negotiations will be to reach a
framework agreement as soon as possible so that all permanent
status issues can be resolved by September 13," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said interim issues would also be discussed including
further handover of West Bank land to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators in Jerusalem in late-night talks on Wednesday
agreed on a transfer of 6.1 percent of West Bank land which would
put 42.9 percent of the area under full or partial Palestinian
control. The handover is expected to take place on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The talks could last two weeks and negotiators would be at the
level of chief negotiators, headed by Oded Eran for Israel and by
Yasser Abed Rabbo and Saeb Erekat for the Palestinians, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Both President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will not give the peace talks the same level of attention
they did to Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Wye, Maryland, in
1998, Rubin said.

RIO DE JANEIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister
Luiz Felipe Lampreia forecast Friday that his country will
increase the volume of its exports as much as 20 percent this year,
if the world trade rises 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said this at a seminar organized by the Brazilian
Finance Executives Institute, adding that the resuming of the
World Trade Organization discussions for the elimination of
protectionism for agriculture and textile products could bring
positive results for the Brazilian balance of trade.
</P>
<P>
He said that the assuming of the new U.S. president will make
easier the negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Americas (
FTAA).
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said that the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) member
countries are ready for the negotiations and for the full
participation of Chile.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian foreign minister said his country wants to start
negotiations about the free trade agreement between Mercosur and
South Africa no later than two months from now.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia, who made last month an official visit to South Africa
last month, will present a document to the Mercosur ministers.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur is composed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay
and Chile and Bolivia as associate members.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Vows to Stick to Lusaka Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Friday reiterated his country's dedicated commitment to the Lusaka
cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference Friday evening after talking with
Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs
Louis Michel that he would contribute to the work for the peaceful
settlement of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace accord is the most instrumental tool for
resolving the DRC issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All ideas now are around the implementation of the Lusaka
agreement. We cannot bring ideas which depart from the agreement,"
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Museveni refuted reports that Ugandan
troops deployed in eastern DRC are creating provinces there.
</P>
<P>
Michel, who was heading a 22-member delegation to Uganda, said
that he talked with leaders of the DRC, Angola and Zimbabwe before
coming to Uganda early Friday morning and all those he talked with
promised to honor the Lusaka agreement.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, which has been backing the rebels in the DRC, sent
troops to the DRC in 1998 to allegedly protect its borders.
</P>
<P>
President of the DRC Laurent Kabila, however, has been accusing
Kampala of invading his country and looting its minerals, which
Uganda has vehemently denied.

<HEADLINE> Mass Education Is Way Out for Uganda: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Friday described mass education as the only way out for Uganda
which is suffering from high illiteracy rate and brain drain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a graduation ceremony of Makerere University
students, the president said that the past education system was an
elite education system which provided opportunities only for the
very few.
</P>
<P>
Now education of the whole population should be stressed
because it is the only way to push Uganda forward, he said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, who is also the chancellor of the university, urged
for improvement in policy, physical and infrastructural
developments because more students would step into the university
gate.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a Universal Primary Education (UPE) program
launched in 1997, Uganda's primary school enrolment has now more
than doubled to a total of 6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
At the function, Museveni also pledged to continue to provide
funding for very bright students from poor families. The
government would continue to sponsor some university students as
before, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 students got their degrees or diplomas at the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Makerere University is famous for its graduates. Former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere and some other regional leaders
once studied in the university.

CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian scientists are working to
contribute to future flights to the Mars in 2001, 2002 and 2007,
the country's Middle East News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Those missions, aiming to learn more about the red planet, will
be carried out in cooperation with U.S. National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) and the International Society for
Planet Discoveries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will contribute to the 2001 mission with a driller, to be
attached to a spaceship that NASA is expected to launch at that
time.
</P>
<P>
The driller, at a total cost of 1 million Egyptian pounds (289,
900 U.S. dollars), is being designed by Egyptian experts from both
scientific research and military production ministries.
</P>
<P>
It will be first tested in the Western Desert, which is similar
to Mars in biological makeup, climate, temperature and dust storms.
No more details were available yet concerning the other two future
flights.

The European legislators approved the resolution with a vote of
265 for, 125 against with 33 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, passed in a European Parliament session in
Strasbourg, said that the EU nations should guarantee same-sex
couples rights equal to those enjoyed by traditional couples,
particularly as regards tax law, pecuniary rights and social
rights.
</P>
<P>
Some EU nations like Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and
Sweden already have granted legal recognition to extramarital
couples.
</P>
<P>
The EP resolution said that European citizens continue to
suffer discrimination and disadvantages in their personal and
professional life as a result of their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
The Amsterdam Treaty, the basic treaty of the European Union,
has stipulated specific references against discrimination against
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament said that it noted with satisfaction
that Britain is amending its laws to allow homosexuals to follow
military careers though some others still ban homosexual relations
in the army.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also called on the 13 countries now applying for
EU membership to ensure equal rights for homosexuals. The 13
countries are Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia,
Estonia, Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria,
Malta and Turkey.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Begins Talks with Cambodia on Khmer Rouge Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. team had begun
talks with the Cambodian delegation on the trial of the former
leaders of Khmer Rouge, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the Cambodian delegation is headed by First
Minister Sok An.
</P>
<P>
The talks were "concentrated" and they would continue on
Saturday, the spokesman said
</P>
<P>
The 7-member team, led by Hans Corell, Under-Secretary-General
and the Legal Counsel, arrived in Cambodia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Corell, the delegation include: Ralph Zacklin,
assistant-Secretary-General and the deputy of the team; Lakhan
Mehrotra, head of the Jakarta office of the U.N. Transitional
Administration in East Timor; Shashi Tharoor, a director in Annan'
s office; John Renninger, who heads the Asia and pacific division
of the U.N. Department of Political Affairs; Daphna Shraga, a
senior officer in the U.N.office of Legal Affairs; and Mark
Quarterman, an officer in the Department of Political Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and Cambodia have been at odds over who would
be in control of a tribunal to try the former Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
U.N. legal experts are concerned that Cambodia's legal system
is too weak to guarantee justice on its own.
</P>
<P>
This will be the final round of negotiations and an agreement
with the Cambodia's Government is expected to be reached to ensure
a credible trial that meets minimum international standard.

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed by Torrential Rain in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Severe rain in Kibuye Prefecture
of Rwanda has killed four people and flooding waters took their
bodies, only one body has been recovered, Rwanda News Agency
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Flooding waters also took over 10 domestic animals including
cows, goats and sheep. Rain has damaged a number of crops, soils
eroded from steep areas down the valley, it said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain has hit the western region, where as severe droughts
have been predicted for the north eastern part of the country for
the next three months of March, April and May.
</P>
<P>
The drought predicted is to be caused by the persistent off
shore winds that blow off Rwanda's north eastern region and some
parts of the east, Didace Musoni, director of meteorological
department in the Ministry of Transport and communications said.
</P>
<P>
According to a climate outlook made at the recently concluded

NAIROBI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- French Ambassador to Rwanda
Friday apologized to Rwandan Speaker of Parliament Sostene
Cyitatira following a scuffle between the embassy's chief security

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Close 10 Diplomatic Missions Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
decided to temporarily close 10 of its 26 diplomatic missions
abroad due to inadequate funding, said the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs in a press release issued Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The affected embassies or high commissions are those in Abuja
and Cairo in Africa; Bonn, Paris, Rome and Moscow in Europe;
Beijing and Tokyo in Asia; and Ottawa and Havana in the America,
the release said.
</P>
<P>
"Government wishes to reassure all our friends and the general
public that this move will not, and indeed is not intended to
either affect or diminish our bilateral relations with the
countries where these missions are located," it said.
</P>
<P>
The affected missions would be covered from the nearest
diplomatic missions still operating and honorary consuls would be
appointed in those various capitals to look after the commercial
and consular interests of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign
Affairs Eriya Kategaya told a parliamentary committee Thursday
that this reduction was just geared at cutting down the costs.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports of embarrassment of Uganda's diplomats
abroad due to lack of fund to pay for accommodation or utilities.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni last October directed the country's
Foreign Ministry to close down all missions abroad except six.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 130 Ugandans working for diplomatic
missions abroad. The government's annual budget for the missions
is 10 million U.S. dollars, only 60 percent of the amount they
really need.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Pilgrims Start Stoning of Devil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.7 million Saudi
and foreign pilgrims on Friday continued their pilgrimage, or Hajj
rituals by starting symbolic "stoning of the devil" in Mina,
ritual site in the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The stoning ritual will last for three days and each pilgrim
will throw seven pebbles at each of the three different pillars
symbolizing the devil as a sign of the human being overcoming the
devil.
</P>
<P>
After this rite pilgrims will return to the Grand Mosque in
Mecca to complete the last part of their Hajj journey by performing
circumvention around the holy Kaaba, which according to Koran is
the oldest house of worship in the world.
</P>
<P>
This year's Hajj rituals began on Tuesday, with nearly 2.3
million pilgrims from around the Moslem world took part in
Tuesday's 11-kilometer procession from Mecca to Mina.
</P>
<P>
The ritual in Mina is called the Day of Al-Tarwiya, a word used
in the days of the Prophet Mohammad for stocking enough water for
the journey to Mount Arafat and the Valley of Mozdalifa.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims spent their night in Mina on Tuesday in the 40,000
fire-proof tents erected by the Saudi government with a total cost
of 2.4 billion riyals (640 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the pilgrims climbed Mount Arafat, where Prophet
Mohammad delivered his final sermon 14 centuries ago. They spent
the day on the hill "praying for forgiveness and seeking the
blessings of God."
</P>
<P>
The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and must be
performed by every able Moslem. The climbing of Mount Arafat is
considered as the most difficult stage, and the rituals on the hill
marks the climax of the annual pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
During a sermon on Mount Arafat, the pilgrims were told that
they will be as free of sin as newborns. They were also urged to
stand united and to cooperate with each other against enemies.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday evening, the pilgrims descended from Mount Arafat
and made their way, many on food, to the Valley of Mozdalifa, where
they picked up pebbles for the stoning ritual.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the pilgrims performed prayers of Eid Al-Adha, the
most important Islamic festival to slay and sacrifice sheep, cows
and camels to mark Abraham's readiness to sacrifice his son for
God.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Minister of Health Osama Ibn Abdel-Majid on Friday said
this year's pilgrimage season has so far been "free of epidemics
and that no security incidents or fires" were registered.
</P>
<P>
A tent fire caused by using gas cylinders during the 1997 Hajj
season killed more than 350 pilgrims and injured over 1,600 others.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Pull out From Lebanon Completely: Peres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A scheduled Israeli troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon will be complete and Israel will not
retain any part of a border zone in Lebanon after the pullout,
Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Peres made the remarks to visiting British journalist Patrick
Seale, biographer of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad. During their
meeting, Seale asked if Israel would, as reported in Israeli media,
keep parts of the border zone it occupied in southern Lebanon as
part of a unilateral withdrawal plan.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet on March 5 gave backing to a key pledge made
by Prime Minister Ehud Barak to withdraw from southern Lebanon by
July, with or without a peace deal with Syria, the main power in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Shaul Mofaz presented Barak on
Friday the military plan for a unilateral withdrawal, code-named "
Operation Morning Twilight," Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Another military plan for a withdrawal under the framework of a
peace agreement with Syria, which code-named "Operation New
Horizon," is also in the making.
</P>
<P>
Both plans deal with measures to reinforce Israeli defense after
a pullout from Lebanon. Israeli media said recently that if Israel
has to carry out the "Operation Morning Twilight," or a unilateral
withdrawal, it might keep some military outposts in the buffer zone
in areas about 500 meters north of the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out the 15-kilometer-deep border zone in Lebanon
in 1985 with a self-claimed aim of preventing cross-border
guerrilla attacks on its north. But mounting Israeli casualties
have spurred a growing public pressure for a pullout.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which resumed last December
after a four-year break, broke off in January over a dispute on the
fate of the Golan Heights, a strategic Syrian plateau seized by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass said Thursday that the
United States would succeed in bringing the sides back to the
negotiating table "within weeks."
</P>
<P>
But both Israeli and U.S. officials said they were not aware of
any imminent announcement of negotiations restarting.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges N. Parties to Make Concessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Life is fleeting and opportunities come and go. We have the
chance of a lifetime. Whatever the differences, it's not worth
another life, not one. It's not worth another day's delay,"
Clinton told a gala dinner attended by the Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams
and David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the statement before holding five separate
meetings Friday and hosting a St. Patrick's Day reception at the
White House. Thursday's dinner was hosted by the America Ireland
Fund and joined by more than 1,000 guests.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told the guests that he was proud of the supporting
role he had played in the peace process, adding that the cease-
fires now are measured in years, not weeks.
</P>
<P>
"I must confess as your friend that I still do not know the
answers," he said, expressing his regrets that the peace process
is in a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told a
regular briefing that the administration did not expect any
breakthrough during Friday's meetings.
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that this is more than just courtesy, but I also don't
anticipate any breakthrough. There are discussions scheduled for
when they return home, and they will continue to try to find a way
through to implementing the Good Friday accords," Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
The Good Friday accords were signed by the parties involved in
the future of the British province of Northern Ireland in 1998.
The peace process runs into an impasse after the Irish Republic
Army (IRA) refused to disarm and Britain suspended the self-rule
in the province.
</P>
<P>
Major players in the Northern Irish peace process, including
Adams, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter
Mandelson, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and pro-Britain
Trimble, are gathering here.

<HEADLINE> European Airlines Complain Over Airport Switch Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission got on
Friday a complaint filed by 12 European airlines blaming Italy's
plan to switch their flights from Linate to Malpensa.
</P>
<P>
The complaint was the latest move by the airlines in their
fight with Italian authorities who wanted to switch airlines other
than those of Italian origin from the more popular airport to the
newly-constructed airport.
</P>
<P>
A decree drawn by Italian Transport Minister Pierluigi Bersani
enforcing the switch plan is to come into force on April 20. The
Italian government argued that the switch is needed to reduce the
pressure of overcrowdedness on Linate.
</P>
<P>
Malpensa is 53 kilometers away from downtown Milan and ground
transportation would affect the passenger flow with the airlines
having to use the new airport.
</P>
<P>
The 12 airlines said that the switch plan unfairly
discriminates against them in favor of Italy's national carrier
Alitalia.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, has required the Italian authorities to modify the switch
plan from Linate to Malpensa.
</P>
<P>
The airlines complaining against the switch plan include
British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France, Sabena SA, Finnair,
Scandinavian Airlines System, Maersk Air, Olympic Airways, Iberia,
TAP Air Portugal, Austrian Airlines and Aer Lingus.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Denies U.N. Report on Involvement in UNITA Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda Friday denied the
allegations by a U.N. report that its authorities played a role in
aiding the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) to circumvent U.N. sanctions by illegally selling
gems for weapons.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Mutaboba, the Rwandan permanent representative to the
United Nations, told a press conference here that his government
has nothing to do with military cooperation with UNITA, arranging
diamond sales for UNITA, and facilitating UNITA meeting with
weapon brokers, as alleged by a report of the Security Council
Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The Rwandan Government wishes to state categorically that
these allegations have no foundation, and are merely hearsay from
quarters that distort facts for reasons known to themselves," he
said.
</P>
<P>
 "When the Panel of Experts visited Rwanda, it was given
information and explanations which are not reflected in the final
report for reasons unknown to us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda is one of a dozen of countries singled out by the
report, which, compiled by the U.N. Sanction Committee headed by
Ambassador Robert Fowler of Canada, spells out how UNITA has been
able to sidestep U.N. sanctions by buying weapons, mainly from
Bulgaria, having them shipped to African nations and paying for
them with diamonds from mines it controls.
</P>
<P>
Primarily, the report accuses President Blaise Compaoro of
Burkina Faso, President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and the late
Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko of having personally received
diamonds for having helped UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi with arms
and fuel shipments in violations of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Burkina Faso, Togo, Rwanda and Bulgaria have denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed an arms and fuel embargo on UNITA
in 1993, a year before the United Nations brokered a peace
agreement between the rebels and government. In 1998, six months
before the peace agreement collapsed, the Council expanded the
measures to include a ban on rebel diamond exports, which are
estimated to have supplied the group with up to 4 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"There is no military cooperation with UNITA," he said. "The
fact that Rwandan troops used the Angolan territory to evacuate
Rwandan troops did not necessarily mean a pact with (Jonas)
Savimbi," who is the leader of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
"Angola knows how we evacuated our troops in a rescue
military operation," he said. "Nobody ever had contact with
Savimbi or any UNITA officials for that matter."
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no grain of truth in the allegations that
Rwanda 'have allowed UNITA to operate more or less freely in
Kigali for the purpose of arranging diamond sales,'" he aid.

<HEADLINE> Private Nazi Photo Collection Unearthed in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian history professor has
unearthed a private collection of photographs chronicling the rise
of the Nazi party at a second-hand store in Sudbury, southern
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
The album includes pictures of Hitler, Herman Goering, minister
of the interior, Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, and propaganda
minister Josef Goebels, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
There are also photos of the wedding of a ranking Nazi party
member, where 14 ushers in army uniforms give the Seig Heil salute,
forming an arch outside the church, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very impressed by some of these earlier pictures that show
the honor guard for Hitler and the access the photographer had to
them,"professor Dieter Buse of Laurentian University was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The collection of pictures taken in the 1930s must have been a
job by someone trusted "within the security ring" of the Nazi
party, said the professor.
</P>
<P>
"What makes this interesting" is that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler
had only one official photographer -- Heinrich Hoffman, the
professor said, adding Hitler and Hoffman often scrutinized
pictures together,selecting the ones for public distribution.
</P>
<P>
Tory Cameron, owner of the TNT Second Hand Store in Sudbury,
said he purchased the private collection from a local resident
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the seller was in his late 30s and not of German
descent.He had no idea how the collection ended up in the hands of
the seller,the store owner said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Calls for Strenuous Fight Against Epidemics in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The next two to eight weeks are
critical for flood-stricken Mozambique' health and aid workers
fighting the threat of potential cholera and malaria epidemics,
said the World Health Organization (WHO) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The threat of a malaria epidemic in the African country is
increasing and will be at its most dangerous in around three to
six weeks time as floodwaters gradually subside, the rains stop
and warm temperatures return, ideal breeding conditions for
mosquitoes,according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
Suspected cholera cases are also on the rise with two special
treatment centers set up in Maputo City and a third expected to
open on March 17 at Machava, said WHO. The fact that so many
people are currently displaced also increases the threat of
disease.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, the Mozambique Ministry of Health has
prepared a three-month Malaria Emergency Control Plan supported by
key United Nations agencies including WHO and UN Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes strategies for early diagnosis and treatment
for malaria, mosquito population control, protecting people
against mosquito bites (mainly through the distribution of
insecticide-treated bednets).
</P>
<P>
In addition to the cholera treatment centers, a major health
education program is underway to warn the population on how best
to prevent the disease. This includes a door-to-door campaign and
health activists working in the community. Water supplies are also
being chlorinated as an extra precaution.

<HEADLINE> WHO Backs Time-Limited Exemptions for DDT Used in Malaria Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has called for time-limited exemptions for the production and use
of DDT in malaria control.
</P>
<P>
"A universal ban on DDT now must include time-limited
exemptions for its production and use in malaria control.
Otherwise, we might see increased death rates and suffering as a
result of malaria," said WHO Project Manager for Roll Back Malaria
David Nabarro in a statement here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The WHO call comes on the eve of the Fourth Meeting of the
Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Persistent Organic
Pollutants (POPs) to be held in Bonn, Germany on March 20-25. The
talks will lead to a legally binding treaty to combat the threat
of 12 POPs, including DDT, to the environment and public health.
</P>
<P>
The treaty aims to see a significant reduction in the use of
DDT,if not its virtual elimination. The current draft of the
treaty includes exemptions which would allow countries to continue
using the pesticide for public health purposes, as well as
provisions for technical and financial support to DDT dependent
countries to help them reduce their reliance on this persistent
organic pollutant.
</P>
<P>
WHO believes that these exemptions and provisions are essential
to reaching the ultimate goal. Provisions related to the reduction
and or elimination of DDT are among the key issues to be discussed
in Bonn next week.
</P>
<P>
"A premature shift to less effective or more costly
alternatives to DDT is likely to be unsustainable. Countries need
time and resources to evaluate and select alternatives that are
locally appropriate and sustainable," Nabarro said. "In the
meantime, the require the reassurance that DDT can be used, if
needed, to protect human lives.This is simply good planning, and
good planning needs time and cash."
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, extensive use of DDT for agricultural
purposes has resulted in serious damage to the global environment.
Although the pesticide is now banned from agricultural use, it
continues to be used in limited quantities for public health
purposes.
</P>
<P>
For many malaria-affected countries, WHO said, responsible DDT
use is a vital strategy in situations where alternatives are not
available and where the potential loss of human life associated
with unstable malaria transmission and epidemics is greatest.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Government Launches Campaign for Bilateral Accords with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has launched
a campaign to win support for Switzerland's bilateral accords with
the European Union (EU) ahead of a referendum in May.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to win over Switzerland's voters to the idea of
closer ties with the European Union started Friday with the launch
of two websites, run by the ministries of economics and foreign
affairs,according to Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
The government has given itself two months to sell the
bilateral accords to the public before a referendum scheduled on
May 21.
</P>
<P>
The two websites are published in German and French. They
explain how important the EU is to Switzerland, and they give
users the chance to put questions or opinions to the government.
</P>
<P>
The site reminds voters that Switzerland is an integral part of
Europe, both geographically and in terms of trade. It points out
that the EU is Switzerland's most important trading partner, and
that future Swiss prosperity depends on relations with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Surveys suggest that the bilateral accords have the support of
the majority of Swiss voters. But, equally, many remain deeply
skeptical about closer ties with Europe.

<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- German state prosecutors said on
Friday that they had charged a top aide to former German
Chancellor Helmit Kohl and a fugitive arms dealer in connection
with the Christian Democratic Union's massive finance scandal.
</P>
<P>
Former CDU's treasurer Walter Leisler Kiep and arms dealer
broker Karlheinz Schreiber had been charged in a case of bribery,
said Augsburg Judge Maximilian Hofmeister. But he refused to
provide with any details about charges in 165-page indictment.
</P>
<P>
Kiep was once the CDU treasurer from 1971 to 1992.Helmut Kohl
was the chairman of the CDU from 1973 to 1998 and German
Chancellor from 1982 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
Karlheinz Schreiber gave the CDU one million marks (493,000 U.
S. dollars) in 1991 in handover at a Swiss parking lot. The cash
was packed in briefcase and was taken by Kiep and former CDU
finance advisor, Horst Weyrauch.
</P>
<P>
Schreiber offered a bribe to officials of Kohl's government in
order to sell 36 Fox light tanks to Saudi Arabia, but all members
of Kohl's government denied it firmly.
</P>
<P>
Schreiber has fled to Canada. Germany wants to extradite him.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government on Friday
approved a system that would peg oil export duties to prices on
the world market, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This system was approved by a government commission on
protective measures in foreign trade and customs tariff policy.
</P>
<P>
The government will issue a directive each time world prices
shift to a new level on a special scale, but the duty cannot
change more often than once every two months, Interfax reported,
quoting Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko.
</P>
<P>
Khristenko said a similar scale for oil products will also be
introduced later.

<HEADLINE> Torrential Rains Flood Central Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rains in central
Mozambique have led to further flooding in Sofala province,
Mozambique News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Buzi river burst its banks again, once more flooding the
Buzi town. About 7,000 people, who ventured back to the town
earlier this month when the waters subsided, had to return to the
accommodation centres set up by the government for flood victims.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, two small boats are being used to
rescue people who have suddenly found themselves stranded in the
outlying suburbs of Buzi, and in the locality of Guaraguara.
</P>
<P>
The flooding in the Buzi valley is likely to worsen since the
Chicamba dam on the river's main tributary, the Revue, has been
forced to open its floodgates, discharging 400 cubic meters of
water a second, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the continuing rains, it is not yet possible to
repair the main north-south highway in the Sofala district of
Chibabava. About 500 meters of the road is now under water that
is up to 1.5 meters deep. The road state is worsening further
in southern province of Inhambane. In addition to earlier cuts in
Temane and Pambara, the road is now also under water in the
Vulanjane area. This is the same area where the road suffered
severe damage in the February 1999 floods.
</P>
<P>
Currently, no overland transport is possible from the
provincial capital city of Inhambane to the districts of
Vilanculo, Inhassoro and Govuro.
</P>
<P>
Nova Mambone, the capital of the Govuro district, is in danger
of further flooding as the Save river rises again. A helicopter
carrying relief goods to this town failed to land on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the road destroyed, Inhambane and Gaza provinces can no
longer be supplied with fuel and other basic necessities by trucks
from Beira, the capital of Sofala province.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Revive Education for Disabled People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government is set to
revive education trends for physically and mentally disabled
children and adults, Rwandan News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Narcisse Musabeyezu, director of nursery and primary school in
the Ministry of Education and coordinator for disabled education,
made the remarks during a two-day workshop in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Musabeyezu said: "Parents and teachers need to understand their
role in the education of the disabled, formulate modalities for
the establishment of a system that cares and caters for the
handicapped and suggest measures and recommendations for the
improvement of their status in society."
</P>
<P>
According to Minister of Education Jean Damasce ne
Ntawukuriryayo, "although education is considered as a right, the
mentally and physically handicapped have not always been
integrated into the system".
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has over 5000 traumatized people following the 1994
genocide, who need trained counsellors to rectify the trauma.
</P>
<P>
Participants found it imperative to have trained teachers in
the matters related to special education needs of the handicapped.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Aluminium Terminal Put Into Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- An Australian ship carrying 6,300
tons of raw material for the production of aluminium is for the
first time moored in the Matola aluminium terminal at Maputo port,
Mozambique News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The terminal itself, built in partnership between Mozal, the
company that owns the aluminium smelter being built on the
outskirts of Maputo, and the Mozambican publicly owned ports and
railway company, CFM, was inaugurated on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, David Nunro, director of
 Billiton, the London-based metals company that holds 47 percent
of Mozal's shares, said that the building of the smelter is about
80 percent complete and the first ingot of aluminium should be
cast by the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
This means that the factory will have been built in just 26
months and, according to Nunro, it will cost less than 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars estimated initially.
</P>
<P>
"The terminal that we are inaugurating on Thursday was
projected to receive ships with a capacity of 35,000 tons," he
said, adding that "at this terminal 40 ships a year will moor,
carrying 500,000 tons of alumina and 92,000 tons of coke, at a
combined value of 120 million U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
The terminal has three silos to store raw materials, the
largest of which, for alumina, has a capacity of 45,000 tons. The
other two silos can store up to 11,000 tons of coke.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the name of the Mozambican government, Transport
Minister Tomas Salomao described the terminal as a good example of
partnership between national companies represented by CFM and
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
For the building of the terminal, Mozal contributed 13 million
U.S. dollars, which CFM is to pay back through the funds generated
by the port services rendered to Mozal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Up 0.5 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices surged 0.
5 percent in February, the biggest jump in 10 months, led by a
record increase in fuel oil prices and sharply higher gasoline
costs, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The big advance in the Consumer Price Index, the nation's
broadest gauge of inflation, followed a modest 0.2 percent rise in
January, and was slightly worse than the 0.4 percent gain forecast
by many analysts.
</P>
<P>
Last month's increase stemmed from a huge 4.6 percent jump in
energy prices, the biggest gain since a 6 percent rise in April.
</P>
<P>
The 0.5 percent increase in overall consumer prices also was
the steepest increase since April, when consumer prices rose by 0.
7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding volatile energy and food components, the "core" rate
of inflation rose a mild 0.2 percent in February after a matching
gain in January. February's core rate was right on target with
many analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
Friday's report comes one day after the government said
inflation at the wholesale level, led by huge increases in home
heating oil, gasoline and other energy costs, jumped 1 percent in
February, the biggest one-month surge in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the CPI for the past three months
implied an annual rate of inflation of 3.9 percent, a figure
likely to weigh on Federal Reserve policymakers who meet next
Tuesday to consider monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has raised interest rates four times since last June,
and has made clear it will gradually raise rates further to cool
the U.S. economy and attempt to head off inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's report, the government said the rise in overall
energy prices in February was led by a whopping 34.6 percent gain
in fuel oil prices, an all-time monthly high. Gasoline prices rose
6.3 percent, the largest gain since April. Natural gas prices went
up by 1.7 percent, the biggest rise since September, and
electricity rose 0.8 percent, the largest increase July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Food prices, meanwhile, rose a sizable 0.4 percent, the largest
increase since October 1998. Rising prices for beef, pork and
fresh fruits more than offset falling prices for poultry and fresh
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
February's data also showed strong price rises elsewhere.
Housing prices gained 0.5 percent, the largest gain since January
of 1991 when it posted a 0.8 percent rise. Transportation prices,
a sector affected by higher gasoline costs, rose 1.3 percent, the
largest rise since April's 2.4 percent increase.

<HEADLINE> Britain Applauds German Lifting of British Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Friday welcomed Germany
's decision to lift a ban imposed on imports of British beef after
outbreaks of mad cow disease and called on France to do the same.
</P>
<P>
"All credit to the Federal Government of Germany," British
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown said.
</P>
<P>
"I really do hope it has a knock-on effect. France is now
completely isolated on this issue within the EU...they really
should think again...they're defying the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Farmers Union(NFU) also welcomed the decision.
</P>
<P>
"This was the right decision and leaves France conspicuously
out on a limb in Europe over its illegal ban. There is no possible
reason left for France to maintain its illegal ban," NFU President
Ben Gill said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Germany's upper house of parliament has voted on Friday by 39
votes to 30 to lift the country's four-year ban on imports of
British beef.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed in 1996 after scientists said they believed
mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a
deadly,brain-wasting disorder for which there is no known cure,
could spread via infected meat from cattle to people.
</P>
<P>
Germany's decision follows legal moves by the European
Commission after Germany failed to comply with last year's
European Union agreement to reopen all beef markets.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission lifted its ban on British beef sales to
other EU countries last year after Britain introduced new rules on
raising and slaughtering cattle.
</P>
<P>
France retained its import ban, saying British safety measures
were not adequate. France is now the only EU member still banning
British beef imports.

<HEADLINE> Early Voting for Russian Presidency Starts in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Early voting in Russia's
presidential elections began Friday morning in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya amid heightened security, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Federal servicemen stationed in remote mountainous areas of the
province or those on combat missions will be the first to cast
their ballots, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
"Special attention was paid to security -- of both voters and
election commission members," said Dzhamal Mezhidov, deputy
chairman of the Chechen Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
As Russia moves closer to the presidential elections scheduled
for next Sunday, rumors are rising in the breakaway republic that
the rebels could capture Grozny and Gudermes, the two largest
Chechen cities.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence reports suggest that "gang leaders are continuing
their efforts to thwart the Russian presidential elections in
Chechnya," Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin spokesman on Chechnya,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police forces there have been placed on high alert as of
Thursday to cope with the increased threat, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
None of the 12 presidential candidates are campaigning in
Chechnya, although some action groups are expected to operate
there in support of acting President Vladimir Putin and Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, the two front runners.
</P>
<P>
For Moscow, presidential elections in Chechnya have special
political significance. A federal military campaign has been
raging there since last September to root out the rebels, who
staged two waves of armed incursions into neighboring Daghestan
and were allegedly behind a spate of apartment bombings that left
some 300 people dead in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
"Participation in the elections is important for us in Chechnya
as part of the (Russian) federation," said Mezhidov of the Chechen
Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Lieutenant General Ivan Babichev, the military
commandant of the security zone in Chechnya, over 450,000 people
are expected to cast their votes in the province's 336 polling
stations, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Election officials have loosened requirements in the balloting
to facilitate the Chechen civilians with no passports. In order to
vote, it will be enough to produce a pensioner's card, a war
veteran's card or a certificate from the local administration,
Babichev said.
</P>
<P>
"We are giving everyone a chance to vote," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Constitutional Court of
Mongolia has turned down an parliamentary act to amend the
constitution, Mongolian news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting of the court, with a
discussion focus on whether the amendments have violated the
constitution itself.
</P>
<P>
Some participants considered the amendments as a violation to
the constitution, saying they have infringed 20 provisions of the
Mongolian constitution. But some parliamentarians insisted that
the constitutional court doesn't have the right to discuss the
content of the amendments ratified by the parliament on December
20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The decision is to be discussed at a plenary meeting of the
parliament, and will be put into effect if accepted by the
majority of the parliament. Otherwise, the constitutional court
would have to call on another meeting involving more members.

<HEADLINE> "Holy City" in Turkey Revamped for Christian Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Residents of a Christian "Holy
City" in northwestern Turkey are having their hands full preparing
the city for an influx of tourists to mark the 2000th anniversary
of Jesus Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
Iznik Municipality in the Bursa province is working on six
projects for restoration of historic sites and tourism promotion
which will cost nearly 100 billion Turkish liras (200,000 U.S.
dollars), local press reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Designated as a "Holy City" by the Christian world in the 1970s,
Iznik is rich in historic and religious works which date back to
the Roman, Byzantine, Seljukian and Ottoman periods.
</P>
<P>
Iznik Mayor Zeynel Abidin Turan said that initiatives have been
launched to introduce the historic and tourism assets of Iznik to
the world.
</P>
<P>
Turan said that 15 Orthodox leaders would gather in Iznik for a
Christmas ceremony on December 26, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Announces Measures to Liberalize Insurance Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS), the central bank, Friday unveiled measures to
liberalize the country's insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
In a press release MAS said with immediate effect it will lift
the closed-door policy on direct insurers and the 49 percent
shareholding restriction on foreign ownership in locally-owned
direct insurers.
</P>
<P>
MAS will also adopt an open market entry policy for new
insurance brokers and maintain the existing current open policy on
admission to reinsurers and captive insurers.
</P>
<P>
MAS underlined that the awarding of insurance licenses will be
subject to applicants who meet the admission criteria it has
established.
</P>
<P>
It also promised to introduce measures to raise standards of
corporate governance and market conduct in line with international
best practices and strengthen protection of policyholders'
interests by insurers.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization of the insurance industry in Singapore was first
introduced by Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong when
he stressed the need to liberalize, upgrade and modernize the
insurance industry in his key-note address at the 9th Pacific
Insurance Conference on August 16, 1999.
</P>
<P>
MAS said its objective in liberalizing entry to insurance
industry is to create a more vibrant and competitive industry,
with greater efficiency, choice of products and value to customers.

<HEADLINE> Brussels Expected to Join European Bourse Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Brussels stock market is
expected to join at least two other European bourses next week to
create Europe's second largest bourse.
</P>
<P>
The performances of the local stock market were stimulated to a
high record this week by the talks between the Brussels stock
market and its Paris and Amsterdam counterparts on their merger.
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's record rise in Brussels, the local stock
exchange enjoyed another heated run Thursday when the flagship Bel
20 index rose 6.79 percent to close at 2,906.66.
</P>
<P>
During the course of the day's trading, the index once rose by
as high as 9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders said earlier this week
that a decision on the future of the Brussels stock market would
be made in the coming days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
He added that it would be good for the companies that are
listed on the Brussels stock market or considering a listing.
</P>
<P>
Should the merger of Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam bourses be
announced next Monday, they will combine to make the second
largest bourse in Europe behind London, with a total of 2,400
billion euro (about 2,326 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Bel 20 currently possesses a capitalization of 275 billion
Belgian francs (about 266.7 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Europeans Urged to Prevent Children From Sex Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Lobbyists, lawyers, activists
and computer scientists gathered here on Friday to raise further
awareness to prevent children from sex abuse on computer networks.
</P>
<P>
An international forum was held here under the auspices of the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (
UNESCO), aimed at urging people to join the fight against
paedophilia on the Internet and to combat child pornography.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO launched a campaign known as Innocence in Danger to
ensure coordinated follow-up actions already taken by the European
countries in the fight against child pornography and paedophilia.
</P>
<P>
The campaign sought to group together Internet professionals
and jurists, child protection specialists, dignitaries and
political leaders from various countries to raise world awareness
and mobilize human, technical and financial resources for the
fight.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels forum was held three days before the trial of
Belgium's most notorious paedophile Marc Dutroux who was accused
of raping almost a dozen and killing at least two little girls in
the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The trial of Dutroux is scheduled for next Monday, almost four
years after he was arrested and two years after he broke loose
from guarding gendarmerie to run free for three hours and a half
in April 1998 before he was caught up again.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux was sentenced to 13 years in jail in 1989 for raping
five girls but was released early and only to be arrested in
August 1996 after two girls were rescued from a dungeon in his
cellar.
</P>
<P>
Two bodies of little girls were found in his house and two more
bodies were discovered in that of one of his associates.
</P>
<P>
The exposure of Dutroux' crimes against little girls created a
furor in Belgium and across Europe. Some 350,000 people gathered
on the streets of the Belgian capital of Brussels in 1996 to
protest against the inefficiency of the country's police and
justice system.

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will announce a
major overture toward Iran Friday, promising steps toward the
return of assets frozen since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution,
lifting a ban on imports of Iranian luxury goods and making it
easier for Iranian academics and athletes to visit the United
States.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian investigators said Thursday that they have
indentified the explosives, detonators, routes and at least six
people who allegedly helped carry out apartment bombings in Moscow
and other cities last September that triggered the Russian
military offensive against Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Investors bought stocks furiously Thursday, sending the Dow
Jones industrial average up nearly 500 points in its biggest one-
day point gain ever. Broader indexes also rose sharply as
investors put aside fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve would
aggressively raise interest rates and slow the economy to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister of Nepal Krishna Prasad Bhattarai resigned
after a rebellion by members of his government party, who blamed
him for deteriorating law and order, and poor administration.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. producer prices rose a larger-than-expected 1 percent
last month, with much of the increase due to energy prices. But
excluding food and energy, prices rose only 0.3 percent, and all
of that increase resulted from higher cigarette prices.
</P>
<P>
-- NATO pledged to send more troops to Kosovo and crack down on
Serb and Albanian extremists.

<HEADLINE> Athens Olympic Organizers Considers Changing Dates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Athens is considering whether to
bring the 2004 Summer Games forward by two weeks from the planned
dates of August 13-29, organizers said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal came from the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who said the change of dates
would allow professional soccer players to compete at the Games.
</P>
<P>
Athens' chief Olympic organizer Costas Bakouris said that the
IOC wants them to give an answer before the next (IOC) executive
board meeting on April 18-19.
</P>
<P>
The issue could be finalized on May 10-12 when the IOC's
coordination commission will pay its next visit to Athens.
</P>
<P>
The IOC says the date change would allow the top players to
appear for their national teams at the Games by avoiding clashes
with domestic league fixtures or the European Champions League.

Qian expounded on China's basic policy of "peaceful

As for the role of the United Nations in the present
international situation, Qian said that despite a dangerous
tendency during the Kosovo crisis of reducing the role of the UN
and its Security Council, and even placing certain nation and
regional organization over the UN, the final settlement of the
crisis within the UN framework shows that the role of the UN in
preventing and settling crisis and disputes, as the world's most

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister Denies Ocalan Lives in Luxury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Justice Minister Hikmet
Sami Turk said on Friday that Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), did not live in luxury as it was
assumed, but he had a radio and could read newspapers every day.
</P>
<P>
"Today, punishment aims at not exterminating criminals, but
training them to be useful for the society in future," the Anatolia
News Agency quoted Turk as saying at Salpazari town of Trabzon
province in the Black Sea Region.
</P>
<P>
Turk seems to support life imprisonment for Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"While taking the decision (on Ocalan), Turkey's high interests
will be taken into consideration by the Parliament. It is very easy
to exterminate a person but life imprisonment is a very heavy
sentence and punishment."
</P>
<P>
Turk said that his country, which has been accepted a European
Union candidacy, has set up a commission to scrutinize the Turkish
Penal Code (TCK).
</P>
<P>
Capital punishment has been annulled in Europe while there is
death sentence only in Turkey which sees itself a European country.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has not carried out any capital punishment since 1984. A
total of 57 people have been sentenced to capital punishment since
1991. Ocalan is among them," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan had been leading the PKK in an armed struggle for an
independent Kurdish state in southeast Turkey since 1984. The long-
time conflict has claimed thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
The PKK chieftain was captured last year by Turkish security
forces and was later sentenced to death by a court.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is waiting for a decision by the European Court of Human
Rights' (ECHR) about Ocalan. Only after the ECHR makes such a
decision, the country will decide whether or not to carry out the
death sentence for Ocalan.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Prime Minister Jens
Stoltenberg announced his new government in Oslo on Friday, said
reports from Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after presenting his government to King
Harald V, Stoltenberg said his 18-member team, including 10 men
and eight women, was "large" and included some of Norway's most
experienced politicians.
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg, who celebrated his 41st birthday Thursday, has
become the country's youngest-ever prime minister. Some of his
cabinet members are also very young: Oil and Energy Minister Olav
Akselsen is 34, Justice Minister Hanne Harlem is 35, while Finance
Minister Karl Eirik Schjoett-Pedersen is 40.
</P>
<P>
Thorbjoern Jagland, 49, a former prime minister and head of
the Labour Party, was named the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg was asked by the king last week to form a new
government after former prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, who
came to power in March 1997, lost a vote of confidence in
parliament and resigned.
</P>
<P>
All the ministers are from the Labour Party. The new
government has a minority of seats in parliament, 65 of 165, and
will depend heavily on cooperation with other parties to survive.
</P>
<P>
The next legislative elections in Norway are scheduled for
September 2001.

<HEADLINE> EU Keeps Support for Refugee Return to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said on
Friday that it would continue to support the return of refugees
and displaced people to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The EU's Obnova 2000 integrated return program is designed to
provide financing of 50.1 million euro (about 48.5 million U.S.
dollars) for a package of measures to ensure sustainable return
movements.
</P>
<P>
Aid will be also provided for housing reconstruction and
rehabilitation of related infrastructure, income generation
measures, demining and measures to provide legal advice and
assistance to refugees and displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
The Obnova 2000 program will support breakthrough return
movements to previously closed municipalities in Bosnia, such as
Republika Srpska, and it will support regional return movements
from Croatia to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, said
that a successful return process is fundamental for the creation
of a stable Bosnia and is one of the cornerstones of the Dayton
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The EU committed assistance funds of up to 1.3 billion euro (
about 1.2 billion dollars) to Bosnia between 1996 and 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany's upper house of the
parliament, the Bundesrat, on Friday lifted a national ban on
British beef.
</P>
<P>
British beef must be clearly labeled to protect consumers from
the possible risks of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, said the Bundesrat.
</P>
<P>
Since the mad cow disease caused by the British beef began in
March 1996, almost all the countries of the European Union have
banned import of the British beef.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Parliament Passes Budget for Fiscal 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Diet, or parliament, on
Friday adopted a record-high 84.99 trillion yen (770.9 billion U.S.
dollars) national budget for fiscal year 2000, featuring measures
designed to spur sustainable recovery of the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The House of Councilors (upper house) passed the general-
account budget for the year starting from April 1 at a plenary
session, with the support of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (
LDP) and its two coalition partners, the Liberal Party (LP) and
the New Komeito party.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which was submitted to parliament on January 28,
cleared the House of Representatives (lower house) on February 28.
</P>
<P>
The budget features a 2.6 percent expansion in general
expenditures to a record 48,091.4 billion yen (436.2 billion
dollars) for funding public works and other policy-oriented
projects.
</P>
<P>
The expansionary fiscal policy is designed to meet the Japanese
government's economic growth target of 1.0 percent in real terms
in fiscal 2000, which would be the second straight year of growth.
The government has voiced confidence that it will be able to
attain its goal of 0.6 percent growth for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
To help fund the budget, the Japanese government will have to
float a record 85.87 trillion yen (778.9 billion dollars) in bonds
during fiscal 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Montreal court Thursday
charged 10 youths for Wednesday night's riot in a downtown area
against what they called "police brutality".
</P>
<P>
The defendants were among 112 others arrested in the clash with
the riot police, who were called in to restore order after
hundreds of protesting youths began smashing windows and damaging
cars.
</P>
<P>
Municipal court judge Pierre Gaston ordered three of the
defendants to remain in custody until a further decision, while
the other seven were allowed to go home before reappearing in
court at a later date.
</P>
<P>
The protest was organized by a group called Movement Action
Justice, which has said "we won't stop our efforts just because
some tiny groups create havoc."
</P>
<P>
The youths were alleged to protest against the death of a
homeless man in a confrontation with the police at a Montreal cafe.

MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Belarus' Vadim Shashurin put in a
performance free from mistakes to win the men's 10 kilometer
sprint Friday at Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia.
</P>
<P>
Shashurin missed no targets and finished in 26 minutes 28.8
seconds to capture his first biatholon World Cup title since 1997.
</P>

Devis Da Canal of Italy, the 1997 junior world champion, was 7.
1 seconds behind the winner. He also shot clean and scored his
first career podium finish.
</P>
<P>
Defending overall champion Sven Fisher of Germany made one
penalty loop to finish third, just 9.5 seconds behind the leader.
</P>
<P>
Overall standings leader Raphael Poiree of France came in fifth,
25.1 seconds off the pace. Two penalty loops denied him the
season's World Cup Sprint title, which went to Ole Einar
Bjorndalen of Norway.

The race for the overall title is still open as Poiree has 437
points ahead of Bjorndalen, at 417. Bjorndalen finished twelfth

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the
world's second largest chip producer, has brought the world's
fastest PC chip to China.
</P>
<P>
The new 1GHz chip, or central processing unit (CPU), makes one
billion calculations per second, much faster than other popular
chips now in use.
</P>
<P>
Leading PC manufacturers including Compaq and Gateway use the
new 1GHz Athlon chip in their latest desktops, which are now
available to customers all over the world via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
However, the chip will not be available in China until the end
of this month, said Thomson Chan, director of marketing for AMD
Asia Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The CPU is the heart of a computer, and its speed plays a
decisive role in the machine's performance.
</P>
<P>
Computer technologies are undergoing unprecedented development,
with more sophisticated models appearing in almost every fields in
growing numbers, said Prof. Chen Zhengqing, president of China
Computer Users' Association.
</P>
<P>
"The new 1GHz chip will have people calculating computer speeds
in giga-bytes rather than mega-bytes," he said.
</P>
<P>
AMD, which has long been challenging the world's top chip maker
Intel through lower prices for its products, has pledged a
consistent pricing strategy since launching the fastest chip ahead
of its competitor, according to Thomson Chan.

</P>
<P>

the importance NCR attaches to the China market," said Hideki
Hosoi, vice-president of Japan/North Asia Region, NCR's Retail
Solution Group.

BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
met with Lord William Rees-Mogg, columnist and former editor-in-
chief of the British Times newspaper, here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian expounded on China's basic policy of "peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems" in settling the Taiwan
issue, highlighted president Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposition
in this regard, and said that not allowing the Taiwan issue to
linger on indefinitely is an important part of the Chinese
government's push for reunification.
</P>
<P>
As for the role of the United Nations in the present
international situation, Qian said that despite a dangerous
tendency during the Kosovo crisis of reducing the role of the UN
and its Security Council, and even placing certain nation and
regional organization over the UN, the final settlement of the
crisis within the UN framework shows that the role of the UN in
preventing and settling crisis and disputes, as the world's most
influential and universal inter-governmental organization, is
irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
It should be commonly understood that the UN's authority must
be safeguarded, and military intervention which brushes aside the
UN should be opposed, Qian stressed.

Rees-Mogg is visiting China as the guest of the People's Daily

<HEADLINE> Int'l Symposium on Obesity to Be Held in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign medical
specialists will hold a symposium next week in Beijing to discuss
how to deal with obesity, which is becoming a global health
problem.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will also focus on establishing new criterion for
the clinical diagnosis of overweight and obesity, the latest
weight-loss methods, and other health-related topics, according to
the event's organizer.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine estimate
that 14 percent of young and middle-aged urban Chinese are
overweight, and in some cities in north China, overweight people
make up nearly half of local population.
</P>
<P>
Another study has found that obesity among Chinese children has
grown at an annual rate of nine percent over the past decade,
indicating that the number of fat children will double in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Specialists warn of a possible sharp increase in the overweight
population in the coming years, and note that obesity may become
the primary health threat in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Obesity, which is often the result of an unhealthy diet and a
sedentary life, may lead to high blood pressure, cardiovascular
diseases, diabetes, and related complications, doctors say.

<HEADLINE> Tight Security in Delhi Prior to Clinton Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Security went tighter in the
Indian capital on Friday with just two days left before U.S.
President Bill Clinton's arrival here for his south Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
Delhi police personnel and U.S. security officials were busy
fine-tuning various security measures, while the Plush Maurya
Sheraton Hotel, where Clinton would stay during his visit, was
sealed off on Friday morning by U.S. security men and armed guards
of Delhi police.
</P>
<P>
Fire safety system and communication networks in the hotel were
thoroughly checked and an anti-sabotage team of the Delhi police
was working overtime combing the hotel and its surrounding areas
for any possible explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
Several Police Control Room jeeps could be seen parking around
the hotel and policemen were keeping strict vigil on people moving
around in this sensitive area.
</P>
<P>
Close circuit televisions and security cameras have also been
installed in some "strategic parts" of the hotel, police sources
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a deal between the Indians and the Americans, the
proximate security of Clinton will be solely managed by U.S.
security officials and the Delhi police would only provide "outer
ring" security cover, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Elaborate security arrangements have also been made at Rajghat,
where Clinton will pay homage to the Father of the Nation Mahatma
Gandhi, said Suresh Roy, joint commissioner of Delhi police.
</P>
<P>
"All security measures are being taken for (the) smooth and
peaceful visit of Clinton," said Roy, adding that the Delhi police
and the U.S. security agencies have maintained "close cooperation
and coordination."
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, security in and around the U.S.
embassy in Chanakyapuri area had also been beefed up in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Police Commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma said Wednesday that
the entire Delhi police force, which has more than 55,000
personnel, had been mobilized and put on a "general state of alert
" to ensure "foolproof security" for the U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
Security measures already taken by the Delhi police force
included a close watch on the large number of Afghan refugees in
the capital and a constant vigil on the entry and exit points to
the city, said Sharma.
</P>
<P>
The police will also make sure that the Clinton visit would not
be disturbed by any possible protest actions, he added.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Dependence on Food Imports Makes Singapore Vulnerable: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SINGAPORE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Heavy dependence on primary
food imports has made Singapore vulnerable to unforeseen
disruptions in food supplies and outbreak of food-poisoning and
zoonotic diseases, Singapore Minister for National Development Mah
Bow Tan told the parliament Friday.
</P>
<P>
He asked the parliament to take the move to restructure the
Primary Production Department (PPD) under his ministry into a
statutory board called the Agri-food and Veterinary Authority (AVA)
on April 1, 2000, and assign it a mandate to ensure safety of
Singapore's primary food needs, to shoulder the responsibility for
animal and plant health, animal welfare and the agriculture
industry.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Singapore's primary food requirements come from
overseas while local production supplies only 1.5 percent of the
poultry, 10 percent of fish, 30 percent of the eggs and six
percent of the vegetables consumed in the country.
</P>
<P>
PPD was formed in 1959 to develop and regulate the local
farming industry and to ensure safety and quality of foods
produced by local farms.
</P>
<P>
With the gradual shrinking of the agricultural sector over the
years due to urbanization and industrialization, PPD's role and
focus shifted in tandem to ensure the safety of primary food
imports, manage animal welfare and diseases control and facilitate
agricultural development and trade.
</P>
<P>
As a statutory board, AVA can leveraged on its expertise to
offer consultancy to food and agriculture industries in Singapore
and the region and look into making Singapore an agricultural hub
and distribution center in the region, the minister said.

Adviser Alexander Aguirre told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>

and drug trafficking.

concerns through broader strategic, political, economic and
security alliances and pursuit of peace initiatives bilaterally,
regionally and internationally.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre stressed that the government will pursue a country-team
approach in dealing with national security issues, in which
government agencies shall speak with one voice.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
assured European envoys here on Friday that the conflict in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) would be solved soon
because all the parties involved want peace.
</P>

He told the ambassadors from some European Union countries that
Uganda was totally committed to the Lusaka peace agreement signed

<P>
National unity and revitalization are the common aspirations of
all Chinese descendants around the world. Such a feeling is much
stronger among those Chinese who used to wander in foreign lands,
the participants at the seminar said.
</P>
<P>
"The independence of Taiwan means war, for any sovereign state
will not tolerate any attempt to compromise its territorial
integrity," said Leong Chong Kao, vice-chairman of the association.
</P>
<P>
"We bear the fervent hope that our compatriots in Taiwan will
lead a peaceful life free from war," he said. "In this regard,
they must have a clear understanding of the current situation and
cast their votes well (in the election in Taiwan)."
</P>
<P>
Lao Ngai Leong, another vice-chairman of the association, said
that all remarks and actions which maliciously separate Taiwan
away from the motherland will harm national interests and will
surely be opposed by all Chinese including those in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We hold the firm belief that any attempt to challenge the one-
China principle and advocate the independence of Taiwan will not
succeed," Lao said.
</P>

Some other participants noted that no matter who becomes the
new leader in Taiwan, the independence of Taiwan will not be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
The speakers expressed the wish that Taiwan compatriots will
not be cheated by some separatist politicians. The masses of
Taiwan people should make wise decisions at the critical juncture.

<HEADLINE> More Non-smoking Areas in Restaurants Demanded in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Council on
Smoking and Health (COSH) has released its findings of a new
opinion survey which show that a majority of people favor smoke-
free eating places in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,078 respondents were interviewed in the survey,
which is a follow-up of a similar survey conducted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Professor T.H. Lam from the Department of Community Medicine of
the University of Hong Kong, who headed the research team, said
that compared with the previous survey, stronger support for smoke-
free restaurants was found in the latest survey.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of those interviewed supported the proposal that
half the seats in all restaurants should be designated as non-
smoking areas and more than two-thirds supported all seats being
non-smoking.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that prevalence of exposure to Environmental
Tobacco Smoke (ETS) in restaurants has also remained high. About
69 percent of the respondents admitted that they were often or
sometimes exposed to passive smoking.
</P>
<P>
A majority, about 64 percent of the respondents, believed that
the current legislation was insufficient and ineffective in
protecting people from passive smoking. Most agreed that the
legislation should be expanded to cover more restaurants and
increase the size of non-smoking areas.
</P>
<P>
"The survey indicates that most people would choose restaurants
with non-smoking areas, especially when accompanied by children,
and most would choose to eat in non-smoking areas," T.H. Lam said.
</P>
<P>
Professor A.J. Hedley chairman of COSH, said: "This new report
makes it clear beyond any doubt that the public now recognizes
that tobacco smoke in the form of ETS is an extremely poisonous
mixture of chemical compounds."
</P>
<P>
The council has called for a much improved strategic plan to
prevent passive smoking in the home, the workplace, restaurants
and bars, and other public places and transportation.

<HEADLINE> Registered Trademarks Exceed One Million in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of valid trademarks in
China has reached nearly 1.1 million, ranking tenth in the world,
according to statistics released today by the Trademark Bureau
under the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC).
</P>
<P>
Last year, local authorities throughout China handled some 165,
000 trademark applications and approved 122,000, and the latter
figure was 14,700 more than that in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Another 111 new famous trademarks were also confirmed last year,
bringing the total number of such trademarks to 153, according to
the bureau.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of China's high-tech industry in
recent years, knowledge and technology has played an increasingly
significant role in the country's economic growth, and more and
more Chinese enterprises have paid growing attention to protecting
their property rights, the trademark right in particular.
</P>
<P>
However, due to loopholes in trademark registration procedure
and supervision, violation of trademark rights and fake products
also take place in the Chinese markets.
</P>
<P>
Bai Dahua, deputy director of the SAIC, said the Trademark
Bureau is stepping up its effort in revising the Trademark Law to
simplify registration procedures and improve supervision mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local departments for industry and commerce have
joined hands with key enterprises to help them resolve trademark-
related problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide computer network is expected to be set up by the
end of this year to supervise trademark registration and improve
management.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Calls for Speeding Up Western Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, will publish an editorial tomorrow calling for
accelerating the development of the country's vast western regions.
</P>
<P>
Implementing the strategy of developing the central and western
regions represents a major decision of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) in the new century, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It will be of great significance for a sustainable growth of
the national economy, the coordinated economic development of all
regions, enhanced unity among all nationalities, and social and
border stability.
</P>
<P>
We must seize this historic opportunity and do a solid job in
carrying out the Party's major decision which will have a far-
reaching impact, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
As an important step in China's reform and opening up and
socialist modernization drive, the strategy of developing the west
is of landmark significance, it notes.
</P>
<P>
Now, conditions and opportunities have matured for implementing
the strategy, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The past two decades have witnessed the rapid growth of the
eastern regions, which has accumulated much capital, talent,
technology, and management experience.
</P>
<P>
Whiling pursuing further growth, the east is also willing to
support the development of the west, which in turn will offer the
east rich resources and huge market potentials.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, since the establishment of New China over 50
years ago, the country's overall strength has improved markedly,
and now boasts enough economic capability to extend further
support to the west, says the editorial.

<P>
In addition, the CPC has become more experienced in applying
economic means to the country's construction; and China's
socialist system also provides great advantages in pooling all
forces into major projects.
</P>
<P>
People in both the eastern and western regions have every
reason to believe that western development will be a great success,
it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that in the process of developing the west,
good wishes must be combined with actual conditions, and the
government's macro-economic tuning must be combined with market
laws.
</P>
<P>
As a huge undertaking, western development must be planned in a
scientific and meticulous way, and carried forward in a step-by-
step manner, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
In the process, special efforts should be devoted to building
the regions' infrastructure, ecological protection, industrial
restructuring, and the development of science and technology and
education, it stresses.

modernization drive have arrived at a new stage, and developing
the west is a major feature of this new stage, which will have a
direct bearing on the country's long-term development, stability,
and prosperity.

The editorial expresses the belief that with the CPC's
leadership and the efforts of the entire nation, the central and
western regions of China will surely achieve better and faster
development in the new century.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Senior Judges to Receive Training in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Each year, at least six senior
judges and six senior prosecutors will spend three months in
Europe for professional training beginning this year, according to
a four-year cooperative project launched here today.
</P>
<P>
The EU-China Legal and Judicial Co-operation Program, supported
by the European Commission and China's Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation(MOFTEC), also promises to fund 15 Chinese
lawyers each year for their nine-month training courses in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Union plans to provide over 13.5 million euro for
the project, which is scheduled to be carried out by by the
British Council (on behalf of the European Commission) and China's
Ministry of Justice (on behalf of MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
According to Gao Changli, Chinese minister of Justice, the
project aims to "strengthen Sino-European legal and judicial
exchanges and collaboration, as well as promoting and ensuring the
overall sound development of China-Europe relations."
</P>
<P>
The project also pledges to fund 20 Chinese professionals each
year on a one-month visit to European legal institutions and to
attend a seminar on a legal topic.
</P>
<P>
Gao pointed out that the Chinese government is devoted to the
rule of law in China, and to building a socialist and legal
country. "The project provides a very good channel for mutual
understanding, learning and co-operation between Chinese and
European legal and judicial circles."

<HEADLINE> Oldest Ax Tools Indicate Similar Intelligence in Asia and Africa (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and American
anthropologists have ascertained that stone artifacts found in
south China were made 800,000 years ago, demonstrating that early
humans living in Asia had a technological level similar to that of
people living in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The stone tools from the Bose Basin in the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region represent the oldest known large cutting tools (
LCTs) in East Asia, pushing the history of toolmaking here back
some 300,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The authoritative Science magazine had a color picture of two
Bose artifacts on the cover of its March 3 issue.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory analysis of argon isotopes, which are widely
regarded as a state-of-the-art dating technique, in the rocks from
Bose precisely dated the aerolites associated with the artifacts.
</P>
<P>
"Acheulean-like tools in the mid-Pleistoncene in south China
imply that Mode 2 technical advances were manifested in East Asia
contemporaneously with handaxe technology in Africa and western
Eurasia," researcher Hou Yamei, professor at the Chinese Academy
of Sciences' Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and
Paleoanthropology, said in the Science report.
</P>
<P>
Because some of the Bose basin artifacts rival the refinement
of contemporaneous African stone tools, known as Acheulean
technology, many scientists claimed that the new study disproves a
long-standing hypothesis that Homo Erectus in Asia was less handy -
- and by implication, less intelligent and adaptive -- than their
African relatives.

"There is no essential difference in the biology and culture of
early human groups East and West," said co-leader of the
excavation Huang Weiwen, a paleontologist at the same CAS
institute.
</P>
<P>
In 1944, Harvard anthropologist Hallam Movius proposed that
prehistoric population living 1.6 million to 200,000 years ago
existed on one side of a geographical line that separated them
from groups in central and eastern Asia, where early humans
fashioned much simpler stone implements.
</P>
<P>
But the discovery of prehistoric hand axes in the Bose Basin
supports the growing suspicion that hand-ax production sometimes
crossed what archaeologists call the Movius line.
</P>
<P>
With a size of roughly 800 square kilometers, the Bose Basin
has a complete chronological series of layers dated back to two
million years ago, and Hou and her colleagues have found more than
100 ancient cultural sites in the basin.
</P>
<P>
"The stone tools made from large cobbles reveal that ancient
residents there were high-tech Homo Erectus," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
Hou and the team also claim that Bose stone technology is
associated with a meteorite falling to Earth and dispersing glassy
remnants of molten rock.
</P>
<P>
Widespread forest destruction caused by the ancient meteorite
probably spurred residents to make delicate tools in order to
obtain food, they said.
</P>
<P>
"What we have in the Bose Basin is the most Acheulean-like
assemblage of stone tools ever found in East Asia, requiring the
same behavioral and technical competence," said Richard Potts of
the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History,
who has worked with Hou since 1994.
</P>
<P>
While academic circles take a second look at the Chinese sites,
Hou is leading a team to analyze fossilized animal bones found in
caves surrounding the basin.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Indonesia's Aceh Improves, Says President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said here Friday that the situation in Aceh province is much
better now, following talks between State Secretary Bondan Gunawan
and Military Commander of the Aceh Separatist Movement (GAM)
Abdullah Syafi'ie.
</P>
<P>
Wahid added that he had ordered the state secretary to do so.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Gunawan held talks with Syafi'ie in Aceh at an
undisclosed place. This was the first encounter ever between
representatives of the government and the GAM, an underground
movement in the province which has been launching fighting against
the central government over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"I asked Mas (Brother) Bondan to go to Abdullah Syafi'ie and
give sacrificial animals to him," Wahid told reporters after
Friday's praying, adding that the GAM members are also the
brothers of the nation.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Aceh issue should be settled well. He wanted a
large-scale investment process to take place in the province soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesia's House of Representatives (DPR)
Speaker Akbar Tandjung Friday said the government's move to hold
talks with the Aceh separatist commander was expected to
accelerate the peace settlement process on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The GAM is a fact that exists in Aceh and (its existence) is
effective in some part of the province," Tandjung said, adding
that the government also is expected to extend its talks with
other factions in Aceh to boost the reconciliation process and end
the bloody conflict.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, National Police Chief Gen. Rusdihardjo said
the talks with the GAM commander did not mean that the government
reached a compromise with separatists.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so. It has been planned long before. It is just
an approach. Let us see from the positive point of view. Talks
with the GAM are better than not at all," Rusdihardjo told
reporters here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Acehnese Muslim leaders voiced their hope that talks
between the government and the GAM will lead to the settlement of
the conflict in the restive province of Aceh.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the cordial meeting between Bondan (Gunawan) and
Syafi'ie to be followed by a get-together between troops of both
sides, thus negating any more gunfight," Chairman of Muhammadiyah
Aceh Chapter Tengku Imam Suja' was quoted by Antara as saying.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Prices Increase in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has increased fuel
prices by up to 20 percent owing to a rise in imported oil price
and a devaluation of metical against U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy on Thursday announced
rises by 20 percent in the price of diesel and jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
A liter of diesel rose from 5,210 to 6,250 meticais (14,200
meticais to one U.S. dollar at current exchange rate). The
increase for jet fuel was from 3,844 to 4,612.90 meticais a liter.
</P>
<P>
Kerosene went up from 2,780 to 3,330 meticais a liter, which is
a 19.8 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The price of cooking gas rose by 15.5 percent. A Kilogram of
gas now costs 8,268.3 meticais, instead of the previous 7,157.9
meticais.
</P>
<P>
The smallest increase was for petrol, which went up by 6.1
percent, from 7,580 to 8,040 meticais a liter.
</P>
<P>
These prices are valid for the main ports and surrounding
areas. Inland, the distributors are allowed to add the cost of
transport to the fixed prices.
</P>
<P>
Fuel prices are reviewed every month, and are changed whenever
the import price has risen or fallen by more than three percent
when expressed in meticais.
</P>
<P>
The last fuel price increase was on February 15.

<HEADLINE> US Company Finds New Partners for Steel Factory in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States corporation
Enron has announced that it has found five partners to work with
it on a proposed factory to manufacture steel slabs in Maputo,
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Maputo Iron and Steel Project (MISP) seemed in deep trouble
last year when Enron's original partner, the South African
Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) pulled out.
</P>
<P>
Enron and IDC were each to have held 50 percent of the equity
in MISP.
</P>
<P>
An Enron press release issued on Thursday says that the other
50 percent will now be held by the Swiss steel company Duferco,
Kobe Steel of Japan, Midrex of the United States, VAI of Australia
and Techint of Italy.
</P>
<P>
Enron says that Midrex has technology for smelting iron filings
that will be used at MISP, while VAI is "one of the major
suppliers and manufacturers of integrated steel equipment in the
world". Techint is also a leading manufacturer of steel-making
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The raw material for MISP is magnetite from Phalaborwa in South
Africa, and natural gas from Pande, in the southern Mozambican
province of Inhambane. Enron holds the rights over the Pande gas
field.
</P>
<P>
According to Enron, MISP will cost about a billion U.S. dollars
to build, with the 610 kilometer-long pipeline to bring the gas
from Pande to Maputo costing a further 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
But serious problems with MISP have yet to be solved. In
particular, the factory will need 67 million liters of water a
day, and it is not yet known where this will come from. The
government has ruled out the use of the Umbeluzi River, which
supplies Maputo with its drinking water.

LAGOS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- More killings and arson were
counted Thursday in the prolonged clashes between the towns of Ife

<HEADLINE> World Water Forum Opens In Hague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 3,500 experts are
gathering here to take part in the Second World Water Forum in a
bid to create wider public awareness for water issues in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Dutch Crown Prince Willem-Alexander
Claus George Ferdinand said the world needs a new beginning if the
governments are to avert water crises in the century ahead.
</P>
<P>
"This does not mean we will be starting all over again. Instead,
let us take the positive elements from the past and incorporate
them into our new approach to Integrated Water Resource Management,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to the new generation of water managers to work hand
in hand with members of the older generations. By working together,
we will make a difference," added the prince, who is honored as
Chairman of the Forum.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the water situation, Willem-Alexander said lots of
people in the world have no access to clean water or adequate
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
"Millions of people - many of them children - die each year of
water-related diseases: diseases that could easily be cured. Water
resources are in danger of drying up - water that is needed to
produce food and give people sustainable livelihoods. Half of our
wetlands were destroyed in the last century. Half of the world's
rivers are polluted, their ecosystems dead before they reach the
sea," he warned, adding that "this is simply not acceptable".
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the governments hold dialogues with the major
groups attending this Forum and urge them to make a commitment.
</P>
<P>
According to the Organizing Committee, 158 delegations and 115
ministers will attend a parallel Ministerial Conference on water
issues on March 21-22, the last two days of the Forum.
</P>
<P>
World Water Council President Mahmoed Abu-Zeid said the five-
day Forum will be dynamic and creative, expected to provide an
opportunity for all stakeholders to present their concerns and
learn about the needs of others as well.
</P>
<P>
Serving as a launching pad for a global "vision on water", the
Forum aims at paving the way for taking necessary steps "from
Vision to Action".
</P>
<P>
The first World Water Forum was held in Marrakech, Morocco.

<HEADLINE> WB Pledges Support to China's West Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank's new vice-
president for the East Asia and Pacific region, Jemal-ud-din
Kassum, today pledged his organization's firm support to China's
strategic plan to develop its vast western regions.
</P>
<P>
Kassum, who arrived here Tuesday for a six-day official visit,
told a press conference that in the next three years, his bank is
expected to extend at least one billion U.S. dollars of loans to
back major projects in western China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the World Bank is willing to provide assistance to
address strategic issues involved in the ambitious development
program.
</P>
<P>
Such issues include integrating key transport systems linking
the western regions with each other and with the rest of the
country, strengthening and increasing access to social services
and mitigating environmental consequences, and measures to lower
investment costs and ensure quality.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the Bank's loans to China would amount to
five to seven billion U.S. dollars in the next three years, with
at least one billion dollars to be spent on projects in the west.
</P>
<P>
Kassum's China trip is his first official visit since he took
up the post on March 1.
</P>
<P>
While in Beijing, he has met with senior Chinese leaders,
including Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Finance Minister Xiang
Huaicheng, and leaders of the State Development Planning
Commission, the People's Bank of China and other key government
agencies, and held discussions with them on major issues
concerning the World Bank's collaboration with China.
</P>
<P>
He will make a field trip to Guizhou Province in the southwest
to visit some of the World Bank-funded projects there.
</P>
<P>
Kassum expressed satisfaction with the strong and fruitful
collaboration that the Bank has developed with China over the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased to learn how highly all the government
representatives value the contribution of the World Bank to China
and we fully agreed that this strong relationship should continue,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He also committed himself in the capacity of the new regional
vice-president to continuing and strengthening the Bank's
collaboration with China.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Bank has supported 220 projects in China
that cover most of the Chinese regions with 30 billion dollars in
loans.
</P>
<P>
China is the largest single borrower from the Bank among all
the countries, while the implementation of the projects is also
the best among all the countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's impressive growth over the past 20 years has uplifted
hundreds of millions of its people out of poverty, Kassum noted,
adding that this is attributable to the wide-sweeping economic
reforms in China.
</P>
<P>
"China's record in reducing the number of absolute poor has
been unprecedented. I am hopeful that my visit to the Southwest
Poverty Reduction Project will give me better insight into China's
success in this area," said Kassum.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Sino-Foreign Coal Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China has devised preferential
policies to give foreign investors easier access to launching coal
projects in the country, a senior official with the State
Administration of Coal Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, foreign investors are allowed to
hold a majority stake in all coal projects in which they are
allowed or encouraged to invest.
</P>
<P>
The administration will give priority to the construction of
foreign-funded coal projects, and actively arrange the domestic
segments of capital in co-funded coal projects, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the preferential policies granted by the state,
foreign investors can also enjoy preferential policies worked out
by local governments.
</P>
<P>
Local coal enterprises will also be allowed to provide
favorable treatment for the foreign investors in light of relevant
state rules.
</P>
<P>
The official said that his administration will continue its
efforts this year to present a large group of big coal projects
for foreign investors, with priority given to building pit-head
power plants and coal transport facilities, exploiting coalbed
methane, and developing clean coal technology.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Court Postpones Hearing of Two Hamas Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Security Court decided on
Friday morning to postpone the hearing session of two suspects of a
radical Palestinian group, who surrendered to the Palestinian
police in the West Bank on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Voice of Palestine radio said Mohammed al-Semari and Hamdi al-
Mikdad urged the jury to put off the hearing session which opened
on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The court met on Thursday night to consider the charges against
the two suspectes of plotting against higher national interests,
illegal possession of arms and explosives in an inhabited area and
risking the lives of the people around.
</P>
<P>
Al-Semari, a leading member of the resistance movement Hamas,
and al-Mikdad were arrested during an ambush by Palestinian
Preventive Security Forces (PSP) at their residence in the West
Bank city of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Security Sources said the accused had threatened to
blow themselves up if the PSP troops broke into their house, but
gave up later after negotiations with the West Bank PSP Chief,
Colonel Gabriel al-Ragoub and Ghassan al-Shuk'a, the head of Nablus
Municipality.
</P>
<P>
They surrendered to the police after making a telephone
conversation with Hamas supreme leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin arranged
by Palestinian officials, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Security Forces on Thursday afternoon
arrested another Palestinian suspected to be in connection with the
two defendants as tipped by the Israeli Public Security Police.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Hopes IMF Would Not Delay Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government said
Friday it believes the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would not
delay the disbursement of its loan to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The amount (of the loan) has also been agreed upon -- as much
as 5 billion U.S. dollars," Coordinating Minister for Economy,
Finance and Industry Kwik Kian Gie told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the IMF is planning to postpone the disbursement
of its loan to Indonesia, pending a satisfactory settlement of the
Bank Bali scandal and the bad debts of the Texmaco business group.
</P>
<P>
The Bank Bali scandal, which helped wreck former president B.J.
Habibie's political career last year, revolves around a 60 percent
commission paid by Bank Bali to a firm run by a leading member of
the former ruling Golkar Party for the recovery of 904 billion
rupiah (129 million U.S. dollars) in loans from the Indonesian
Banking Restructuring Agency (IBRA).
</P>
<P>
Texmaco group obtained 754 million U.S. dollars and 1.9
trillion rupiah (270 million U.S. dollars) in loans mostly in pre-
shipment export facilities between November 1997 and February 1998
from the central bank through state banks Bank Negara Indonesia (
BNI) and Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) thanks to intervention from
then president Soeharto. The loans violated the legal lending
limit on BNI as well as the rule requiring prudent management of
the country's foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended loans to Indonesia last year over the Bank
Bali scandal, but signed a new agreement in January this year
under which it pledged to disburse the aid package mounting to 5
billion U.S. dollars over the next three years to the country.
</P>
<P>
Kwik Kian Gie said Texmaco's case has been forwarded to the
IBRA.
</P>
<P>
"Texmaco's case does not matter anymore because its (debt)
credit has been transferred to IBRA," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kwik Kian Gie said the selection of a new IMF managing director
to replace Michel Camdessus will not affect the latest agreement
signed by the IMF and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the government would bear the burden of the
state budget for the year 2000 if the IMF delays the disbursement
of the loan.
</P>
<P>
The IMF loan is the first source of funds for the state budget.
</P>
<P>
"A delay (in its disbursement) will directly influence some
social projects such as the social safety net program," he added.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Reaches Agreement With Major Suppliers of Oral Polio Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) has reached an agreement with the three largest
international suppliers of oral polio vaccine (OPV) to ensure that
sufficient quantities of the vaccine are available at least
through the year 2005, when the world is expected to be certified
polio-free.
</P>
<P>
"The global campaign to eradicate polio will not succeed if the
supply of oral polio vaccine is not assured through the year 2005
and even beyond," said UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy in
a statement here Friday. "The agreements we have come to today are
a major stepping stone toward our goal of eradicating this disease.
"
</P>
<P>
Meeting in Geneva with senior representatives of the three
principal WHO-certified suppliers of oral polio vaccine, Aventis
Pasteur, Chiron and SmithKline Beecham Biologicals, Bellamy said
that the business of vaccine production goes far beyond profit and
loss.
</P>
<P>
"It has a humanitarian dimension," Bellamy said. "It's
important to remind ourselves that this vaccine is one of the
miracles of our times."
</P>
<P>
As the target date for eradicating polio gets closer, UNICEF is
going all-out to support eradication efforts in countries where
the disease is still endemic. In collaboration with WHO, Rotary
International, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
NGOs, "National Immunization Days" will reach over 450 million
children with the oral polio vaccine this year alone.
</P>
<P>
Eradication of polio is targeted for the end of this year;
final certification that polio has truly been swept from every
corner of the globe is targeted for 2005.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF spends about 100 million U.S. dollars each year to
provide oral polio vaccine for immunization programs in polio-
endemic countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

The benchmark Hang Seng Index rose for the first time this week
up 329.04 points, or 2.01 percent, to open at 16,688.04 on Friday

Monday. Affected by the regional markets, Hong Kong stocks fell

Hong Kong stocks took their cue from the Dow Jones Industrial

news eased concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise rates

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Shows Signs of Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China has shown thriving scenes since the
establishment of the SAR government and will have a promising
future, a senior legislator in Macao said.
</P>
<P>
The fine scenes can be seen in the aspects of improved public
security, economic resurgence and booming tourism, according to
Tong Chi Kin, a senior member of the Macao Legislative Council and
spokesman for the Executive Council of the Macao SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Tong made the remarks in a recent meeting with a group of
people from the Hong Kong SAR of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the establishment of the Macao SAR
government, the situation of public security has been greatly
improved and the number of criminal cases has dropped obviously.
Over the past three months, local residents can feel that public
security has turned for the better.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the morale of the police is raised under the
SAR government rather than the Portuguese rule. They have become
more efficient in cracking criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
As long as the police make more efforts, they will surely be
able to live up to the expectations of local residents and
tourists, Tong Chi Kin said.
</P>
<P>
The economy has also shown signs of recovering. More business
opportunities have come, internal consumption market tends to be
booming, export maintains steady growth and unemployment rate
begins to go down.
</P>
<P>
The legislator noted that recently two companies from Hong Kong
have removed their headquarters to Macao, one pharmaceutical
factory will be put into production soon, and a foreign bank is
going to open a branch in the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the SAR government is improving its
administrative efficiency to offer investors better services, Tong
Chi Kin said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to tourism, the number of tourists in the first
month of the year increased about 20 percent over that in the same
month of last year.
</P>
<P>
What's more important, Tong said, Macao's unique cultural
features are attracting more tourists in addition to the
traditional gambling business.
</P>
<P>
As the income from tourism is an important part of government
revenue in Macao, the SAR government will try to make more people
around the world acquire more favorable knowledge about Macao.
</P>
<P>
Now the government has set up tourism offices in 14 big cities
all over the world, and more shall be set up to better promote
Macao's tourism, Tong Chi Kin said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Prefers not to Send Police to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel is inclined to reject an
American appeal about sending Israeli police officials to Kosovo to
participate in the international police force positioned there to
maintain order.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel has not yet given an official reply to the
United States, the heads of Israeli police and officials in the
Public Security Ministry had expressed their opposition to such an
idea, the Ha'aretz daily Friday quoted officials familiar with the
plan as saying.
</P>
<P>
These officials contended that according to the Israeli law, the
police have no legal ground to exercise its authority outside the
borders of the country.
</P>
<P>
The request, according to the report, was made by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright to Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
after an initial request from a lower-level U.S. official was
rejected outright earlier.
</P>
<P>
Levy reportedly favored accepting the appeal, but internal
consultations later turned the responsibility of making a decision
to the Public Security Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official told the Ha'aretz that the incident will not
pose any obstacle or problem to relations between Israel and the U.
S., the major patron of Israel in the world political arena.
</P>
<P>
Israel once acceded to a similar U.S. request to send police
force to Haiti after the U.S. invasion of the Caribbean island
country several years ago. U.S. President Bill Clinton then
intervened in a direct appeal to the then Israeli Prime Minister
Yithzak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
However, the complicated situation in Kosovo made Israelis hold
back from following the precedence. The escalating ethnic violence
in Kosovo, especially in the northern city of Kosovoska-Mitrovica,
caused more than 100 injuries this year on the part of
international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
According to Yugoslav official statistics, so far about 910
civilians have been killed and more than 800 injured in 4,354
terrorist activities since the international peacekeepers entered
Kosovo in June last year after the 78-day air bombing of Yugoslavia
by the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

</P>
<P>
Grossman noted that the Turkish government was on the right

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Grow 32.7 percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai exports in February reached
5.57 billion U.S. dollars, posing a 32.7 percent year-on-year
increase, Thai Deputy Commerce Minister Gornpot Asavinvichit said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gornpot was quoted by Thailand News Agency as saying that
Thailand also gained a trade surplus of 789.5 million dollars last
month, a 34.3 percent increase over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures were satisfactory and if the country could maintain
a monthly export level at around 5.5 billion dollars in the rest
of the year, total exports this year could grow over 10 percent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured products accounted for the largest proportion of
the country's exports last month, led by electrical appliances,
computers and parts and other electronic products, he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited improving world economic conditions, growing capital
markets and rising electronic commerce businesses as the factors
that contributed to the growth.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Thai government will push for more exports of
agricultural products through government-to-government deals,
Gornpot said.
</P>
<P>
Due to growing demand for capital goods of local manufacturers,
Thai imports in February also posed a 31 percent year-on-year
increase, reaching 4.78 billion dollars.

The financial assistance would be covering 15 projects from

<P>
The ADB expressed the confidence that Sri Lanka's economy could

Sri Lanka was one of the best aid utilizing countries and
efforts were under way to further increase utilization and
management, the ADB's resident representative John R. Cooney was

<P>
GENEVA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss House of Representatives
has given support to calls to scrap stamp duty on the trading of
shares and bonds in order to make the country a more attractive
financial center, Swiss Radio International reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The House voted 107 votes to 58 for the federal government to
come up with a proposal by September to do away with stamp duty on
shares and bonds,
</P>
<P>
If the stamp duty on shares and bonds is scrapped, the
government will suffer a loss of around 500 million Swiss francs (
about 301 million U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats, who are opposed to the plan, claimed that
they will call for a nation-wide vote, unless the banking sector
offers some kind of compensation to make up the shortfall in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
But center-right parties said the measures were needed for
Switzerland's financial market to remain competitive with other
major centers like London.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Renews Sponsorship of Olympic Games for Another Eight Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Eastman Kodak Company has
renewed its worldwide Olympic sponsorship for the eight-year
period from 2001 through 2008, announced the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) Thursday in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted that Kodak, who supported the first Olympic
Games of the modern era in Athens in 1896, will again be with us
when we return to Athens in 2004," said Richard W. Pound, IOC
first vice president and chairman of the IOC Marketing Commission.
</P>
<P>
"For more than a hundred years, Kodak has been making the
Olympic experience real for the people of the world. Olympic
images continue to be the most powerful reminders of the grace and
glory of the Olympic athletes," Mr. Pound added. "They say a
picture is worth a thousand words; Kodak has provided the
equivalent of millions of Olympic memories during its more than a
century of support of the Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
By joining the fifth and sixth generations of the IOC's global
sponsorship program, The Olympic Partnership (TOP) Program, Kodak
remains the exclusive film/photographics and imaging provider
through the next four Olympic Games: the 2002 Olympic Winter Games
in Salt Lake City, the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, the 2006
Olympic Winter Games in Turin, and the 2008 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
As a TOP partner, Kodak also continues to sponsor the athletic
teams and activities of the 199 National Olympic Committees (NOCs)
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Kodak has been involved in the Olympic Movement since 1896 when
it was an advertiser in the Athens results brochure and is a
charter member of the TOP program. Kodak joins The Coca-Cola
Company (beverages), John Hancock (life insurance/annuities), Sema
Group (information technology/systems integration), TIME/Sports
Illustrated (publishing), and VISA (payment systems) as the latest
partner in TOP V.
</P>
<P>
"We believe our role with the Olympics over the last century
plus has really furthered the goal of supporting the Olympic
spirit, athletic competition and international unity. In addition
to providing products, services, technology and personnel to help
make the games a reality, Kodak's products have also helped
capture some of the most enduring images of the Games. Those
images, in turn, have helped communicate the spirit of the
Olympics around the world," said Carl Gustin, senior vice
president and chief marketing officer, Eastman Kodak Company.
</P>
<P>
The IOC's TOP (The Olympic Partners) Program is the only
worldwide Olympic sponsor program. Created in 1985, the TOP
program provides support to the organizing committees of the
summer and winter Olympic Games, every National Olympic Committee,
the athletes of the Olympic teams, and the IOC.
</P>
<P>
When the program was launched, fewer than ten NOCs had any form
of marketing revenue. Today all 199 NOCs receive funding through
the program, according to the IOC. TOP Partners enjoy exclusivity
in their respective business categories.

<HEADLINE> 13-year-old Israeli Girl Draws with Kasparov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A 13-year-old Israeli girl
played world chess champion Garry Kasparov to a draw this week,
the Ha'aretz daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The girl, named Victoria Zaks, participated in a worldwide
match for Children versus Kasparov via the Internet and forced the
champion agree to a peace treaty after only 13 moves, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
All the other children taking part in the match were defeated
by Kasparov in a few moves, so that Zaks was the only one
challenging Kasparov's nerve.
</P>
<P>
Zaks immigrated from a former Soviet Union country to Israel
just two yeas ago and she has been reportedly playing chess since
she was six. She did not make any special preparations for the
match and was not especially nervous, the report said.
</P>
<P>
To encourage her bravery and brightness, Israel's National
Lottery decided to award her a new computer.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday reiterated his
warning that Israel's response to any attacks on the Galilee after
the Israel Defense Forces' redeployment to the international border
with Lebanon in July will be severe.
</P>
<P>
Barak also reiterated the government's commitment to Israel's
ally, the South Lebanese Army, and said the safety and welfare of
members of the force and their families will be guaranteed,
whatever the cost.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was speaking to reporters while on a tour of
Northern Israel Thursday, during which he participated in a
memorial ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the death of a
Jewish fighter.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Policy-making officials in Israel say the United States is
not doing enough to curb Russian aid for Iran's nuclear weapons and
long-range missile projects. Although the administration assured
Israel the subject was high on its agenda, the officials say, there
is no connection between the words and actions.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem expects the U.S. to exert heavier pressure on the
leadership in Moscow and to warn the Russians that they will face
sanctions if nuclear and missile technology continues to be made
available to Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, the administration has more complex considerations in
its relations with Russia, notably maintaining the stability of the
regime of acting President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian preventive security units arrested three Hamas
suspects near Nablus on Thursday night, two of them believed to be
the last members of the terror cell liquidated in Taibeh on March
2.
</P>
<P>
The two, reportedly armed with two suitcases containing 10
kilograms of explosive each, were arrested at their hideout.
</P>
<P>
A national security alert had been launched following the raid
on the Taibeh cell, during which four terrorists were killed and a
fifth arrested.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel and U.S. officials sought Thursday night to tone down
expectations of a quick resumption of peace talks with Syria
following predictions by Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass that
the negotiations could resume in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We are working on it, the time constraints are tightening, but
we still do not know anything new about the resumption of talks,"
said a spokesman from Barak's office.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said "I am
not aware of any imminent announcement" of negotiations resumption.
At the same time, Rubin did not rule out the possibility of a
summit between Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and U.S. President
Bill Clinton to help jumpstart the process.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Education Sector Urged to Nurture More Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Friday urged the education sector
to step up their efforts in generating an innovation environment
for students to explore their talents.
</P>
<P>
A country's competitive edge would increasingly come from its
ability to research, innovate and develop new technologies and
scientific techniques and the education sector should step up
their efforts in fulfilling this necessity, he told the opening of
the Prime College Campus in Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
He said there was an urgent need for Malaysia to increase the
number of scientists and engineers who will form the catalytic
backbone to the country's transition to a competitive knowledge
economy,
</P>
<P>
If Malaysia was to realize its quantum leap into the digital
era, a critical mass of scientists and researchers was a pre-
requisite, he said.
</P>
<P>
And if Malaysia was to succeed in creating a knowledge-based
economy where the best ideas can flourish, then an environment of
innovations must be generated by allowing students to explore
their talents fully, he added.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said the continued development of private institutions
of higher learning must take into account the need to make private
education accessible to students.
</P>
<P>
Under the 7th Malaysia Plan (1996-2000), the target for upper
secondary school enrollment into the science stream was set at 60
percent, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda's ambassador to
Tanzania has urged Tanzanian businessmen to boost export to
Rwanda, the Guardian newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with a delegation of Tanzania Chamber of
Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (TCCIA) on Thursday, Zephyr
Mutanguha said while Tanzania provided a major transit facility
for Rwandan imports through Dar es Salaam Port, the country's
business community was failing to exploit the good bilateral ties
and historical relations to boost trade.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda had lots of goods from Kenya and Uganda and almost
nothing from Tanzania, the envoy pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the TCCIA members, scheduled to leave next Sunday
for Rwanda on a business exploration tour, to exploit the Rwandan
market for Tanzanian goods.
</P>
<P>
He assured the delegation of their safety while in Kigali,
saying that the isolated incidents of killings as reported by
western media in recent days could occur anywhere in the world.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nike Inc. Reports 17 Percent Profit Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Nike Inc., U.S.'s leading
athletic shoe vendor, reported Thursday a 17-percent jump in
fiscal third-quarter earnings, amid solid sales growth
internationally and despite falling revenue.
</P>
<P>
News release from the sports giant said that, for the quarter
ended February 29, 2000, the Beaverton, Oregon-based company,
earned net income of 145.3 million U.S. dollars, up from 124.2
million dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Revenue fell to 2.16 billion dollars, down slightly from 2.18
billion dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to show strong growth in profitability despite
significant pressure caused by the strength of the U.S. dollar
against the euro," said Philip Knight, Nike chairman and chief
executive officer, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Our international business is robust, showing constant dollar
revenue growth in every region outside the U.S.," he added.
</P>
<P>
By region, U.S. athletic footwear revenue rose 4 percent to 858.
9 million dollars, while European revenue fell 7 percent to 558.5
million dollars -- but a rising dollar was responsible for that
decline, Nike said. Revenue in the Asia-Pacific area rose 14
percent to 254.1 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Nike earned 453
million dollars, compared to 357 million dollars a year ago.
Revenue during that span rose 2 percent to 6.7 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Northwest Airlines
Thursday raised fares throughout its entire domestic system, by as
much as 40 U.S. dollars per round-trip, in an attempt to counter
historically high fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
News release from the No. 4 U.S. airlines said it raised
unrestricted, or business, fares by 20 to 40 dollars round-trip,
and leisure fares by 10 to 20 dollars round-trip. Other fares,
such as senior fares, military fares, some Internet offers and
consolidator fares, vary in their levels of increase.
</P>
<P>
Northwest also increased fees for services such as excess
luggage, pet transportation, lost ticket replacement and other
handling fees by 5-25 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Observers expected other airlines to follow suit. "This will
probably be one of the fastest fare hike matches," said Tom
Parsons, who tracks fares for on-line travel company Bestfares.com.
</P>
<P>
Northwest executives, including chief executive John Dasburg,
have recently said current fuel price levels threaten airline
profitability.
</P>
<P>
Fuel price, rising to more than 30 dollars per barrel, is the
second-largest cost for airlines after labor.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Bethune, chief executive officer of Continental Airlines,
also said recently that fares would have to rise to offset fuel
prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Fighting continued Friday in North
Lanao province in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao,
killing at least 41 Muslim rebels and six government troops, the
latest military reports said.
</P>
<P>
The casualty report came after Philippine Armed Forces Chief-of-
Staff Angelo Reyes Friday morning ordered marine soldiers to clear
a town in North Lanao of attacking Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Reyes deployed more marines in the battle-
gripped Matungao Town in North Lanao where some 400 Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) guerrillas tried to surround and control
the town hall.
</P>
<P>
"I ordered the marines to clear the town of MILF rebels," said
Reyes who lamented the death of five soldiers and a civilian
military volunteer in the battle.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said the Muslim rebels were holed up in the
mountainous enclaves of the surrounding towns near the boundary of
North Lanao and South Lanao as government troops pounced on them.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, other reports said North Lanao has been
declared a "war zone" as sporadic fighting between government
forces and MILF rebels broke out Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MILF rebels have reportedly attacked six government force
detachments in North Lanao Thursday, killing two army soldiers and
two civilians.

MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Friday urged the Southeast Asian countries to enhance financial
market regulation in case of a revival of the currency and
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based multilateral financial body said it was the
free flow of capital into economies with distorted incentives and
without adequate supervisory or regulatory capacity which led to
the Asian currency and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
An ADB report recommends policies for preventing recurrence of
the Asian crisis, but it also admitted that since there are no fit-

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is to carry out a regional comparative
study to determine the economic environment differences in all its
member states as implementation of the Free Trade Area (FTA) draws
nearer, secretary-general Erastus Mwencha has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The study would examine the various factors to determine
differences from country to country which would in turn offer
solutions to uneven playing field, he said.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Zambian newspaper, The Post, quoted Mwencha as saying
that at the moment people were apprehensive for the outcome of
the regional grouping's zero tariffs scheduled for October 31,
2000.
</P>
<P>
"We have to tackle the economic environment problem and examine
the existing inconsistencies. I believe that is the real challenge
of integration," Mwencha said.
</P>
<P>
He cited concerns from the Zambian private sector which has
highlighted high government taxes, interest rates, labor and
electricity costs as contributing to its disadvantaged position
and uneven playing field.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha reiterated that COMESA has instituted a mechanism to
compensate revenue loss that may be incurred by national
governments as a result of zero rating.
</P>
<P>
He said the compensation mechanism was put up with the
co-operation of some major donors including the European Union and
International Development Bank.

LOS ANGELES, March 16 (Xinhua) -- All 54 Oscar statuettes, to
be given to this year's winners during a live broadcast of the
ceremony on March 26, are missing, press reports said late
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences issued a
statement Thursday night, saying the shipment -- from Chicago --
has apparently been stolen from a loading dock in a Los Angeles
suburb.
</P>
<P>
"We figured you'd probably want to know," the statement
concludes. A press conference is scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Entertainment Tonight, a television newsmagazine, reported that
the statuettes had been delivered by Roadway Express to the Bell
postal service center in California, and the Oscars went missing
from a loading dock there.
</P>
<P>
A new shipment of Oscars is scheduled to arrive on March 24,
two days before the broadcast, in case the originals fail to turn
up, according to ABC network.
</P>
<P>
While the FBI had initially been called in, the matter has now
been turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department Hijacking
Unit.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Friendly Exposes Soccer Gap between China and Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Sense comes after sentiment.
</P>
<P>
After reading too much into the friendly between China and
Japan Wednesday in Kobe, the Chinese media has shifted the focus
from head coach Yugoslav Bora Milutinovic to where China stand in
the hierarchy of Asia soccer, let alone the world.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic, nicknamed "Wonder Coach" for guiding four
different teams into the World Cup finals, had hit the headlines
in sports pages in the build-up to the friendly which ended up a
scoreless tie.
</P>
<P>
The habitually hectic media spared the Yugoslav from scolding
but laid their fingers to the sore spot of the Chinese soccer,
which they held has lagged behind Japan whether in soccer
philosophy or tactics.
</P>
<P>
"The goalless draw could not whitewash the alarming soccer gap
between China and Japan. But Milutinovic took over the national
team just a week ago, he need not shoulder any reponsibility,"
said the mass-circulation weekly Ball Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Daily even gave thumbs-up to Milutinovic for his
substitution in the second half, thinking the replacement was well-
timed and effective.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise the result would not have been a draw,"said the
daily paper.
</P>
<P>
Instead of Milutinovic, the media has relentlessly directed
their sharp words towards the beleaguered Chinese soccer, which
was embodied by poor organisation and shabby teamwork on the field.
</P>
<P>
"Visible Gap" was the headline of the Beijing Morning Post on
Thursday, which warned that the Japanese soccer has had an all-
round advantage over China.
</P>
<P>
The paper summed up the gap as "skillfully and tactically
stagnant and weak mentally, the single physical advantage failed
to be brought into full play".
</P>
<P>
China Sports Daily said that among the Chinese players the
goalkeeper is the best while the China Youth Daily headlined "
China forced a lucky tie".
</P>
<P>
"What the Chinese players are in urgent need are the basics:
skill and ability to read the game," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
China did not have a mental disadvantage as both sides split
their past meet with a 7-2-7 record. The last time they met on the
field is in 1998 in Dynasty Cup soccer tournament where China won
2-0.
</P>
<P>
The unbridled buildup prior to the friendly belied China's gap
to Japan, which football legend Pele ever said have the "talent,
quality and the finess with the ball like Brazilians" and "the
power of European style".
</P>
<P>
Japan's J-league, home to dozens of Brazilian players, has
slowly grown into a bit of an exporting industry seven years after
its birth. Midfielders Hidetoshi Nakata (AS Roma) and Hiroshi
Nanami (Venezia) and striker Shoji Jo (Real Valladolid)
spearheaded the up-and-coming generation to put Japanese soccer on
the world map.
</P>
<P>
The Sports Express went further to say that the gap is the
price that the Chinese soccer paid for the "detour" they made.
</P>
<P>
"Japanese soccer has unswervingly hold on to the South American
playing style, now they begin to harvest the crops.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, the Chinese soccer fall short of its own
style. They imitated Brazil then England, recently they turned to
the so-called Euro-Latin style. It is really a lesson that so much
time have been spent on the detour but come to no avail,"
</P>
<P>
"If we do not draw the lessons, China will lose matches which
matter much more than the friendly," the paper warned.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in N. China Drought-Affected Area Get Adequate Food Supplies, Clothing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 million kg of food
and 1.25 million pieces of clothing and quilts have been
distributed to farmers in drought-affected area in north China's
Shanxi province, an official source said today.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Shanxi was hit by its worst drought of the past
century. The drought led to a direct economic lost of 13.3 billion
yuan (1.6 billion US dollars) and left some 7 million people
without enough food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
"We now have enough to eat and wear, the government also lends
us seeds and fertilizer for spring planting," said Li Si'er, a
villager in Shanxi's Luliang region which suffered the most by
last year's dry weather.
</P>
<P>
Li and his fellow villagers harvested almost no grain last year.
</P>
<P>
Since autumn last year, the central and provincial governments
have allocated 113 million yuan for the relief efforts. The
provincial government has also spent six million yuan on
cultivating high-yield and drought-resistant corn seeds in
southern Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
Localities in the province have also organized farmers to work
outside the province.

<HEADLINE> Migrant Workers Major Work Force in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The migrant population is nearly one tenth of the total
population in this coastal city. They are mainly employed in the
service trades, building and township businesses.
</P>
<P>
A survey here showed that the transient work force aged between
16 to 50 consisted of surplus farm labors from Hebei, Shandong,
Henan, Anhui, Sichuan and northeast China provinces. The
population of that category topped one million for the first time
last year.
</P>
<P>
Urbanization has created the most job opportunities for migrant
workers, the survey said. A construction worker earns 20 yuan a
day, and a skilled laborer can make up to 40 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Now, housing building and decoration and company security are
among the emerging lucrative markets for migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
With their tolerance for hard and tiring work, and their
willingness to accept comparatively low salaries, migrant workers
have secured a large part of the job availabilities in the service
sector.
</P>
<P>
The survey estimated that migrant workers spent 2.3 billion
yuan of their earnings in the city annually, which is based on an
average monthly consumption of 180 yuan per person.
</P>
<P>
However, the migrant workforce is also responsible for 35
percent of the crimes in Tianjin for the past three years. To curb
this, the municipal government has worked to improve personnel
management and training of migrant workers.

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Market Enjoys Fast Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer market saw
speedier growth in the first two months of this year with sales
volume of consumer goods hitting 576.78 billion yuan (about 70
billion U.S.dollars), surging 10.9 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Statistics said today that the growth
rate of sales volume between January and February was three
percentage points higher than that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales volume in January stood at 296.29 billion yuan, climbing
11.3 percent on an annual basis, and that of February amounted to
280.49 billion, up 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The catering industry has maintained its strong growth momentum
in the past two months, with business volume jumping 19.5 percent
to 60.51 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
During that period, sales of consumer goods in urban areas
enjoyed a faster growth than in regions at or below county level,
the bureau reported.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the bureau attributed the booming consumer market
to the spending spree brought about by festivals and holidays in
the first two months, mainly the New Year's Day and the Spring
Festival, as well as the state's policy of stimulating domestic
demand.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Shows Signs of Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China has shown thriving scenes since the
establishment of the SAR government and will have a promising
future, a senior legislator in Macao said.
</P>
<P>
The fine scenes can be seen in the aspects of improved public
security, economic resurgence and booming tourism, according to
Tong Chi Kin, a senior member of the Macao Legislative Council and
spokesman for the Executive Council of the Macao SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Tong made the remarks in a recent meeting with a group of
people from the Hong Kong SAR of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the establishment of the Macao SAR
government, the situation of public security has been greatly
improved and the number of criminal cases has dropped obviously.
Over the past three months, local residents can feel that public
security has turned for the better.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the morale of the police is raised under the
SAR government rather than the Portuguese rule. They have become
more efficient in cracking criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
As long as the police make more efforts, they will surely be
able to live up to the expectations of local residents and
tourists, Tong Chi Kin said.
</P>
<P>
The economy has also shown signs of recovering. More business
opportunities have come, internal consumption market tends to be
booming, export maintains steady growth and unemployment rate
begins to go down.
</P>
<P>
The legislator noted that recently two companies from Hong Kong
have moved their headquarters to Macao, one pharmaceutical factory
will be put into production soon, and a foreign bank is going to
open a branch in the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the SAR government is improving its
administrative efficiency to offer investors better services, Tong
Chi Kin said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to tourism, the number of tourists in the first
month of the year increased about 20 percent over that in the same
month of last year.
</P>
<P>
What's more important, Tong said, Macao's unique cultural
features are attracting more tourists in addition to the
traditional gambling business.
</P>
<P>
As the income from tourism is an important part of government
revenue in Macao, the SAR government will try to make more people
around the world acquire more favorable knowledge about Macao.
</P>
<P>
Now the government has set up tourism offices in 14 big cities
all over the world, and more shall be set up to better promote
Macao's tourism, Tong Chi Kin said.

<HEADLINE> Another Active Fault in Wellington Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to a press release issued Friday by the Institute of
Geological and Nuclear Sciences (GNS), a New Zealand crown
research institute, the Otaki Forks Fault, as it has been named,
runs for 70 kilometers between Upper Hutt in the Wellington region
to the Mangahao River valley east of Levin.
</P>
<P>
Geologists had long been curious about the suspicious-looking
surface feature of unclear origin, but until this year it had not
been subjected to field studies.
</P>
<P>
Geologists John Begg and Russ Van Dissen of GNS studied the
feature to find out if it was active fault, and to assess the size
and frequency of earthquakes it could generate.
</P>
<P>
By digging a trench across the feature, they found evidence
that it had ruptured either two or three times in less than 10,000
years,each time producing a large earthquake.
</P>
<P>
"The fault has produced horizontal displacements of several
meters which means it's capable of generating an earthquake of
magnitude seven or greater," Van Dissen said.
</P>
<P>
"Our assessment is that it ranks with the Ohariu Fault, west of
Wellington, in terms of its ability to produce a major earthquake
every 1,000 to 4,000 years," he added.
</P>
<P>
Further field studies would be needed to determine if the Otaki
Forks Fault ruptured along its entire length, or if sections
ruptured independently, Van Dissen said.
</P>
<P>
The discovery brings to seven the number of major faults in the
Wellington region, all capable of generating an earthquake of
magnitude seven or greater. In addition, there are at least 20 "
second order" faults also capable of producing a damaging
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The major faults in the Wellington region are the Wellington
Fault, Shepherds Gully Fault, Ohariu Fault, Northern Ohariu Fault,
Wairarapa Fault, and the Otaki Forks Fault. the Subduction Thrust,
about 30 kilometers below Wellington, is also a potential source
of damaging earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington Fault is the most active of the surface faults
with a recurrence interval of about 600 years. It last ruptured
between 400 and 500 years ago.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Allen Iverson was suspended by
Philadelphia 76ers for at least one game for missing the team's
shootaround Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Iverson, who led the NBA scoring standings, was sidelined in
76ers' loss to the Miami Heat Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"I felt I had a better relationship with this organization,"
Iverson said with angry after the game. "I don't think this is
fair at all."
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia owner Pat Croce said Iverson will likely be
suspended for just one game, but coach Larry Brown was more vague.
</P>
<P>
"He missed practice today, but there's a lot more to it," Brown
said. "I've let it go too far. It's just the culmination of a lot
of things."
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Iverson has clashed previously with Brown.
Croce said the All-Star guard missed practices a couple of weeks
ago, but the problem was temporarily resolved after a meeting with
Brown.
</P>
<P>
According to general manager Billy King, Iverson phoned the
team trainer Thursday morning to say he had a headache and wouldn'
t participate the 11 a.m. shootaround. King said a headache wasn't
an adequate excuse.

<HEADLINE> Signs of Self-sustaining Recovery Seen in Japan's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan's economy has shown the first
signs of a self-sustaining recovery since the latest recession
from April 1997, the Economic Planning Agency said Friday in its
monthly report for March.
</P>
<P>
The economy still "continues to improve moderately", but signs
of a self-sustaining recovery have "gradually appeared", said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The recovery was ascribed to a pickup in capital investment,
improvement of corporate returns and removal of inventory burdens,
according to agency officials.
</P>
<P>
It is corporate activities that upgraded the March assessment
and the personal consumption also did some contribution as low
bonuses weighed on household spending, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said the government
is not yet ready to declare that Japan's economy is on a
sustainable recovery path since "The recovery in domestic demand
is still weak."

NAIROBI -- Kenya's economic growth rate slowed to 1.3 percent
in 1999 from 1.8 percent in 1998, an official report has said.
</P>
<P>
In its Monthly Economic Review released Wednesday, the Central
Bank of Kenya said that the economic downturn was attributed to
structural inefficiency and prolonging drought.
</P>
<P>
The central bank forecast the current slowdown to linger in the
short- term due to drought, but to pick up in the second half of
the year, when more abundant rains are expected and current
economic reforms start bearing fruit, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Thursday. (Kenya-Economy)

<HEADLINE> Alert Level Over Mt. Mayon Lowered Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine volcanologists have
lowered to Alert Level 3 the disaster warning over Mt. Mayon after
it exhibited a continuous decline in eruptive parameters since
last week,Philippine News Agency (PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, however, was twice greeted by 1 kilometers
high of billowing ash columns emerging from the crater, the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But volcanologists were fast to confirm it was not eruption-
related, the PNA said, adding that it was brought about by a
sectoral collapse of pyroclastic deposits from the crater that
triggered a mushrooming effect of thick ashes.
</P>
<P>
On March 9, the Phivolcs lowered Mt. Mayon's warning status to
Alert Level Four, after the volcano had a sudden drop in all
parameters of abnormal condition.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, evacuees have been reduced to 27,602 or an
equivalent to 5,596 families, the Albay Provincial Disaster
Management Office said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80,000 people fled foothill villages after the volcano
began its latest series of eruptions on February 24. There have
been no reported casualties.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Diplomacy to Focus on European Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
VIENNA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Austria's diplomatic policies will
focus on promoting and deepening European Union expansion in the
years to come, Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Telling reporters at a press conference, she said she would
conduct responsibly the rotating presidency of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), advancing and
deepening the process of EU enlargement, and quickly handle all
compensation issues generated from World War II.
</P>
<P>
Austria agreed on Wednesday to compensate those Ukrainians who
were forced to work in Austria during World War II.
</P>
<P>
According to a committee's investigation report, about 40,000
out of 240,000 forced laborers still alive are Ukrainians.
</P>
<P>
But prompting and deepening the process of the 15-nation
European group is the top agenda of her work, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero-Waldner noted that the expansion of the bloc is not
only an economic program, but also a program of peace, security
and culture.
</P>
<P>
Austria, located in the heart of Europe, has every reason to
help its east and south neighbors to join the union, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she pointed out that speed and quality are two
important factors in expanding the EU, saying it is necessary to
maintain a certain speed to quicken the access of candidate
nations.
</P>
<P>
But quality should not be neglected, she said,because the
guarantee of expansion quality is the precondition for balancing
the benefits of current and future members of the group.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the far-right Freedom Party's attitude toward the
EU's enlargement, Ferrero-Waldner replied that as a partner of the
two-party coalition government, it will act under the coalition's
plan.
</P>
<P>
Austria has been diplomatically isolated by other European
countries for allowing the Freedom Party, headed by Jorg Haider
who is notorious for remarks belittling Nazi employment policies,
to enter the government last month.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's GDP Expected to Grow by 0.2 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's central bank
predicted in its annual report that the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) is expected to grow by 0.2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The central Bank, Bank Indonesia, said production activities
had already started to recover.
</P>
<P>
It cited in particular the processing industries, services,
electricity, gas and drinking water and agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
It admitted, however, that the economic recovery process was
still sensitive to any socio-political upheavals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a memorandum of economic and financial policies
signed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the government
issued in January this year, Indonesia's economy is predicted to
grow by 1-2 percent in 1999/2000 fiscal year ending on March 31,
2000 and then strengthening to the 3-4 percent during the fiscal
year 2000(April-December).
</P>
<P>
The central bank stated that the country's foreign debt dropped
by 6.3 percent this year to 141.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Private debt decreased by 21.5 percent while state debt
increased by 12.5 percent, the central bank said in its annual
report published by the Antara News Agency here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although total foreign debt had decreased, the report said, the
burden of repaying the principals and interest remained heavy and
hampered the recovery of export activities.
</P>
<P>
It further said foreign debt settlement had been relatively
slow except in the case of banks' and government's debts.
</P>
<P>
Only up to 14.7 percent of 23.2 billion U.S. dollars in non-
banks' private debts had been restructured.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, restructuring of government debts had been
quite successful reaching 79.8 percent of 4.7 billion U.S. dollars
expected to be restructured this year.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Rejects U.S. Report on Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a press release available here Friday, the Myanmar Foreign
Ministry said that Myanmar regrets over the report on its labor
conditions which in no way represents the true situation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. report charges that Myanmar uses forced labor with
impunity to support tourism and for commercial ventures of the
military.
</P>
<P>
The press release also refuted U.S. accusation of use of forced
labor by Myanmar in military operations, saying that no major
military operations have taken place in recent years since 17 anti-
government armed groups have returned to the legal fold and peace
and stability prevail all over the country.
</P>
<P>
The press release turned down the allegation that children are
used in Myanmar as human minesweepers and shields, saying that
there is no need to dignify them with a response.
</P>
<P>
The press release blamed the U.S. report of ignoring the
positive actions taken by the Myanmar government in its
legislation regarding labor, citing the order of the country's
Ministry of Home Affairs issued on May 14, 1999 forbidding the use
of forced labor.
</P>
<P>
The press release charged that the U.S. report, which has
nothing to do with labor, is politically motivated, timed to
coincide with the meetings of the International Labor Organization
Governing Body and Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar announced dissociation of itself in June
1999 from a resolution adopted at the 87th session of the
International Labor Conference which accused the country of
widespread use of forced labor and restriction of freedom of
association.

BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of the
report on the Implementation of the 1999 Plan for National
Economic and Social Development and on the Draft 2000 Plan for
National Economic and Social Development delivered by Zeng Peiyan,
minister in charge of the State Development Planning Commission,
at the Third Session of the Ninth National People's Congress on
March 6, 2000:
</P>
<P>
Fellow Deputies, I have been entrusted by the State Council to
report now to this session on the Implementation of the 1999 Plan
for National Economic and Social Development and on the Draft 2000
Plan for National Economic and Social Development. These are
presented for your examination and approval, and also for comments

<P>
I. Implementation of the 1999 Plan for National Economic and
Social Development
</P>
<P>
The people of all ethnic groups in China worked hard together
with one mind under the correct leadership of the Communist Party
of China over the past year. They surmounted all types of
obstacles in the way forward to score fresh achievements in reform
and opening up and in the modernization drive. The national
economy witnessed sustained, rapid and sound development, and all
social undertakings progressed in an all-round way. On the whole,
the 1999 plan was carried out satisfactorily and the major
regulatory targets for national economic and social development
were basically attained.
</P>
<P>
The national economy continued to show good momentum of
development, and there were improvements in the quality of growth
and performance of the economy. In 1999 China's GDP hit 8.2054
trillion yuan, representing an increase of 7.1% over the previous
year. The production conditions for agriculture continued to see
improvement, and important advances were made in restructuring
efforts. The capacity to fight against natural calamities was
further strengthened. Efforts to develop water-saving irrigation
and dry farming were stepped up. The area of cultivated land
making use of improved varieties of crops and advanced, applicable
technology has been constantly expanding. About 4.67 million
hectares were added to the area of land applying 18 practical
agricultural techniques, including the casting of rice seedlings,
wheat mulching, high-quality early rice and canola. Grain output
remained stable at a relatively high level of 500 million tons. (

<P>
Total revenue in the local budgets in 1999 came to 967.5
billion yuan, or 109.9 percent of the budgeted figure. This figure
includes 558 billion yuan in revenue collected by local
authorities, or 101 percent of the budgeted figure, and 409.5
billion yuan in subsidies granted to local authorities by the
central government, or 124.9 percent of the budgeted figure. Total
expenditures in the local budgets amounted to 963.7 billion yuan,
or 109.5 percent of the budgeted figure. This figure includes 903.
9 billion yuan of expenditures in the local budgets, or 110.2
percent of the budgeted figure, and 59.8 billion yuan turned over
to the central government, or 100 percent of the budgeted figure.
Total local revenue exceeded expenditures, leaving a surplus of 3.
8 billion yuan. This figure represents the overall balance among
all regions of the country. Some regions are still experiencing
serious financial problems because of uneven development in the
country.
</P>
<P>
From the implementation of the central and local budgets as
mentioned above, total revenue for the whole country in 1999 came
to 1.1377 trillion yuan, or 105.3 percent of the budgeted amount.
Expenditures for the whole country totaled 1.3136 trillion yuan,
or 104.2 percent of the budgeted figure. Total expenditures
exceeded revenue, heaving a deficit of 175.9 billion yuan. These
figures may change a little when the final calculations are made
for the central and local budgets.

<P>
To successfully implement the budgets for 1999, the State
Council and local people's governments at all levels concentrated
on accomplishing the following tasks.
</P>
<P>
1. Revenue collection and management was strengthened to ensure
a steady increase of revenue. Total national revenue for 1999
exceeded one trillion yuan, an increase of 150.1 billion yuan over
that of the previous year, or an increase of 15.2 percent. The
ratio of revenue to GDP increased from 11.6 percent in 1997 and 12.
4 percent in 1998 to 13.9 percent in 1999. This is a result of the
steady growth of the national economy, the effective operation of
the financial and taxation system and the continuous improvement
of tax collection and management. Total receipts from tariffs,
value-added tax on imports and sales tax grew by 70.6 billion yuan
over the 1998 figure, an increase of 81.2 percent. Total revenue
from the stamp tax on securities transactions grew by 4 billion
yuan, an increase of 19.4 percent and 10 billion yuan of overdue
taxes were cleared up. The revenue increases from the above
factors totaled 84.6 billion yuan, accounting for 56.4 percent of
the revenue increase in 1999. Total revenue from domestic value-
added and sales taxes, which are closely connected to enterprise
operation, increased by only 5.8 percent, and revenue from the
business tax, only 5.7 percent, both lower than the rate of
economic growth. This shows that the sharp increase of revenue in
1999 did not put a heavy tax burden on enterprises and that the
tax burden borne by the Chinese enterprises remained below the
world's average level. In addition, we conscientiously examined
arbitrary charges and eliminated a total of 388 administrative
charges and contributions to government-controlled funds which
added to the burden on enterprises and involved about 18 billion
yuan.

2. A pro-active fiscal policy was conscientiously implemented
and the role of state finance in macro-control was utilized. First,
local authorities and the departments concerned continued to do a
good job in selecting projects to be funded by government bonds
and in controlling the use of funds. Projects were selected on the
basis of the investment orientation specified by the State Council
and no redundant projects were launched. Expenditures in the
budget and the plan for the use of loans to local authorities were
carefully arranged, and supervision and examination of capital
utilization were tightened to ensure that funds raised through
government bonds were used effectively. Second, the policy on
personal income distribution was revised. The basic cost of living
for employees laid off from state-owned enterprises, unemployment
insurance benefits and subsistence allowances for urban residents
were raised by a big margin. In addition, wages and salaries of
employees in government departments and institutions and pensions
for retirees were increased, and pension standards for retirees
from state-owned enterprises and benefits for some disabled
servicemen and family members of revolutionary martyrs who enjoy
special treatment from the government were raised. More than 84
million employees and residents benefited from this policy.
Financial departments and other departments concerned formulated
the plan, raised funds and implemented the policy in a short
period of time. In most of the areas, employees and residents
received the added payments before National Day on October 1.
Considering that some localities were experiencing financial
difficulties and that insufficient funds were allocated in the
budget in the beginning of the fiscal year, the central government
made transfer payments totaling 34.3 billion yuan from the amount
of revenue above the budgetary target to 24 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities directly under the central government
to enable them to carry out readjustments in income distribution.
The policy was warmly welcomed by cadres and employees, especially
people in the low-income bracket, and its implementation
stimulated consumer demand and created a joyful atmosphere for the
whole nation as they celebrated the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China and the return of Macao
to the motherland.

<P>
Clear progress was made in reforming state-owned enterprises
and turning around the operation of loss-making enterprises, and
we continued to deepen all other major reforms. The process of
separating the functions of the government from those of
enterprises was accelerated. Efforts to merge some enterprises,
declare some enterprises bankrupt and reorganize some industries
were intensified. A large number of new large enterprise groups
were formed in the defense-related, nonferrous metals and
telecommunications industries. Tangible results were seen in the
drive to turn around the operation of state-owned enterprises.
Losses of state-owned enterprises and of enterprises with
controlling share held by the state decreased by 15.9% over the
previous year. The textile, building materials, nonferrous metals
and railway industries took their operations out of the red and
into the black. Over 4.9 million workers laid off from state-owned
enterprises found new jobs, with 93% of those who did not
registered with re-employment service centers, 97% of whom
received basic cost of living allowances. We basically ensured
that all retired people of enterprises received their pensions on
time and in full. Reform of the system of medical insurance for
urban workers continued.
</P>
<P>
Price relationships were further rationalized. We adjusted
prices for railway freight transport, medical services, postal and
telecommunications services and raised public housing rents and
charges and fees for higher education, urban water supply and
environmental protection. All this promoted the development of
basic industries and improvement in social undertakings. We
decreased electricity fees for high power-consuming enterprises
and lowered electricity rates in rural areas. We also rectified
import and export charges by appropriately lowering some fees that
were too high, thereby reducing the burden on export enterprises.

Continued progress was registered in the reform of the grain
and cotton distribution system. We implemented a policy of
purchasing at protective prices all the surplus grain farmers had
to sell, paying good prices for good quality. This protected the
interests of the farmers and promoted adjustment of the production
pattern. State-owned grain purchase and marketing enterprises
continued to sell grain at a profit and carried out closed
operation of their grain purchase funds. In addition, they
improved their management and operations and effected a turnaround
in their previous very poor performance. Reform of the cotton
distribution system proceeded smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Imports and exports grew fairly rapidly and there was continued
improvement in the utilization of foreign funds. We stuck to a
strategy of success through quality and diversification of market
outlets, working energetically to expand exports by granting more
export credits, raising comprehensive tax refunds for exports and
giving more authority to producing enterprises to independently
engage in export. As a result, the slump in exports was reversed
with a high growth rate in the second half of 1999. For the year
the total volume of China's imports and exports reached $360.7
billion, an increase of 11.3% over the previous year. Exports
accounted for $194.9 billion, a rise of 6.1%. Imports amounted to $
165.8 billion, up 18.2%. The pattern of exports improved
constantly. Exports of mechanical and electrical products
increased by 14.7%, representing a net rise of $9.9 billion which
accounted for 88% of the net rise in total exports.
</P>
<P>
Some $56.3 billion in foreign funds was used, a decrease of 3.9%
from the previous year. Foreign investment totaled $45.4 billion,
including $40.4 billion of direct foreign investment and ranking
China first among the developing countries. There was a marked
increase in the number of fund- and technology-intensive projects
encouraged by the state, with an increase in the size of
individual projects. More multinational corporations invested and
established production facilities in China.

Development of science, technology and education was sped up
and all social undertakings made comprehensive progress. More
progress was made in deepening the reform of the management system
for science and technology. As a result of this reform, 80% of the
242 scientific research institutes affiliated to ten state
administrations were restructured and incorporated into
enterprises. Our support for research topics in basic research,
industry-specific technology, major technology and high technology
was strengthened. The launch of the National Key Basic Research
Development Project and the Technological Innovation Fund for
Small and Medium-Sized Science and Technology Enterprises went
smoothly. Progress was made in major special industrial projects
such as the development of digital high definition TV, application
of rare-earth minerals and biotechnology. The success of the test
mission of the Shenzhou spacecraft marked a breakthrough in China'
s research on manned space flight.
</P>
<P>
Fresh achievements were scored in reform and development of all
forms of education at all levels. We increased enrollment for
regular and adult higher education, combining the strategy of
building the country through science, technology and education
with the need to boost domestic demand. In 1999, colleges and
universities enrolled 1.6 million students, an increase of 47.4%
over the previous year. We vigorously supported the improvement of
conditions for operating schools offering elementary education in
economically depressed areas. Some 80% of the country's populated
areas have now made a nine-year compulsory education basically
universal and eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged
residents. Education designed to raise the overall quality of
students was promoted. Efforts to develop new disciplines in
colleges and universities were strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive progress was made in culture, art, the press,
publishing, radio, film, TV, social sciences, family planning,
public health, sports and other social undertakings. Socialist
cultural and ethical development continued to gather in strength.
The natural population growth rate was 0.877%. The project to
extend radio and TV coverage to every village went into full swing,
enabling about 40 million rural residents to enjoy radio and TV
broadcasts in their homes for the first time. The project to
improve the health of residents in poor rural areas was launched.

Market sales began to pick up and people's living standards
continued to improve. Measures such as expanding personal consumer
credit, increasing the number of legal holidays and improving the
consumption environment helped boost consumption demand so that in
the latter half of 1999 market sales began to recover. Retail
sales of consumer goods for the country totaled 3.1135 trillion
yuan in 1999, an increase of 6.8% over the previous year, or an
increase of 10.1% in real terms after allowing for price decreases.
On July 1, 1999, the incomes of lower-income urban residents and
government employees were raised. In the year the per capita
disposable income of urban dwellers was 5,854 yuan, an increase of
9.3% in real terms over the previous year. The per capita floor
space for urban residents was 9.6 square meters, an increase of 0.
6 square meters. The registered unemployment rate was 3.1% in
cities and towns. Measures were taken to lighten the burden on
farmers and efforts were made to increase their income. The per
capita net income for rural residents was 2,210 yuan, an increase
of 3.8% in real terms. Fresh progress was registered in anti-
poverty work and about 8 million more poverty-stricken people now
have adequate food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
All these great achievements of 1999 created a sound
environment for celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding
of New China and welcoming the return of Macao to our motherland.
They also strengthened confidence both at home and abroad in the
development of China's economy. Experience has shown that the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Jiang Zemin
at its core is entirely capable of dealing with all types of
complicated situations, keeping the overall situation under
control and leading the people of all ethnic groups in a united
struggle to blaze new trails, score more achievements and bring
about sustained, rapid and sound development of the national
economy.

4. Efforts to formulate financial laws and regulations were
stepped up to strengthen supervision and management and promote
the administration of finance in accordance with the law.
Following the principles of managing state affairs and handling
financial affairs according to law, we accelerated the pace of
financial legislation. The Accounting Law was revised in 1999 and
over 60 financial rules and regulations were formulated, including
the Interim Rules on Punishment of Violations of the Law and
Indiscipline in Implementing the Central Budget. Greater efforts
were made to examine the special funds financed through government
bonds, subsidies for preventing serious floods, funds for
construction of water conservancy projects, extrabudgetary funds
of departments under the central government, funds for fighting
poverty and social security funds. A sampling survey was organized
to examine the quality of accounting data of one hundred alcoholic
beverage producers and the annual accounting statements of state-
owned enterprises audited by intermediary organs. A number of
cases involving violations of financial laws, rules and
regulations and financial indiscipline were uncovered and the
persons involved were prosecuted. Taxation and Customs authorities
and other departments responsible for tax collection and
management stepped up their efforts to levy taxes according to law
and severely dealt with acts of tax evasion and tax fraud.  We
conducted a review and rectification of public accounting firms
and assets appraisal offices. By the end of December 1999 the work
of restructuring to separate them from relevant departments had
been basically completed.

Reviewing the implementation of the budget for 1999, we are
also fully aware that problems still exist in our financial work
and the implementation of the budget which cannot be neglected.
First, violations of regulations and criminal activities are still
serious in financial and economic work, and financial and economic
order is chaotic. It is very common that laws already enacted are
not fully observed or enforced and law-breakers are not prosecuted.
Second, funding cannot be fully guaranteed and budgets at all
levels are under great pressure, especially in some counties and
townships with great financial difficulties. Some government
departments and institutions fail to pay their employees on time
and funding for some items that should be guaranteed are not made
available. Third, efforts to readjust the pattern of expenditures,
though already initiated, are made too slowly and too
ineffectively and government finance is still taking on too many
matters. The problem of providing unnecessary funds to some items
and failing to fund other necessary items has yet to be
fundamentally solved. On the basis of steady economic development,
all these problems must be gradually solved by deepening the
reform of finance and taxation, improving the financial and
economic system and the functions of finance, standardizing the
economic order and tightening financial supervision and management.


II. The Draft Central and Local Budgets for 2000
</P>
<P>
We are faced with many favorable conditions in economic
development this year. The international economic environment as a
whole is becoming good and the world economy and trade should
continue to grow. The further implementation of a number of policy
measures for boosting domestic demand and the deepening of reform
and opening up should have a positive effect on the growth of the
national economy. The breakthrough in negotiations for China's
entry into the World Trade Organization will greatly promote a
shift in the mode of growth in China's economy and trade and
improve the quality of growth. However, we are also faced with
many difficulties and problems. There are still some hidden
problems in world economic development, competition in the
international market is becoming more fierce and effective demand
is weak in the operation of the national economy. The key and
basic approach to solving these problems is faster development. "
Development is an absolute principle." The objective economic
reality compels us to intensify efforts to implement policy
measures designed to promote economic development and continue to
implement a pro-active fiscal policy.

1. Continuing to strengthen infrastructure development.
Investment needs to be increased to ensure that infrastructure
projects funded by government bonds over the past two years are
completed as soon as possible and begin yielding economic returns.
More needs to be invested in preparation for the development of
the western region and for a number of other key projects which
have a direct bearing on the growth of the national economy.
Investment in capital construction from the central budget will
total 89.3 billion yuan (including subsidies for local authorities)
.
</P>
<P>
2. Intensifying efforts to support the reform and development
of state-owned enterprises. We should continue to do better in
technological upgrading of key industries, enterprises, products
and industrial processes. Funds and subsidies on interest payment
from the central budget for technological upgrading of enterprises
will be 16.5 billion yuan (including subsidies for local
authorities).
</P>
<P>
3. Investing more in social security and fully implementing the
policy to readjust income distribution introduced in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Funds earmarked for this purpose from the central budget for
2000 will total 70.7 billion yuan, including 3.7 billion yuan to
fund subsistence allowances for workers laid off from enterprises
under the central government, 5 billion yuan allocated through
transfer payments to make up for the shortage in budgetary funding
for subsistence allowances for workers laid off from state-owned
enterprises in the old industrial bases and the central and
western regions which are in financial straits, 8.8 billion yuan
to make up for the insufficient budgetary funding of old-age
pensions for retirees from coal, nonferrous metal, military and
other industries which are in financial difficulty and 53.2
billion yuan as subsidies for some areas to raise the social
security benefits and increase the wages and salaries of employees
in government departments and institutions.
</P>
<P>
4. Stepping up efforts to increase investment in education,
science, technology and agriculture and ensure that the rate of
increase is higher than that of the regular revenue. The
proportion of expenditures for education in the central budget
will be increased by one percentage point over the level in 1999.
A total of 16.5 billion yuan will be allocated for education, an
increase of 29.7 percent over that of the previous year. Funds for
science and technology will be 11.2 billion yuan, an increase of
14.1 percent over the 1999 figure. Expenditures for agricultural
administration and the support of agricultural production will
come to 7.9 billion yuan, an increase of 14.8 percent over the
1999 figure.
</P>
<P>
5. Appropriately increasing expenditures for state security.
Since the army, armed police force and procuratorial, judicial and
public security organs no longer engage in business or run
enterprises, an additional 5.6 billion yuan will be provided to
cover the necessary expenditures for the performance of their
functions. Expenditures for national defense will total 120.5
billion yuan, an increase of 12.7 percent over the 1999 figure,
the same as the increase of recent years. These funds will mainly
cover the increased salaries and allowances for officers and men
in the army as well as expenditures for troops stationed in Macao.
The GDP in 2000 is expected to maintain a growth rate of about
seven percent. This will lay a foundation for increasing revenue.
At the same time, we are clear that there are still some factors
which will restrict the growth of revenue. First, Customs
authorities tightened supervision and stepped up their efforts to
crack down on smuggling, resulting in an exceedingly high increase
of 81.2 percent in import duties in 1999. The figure for this year
will remain basically the same. Second, the state lowered the
interest rates for loans seven times and the business tax rate for
banking and insurance, and consumer demand in the domestic market
is weak. Revenue from business taxes may be on the decline. Third,
we will adopt the policy of tax readjustment to boost investment
demand, specifically, temporarily halting collection of fixed
asset investment regulatory taxes and partial reduction or
exemption of enterprise income taxes for investment in domestic
equipment purchase. This will result in reduction of some revenue.
Fourth, to encourage exports and expand international cooperation,
total export tax refunds for this year will amount to 80 billion
yuan, an increase of 27.8 percent over the 1999 figure. This will
directly reduce revenue.

The draft central and local budgets for the year 2000 break
down as follows: revenue totals 1.2338 trillion yuan, an increase
of 96.1 billion yuan, or 8.4 percent over the actual figure for
1999, and expenditures total 1.4637 trillion yuan, an increase of
150 billion yuan, or 11.4 percent over the actual figure for 1999.
</P>
<P>
It should be explained that the central budget this year was
prepared in accordance with the Budget Law and the Regulations for
Implementation of the Budget Law. While examining the report on
the final accounts for the central budget and the audit report on
the central finance for 1998 last June, the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress proposed preparation of detailed
budget items and departmental budgets. The Ministry of Finance
established a special group for this purpose.  By soliciting
opinions from the departments concerned, the Ministry worked out a
plan for improving the preparation of the central budget for 2000
and suggested that budgetary management be tightened. The State
Council approved implementation of this plan. The central budget
for this year was prepared two months earlier than in past years.
In years to come, formulation of the central budget will be
gradually completed even more in advance. Based on current
classification of revenue and expenditures, the budget for this
year was prepared in as much detail as possible. Departmental
budgeting is the usual practice in countries with market economies
and is also the orientation of reform of China's budget
preparation. This reform involves many departments and much
essential work and is technically difficult. To ensure steady
progress in the reform, we selected the Ministry of Education, the
Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Science and Technology
and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security on the basis of the
full cooperation of all departments under the central government
and the trial preparation of departmental budgets and asked the
selected departments to submit their departmental budgets to the
National People's Congress for your examination and approval. As
the preliminary reform of the method of budget preparation is
being introduced this year, the classifications and quotas will
need to be further revised.

Revenue and Expenditures, Stepping up Efforts to Handle Financial
Affairs in Accordance with the Law and Striving to Implement the
Budget for 2000.

<P>
On the basis of an overall analysis and assessment of revenue
and expenditures in 2000, the State Council prepared a draft
central budget for 2000. Total revenue in the central budget for
2000 is 690.4 billion yuan, 50.8 billion yuan more than the actual
figure of the previous year, or an increase of 7.9 percent. This
figure includes 630.6 billion yuan collected by the central
government, 50.8 billion yuan more than the actual figure for 1999,
or an increase of 8.8 percent. Local governments will turn over to
the central government 59.8 billion yuan, the same as the 1999
figure. Expenditures in the central budget total 920.3 billion
yuan (including payments of interest on debts), 101 billion yuan
more than the actual figure for 1999 and an increase of 12.3
percent. A total of 480.1 billion yuan of these expenditures will
be incurred at the central level, 70.3 billion yuan more than
actually spent last year and an increase of 17.2 percent.
Subsidies to local authorities total 440.2 billion yuan, 30.7
billion yuan more than the actual figure for 1999 and an increase
of 7.5 percent. A deficit of 229.9 billion yuan will be left after
setting revenue against expenditures. It is worth noting that the
increase in the deficit in the central budget this year mainly
results from reform of the method of preparing the budget. A sum
of 74.9 billion yuan in expenditures covering interest on
government bonds, which was originally not listed in the regular
expenditures in the central budget and not reflected in the
deficit, is being listed in the regular expenditures in the
central budget and is reflected in the deficit of the same year.
This does not mean that more government bonds will be issued. This
helps fully reflect expenditures in the central budget and makes
it easier to monitor and control debts. This also conforms to
common international practice. According to the method of
calculation used last year, the deficit in the central budget
would be 155 billion yuan, 24.7 billion yuan less than the 1999
figure. The central budget for 2000 prepared according to the dual-
budget system is as follows: Total regular revenue in the central
budget is 694.2 billion yuan and regular expenditures in the
central budget total 641.5 billion yuan. A surplus of 52.7 billion
yuan is left after setting revenue against expenditures and this
amount is to be transferred to the construction budget.  Total
revenue in the central construction budget is 48.9 billion yuan
and expenditures in the central construction budget total 278.8
billion yuan, with expenditures exceeding revenue by 229.9 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Funds to service domestic and foreign debts in the central
budget in 2000 amount to 158.1 billion yuan. The deficit totaling
229.9 billion yuan also has to be covered in the same year. The
central government will issue 50 billion yuan of bonds for local
governments. The government bonds to be issued in 2000 total 438
billion yuan, of which 388 billion yuan will be counted in the
central budget, 16.5 billion yuan more than the 1999 figure. In
addition, total revenue from funds controlled by the central
government for 2000 is 130.3 billion yuan and projected
expenditures for funds controlled by the central government come
to 130.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Total revenue in the local budgets for 2000 amounts to 1.0434
trillion yuan, an increase of 7.8 percent over the actual 1999
figure. Revenue collected by local governments comes to 603.2
billion yuan, 45.2 billion yuan more than the actual figure for
1999 and an increase of 8.1 percent. Subsidies to local
governments from the central budget total 440.2 billion yuan, an
increase of 7.5 percent. Total expenditures in the local budgets
amount to 1.0434 trillion yuan, an increase of 8.3 percent over
the actual figure for 1999. This figure includes expenditures of
983.6 billion yuan in the local budgets, 79.7 billion yuan more
than the actual figure for 1999 and an increase of 8.8 percent.
It also includes 59.8 billion yuan to be turned over to the
central government. Revenue and expenditures are balanced in the
local budgets.

The year 2000 is the final year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and
is crucial to efforts to tackle difficult problems in reforms and
get state-owned enterprises out of their plight. Fulfilling the
financial tasks for this year, making good use of the role of
finance and tightening financial management are crucial to efforts
to maintain sustained, rapid and sound development of the national
economy, accelerate the establishment of a socialist market
economy, attain the second-step strategic objective for the
modernization drive and make a good start for the new century.
</P>

1. Continuing to tighten investment management and taking full
advantage of the macro-control function of finance. The expansion
of investment in infrastructure development over the past two
years has produced the desired results. This fully shows that the
government enjoys advantages in regulating the operation of the
economy under a socialist market economy and that our objectives
are attained. The major reasons for this are that funds are
properly invested, managed and utilized and that projects are
meticulously examined before approval. On the basis of a review of
the experience, funds raised this year through the issuance of
government bonds will still be used according to the direction and
priorities for investment specified by the State Council.  All
projects must be placed under overall planning, rationally
distributed and developed in strict accordance with the proper
procedures for capital construction. In the process of actual
construction, the design should be meticulous, the construction
scientifically carried out and supervision strict to ensure the
quality of projects. We should also conscientiously select
technological transformation projects, take into consideration the
demand of domestic and international markets, prove their
feasibility through scientific analysis and carefully make policy
decisions. These projects should aim at scientific and
technological advances and industrial upgrading. We must ban
disguised redundant projects or projects to blindly expand
production capacity. Through close cooperation with other
departments concerned, financial departments at all levels should
tighten special supervision and examination of funds to prevent
them from being misappropriated or diverted to other purposes. We
must resolutely expose and punish violators once they are
discovered.

2. Strengthening tax collection and management to ensure
sustained and steady increase in revenue. The Fifteenth National
Congress of the Party defined the grand objective of improving
government finance. Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized many times that
"government finance has a direct bearing on the overall interests
of the country" and "improved government finance is an important
condition for ensuring the development of all economic and social
undertakings." An important component of the effort to improve
government finance is to establish a mechanism for ensuring a
steady increase in revenue, promote the administration of taxation
in accordance with the law and strengthen tax collection and
management. Ensuring a steady increase in revenue is a most
important task in terms of efforts to build up the national
strength, increase the overall strength of our country, meet the
needs of reform, development and stability and achieve the
objectives of our pro-active fiscal policy. Therefore, the
principle of "tightening collection and management, plugging up
loopholes, punishing corruption and clearing up overdue taxes"
should be thoroughly implemented, the basic work of tax collection
and management should be strengthened, all laws and regulations on
taxation should be strictly enforced, taxation should be
administered in accordance with the law and all due taxes must be
collected. All local authorities and government departments should
conscientiously implement the Circular of the State Council on
Reversing the Local Policy of First Collecting Taxes and Then
Refunding Taxes. They are not allowed to attract investment
through a policy of first collecting taxes and then refunding
taxes or other means of tax reduction and exemption in violation
of the provisions of tax laws. Moreover, they cannot alter tax
laws or tax policies through any means. They cannot approve tax
deferrals or exemption without authorization or collect "more
taxes than prescribed." We must safeguard the uniformity and
authority of tax laws. Beginning in the year 2000, all local
authorities must cease implementing their policy of first
collecting taxes and then refunding taxes, carefully carry out
inspections and reverse it. Local authorities who refuse to
reverse their policy and continue to apply it without
authorization will lose their transfer payments and special
subsidies from the central budget and the persons concerned will
be investigated for responsibility. We should improve and
strengthen the means of tax collection and management, deepen the
reform in this regard, tighten examination, severely deal with all
acts of tax evasion and tax fraud and particularly take resolute
measures to severely punish the criminal gangs which engage in
smuggling, trafficking in smuggled goods and tax evasion through
internal and external collaboration. Governments at all levels
should redouble their efforts to support the work of the
departments responsible for the collection and management of
revenue.

3. Tightening budgetary management and steadily promoting the
reform of the budget system. An important task of governments and
financial departments at all levels is to conscientiously
implement the Decision of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress on Tightening the Examination and Supervision of
the Central Budget. As soon as the central and local budgets are
approved by the National People's Congress, finance departments at
all levels should promptly examine and approve the budgets of all
departments, and these departments should promptly examine and
approve the budgets of their subordinate units. All government
departments applying to obtain government funds must follow the
proper budgetary procedures, prepare the budget before spending
and strictly implement the methods for expenditure management. The
expenditures of all departments and their subordinate units should
be classified in set budget items, with no shifting of funds
between different budget items.
</P>
<P>
Reform of the budget system is an important component of the
current reform of finance and an objective requirement for
implementing the principles of ruling the country by law and
ensuring that the government performs its official duties in
accordance with the law. Moreover, it is a necessary requirement
for strengthening economic and budgetary supervision and an
effective means of building a clean and honest government through
improvement of the system. The current reform of the budget system
consists of several aspects. First, budget items will be more
detailed and budgets of government departments will be prepared.
We are reviewing experiments in the central budget and gradually
applying the successful practices to other budgets. Beginning in
the year 2000, budget items in local budgets will be more detailed
and government departments will be required to prepare their
budgets. Second, we will conduct investigations and studies and
formulate reasonable standards for determining the size of the
staff and expenditures in light of specific conditions. This will
provide an important foundation for preparing budgets and
examining their implementation. Third, a thorough review will be
made of the revenue and expenditures in all departments preparing
budgets, which will lay a good foundation for the reform of budget
preparation. Fourth, on the basis of the notable results obtained
in experimentation with government procurement, we will gradually
expand the range of government procurement to cover purchase of
all office supplies and office equipment, construction of public
facilities and related services. Fifth, we will begin studies on
the implementation of the treasury single account system as a
basic measure to tighten management, combat corruption and build a
clean and honest government.

5. Doing better in social security work and accelerating the
improvement of the social security system. An improved social
security system is an important prerequisite for pushing forward
the reform of state-owned enterprises, an important guarantee for
social stability and an important barometer of economic and social
progress. The priority of the current social security work is to
ensure that the basic cost of living for workers laid off from
state-owned enterprises, pension benefits for retirees from state-
owned enterprises and subsistence allowances for needy urban
residents are distributed on time and in full.

However, we are fully aware that there are still quite a few
conflicts and problems in economic and social development. First,
effective demand is feeble. The pace of increase in fixed asset
investment has slowed. The increase in investment from state
institutions and enterprises dropped from 22.7% in the first
quarter of 1999 to 3.8% in the fourth quarter. Certain factors
held back the growth of consumer spending and restricted the
expansion of consumption fields. In 1999, consumer prices and
retail prices of consumer goods fell by 1.4% and 3% respectively
from the previous year. Second, unemployment pressure has grown.
As of the end of 1999, there were 6.5 million workers laid off
from state-owned enterprises unemployed. There are other
unemployed people who need to find jobs. Fewer people are now
employed in township and village enterprises. There is a great
deal of surplus labor in rural areas that needs to be absorbed
elsewhere. Third, the growth of rural incomes has slowed. Due to
changes in the balance of supply and demand, there was a constant
drop in the prices of agricultural products and a decline in the
performance of township and village enterprises. The per capita
net income of rural residents increased by only 48 yuan in 1999.
Fourth, anomalies in the economic structure remain outstanding.
The problem of excess production capacity for ordinary products is
still serious. Some enterprises are unable to adapt to changes in
market demand and have weak development and innovation capacity.
They are unable to replace older generation of products with new
ones fast enough and are hardly competitive. Fifth, the
environment continues to deteriorate in some regions and pollution
is serious in some cities. We will take effective measures and
work hard to solve these problems.

II. Regulatory Targets and Major Tasks for Economic and Social
Development in the Year 2000
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 marks the turn of the century and is the final
year for implementing the Ninth Five-Year Plan. Success in
economic work for this year will have a major impact on our effort
to attain all of the strategic targets for the second stage of our
modernization drive and to move on to reach the targets for the
third stage.
</P>
<P>
The general requirements for economic work in the year 2000 are
as follows. We should follow the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory
and the Party's basic line and conscientiously implement the
guiding principles set at the Fifteenth National Congress of the
Party and the third and fourth plenary sessions of the Fifteenth
Party Central Committee. We should continue to implement all the
policy measures adopted by the central authorities for promoting
reform and development, giving priority to the reform and
development of state-owned enterprises, economic restructuring,
scientific and technological progress and expansion of domestic
demand. We should further stabilize the position of agriculture as
the foundation of the economy, making diligent efforts to
restructure agriculture and the rural economy and using every
possible means to increase the farmers' incomes. Taking the reform
of state-owned enterprises as the key link, we should
energetically promote improved performance and the establishment
of a modern enterprise system. We shall continue to follow a
proactive fiscal policy, take more advantage of the role of
monetary policy and make comprehensive use of macro-control means
such as taxation and pricing. Efforts to develop infrastructure
should be strengthened. No time should be lost in speeding up
technological upgrading and scientific and technological
innovation. Great efforts should be made to expand consumption. We
should open China wider to the outside world, vigorously work to
increase imports and exports and raise the level of foreign fund
utilization. We should improve the social security system, pay
close attention to poverty alleviation programs, step up efforts
to fight poverty and further improve people's standard of living.
We should balance reform, development and stability to ensure
sustained, rapid and sound development of the national economy and
promote all-around social progress so that we can greet the new
century with outstanding achievements.

7. Strengthening financial supervision and management and
rectifying financial and economic order. The current chaos in
financial and economic order is seriously disrupting the operation
of the economy and giving rise to corruption. Greater efforts must
be made to rectify it. This year we will focus on several tasks.
First, supervision and management of funds should be tightened.
All funds, especially those earmarked for key projects, should be
monitored throughout the process of budgeting, allocation and
utilization, and results of the utilization of these funds should
be reported. Leading cadres concerned must bear the responsibility
if these funds are misappropriated, wasted or diverted to other
purposes without authorization. Second, we should continue to
implement the central government's regulations on managing
administrative fees, fines and confiscated funds according to the
principle of "separating revenue from expenditures". We should
take the initiative to strengthen budgetary management and
incorporate all extrabudgetary funds into special accounts. We
should fully implement a method whereby "relevant organs make out
invoices for administrative fees and fines which must be paid to a
bank account under the unified management of a government finance
department", to ensure that those who determine the amounts of
fees and fines or make out invoices cannot collect them or use
them themselves. Third, the Accounting Law should be
conscientiously implemented. The basic accounting work and the
quality of accounting data should be improved. An accountant
assignment system and a chief accountant system should be
implemented to tighten accounting supervision and severely deal
with the acts of falsifying bills, accounts and audit reports.
Fourth, we should lose no time in rectifying public accounting and
auditing firms and other intermediary organs to standardize their
business operation and strengthen self-discipline to provide
objective, fair and highly efficient services to the public. Fifth,
financial laws should be further improved and enforcement of these
laws should be strengthened. The system of administrative review
for finance departments should be improved. We should establish
and implement a responsibility system for enforcement of financial
laws and an evaluation system. Greater efforts should be made to
ensure that financial affairs are handled in accordance with the
law.
</P>

8. Adhering to the principle of hard work, plain living and
building the country through diligence and thrift, fostering the
concept of frugality and utilizing funds in an economical manner.
Hard work, diligence and frugality are the fine traditions of the
Chinese nation and embody the Party's fine style of work formed in
the long revolutionary struggles and economic development.

<P>
Guided by Marxist financial and economic theory, in political
and historical perspectives, the three generations of leaders of
our Party represented by Comrades Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and
Jiang Zemin have always stressed the needs for hard work, plain
living, building the country through diligence and thrift and
being economical in all endeavors. Our financial resources are
insufficient, and increase in revenue falls far short of the needs
of our modernization drive. Some local governments even cannot
guarantee funds for performing their normal functions, but such
phenomena as ostentatious and extravagant behaviors and pleasure-
seeking are still prevalent in some localities and departments.
Budgetary funds are seriously lost and wasted. More and more
luxury hotels, office buildings and auditoriums are being built
and the trend is toward even greater opulence. Public money is
being lavished for high consumption. This has aroused strong
resentment among the people.  Therefore, stressing the principle
of hard work, plain living and building the country through
diligence and thrift is an important measure to alleviate the
imbalance between funding supply and demand and an important way
of cementing ties between the Party and the government on the one
hand and the people on the other and carrying forward the Party's
fine traditions. We must stress the need to be politically minded
and will adhere to this principle for a long time to come. To
ensure the implementation of this principle in terms of systems
and mechanisms, we should reform the budgetary management system
and improve the financial supervision system. Financial
departments at all levels should allocate funds rationally and
scientifically, tighten financial supervision and management,
resolutely combat extravagance and waste and fight corruption.
They should take the lead in practicing economy in the use of all
funds and use them where they are needed most. Our limited funds
should be used to best advantage in promoting reform, opening up
and the socialist modernization drive.

Fellow Deputies,
</P>
<P>
The financial work this year is arduous. Let us rally closely
around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its
core, hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, adhere
to the Party's basic line, acquire a clear understanding of the
situation and our tasks, seize opportunities, blaze new trails
while forging ahead, and work together with great confidence to
ensure the successful implementation of the budgets for this year.

2. Promoting strategic restructuring of agriculture and the
rural economy and improving the overall quality and performance of
the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
We will continue to strengthen infrastructure development
efforts in agriculture, focusing on water conservancy.
Construction of the projects to reinforce dikes on the Yangtze and
Yellow rivers and other big rivers will be accelerated. Rivers and
lakes will be dredged and desilted and new towns built for the
displaced people. Major dilapidated reservoirs will be reinforced.
More pivotal water conservancy projects on major rivers will be
constructed. Large irrigated areas will be improved, and the
application of water-saving irrigation will be vigorously expanded.
Efforts to develop water and power supply, roads, communications
and other public facilities in rural areas will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Farmers should be encouraged to adjust the pattern of
cultivation in response to market demand. They should develop
green foods and local specialties and work hard to improve the
overall quality of agricultural products. The application of key
technology for the integrated use of agricultural resources,
intensive farming, forecast and control of biological disasters
and production of highly processed agricultural products will be
vigorously expanded. Projects to improve seeds and the varieties
and breeds of livestock, poultry and aquatic products will be
successfully carried out. Livestock and poultry production and
aquacultural development will be stepped up to increase
consumption of meat, eggs and milk and to accelerate the
conversion of grain into other products.
</P>
<P>
We will continue to deepen reform of the grain distribution
system. We will uphold the policies of purchasing at protective
prices all the surplus grain farmers have to sell, of having state-
owned grain purchase and marketing enterprises sell grain at a
profit and of ensuring closed operation of state grain purchase
funds. The types of grain to be purchased at protective prices
will be regulated as appropriate. We will focus on reform of state-
owned grain purchase and marketing enterprises to increase their
competitiveness on the market.
</P>
<P>
Township and village enterprises will be restructured and
vigorous efforts will be made to develop small cities and towns.
Township and village enterprises should be advised to integrate
production with industrialized operation of agriculture to promote
the processing of agricultural products and the conversion of them
into other products to increase their added value. Small cities
and towns should have a rational distribution and should be
scientifically planned and their development should be accelerated.
Township and village enterprises should be encouraged to
concentrate in small cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
Anti-poverty policies and measures will be further implemented
and the efficiency in the use of anti-poverty funds will be raised.
We will mobilize the whole society to join in the anti-poverty
program. Efforts should be aimed at helping approximately 10
million more poor rural residents solve their food and clothing
problems in order to attain the objectives of the state anti-
poverty plan which calls for helping 80 million destitute rural
residents over the seven years from 1994 to the year 2000.

3. Intensifying industrial restructuring efforts to improve the
quality and performance of industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
Technological progress and the process of industrial upgrading
will be accelerated. The metallurgical industry should increase
production of steel products urgently needed domestically, such as
cold-rolled plates, autobody sheets, galvanized sheets and
petroleum pipelines. The nonferrous metals industry should produce
more highly processed products and new materials and ensure an
ample supply of copper barilla and aluminum oxide. The petroleum
and natural gas industry should accelerate the development and
prospecting of oil and gas resources in the central and western
regions and build more natural gas pipelines. More adjustments
will be made in the pattern of production in the chemical,
petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries and in industries
which support agriculture. The light industry should focus on the
production of wood pulps, high-grade paper and paperboards and use
new applicable high technology to produce highly processed farm
products. The textile industry should develop specialized
functional fibers and improve printing, dyeing and other finishing
processes by applying advanced technology. Efforts will be made to
produce urban rail tracks and rolling-stock and environmental
protection equipment domestically as soon as possible. The
production capacity and level of technology of new power equipment
and new ships and equipment for use in agriculture and in
petrochemical, metallurgical, textile and paper industries will be
raised. We will speed up the process of industrial restructuring
and enterprise reorganization in old industrial bases. A number of
small plants and mines that are technologically backward, produce
inferior products, waste resources and cause serious pollution
should absolutely be closed down. Backward equipment, technology
and processes should be abandoned. Total production in the coal
and metallurgical industries will be kept under control. Every
possible means will be used to improve the quality of industrial
products, raise productivity and enhance enterprise performance.

5. Strengthening implementation of a proactive fiscal policy
and making greater use of monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Looking at China's present economic situation and the problems
facing the country, we must continue to follow a proactive fiscal
policy if we want to attain our macro-economic objectives this
year. We will issue 100 billion yuan worth of long-term treasury
bonds to boost investment demand. This year's total national
budgetary revenue will be 1.2338 trillion yuan and expenditures
will total 1.4637 trillion yuan (including interest payments on
debt). This leaves a deficit of 229.9 billion yuan, which is
entirely for the central government as local budgets will maintain
fiscal balance. We currently have a fairly ample supply of goods
and materials, which provides the necessary material guarantee for
issuing more treasury bonds to help offset the current feeble
demand. From a long-term point of view, so long as we make good
use of these funds, not only will there not be any big risk, but
we will lay a solid foundation for future development. We must
work hard to increase revenue and reduce expenditures, intensify
tax collection and management and collect taxes strictly in
accordance with the law to ensure an increase in tax revenue. We
will adjust the pattern of expenditures, strictly controlling and
holding down expenditures for ordinary projects in favor of
expenditures for key projects. The function of budgetary funds in
directing investment should be given full play.
</P>
<P>
We must make integrated use of all types of monetary policy
tools to truly increase the supporting influence that finance has
on economic development. We will properly expand the monetary base
as needed for economic development. This year M2 is expected to
increase by 14% to 15% and M1, by 15% to 17%. Total lending by all
financial institutions is expected to increase by 1 trillion yuan.
Financial institutions should devote a great deal of effort to
improving their financial services and provide greater support in
all areas for economic development and reform while maintaining
prudent operation. We will speed up efforts to establish and
improve a credit guarantee system for small and medium-sized
enterprises. The size of refinancing for small and medium-sized
financial institutions should be appropriately increased where
conditions permit.

7. Continuing to raise the level of opening up and making
better use of both domestic and international markets and
resources.
</P>
<P>
We will seize the favorable opportunities presented by the
upturn of the international economic environment and the
accelerated pace of China's accession to the World Trade
Organization to revise and improve relevant laws and regulations
to accord with international standards, expand imports and exports
and utilize more foreign funds. Policies to encourage exports,
such as refunding export tax, will be continued. We will further
increase the export of mechanical and electrical products,
accelerate the upgrading of textiles, garments and other
traditional export commodities, vigorously export high-tech
products and put more farm products on the international market.
Enterprises with comparative advantages will be encouraged to
invest in setting up factories abroad that process their own
materials, open up foreign markets and pay close attention to
improving management. We will take further steps to optimize the
pattern of imports, making proper arrangements for the import of
key equipment, technology and raw and semi-finished materials
urgently needed in China. We will vigorously promote the reform of
state-owned foreign trade enterprises and accelerate the
implementation of a registration system to empower producing
enterprises to directly engage in import and export. The number of
export commodities on which voluntary quotas are imposed will be
reduced. Quota management and bidding methods will be improved.
Regulation of processing trade enterprises will be based on
classification of the enterprises. An all-out drive will be
launched to combat cases of failure to turn over foreign currency
owed to the government and illegal arbitrage of foreign exchange,
tax fraud and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
We will further improve the investment environment and
experiment with more ways and areas of investment for utilizing
foreign capital. Restrictions on foreign investment in terms of
investment fields, geographic regions, technology transfers,
required local content, foreign exchange equilibrium and maximum
proportion of foreign capital will be relaxed. We will open to the
outside world banking, insurance, telecommunications, tourism and
other service trades on a step-by-step basis. Regulations
concerning the management of BOT projects with foreign investment
and infrastructure transfer projects should be formulated and
implemented as soon as possible. Efforts will be stepped up to
attract investment from multinational corporations. Vigorous
efforts will be made to attract foreign investment in a variety of
forms for the reorganization and technological upgrading of state-
owned enterprises.

III. Increasing Effective Demand to Promote Sustained, Rapid
and Sound Development of the National Economy
</P>
<P>
Boosting domestic demand is an important measure for resolving
the conflicts and problems in our current economic activities; it
is also a long-term strategic policy for national economic
development. The key to expanding domestic demand is to increase
effective demand. The production capacity of enterprises making
unmarketable products must not be expanded, and under no
circumstances will poor quality redundant development be allowed.
Increasing effective demand will not only promote economic growth
at present but also help improve the industrial structure,
increase the potential of future economic development, improve the
overall quality and performance of the national economy and add to
our overall national strength and international competitiveness.
In working to boost effective demand, the objective will be to
increase investment and consumption to constantly improve the
material and cultural life of both urban and rural residents. The
supply structure will be adapted to changes in demand in the
domestic and international markets.  Scientific and technological
advances and technological innovation should be the driving force
behind efforts to promote the optimization and upgrading of the
industrial structure. We will follow a strategy of sustained
development, ensuring that economic development is in line with
the country's supply of resources and the environment to maintain
a beneficial development cycle. We will create the necessary
conditions in terms of systems, mechanisms and policies to
increase effective demand and promote sustained, rapid and sound
development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Urban and rural markets will be vigorously developed to expand
consumer demand. Stimulating the market and increasing consumption
is the key to boosting effective demand. We will adopt a variety
of measures to encourage increased consumption. We will do our
best to ensure that the total volume of retail sales of consumer
goods reaches 3.335 trillion yuan this year, an increase of 7.1%
over last year. First of all, the policy on income distribution
will be adjusted to give people more purchasing power. All
policies introduced in 1999 to adjust income distribution will be
continued to gradually increase the income of low- and middle-
income urban residents.

<P>
Reform of the investment and financing system will be
vigorously promoted to create conditions for expanding effective
demand. First, the reform of the investment and financing system
will be accelerated to provide incentives for and restraints on
enterprise investment. The general aim of the reform is to allow
enterprises to independently make decisions and accept risks when
making investment in projects encouraged or permitted by the state,
with the exception of especially important projects or those
covered by special state regulations. Examination and approval
procedures will be simplified so that the government will only
examine investments by enterprises to decide whether or not they
are in conformity with the state's development plan, macroeconomic
policies, laws and regulations. The government will not directly
intervene in the investment and financing activities of
enterprises. The government should work more efficiently and speed
up the examination and approval of projects. Second, more channels
will be opened up for enterprises to raise more investment capital.
The capital market and various means of financing will be
developed at a quicker pace so that enterprises can strongly
increase their investments in response to shifts in market supply
and demand and in accordance with their own development
requirements. Formulation of rules governing industrial investment
funds will be accelerated so that they can go into effect.
Vigorous efforts will be made to establish a risk investment
mechanism. Third, we will create a good policy climate for
encouraging and guiding all sectors of society to invest more. We
will abolish restrictions on investment by all sectors of society
and on the development of the non-state sector of the economy,
opening more areas to them. Concrete actions will also be taken to
provide consulting services and personnel training for the
expansion of investment from the various sectors of society and
the development of the non-state sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
More use will be made of prices as a lever to promote economic
growth and restructuring. Continued efforts will be made to
straighten out price relationships and further improve the pricing
system. Prices will be appropriately raised for water supplied
from water conservancy projects, urban water supply and public
transport services. Efforts to impose charges for the treatment of
wastewater and refuse will be increased.

<HEADLINE> Report on 1999 Budget Execution, 2000 Draft Budgets (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text of
the report on the implementation of the central and local budgets
for 1999 and on the draft central and local budgets for 2000
delivered by Chinese Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng at the
Third Session of the Ninth National People's Congress on March 6,
2000:

Fellow Deputies,
</P>
<P>
I have been entrusted by the State Council to submit a report
on the implementation of the central and local budgets for 1999
and on the draft central and local budgets for 2000 for your
examination and approval, and also for suggestions and comments
from members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference.

I. Implementation of the Central and Local Budgets for 1999
</P>
<P>
Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and
the State Council, in 1999 the people throughout the country
worked hard together and scored great achievements in the national
economy and all social undertakings. After the central budget for
1999 was approved at the Second Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress, some problems arose in the development of the
national economy. Fixed asset investment increased slowly and
exports and direct foreign investment slumped. Consumer demand was
sluggish, there was a protracted decline in prices and effective
domestic demand was weak. The Party Central Committee and the
State Council analyzed the economic situation and resolutely made
an important policy decision to step up efforts to implement a pro-
active fiscal policy to maintain the good momentum in the economic
recovery in the second half of 1998. This pro-active fiscal policy
was implemented through some major measures. On the basis of the
amount of government bonds set in the budget in early 1999, the
Ministry of Finance issued an additional 60 billion yuan of long-
term government bonds to the commercial banks, of which 30 billion
yuan was listed as an addition to the deficit in the central
budget for 1999 and the remainder was borrowed by the central
government in the name of local governments and was not listed in
the central budget. The incomes of low- and medium-income urban
residents were increased by a fairly large margin. Wages and
salaries of employees in government departments and institutions
were raised. The policies on tax refunds for exports and internal
taxation were revised. Reduction in revenue and increase in
expenditures were compensated by new increases in revenue and
readjustments in the pattern of expenditures rather than by
further increasing the central deficit. In August 1999 the
Eleventh Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress examined and adopted the proposal made by the
State Council to issue additional government bonds for increasing
fixed asset investment and its plan to revise the central budget.
These macro-control measures which focus on the implementation of
a proactive fiscal policy have proved to produce notable results.
The national economy grew steadily, gross domestic product rose by
7.1 percent over that of the previous year and the quality of the
operation and performance of the economy improved notably. All
reforms proceeded smoothly and the living standards of the people
continued to improve.

<HEADLINE> Report on 1999 Budget Execution, 2000 Draft Budgets (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the basis of steady economic growth, the central and local
budgets for 1999 were implemented fairly satisfactorily. Total
revenue in the central budget for 1999 came to 639.6 billion yuan,
or 108.7 percent of the budgeted figure. This figure includes 579.
8 billion yuan in revenue collected by the central government, or
109.6 percent of the budgeted figure, and 59.8 billion yuan turned
over to the central government by local authorities, the same as
the budgeted figure. Total expenditures in the central budget for
1999 amounted to 819.3 billion yuan, or 106.6 percent of the
budgeted figure, including 409.8 billion yuan of expenditures for
the central government, or 92.9 percent of the budgeted figure,
and 409.5 billion yuan in the form of subsidies for local
authorities, or 124.9 percent of the budgeted figure. Central
expenditures exceeded revenue, leaving a deficit of 179.7 billion
yuan, 600 million yuan less than the amount of 180.3 billion yuan
approved at the Eleventh Meeting of the Standing Committee of the
Ninth National People's Congress when the projected deficit was
revised.
</P>
<P>
The actual figures for some items in the central budget vary
greatly from those in the draft budget formulated in early 1999.
Total receipts from tariffs, sales tax on imported goods and value-
added tax came to 192 percent of the budgeted figure, mainly
because the government stepped up efforts to combat smuggling and
encouraged importing through legal channels and because the
Customs authorities tightened tax collection and management,
increasing revenue by a big margin. Total business tax collected
came to 86.1 percent of the projected figure and income tax paid
by state-owned enterprises, 70.5 percent. This is mainly because
the government lowered the interest rates for loans several times
and the revenue turned over by financial institutions was reduced.
Total receipts from stamp tax on securities transactions came to
165.6 percent of the budgeted figure, since a greater volume of
stock transactions resulted in more revenue. Total expenditures
for capital construction came to only 79.6 percent of the budgeted
figure because some funds for capital construction originally
listed in the expenditures in the central budget were allocated to
local authorities in the form of subsidies.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President's Aide Meets Aceh Separatist Movement Military Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid's close aide Bondan Gunawan held a talks with Abdullah Syafi
'ie,the military commander of the separatist movement in Aceh at
an undisclosed place in the province on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During a 20-minute unprecedented talks, Gunawan, state
secretary and government control secretary, presented Wahid's
message to leaders of the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), an underground
movement in the province which had been launching a fighting
against the central government over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The two officials later admitted that they now have the basis
to create a long-waited reconciliation between the two sides,
according to the Indonesian Observer Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first encounter ever between representatives of the
government and GAM.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's expressed readiness earlier to hold negotiations with
GAM leaders, including Hasan Tiro, has been positively welcomed by
GAM secretary general Tengku Don Zulfahri.
</P>
<P>
"Our readiness to negotiate with the Indonesian government is
not because we are surrendering to the Indonesian Armed Forces (
TNI) but to comply with demands of the Aceh people," Zulfahri said.
</P>
<P>
The reason behind GAM's readiness to hold talks with the
government is to heed the wishes of the people of Aceh for a
political solution to the Aceh question, he was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Violence in Aceh has intensified recently and since the year
began more than 200 people have been killed in clashes between GAM
guerrillas and the government forces. But the situation is getting
better now.
</P>
<P>
"Well, its getting better because the general situation is now
very good," the president said here Wednesday when asked about the
strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
"Go ask the people of Aceh themselves. They all know that GAM
is loosing position, that's why in several areas, GAM attack
schools and other public places hoping the people will suspect TNI,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The president urged TNI soldiers and police not to retaliate
against these attacks, but to remain in their barracks "unless
going to pray at the mosque".

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Seven pre-school age children were
killed in a traffic accident Thursday in Central Quebec, according
to Quebec police.
</P>
<P>
The children were on a day-care outing to a sugar shack when
their mini-van collided with another vehicle near St. Jean
Baptiste deNicolet between Montreal and Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
Four were killed on the spot while three others died at the
hospital. Three other children were injured with one still in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Provincial police spokesman Daniel Lamirande said the mini-van
jumped over a guard rail on a secondary road. "Most of the
children were thrown out of the van on impact. It was a pretty
horrible scene," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Hysterical parents rushed to the scene of the accident and saw
their children lying in the field, said Lamirande.
</P>
<P>
An investigation is underway to identify the cause of the
accident. The road was reportedly wet and the driver of the
children's mini-van appeared to have lost control before the mini-
van crashed through the guard rail and was struck by the other
vehicle, the police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Quebec Premier Lucien
Bouchard and the Quebec legislature offered their condolences to
the victims' parents.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Armed Group's Former Leader Assassinated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The former leader of the Andres
Castro United Front (FUAC) armed group Edmundo Olivias, also known
as "Camilo Turcios," was shot dead Thursday by unidentified gunmen
in a road in the northeast of Nicaragua, said police sources.
</P>
<P>
Olivias and his driver Francisco Contreras were slain when they
were traveling early Thursday morning in a pickup truck on the
road to the city of Boaco, 90 kilometers northeast of Managua.
</P>
<P>
Olivias' wife Doriel Caceres, who was traveling in the same
vehicle, was seriously wounded after being struck by seven shots.
She was taken to a Managua hospital, said Boaco police chief
Commissioner Alfonso Sevilla.
</P>
<P>
The FUAC is an armed group made up mainly by members of the
defunct Sandinista Popular Army. They struck a demobilization
agreement in December 1997 with the government of President
Arnoldo Aleman.
</P>
<P>
Still, some group members refused to surrender their weapons
and continue to take action. The FUAC kidnapped a Canadian
engineer and a Nicaraguan soldier in a sector of the North
Atlantic Autonomous Region of the country last September.
</P>
<P>
"Turcios" was an intermediary in the negotiations between the
government and the kidnappers, leading to release of the two
hostages in October.
</P>
<P>
The FUAC second chief, Jorge Alejandro Navarro, also known as "
Tito Fuentess," was also assassinated in the mining village of
Rosita by unknown gunmen.

JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- American athlete Michael
Johnson, the double world record holder in the 200 and 400 meters,
on Thursday arrived in South Africa for the Engen Grand Prix
series with the news that this Olympic year may be his last in
athletic competition.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who is going for a repeat of his double Olympic gold
medals in Sydney in September, will compete in the 200 meters in
Pietersburg on Saturday against South Africa's Marcus la Grange
and Morne Nagel.
</P>
<P>
He will again contest the 200 meters in Pretoria on March 24,
with a grande finale in the 400 meters in Cape Town on March 31.
</P>
<P>
"This will probably be my last Olympics," said the 32-year-old
sprint ace. "And if I compete next year, it will certainly be my
last season."

Last year he got going on a similar program in the Engen series
and went on to break the 400m record at the World Championships in

BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The agricultural sector in east
China's Anhui Province has introduced new varieties of "space"
vegetable seeds to replace traditional ones.
</P>
<P>
The seeds were sent into space for two weeks for special
breeding, and the use of these seeds developed after exposure to
strong radiation in space has the advantages of being disease
resistant and high yielding.
</P>
<P>
Local agronomists note that the so-called "space tomato, red
pepper, and cucumber" are growing well at a number of farming
centers in the province.
</P>
<P>
These vegetables are expected to be grown widely throughout the
province's rural areas.

ALGARVE, Portugal, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Norway upset World Cup
runners-up China 3-0 in their last group B match to enter the
Algarve Cup women's soccer tournament here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Norway, who won group B after the victory, will face World Cup
champions United States in the final slated for Saturday in Loule.
</P>
<P>
Dagny Mellegren scored all three goals, including a double in
the first half. At least two goals came from her taking advantage
of the loopholes in the Chinese defence.
</P>
<P>
A typical example came after China trailed Norway 1-0 in the
first half. After a clumsy effort for a Chinese full-back to head
the ball back to the goalkeeper, Mellegren raced forward to blast
the ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Ma Yuanan said although China and Norway are
about the same level, China was not prepared psychologically
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He added that his team would draw a lesson from this loss when
they prepare for this summer's Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Mia Hamm scored the only goal when eventual group A winners
United States defeated Sweden.
</P>
<P>
In other third-round actions Thursday, Denmark beat Portugal 2-
0 in group A, while Canada defeated Finland 2-1 in group B.

China will now vie for third place against Sweden, while
Denmark and Canada will battle for fifth place.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand swimmer Trent Bray
will take part in the selection competitions later this month for
the Sydney Olympics after a judge overturned his positive doping
test result, the New Zealand Herald reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling was based on doubts about containers used in
one part of the test and the length of time between a sample being
taken from Bray in November and the test undertaken after
Christmas, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The sample sat in quarantine for two weeks on its way to a
testing laboratory in Sydney, according to Bray's lawyer Peter
Thorp.
</P>
<P>
Bray was a triple short-course world championship silver
medallist. He also took a Commonwealth Games freestyle silver
medal in 1994.

HAIKOU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 2.1 million farmers in
south China's Hainan Province have attended technological training
courses and earned certificates of achievement over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
The province began to initiate the farmer-training project in
its cities and counties in 1998, and now more than 600
professionals have given lessons in the fields of agriculture,
animal husbandry, aquatic production, farm economy, and breeding

LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Arsenal were by far the better side as they secured a two-goal
advantage to take into the away leg of their UEFA Cup tie with
Werder Bremen Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
A goal in each half for Thierry Henry and Freddie Ljungberg
were the difference between the sides, although the Germans may
consider themselves lucky the margin was not much bigger.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal established a silky rhythm from the outset that saw
them trouble the German defense with shots from Henry, Patrick
Vieira and Gilles Grimandi inside the first 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Werder Bremen never once looked like scoring but
will still go into next week's second leg with some confidence
after overcoming a 1-0 deficit in the last round to knock-out
holders Parma 3-2 on aggregate.

LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Leeds United subjected Slavia Prague to their heaviest European
defeat of the season, with a convincing 3-0 victory at Elland Road
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The home side dominated the clash from the outset. And after a
battling half-an-hour Jason Wilcox opened the scoring in the 39th
minute.
</P>
<P>
Harry Kewell, who earlier missed two good chances, added a
second in the 54th minute when he touched home Eirik Bakke's cross
and Lee Bowyer rounded off the scoring moments later with a tidy
finish after a superb sweeping pass from Michael Bridges put him
in the clear.
</P>
<P>
Bowyer had been picked despite on Tuesday being charged with
grievous bodily harm to an Asian student. The midfielder will
appear in court on Friday, along with England defender Jonathan
Woodgate.

Slavia had captain Karel Rada sent off for two yellow cards 15

<HEADLINE> Phillips Agrees Five-year Deal with Sunderland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Phillips has agreed a new
contract with Sunderland to make him the highest-paid player in
the club's history and one of the biggest earners in the
Premiership.
</P>
<P>
The five-year deal replaces the player's current contract,
which expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Sunderland manager Peter Reid told the club's website: "Kevin
is the leading goalscorer in the Premiership and an England
international.
</P>
<P>
"It's a long time since we have had that at the club so I'm
understandably very pleased."
</P>
<P>
Phillips has hit 85 goals for the club since arriving from
Watford for 650,000 pounds in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
He has scored 25 Premiership goals this season - eight more
than his nearest rival - with 10 games still remaining.
</P>
<P>
Phillips is the fifth first team regular at Sunderland to
commit himself to a new deal in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Sorensen, Gavin McCann, Chris Makin and Alex Rae have
already agreed new contracts.
</P>
<P>
Rae has signed on until 2003 while highly-rated youngster
McCann has signed until 2005.
</P>
<P>
"Gavin has proved himself to be a top quality midfield player
and will be as good as new after his injury," said Reid.
</P>
<P>
"Alex is playing very well at the moment. Everyone understands
the problems he has had to face and he has fought them well.
</P>
<P>
"He is now playing some of his best football since joining the
club," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wembley to Host England's Game against Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- England's 2002 World Cup
qualifying match against Germany on October 7 this year will be
held at Wembley Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association has confirmed that stadium
redevelopment will be delayed three weeks so the clash can be the
last game played at the venue.
</P>
<P>
England manager Kevin Keegan said: "When all the options are
considered, it has to be right to give the maximum number of fans
the chance to see this massive game.
</P>
<P>
"Until recently, Wembley didn't appear to be available. Now it
is, and I know it will be a wonderful atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Other venues, such as Old Trafford and St James' Park, had been
considered to stage the qualifying game.
</P>
<P>
An FA statement on Thursday said: "The closure of the stadium
has been delayed by three weeks to enable the match to act as the
finale in the present Wembley's 77-year history.
</P>
<P>
"The bulldozers are expected to move in to demolish the stadium
soon afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"The decision follows talks involving the England coach Kevin
Keegan as well as Wembley and the FA.
</P>
<P>
"The FA, the stadium's new owners, had considered taking the
game elsewhere in the country with Wembley expected to close in
September.
</P>
<P>
"But before the World Cup draw was made, Germany were
considered the most fitting opponents for the final match at
Wembley, not least because of the famous World Cup final involving
the two countries back in 1966.
</P>
<P>
"Once they were paired together again at the draw in Tokyo last
December, it had been assumed that other opponents would have to
be found for the finale because of the timetable."
</P>
<P>
Now the curtain will come down on the famous old Twin Towers
with the qualifier against England's greatest international rivals,
who were beaten 4-2 after extra-time in the World Cup final on
July 30, 1966.
</P>
<P>
England's other World Cup qualifying matches over the next two
years will still be played outside London.

<HEADLINE> Four Japanese Red Army Members Expelled to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon evicted four Japanese Red
Army members to Jordan Friday when their political asylum request
was turned down.
</P>
<P>
Only one member of the group, 51-year-old Kozo Okamoto, is
permitted to stay in Lebanon, announced the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Four members were sent to Amman from Beirut via a Middle East
Airline flight on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The five Japanese are wanted in Japan on international terrorism
charges and face possible execution if found guilty, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which does not have an extradition agreement with
Lebanon, had informally sought the extradition of the five since
they were arrested in Lebanon on February 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Beirut has turned down Tokyo's request because Lebanese law
stipulates that they must first serve their sentences before any
extradition demand can be examined. 
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Kozo Okamoto, Masao Adachi, 59, Kazuo Tohira, 46,
Harowo Wako, 50, and Mariko Yamamoto, 59, were each sentenced to 42
months in prison for forging documents, using false passports and
residing in Lebanon illegally.
</P>
<P>
They finished their three year of imprisonment term last week
and asked for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid extradition, Adachi recently married a
Lebanese woman and converted to Greek Orthodox Christianity.
Okamoto and two others converted to Islam.
</P>
<P>
Okamoto was the sole surviving perpetrator of the 1972 attack on
Israel's Ben Gurion Airport in that left 26 people dead. The
attack was organized by the Japanese Red Army and the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to life imprisonment in Israel but was freed
along with 1,150 Palestinians in a swap for Israeli soldiers in
1985.

<HEADLINE> Russians Want Chechen Campaign Continued, Putin Will Win: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Most Russians expect that the
federal troops should continue the military campaign in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya and Russian acting President
Vladimir Putin will win the upcoming presidential race, shows a
latest poll in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three percent of Russians, 3 percent more than a month
ago, think that the Chechen campaign must be pursued to an end.
This is the result of a representative poll among 1,600 adult
Russians, conducted by the All-Russian Public Opinion Survey
Center on March 13 following a similar survey in mid-February,
said the Interfax news agency Friday.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of those, who favor an end to the hostilities
and the start of negotiations with the Chechen leadership, slipped
from 22 percent in February to 19 percent in March, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
Even if the federal troops suffer greater losses in the
campaign, 61 percent of the respondents against 59 percent in
February believe that the offensive should be continued, while 9
percent do not share this position and another 18 percent declined
to answer (8 and 22 percent last month respectively).
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three percent of the answers (60 percent in February) do
not recognize Aslan Maskhadov as legitimate president of Chechnya,
with 15 percent (17 percent in the previous month) admitting him.
</P>
<P>
In 56 percent of the respondents' opinions, Chechnya should be
made a special federal territory not enjoying the full rights of a
Russia region.
</P>
<P>
As many as the same percent of the voters (47 percent in
February) agree that Chechnya must be governed directly by Moscow,
while 25 percent of the poll participants disagree (30 percent
last month).
</P>
<P>
The public opinion center also forecasts no surprises in the
March 26 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"The main sensation is that no sensations are expected," said
director of the center Yuri Levada. "The people have made their
choice. The main curiosity is what will happen next and what kind
of policy we will have," he said.
</P>
<P>
Levada's deputy, Alexei Grazhdankin, described the election
campaign as "rather dull" because "only 6 percent of voters
planning to take part in the elections have not made up their
minds."
</P>
<P>
Regardless of acting President Vladimir Putin's ratings
fluctuations, it is possible that he will be elected president of
Russia, Grazhdankin said.
</P>
<P>
"Putin's rating makes it possible for him to win the elections
in the first round. But even if we allow for a second round, Putin
would receive the support of two thirds of voters if his rival was
(the Communist leader) Gennady Zyuganov, and three fourths of the
votes if his rival was (liberal economist) Grigory Yavlinsky,"
Grazhdankin said.

<HEADLINE> Four Colombian Policemen Kidnapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Four Colombian policemen have been
kidnapped, presumably by members of some guerrilla organization in
the department of Tolima, the police department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police director General Rosso Jose Serrano said that the
kidnapping occurred Thursday in the outskirts of the Fresno
municipality, on the road that communicates the Tolima region with
the coffee growing zone of Caldas.
</P>
<P>
Serrano said that the kidnappers, presumably members of a group
that call themselves "the Bolsheviks," installed an illegal
checkpoint on the road and stopped several vehicles, among them
the one in which a captain, a sergeant, and two agents were
traveling.
</P>
<P>
Tolima police chief Colonel Javier Cifuentes said that the
policemen had been commissioned in an "intelligence" mission to
prevent public disorder in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Carolyn McAskie, the
acting emergency relief coordinator, is expected to lead a six-day
inter-agency mission to the war-torn Angola in a bid to examine
the humanitarian needs of some 1.7 million internally displaced
people in the southern African country, a U.N. spokesman said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference that the
team will set out Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The mission, requested by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
will include officials from the Office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Program and the U.N.
Children's Fund, and will undertake a comprehensive assessment of
existing coordination arrangements, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The mission is scheduled to visit Huambo and Kuito, two of the
nation's provincial capitals, where the bulk of internally
displaced persons are located.
</P>
<P>
Angola has been racked since the mid-1960s by a civil war
which has killed nearly one million and displaced millions more.
International relief workers are reported to have difficulties in
gaining access to the needy people, who have been internally
displaced.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meet N. Irish Leader to Push Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clinton was welcoming Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern to the
White House for a St. Patrick's Day ceremony and later was meeting
with pro-Britain Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble; Sinn
Fein's leader Gerry Adams; John Hume, the Social Democratic Party
leader.
</P>
<P>
Trimble told a press conference at the National Press Club that
he is expected to have "direct contact" with the republican
leadership.
</P>
<P>
"The good news about Ireland is that even though the
institutions have been taken down over the difference between the
parties on decommissioning, no-one wants to go back to the way it
was or give up the peace process," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to restore a process that will eventually lead to all
the requirements of the Good Friday Accord being observed,"
Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he expects eventual restoration of the suspended
government, but the Irish Republic Army (IRA) must first provide
concrete evidence they will begin decommissioning weapons, or
disarming.
</P>
<P>
"Decommissioning would not be important if there was not a
genuine commitment to peaceful means," Trimble added. "And
decommissioning was always seen as just being part of a process
that would, at the end of the day, involve the elimination not
just of weapons of but of paramilitary organizations themselves."
</P>
<P>
"It is only because -- not only because, but it's largely
because over the years the paramilitaries have shown no sign of
dismantling, no sign of ending permanently their terrorist
campaign, that there has come to be such a focus on the question
of weapons decommissioning," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Clinton urged leaders of major parties to
make concessions in order to restore the province's coalition
government and avoid a renewal of violence.
</P>
<P>
"Life is fleeting and opportunities come and go. We have the
chance of a lifetime. Whatever the differences, it's not worth
another life, not one. It's not worth another day's delay,"
Clinton told a gala dinner attended by Adams and Trimble.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the statement before holding five separate
meetings Friday and hosting a St. Patrick's Day reception at the
White House. Thursday's dinner was hosted by the America Ireland
Fund and joined by more than 1,000 guests.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told the guests that he was proud of the supporting
role he had played in the peace process, adding that the cease-
fires now are measured in years, not weeks.
</P>
<P>
"I must confess as your friend that I still do not know the
answers," he said, expressing his regrets that the peace process
is in a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told a
regular briefing that the administration did not expect any
breakthrough during Friday's meetings.
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that this is more than just courtesy, but I also don't
anticipate any breakthrough. There are discussions scheduled for
when they return home, and they will continue to try to find a way
through to implementing the Good Friday accords," Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
The Good Friday accords was signed by the parties involved in
the future of the British province of Northern Ireland in 1998.
The peace process runs into an impasse after the Irish Republic
Army (IRA) refused to disarm and Britain suspended the self-rule
in the province in February.

<TEXT>
<P>
This was announced Friday by BCB adjunct director Antonio
Carlos Martins at a symposium held at the American Chamber of
Commerce to discuss the new system.
</P>
<P>
Martins said that nowadays the time needed for the registration
of foreign capital has been too much because of its volume.
</P>
<P>
BCB data show that foreign investment went from 900 million U.S.
dollars in 1994, to 32 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The BCB said that the new registration system, called
Electronic Declaratory Registry, can be made in the Internet,
substituting for the paper documents now required, and will give
more transparency to the access of the investments.
</P>
<P>
BCB sources said that the new system will reduce from one to
two years, to only 30 minutes the time needed to register the
entrance of foreign capital to the country.

UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. technical
assessment team in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has
completed trips to three of the four sites where peace-keeping
troops will eventually be based, a U.N. spokesman said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference here
that the team visited Mbuji-Mayi, Kanagnga and Mbandaka between
Tuesday and Thursday, and they are expected to visit Matadi, the
fourth site, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Deployment of the 5,500 military personnel is expected to

deployed by the end of June at the earliest," he said.
</P>

The U.N. under-secretary-general for peace-keeping operations,

<HEADLINE> U.N. Humanitarian Envoy Provides Briefing on Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Ross Mountain, the U.N.
special humanitarian envoy to Mozambique, is back in Geneva Friday,
where he updated donor countries on the outcome of his mission,
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, said here.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told a press conference that the U.N. envoy is
expected to give a news conference in Geneva on what he found
during his visit to the southern African country, ravaged by the
worst floods in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
As of Friday, 463,000 people who lost their homes in
Mozambique are being cared for in 121 centers, Eckhard said,
adding that contributions reported to the Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for the floods now total 119
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The transitional appeal for Mozambique, which will cover a
six-month period and address reconstruction needs, is expected to
be launched next week," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan joined the
U.N. agencies once again in calling for massive aid to Mozambique,
saying that the flooding in the Southern African country was "all
the more tragic" because the nation was considered an African
success story over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief's call coincided with the announcement by the
Rome-based U.N. World Food Program (WFP) to prepare a second
appeal to help Mozambican flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, concerned over the worsening flooding
situation in Mozambique, has responded with strengthened efforts
to seek more funds, helicopters for the Southern African country
in a bid to assist Maputo in fighting against the flooding.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique had recovered from a civil war, which broke out
shortly after its independence fro Portugal in 1975. The United
Nations sent a peace-keeping force into the country to cement a
1992 truce.

public that he can keep the strong economy going, said the survey
conducted by Republican and Democratic pollsters.
</P>
<P>
But overall, the survey showed that Bush had a 48 percent lead
over Gore's 44 percent in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Gore has closed his gap with Bush a bit among male voters,
largely on their increased confidence in his ability to handle the
economy, said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.
</P>
<P>
The poll indicates advantages for Republican Bush in concerns
about the nation's moral climate.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Bush are close among women, with Gore having a level
of support that is 4 points higher.
</P>
<P>
The poll also indicated Bush and Gore are about even in the
public view on many issues and candidate qualities.
</P>
<P>
Likely voters consider moral values, improving education,
strengthening Social Security and improving health care as top
issues.

<HEADLINE> Hostages Released in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 32 staff members of the
multi-national oil firm Shell were released on Friday after being
held hostage for five days by Nigerian youths in the country's
Niger delta region.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for Shell, the protesters freed their
workers after hard negotiations involving local officials and
community leaders.
</P>
<P>
The youths stormed the Utorogu, a Shell gas plant near
Nigeria's oil town of Warri, on Monday morning, demanding the
company to improve a local road.
</P>
<P>
The gas plant, which feeds power plants in southern Nigeria,
still remains closed.
</P>
<P>
Hostage taking and acts of sabotage are frequent in the Niger
delta region, where local communities feel they have been
exploited by foreign oil companies and neglected by successive
Nigerian federal governments.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's civil government took office last year with a pledge
to end the disorder and poverty in the delta. The bill on
developing the area is among the first batch of bills President
Olusegun Obasanjo sent to the country's top legislature for
approval.

<HEADLINE> Koehler: IMF Should Concentrate on Preventing Economic Crises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Horst Koehler,
chosen to head the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said Friday
the global lender must emphasize preventing future financial
crises by monitoring countries' economies more closely.
</P>
<P>
Koehler also said he was ready for discussions with
congressional and other critics who say the IMF has become too
expensive, powerful and secretive and want to scale down its
operations.
</P>
<P>
Koehler, 57, now head of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, said at his debut news conference at the IMF
headquarters that he expected the IMF's 24 executive directors to
formally select him as managing director next week to succeed
Michel Camdessus, who stepped down in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Wearing a red badge marked "visitor," Koehler said he felt "it
is now more important for me to listen carefully before making any
specific statements on the role of the fund, listen to IMF
shareholders, to its staff but also to outside experts."
</P>
<P>
However, in the future, he said, the IMF should "focus even
more on crisis prevention and we should make the best use of the
strength of this institution" by providing countries with good
advice on sound economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Koehler said he was "open to discussion and dialogue with the U.
S. congress about reforms."
</P>
<P>
He also said he would hold similar talks with nongovernmental
organizations such as development and environmental groups because
"there is an obligation to explain" IMF policies. Some of these
groups have threatened to disrupt the meetings next month of the
IMF and the World Bank. Koehler said he did not know if he would
be in office in time for these meetings.

ROME, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema and his Portuguese confrere, Antonio Guterres, the EU's duty
president, agreed here Friday in voicing concern over the
situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"International action for security and ethnic coexistence must

</P>
<P>
The deterioration in the Kosovo will discussed at the

"In Lisbon, we will have to make progress towards identifying
what can be done on the ground," he said.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema also urged improved coordination of reconstruction and
development projects and said there must be a debate on what
strategy should be followed towards Yugoslavia and the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
"International moves to achieve major objectives must be re-
launched," he asserted, citing regional stability and economic and
democratic development.

<HEADLINE> British Beef to be Sold again on German Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 BERLIN, March 17 (Xinhua)-- British beef can be sold again on
the German market despite the BSE-problem insolvable.
</P>
<P>
The upper house of the German parliament, the Bundesrat, had
lifted a national import ban on British beef Friday in Bonn. The
European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union welcomed the decision of the German Bundesrat.
</P>
<P>
But British beef must be clearly labeled to protect consumers
from the possible risks of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE).
</P>
<P>
Britain also welcomed the lifting of the ban on British beef
through the German Bundesrat. British Farm Secretary Nick Brown
said London hoped that German consumers could be enjoy the good
quality of British beef again.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his cabinet approved
earlier lifting Germany's ban on British beef imports.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has already lifted a ban on British beef
exports last August 1. The ban had been imposed in 1996 after the
BSE disease broke out which was believed to cause a brain disease
in humans. But France and Germany had still kept national bans on
British beef despite of the EU's ruling.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France were the only EU member nations which
refused to comply with the EU agreement.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Government Defends Trade Accord with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario Green dismissed criticisms
from leftist opposition and from organizations that consider the
pact damages Mexican interests.
</P>
<P>
Green said that all the productive sectors of the country were
consulted during the process of the trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister admitted that "an agreement is a
commitment" that will not satisfy every one of the parts.
</P>
<P>
She said that the trade pact will benefit Mexico and that the
ratification of the text in the European parliaments confirms that
the members of the EU think that it will benefit them in the
immediate future."
</P>
<P>
The discussion of the approval in the Senate of the Republic
will conclude before Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo signs the
agreement in Portugal on March 23.
</P>
<P>
The free trade agreement between Mexico and the European Union
will go in force July 1 of this year and will mean the immediate
liberation of tariffs for 47 percent of the Mexican industrial
products and 82 percent for the European commodities.
</P>
<P>
When fully implemented, the agreement will cover 100 percent of
Mexico-EU trade in industrial products, 99.5 percent of trade in
the fisheries sector and 62 percent of trade in agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly approved the
free trade deal with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and the EU completed talks last November on the free-
trade agreement which the EU hopes will put European companies on
a more equal footing in the Mexican market with U.S. and Canadian
rivals which have benefited from the 1994 North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says to Try Reduce Tension on South Asia Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON,March 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Friday that he hoped to use his trip to South Asia to
reduce tension between India and Pakistan and rekindle the
relationship between the United States and India.
</P>
<P>
"I want to do what I can to reduce tensions on the Indian
subcontinent, to reduce the likelihood of weapons proliferation
and the likelihood of conflict," Clinton told reporters in the
Oval House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton leaves for South Asia on Saturday and stops initially
in Bangladesh. Then he will spend five days in India and conclude
the trip with a brief stop in Pakistan where he will be the first
U.S. president to visit since 1969.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has already made clear that nuclear-armed India and
Pakistan must exercise military and diplomatic restraint if they
expect good relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I will make clear our view that a nuclear-future is a
dangerous future for them and for the world," he said earlier.
</P>
<P>
He said he would improve relationship with India through this
long overdue visit, the last been the one by former President
Jimmy Carter 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of things we can do together, a lot of mutual
interests. obviously what I hope to do first is to rekindle the
relationship between the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his trip to Pakistan, Clinton said he would
support "the restoration of democratic rule in Pakistan, and to
continue our cooperation with them against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said he was looking forward to a stop in
Bangladesh, saying: "I have seen a lot of the initiatives taken in
Bangladesh, particularly for the empowerment of poor people, that
I think are important there and throughout the world."

<P>
Under the unprecedented deal reached with the company by the
departments of housing and urban development and treasury and
officials representing state and local governments, Smith &AMP; Wesson
agreed to a "code of conduct" for sales and distribution of
handguns.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer would sell its products only to authorized
dealers and distributors who also agree to certain conditions. A
dealer or distributor would have its contract with the
manufacturer terminated, for instance, if "a disproportionate
number" of crimes were traced to the weapons it sells.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for its commitments toward advancing gun safety,
Smith &AMP; Wesson won an agreement by the federal, state and local
governments to dismiss pending suits against it or refrain from
filing new suits.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration had been threatening to bring a
national lawsuit against the industry if manufacturers failed to
enter negotiations aimed at increasing gun safety.
</P>
<P>
Friday's deal affects only Smith &AMP; Wesson, the biggest of the
eight major gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"We've heard the statistics many times.... A rate of firearm
deaths for children in this country 12 times higher than the other
25 industrialized countries combined," Housing Secretary Andrew
Cuomo said at a press conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government approached the process in the belief that
reasonable gun manufacturers could "sit down... to stop the
senseless gun violence.... We have reached a settlement with...
the nation's largest gun manufacturer," Cuomo said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Expresses Dissatisfaction Over Kosovo Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov on Friday expressed dissatisfaction over the international
peacekeeping operation in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, saying
the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 1244 on
Kosovo is "far away from satisfaction".
</P>
<P>
However, it would be "impossible and unrealistic" for Russia to
revise unilaterally its role in the peacekeeping operation in
Kosovo, Ivanov said at a State Duma (the lower house of parliament)
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia, which has 3,600 servicemen in its contingent in
Kosovo, has only one way to influence the situation positively,
namely "through the UN Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov admitted that Russia has often been isolated in that
body, but still capable of defending its position. China has
shared Russia's position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
There are no other levers of influence in the Security Council
available to Russia, "but we have the Council's resolution and we
can insist on its implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev also
told the parliament that the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244
is being "unsatisfactorily" enforced.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in the province is growing worse and
could "lead to new armed clashes" within two to three months.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Moscow is determined to keep its peacekeepers in
Kosovo from being drawn into any local armed conflicts, vowed
Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
He railed at NATO's Kosovo Force (KFOR). More recalcitrant
ethnic Albanian nationalists have become increasingly active with
KFOR's "tacit consent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and its closer allies in NATO are continuing
to implement plans to strengthen their military and political
presence in Kosovo and the Balkans as a whole," noted Sergeyev,
charging the West of planning to draw Russian peacekeepers into
armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"We, in turn, have prepared our own plans to counter a possible
escalation of the situation in the Balkans," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Orders Moratorium on Railroad Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government on Friday
ordered a moratorium on new consolidation in the railroad industry
as it is concerned about service problems following recent
railroad mergers.
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department's Surface Transportation Board
ordered railroads to suspend any merger activity while it develops
new rules for mergers, a process expected to take about 15 months.
</P>
<P>
"Given the financial and service instability that exists in the
rail sector as a result of the most recent round of major railroad
consolidations, I cannot in good conscience allow further actions
to occur," board chairman Linda Morgan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The board acted following hearings on the future of the rail
industry.
</P>
<P>
It called the after the proposed 6-billion-U.S.-dollar merger
of Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Canadian National Railway was
announced. The merger would create a network of 50,000 miles of
track from Nova Scotia to Los Angeles and the Gulf of Mexico to
Vancouver, Canada.
</P>
<P>
That proposal, now blocked, came on the heels of a string of
mergers during the 1990s that caused rail car shortages, shipping
delays and depressed stock prices.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that our action is unprecedented," said the board.
"But these are not ordinary circumstances and we see no way of
adequately protecting the public interest short of the steps we
have outlined here."
</P>
<P>
"The railroad industry and the shipping public have not yet
fully recovered from the service disruptions associated with the
previous round of mergers," the board said in its decision.
</P>
<P>
Burlington Northern and Canadian National had asked the board
to let their merger move forward while the government developed
new rules.
</P>
<P>
But the agency rejected that plea, contending it did not want
to be creating new merger regulations in the middle of what might
turn out to be the final round of railroad combinations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meet N. Irish Leader to Push Peace Process(more details) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clinton first met Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern to the
White House for a St. Patrick's Day ceremony and later was meeting
with pro-Britain Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble; Sinn
Fein's leader Gerry Adams; John Hume, the Social Democratic Party
leader.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Ahern said that there is a "
widespread common ground on the need to restore" the self-rule
government in the province.
</P>
<P>
"We've renewed the process of dialogue, in which your personal
involvement is continuing here today in the White House. Already
we
find there is a widespread common ground on the need to restore
the institutions as soon as possible," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
"There is common ground also on the need to ensure that these
institutions operate at all times in an exclusively democratic
basis with no influence admissible from the threat or use of
violence. We must create the confidence to find a way of doing
this," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Trimble said he expects eventual restoration
of the suspended government, but the Irish Republic Army (IRA)
must first provide concrete evidence they will begin
decommissioning weapons, or disarming.
</P>
<P>
"Decommissioning would not be important if there was not a
genuine commitment to peaceful means," Trimble added. "And
decommissioning was always seen as just being part of a process
that would, at the end of the day, involve the elimination not
just of weapons of but of paramilitary organizations themselves."
</P>
<P>
"It is only because -- not only because, but it's largely
because over the years the paramilitaries have shown no sign of
dismantling,no sign of ending permanently their terrorist campaign,
that there has come to be such a focus on the question of weapons
decommissioning," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Clinton urged leaders of major parties to
make concessions in order to restore the province's coalition
government and avoid a renewal of violence.
</P>
<P>
"Life is fleeting and opportunities come and go. We have the
chance of a lifetime. Whatever the differences, it's not worth
another life, not one. It's not worth another day's delay,"
Clinton told a gala dinner attended by Adams and Trimble.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said that he was proud of the supporting role he
had played in the peace process, adding that the cease-fires now
are measured in years, not weeks.
</P>
<P>
"I must confess as your friend that I still do not know the
answers," he said, expressing his regrets that the peace process
is in a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told a
regular briefing that the administration did not expect any
breakthrough during Friday's meetings.
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that this is more than just courtesy, but I also don't
anticipate any breakthrough. There are discussions scheduled for
when they return home, and they will continue to try to find a way
through to implementing the Good Friday accords," Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
The Good Friday accords was signed by the parties involved in
the future of the British province of Northern Ireland in 1998.
The peace process runs into an impasse after IRA refused to disarm
and Britain suspended the self-rule in the province in February.

<HEADLINE> Oil-Producing Countries Urged to Increase Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged Friday oil-producing countries to make a "substantial
production increase", big enough to rebuild depleted reserves and
bring down high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Clinton said oil producers deserve "a fair
return" that would avoid the seesawing market that produced 10 U.S.
dollars a barrel in 1998 and more than triple that price today, 14
months later.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had talked with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd about
the need to stabilize oil prices at levels that satisfy both
producing and consuming nations. Saudi Arabia already has said it
favors increasing production.
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody's struggling now to find a consensus,"
Clinton told reporters when asked about the high oil and gasoline
prices Friday during an meeting on gun control issues.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), are expected at a meeting March 27 to agree to
additional production, but no one knows how much or how soon. The
OPEC producers cut production by 4.3 million barrels a day in late
1998 and early 1999, to force prices up from below 10 dollars a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
While those prices were too low, current prices, ranging as
high as 34 dollars a barrel in recent weeks, "have gone way too
high" and threaten to destabilize the world economy, said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"They've got to find the right balance," he said of the OPEC
producers, although adding that the decision on how much more oil
to pump is "for them to make."
</P>
<P>
There has been growing pressure from Congress for the Clinton
administration to order a drawdown of oil from the government's
emergency petroleum reserve, and administration officials have
said that option remains "on the table."
</P>
<P>
But as recently as Wednesday, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
said he would recommend against using the reserve oil of more than
560 million barrels, which is supposed to be there to respond to
emergency supply disruptions and not to influence prices.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes German Lifting Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) - The British Government Friday
applauded Germany's decision to lift a ban imposed on imports of
British beef after outbreaks of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed in 1996 after scientists believed mad cow
disease, or BSE, could spread via infected meat from cattle to
people.
</P>
<P>
The UK's agriculture ministry Nick Brown said it was now up to
the authorities and meat industry representatives to regain
consumer confidence abroad.
</P>
<P>
"I really do hope it has a knock-on effect. France is now
completely isolated on this issue within the EU ...They really
should think again ... they're defying the law, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Farmers Union also welcomed the decision (NFU). "
This was the right decision and leaves France conspicuously out on
a limb in Europe over its illegal ban," NFU President Ben Gill
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
British beef could be back on sale in Germany by early April.
