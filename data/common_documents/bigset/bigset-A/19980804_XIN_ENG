<P>
SHENYANG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Relatives of Lin Ti-chuan, a
Taiwan woman who was reportedly kidnapped and died in Haicheng, a
city in northeast China's Liaoning Province on July 29, today
consented to an autopsy which the Liaoning law enforcement
officials believe will help determine the exact causes of death
and provide critical material evidence.
</P>
<P>
Related departments in Haicheng, the city in which Lin was
abducted and died as the result of an alleged economic dispute,
have consulted with Lin's relatives since their arrival on August
1. Lin's relatives agreed to the autopsy after consulting with
local legal and medical experts.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached an agreement this afternoon, with
Huang Zhaoxing representing the slain woman's family. A press
conference was held a short time later to brief journalists.
</P>
<P>
The agreement says Haicheng departments investigating the
case will arrange the autopsy on Lin's body, with Chen Yaochang, a
friend on the family, observing related procedures.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls a timetable for completing the autopsy and
returning the remains to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin's relatives expressed gratitude for the support and
assistance granted by Haicheng officials over the past several
days.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Israel to Step up Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Israel have decided to
strengthen cooperation in the fields of tourism, business and
technology.
</P>
<P>
This was stressed by Cypriot Minister of Trade, Industry and
Tourism Nicos Rolandis on Monday, after a meeting with Israeli
Ambassador to Cyprus Semi Tzur.
</P>
<P>
Rolandis said Israeli tourists travelling to Cyprus are on the
rise. "In the first five months of this year Israeli tourists
increased fourfold, in comparison to last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting 80,000 to 90,000 (Israeli tourists) this
year, whereas last year around 50,000 Israelis visited Cyprus,"
the Cypriot minister added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ambassador said Cyprus has become an attraction to
Israeli tourists and their number is growing monthly and daily.
</P>
<P>
Referring to business and technological cooperation between the
two countries, Tzur said Rolandis will soon visit his country to
advance cooperation in the high technology sector.
</P>
<P>
A Cypriot government delegation recently visited Israel and was
optimistic about the future of technological cooperation between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Israeli businessmen dealing in the high technology area, on
the other hand, are interested in investing in Cyprus together
with Cypriot businessmen, because of the island's relations with
the European Union.

<HEADLINE> China Waiting for Indonesia's True Action to Protect Ethnic Chinese: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here Monday that China is now waiting for the result
of the investigation and further action of the Indonesian
government on the brutalities against ethnic Chinese during the
riots in May.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is greatly concerned with the situation
of the ethnic Chinese and Chinese nationals living in Indonesia,
Tang told reporters at the airport upon his arrival here Monday
evening after visiting the Philippines and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the Chinese government attaches great importance to
the incidents in Indonesia and demanded through diplomatic
channels on many occasions the Indonesian side seriously punish
the rioters who committed the brutalities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also called on the Indonesian side to
take forceful and effective measures to safeguard the personal
safety and legitimate rights and interests of the ethnic Chinese
and Chinese nationals in Indonesia, and prevent such incidents
from recurrence.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that during the riots that took place in some cities
in Indonesia in May, many shops owned by Chinese Indonesians were
ransacked and burned and many ethnic Chinese women were savagely
raped.
</P>
<P>
"It is natural that these criminal acts have sparked grave
concern and strong indignation among the people in China and the
overseas Chinese societies," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that all the staff of the Chinese
embassy in Indonesia worked around the clock and followed closely
the developments of the situation.
</P>
<P>
They also took risk to help many ethnic Chinese and Chinese
nationals out of danger, Tang said, adding that the Chinese
ambassador made solemn representations many times to the
Indonesian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tang said, the spokesman of the Chinese Foreign
Ministry clearly stated the position of the Chinese government
time and again.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Tang said, he addressed the issue of the ethnic
Chinese and Chinese nationals living in Indonesia when he attended
the ASEAN Regional Forum meeting in Manila and he also discussed
the issue with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted on those occasions that the Chinese Indonesians have
worked hard for many decades and have made indelible contributions
to Indonesia's economic development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
When the Indonesian economy is in serious trouble after the
East Asian financial crisis, the ethnic Chinese are still making
unremitting efforts to help lift that country out of the economic
predicament and maintain its social stability, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The status of the ethnic Chinese should be respected and their
personal safety and legitimate rights and interests should be
fully protected. They should be treated the same as all Indonesian
citizens, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang strongly demanded the Indonesian government take the
incidents seriously and take effective measures as soon as
possible to safeguard the personal safety and legitimate rights
and interests of the ethnic Chinese and Chinese nationals and
severely punish those held accountable.
</P>
<P>
Tang quoted Alatas as saying that such incidents are a shame
for Indonesia and that Indonesian President B.J. Habibie also
admitted the incidents as "the most inhuman event."
</P>
<P>
Habibie has ordered the establishment of a special
investigation committee on the incident, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has pledged that it will punish the rioters and take
necessary measures to prevent such incidents from happening again,
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"We are now waiting to see what results the special
investigation committee will announce and what conclusions it will
 come to," Tang told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We are also watching closely what forceful and effective
measures the Indonesian side will take to safeguard the personal
safety and legitimate rights and interests of the ethnic Chinese
and Chinese nationals in Indonesia and to prevent the recurrence
of such incidents," Tang noted.

<HEADLINE> More Overseas Chinese Want Children to Learn Native Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Just as most German children,
Tian Tian, an 11-year-old overseas Chinese boy living in
Nuremberg, Germany, enjoys computers and basketball. But unlike
his foreign counterparts, she must learn Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Tian Tian finds it difficult to learn Chinese
characters. Nonetheless, the young boy has learned more than 1,000
characters, and can read Chinese newspapers. In addition, two
of his compositions have been published in the overseas edition of
Beijing-based People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Tian Tian and his parents have been invited to visit Beijing to
participate in a summer language camp organized by People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The young boy and 80 overseas Chinese children from the United
States, Japan, Canada, Britain and France will study the
language, culture, history and geography of China.
</P>
<P>
"Tian Tian arrived in Germany at the age of two and few
difference remain between him and his German friends," said Pang
Xiaobin, his mother. "We're Chinese and it is imperative
for him to learn Chinese."
</P>
<P>
"He has few opportunities to learn Chinese in Germany, so we
teach him at home. We also speak Chinese at home," said Pang.
</P>
<P>
She expressed hope that Tian Tian will learn another 3,000
Chinese characters and be able to easily communicate in the
language within the next three years. Reaching the goal will
require Tian Tian to learn three characters per day over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
Although not exactly fond of language study, Tian Tian loves
Chinese food and he often invites his German friends home for
dinner.
</P>
<P>
"We want to maintain more Chinese traditions, and have brought
Tian Tian to China every year since 1992. This time we want him
receive a patriotic education and hope the camp will develop his
interest in Chinese culture," said Pang.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of overseas Chinese children can
understand and speak Chinese, while a much lower percentage can
read and write, said Chen, who hopes to provide more opportunities
for children to study Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In addition to learning spoken Chinese and calligraphy, writing
compositions and exchanging overseas experienced, the children will
visit the Palace Museum, Summer Palace, Great Wall and Temple of
Heaven, in addition to viewing the national flag-raising ceremony
in Tian'anmen Square.

<HEADLINE> India Offers Composite Dialogue With Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee Monday offered a direct and composite dialogue
with Pakistan to resolve all outstanding issues, including Jammu
and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue must address the totality of the relationship and
not be pursued in a narrow, segmented fashion which would defeat
its very purpose of building a wide-ranging and enduring
relationship, Vajpayee told upper and lower houses of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
A direct bilateral interaction covering Indo-Pakistan
differences in a rational and realistic manner and seeking
confidence-building through cooperation in functional areas and
people-to-people contact would help create a positive climate for
purposefully addressing difficult issues under discussion between
the two sides, according to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Replying to clarification sought by parliamentarians on his
statement on the 10th summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in Colombo, Sri Lanka, last week,
Vajpayee rejected any third party mediation to resolve the Kashmir
issue.
</P>
<P>
On recent conflicts in Kashmir between the two neighbors, the
Indian prime minister put the blame on Pakistan, saying the border
attacks by Pakistan would be firmly dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said his government would take all measures to
safeguard lives to people along the line of actual control, and
that security forces would be fully backed in their efforts to
repulse Pakistan's nefarious designs.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that diplomatic initiatives taken by his government
after India's nuclear tests in May had brought about a greater
understanding of New Delhi's position.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee informed the parliament that during his talks with
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on July 29 on the sidelines
of the 10th SAARC summit in Colombo, he reiterated India's
commitment to developing peaceful and friendly ties with Pakistan
and New Delhi's interest in a "secure, stable and prosperous
Pakistan".

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Undergoes Successful Colon Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz Monday has undergone a successful colon operation, the
Saudi Royal Palace announced.
</P>
<P>
The palace was quoted by official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) as
saying in a statement that King Fahd was suffering from an
inflamed colon which was successfully treated.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the king was feeling well after the
surgery. He would remain in hospital for a few days for
recuperation, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi monarch was admitted to King Faisal Specialist
Hospital in Riyadh Sunday for medical tests. He traveled from the
Red Sea city of Jeddah, where he usually spends his summer
holidays.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd, 77, was admitted in hospital last March for
treating an infection on the gall bladder.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, he suffered from a health setback caused by fatigue
and stress, and upon the doctors' advice spent a three-month
period of recuperation, during which the state affairs were
managed by Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd, who took power in 1982, is the fifth monarch of
Saudi Arabia, which was founded by his late father, Abdul-Aziz
Al-Saud in 1931.

<HEADLINE> Russia Concerned with Tension in Cyprus: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A Russian envoy Monday expressed
concern over increasing tension on the Cyprus island, but defended
his country's sale of the surface-to-air missile system to Greek
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting here with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides, Russian Foreign Ministry envoy for
Cyprus Vladimir Tchizhov said Nicosia's decision to buy the S-300
missiles is not the reason for tension in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"The S-300s are not the reason for which the dialog stopped and
there is no movement for a Cyprus settlement," Tchizhov said.
</P>
<P>
He added the "tension will exist for as long as the impasse
continues and it is possible that it will increase."
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy also expressed concern with the lack of
progress in the Cyprus peace effort and said "today we are a step
behind where we were a year ago."
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders
were held in the U.S. and Switzerland last year, but produced no
breakthrough. Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of
the talks to protest against a European Union (EU) decision to
start membership talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said he will not participate in peace talks
unless his breakaway state in northern Cyprus is recognized and
Cyprus withdraws its application to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been mounting on the island since the missile
contract was struck early last year. The missiles are is scheduled
to be deployed on the east Mediterranean island late this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which landed troops and seized the north third of the
island in 1974 in the wake of an abortive coup seeking union with
Greece, and has maintained some 35,000 troops there, threatened to
launch preemptive strike to prevent the missiles'' deployment.
</P>
<P>
Tchizhov reiterated Moscow's support to the efforts exerted by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to settle the Cyprus problem and
said Russia backs the island's demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974. Turkey Cypriots
declared a breakaway state in 1983, which was recognized only by
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Law Banning Strikes Said to Be Gazetted in Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Recently gazetted laws banning
strikes in essential services and giving police wide powers to
control public gatherings and demonstrations in Zimbabwe were
published in error, the attorney-general's office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Attorney-General Patrick Chinamasa said the
purported statutory instruments, namely the emergency powers in
declaration of essential service notice, law and order
maintenance for control of firearms and explosives and the law
and order maintenance on holding of public gatherings regulations
were invalid.
</P>
<P>
He said, "none of the instruments was seen or approved by the
responsible minister or the president, so apart from being
erroneous their publication was invalid and does not in any way
represent the policy of the government."
</P>
<P>
Authoritative sources Monday said they were surprised by the
publication of the regulations as they had never been debated in
cabinet, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a bad mix-up which has caused a lot of damage to
the country's image," said a source in the Office of the
President and Cabinet, adding that President Robert Mugabe was
livid when he first saw the reports about the laws as he had
never seen or sanctioned them.

<HEADLINE> Rediscount Rate Increased in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's central bank Monday
increased its rediscount rate from 31.5 to 35 percent with
immediate effect as part of efforts to arrest further
depreciation of the Zimbabwean Dollar against major currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said in statement that the Zimbabwean
Dollar had recently come under speculative pressure resulting in
further depreciation to levels "beyond those compatible with
economic fundamentals and developments in international currency
markets".
</P>
<P>
This situation had left the bank with no option but to increase
the rediscount rate in order to bring stability to the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
This also came on the back of a weaker South African Rand,
Zimbabwe's major trading currency partner and rising domestic
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Real rates had also been eroded due to a progressive increase in
domestic prices from 20.1 percent in December 1997 to about 30
percent in 1998, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government Unilaterally Declares Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government
unilaterally declared a ceasefire with rebels in southern Sudan on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The truce will start on Tuesday "to contain the humanitarian
situation in southern Sudan," where at least 1 million people are
facing starvation, said a government statement, but without
mentioning the duration of the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
In a press release Minister of State with the Sudanese Foreign
Ministry Ali Al-Nomeiri expressed his government's hope that the
Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) would respond to the
government decision to make the ceasefire a permanent one in south
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The decision will serve to facilitate the opening of
check-points and passages for the human relief workers, Al-Nomeiri
said, describing the situation as very bad in the area.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came on the eve of the August 4-6 negotiations
between the warring parties in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia with an aim
to end the 15-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA led by John Garang is now the only rebel group
continuing fighting the government for autonomy of the
predominantly Christian and animist region from the Muslim
north. At least 1.5 million people have died since the insurgence
started in 1983.
</P>
<P>
There are about 2.6 million people in southern Sudan suffering
from lack of food. Fighting and drought are making the situation
worse.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Denies Involving in Congo (K) Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
strongly rejected accusations by Democratic Congo that its troops
are behind the on-going rebellion in the capital Kinshasa and
eastern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis now rising in Kinshasa and the Eastern part of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is purely an internal matter,
and the government of Rwanda is not involved in it any way," a
statement issued by Rwandan Minister of Foreign Affairs Anastase
Gasana Monday afternoon said.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda News Agency, in a dispatch to Xinhua here, quoted
the statement as saying that Rwanda, as a good neighbor, provided
assistance to the Congolese to topple late Zairean dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko from power.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Rwanda is happy that the Congolese are now
liberated," said the statement, which was read by the radio in
French and Swahili.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government provides support to Congo (K) which is
still faced with hostile forces opposing its rebirth, the
statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The government of Rwanda claims that for a period of a year,
and basing on the fact that the Congolese now can handle their
own problems alone, it withdrew her military training force from
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"The complete departure of the said Rwandan military force was
organized and supervised by Congolese senior officers, who
provided it with necessary logistics and transport facilities and
accompanied it, satisfactorily to both parties, back to Rwanda,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, troops opposing Kabila, have rebelled in Goma
and Bukavu towns, bordering Rwanda, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The border between Rwanda and DRC has been closed, and about
500 people are said to have crossed into Rwandan town of
Cyangugu, fearing that fighting might broke out in Bukavu.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for End to Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordan on Monday called for an end
to the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister for Development Affairs and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Jawad Anani said the sanction problem
is the the most outstanding issue that must be solved now.
</P>
<P>
He called for the solving of all the problems left over by the
Gulf War (1990-91) in a statement released to the official Petra
news agency on the 8th anniversary of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions have brought too much suffering to the Iraqi
people and should be lifted as soon as possible, said Anani.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when the U.N. chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler is meeting with Iraqi officials in Baghdad on the
destruction of weapons of mass destruction in the country.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions can only be lifted when the U.N. inspectors
verify that Iraq is free of those weapons.
</P>
<P>
Another big problem left over by the Gulf War is the detention
of Kuwaiti war prisoners in Iraq, which has made many Kuwaiti
families heart-broken year after year, Anani said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq should release the prisoners in a short time to make their
families reunite, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has said Iraq has been detaining over 600 Kuwaitis since
the end of the Gulf War, but Iraq has denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
Overcoming the problems involving Kuwait and Iraq, two Arab
countries, is very important for the future of the Arab world,
said Anani.
</P>
<P>
All the concerned sides should contribute efforts in this
regard in order to help establish an "Arab reconciliation," the
minister added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Leaders Inquire Saudi King's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, on Monday inquired about the heath of
King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz, the Lebanese National News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The ailing king, 77, was admitted to hospital for medical
check-up on Sunday for the second time in less than six months,
and underwent a successful colon operation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi and Hariri telephoned Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah,
Defense Minister Prince Sultan separately.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi leaders reportedly told the Lebanese leaders that the
king's condition was stable, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd has been suffering from poor health for several
years. He underwent gall bladder surgery in 1994 and suffered a
stroke in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
In January 1996, he handed over the affairs of state to Crown
Prince Abdullah but re-assumed power seven weeks later.
</P>
<P>
His health has long been in the limelight in the world as his
rich country enjoys some one third of global oil reserve.

</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett said in a
statement issued early Monday that London will stage this
"ground-breaking" ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting) on child exploitation
on October 6-8.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. General Assembly President Visits Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The current President of the
United Nations General Assembly Guinadi Audvedenko Monday arrived
here on a visit at the invitation of Lebanese Foreign Minister
Fares Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
According to the state-run National News Agency, Boueiz will
request the senior U.N. official to exert maximum efforts in order
to master international support for Lebanon's stance over the
recent Israeli withdrawal proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis offered to pull out of south Lebanon but linked
the implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 with
Lebanese government's security guarantee for their northern
borders.
</P>
<P>
This was rejected by Lebanon and its ally Syria, who insisted
that the withdrawal must be unconditional, as called for by the
resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The United States and U.N. chief Kofi Annan, however, have
called the Israeli offer a positive step.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria therefore launched an international campaign
to confront the Israeli "maneuver" and called on the
international community to press Israel to fully abide by the
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz believed the weighty U.N. General Assembly can have,
through Audvedenko's high position, a considerable leverage to let
the Jewish state pull its troops from Lebanon, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 after two invasions, with the claimed aim of
protecting its northern villages from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Audvedenko will hold meetings with
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.

<P>
CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will construct a pipeline that will quadruple
the natural gas production in the North Sinai area.
</P>
<P>
The new pipeline will carry natural gas byproducts from the
offshore gas fields of Port Said on the Mediterranean, run below
the Suez Canal, and reach the eastern part of the canal and Sinai.
</P>
<P>
The new project is designed to transfer the new gas
explorations of Port Said to fields that will produce four times
as much gas, namely, from a current 112 million cubic feet per
day, to 463 million cubic feet per day, Minister of Petroleum
Hamdi Al Banbi said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Banbi, who paid a visit to the governorate of North Sinai,
added the gas pipeline is to carry gas byproducts as part of the
national gas network at a cost of 164 million dollars and will
take two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
The project will also provide for the needs of power stations
and industrial zones west and east of the Suez Canal and North and
South Sinai, he said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The General Authority for Investment and Free Zones
Chairman Ibrahim Fawzi has said non-Arab foreign contributions to
investment projects in Egypt increased to 651 million U.S. dollars
in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
This indicates an increase of 25 percent compared with the same
period of last year, Fawzi told a meeting Saturday night with
members of the American-Egyptian Chamber of Commerce in Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The Authority is currently negotiating with the French auto
manufacturer Peugeot on setting up a car motor plant at Ismailia
free-trade zone in northeastern Egypt, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi pointed out that doubling Egyptian exports to foreign
markets is a main target of the government.
</P>
<P>
He said the Egyptian government is studying a report by the
authority on the importance that companies specialized in
exporting to foreign markets should enjoy tax breaks, privileges,
guarantees and the incentives provided for in the Investment Law
No. 8 for 1997.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemen's Ministry of Oil and Mineral Resources
predicted that the exportation of the Yemeni gas will start in
2003. This is the first time the government admits the delay of
the project which was originally slated for 2001.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Al-Hayat newspaper quoted a report of the ministry as
saying that 5.3 million tonnes of gas is expected to be exported
annually which will bring in revenue, according to the government
forecasts, between 650 and 750 million U.S. dollars.

Mostafa Moazenzadeh announced Monday that the country has produced
1.5 million tonnes of steel products out of 1.8 million tonnes of
unprocessed steel in the first four months of the current Iranian
year (starting from March 21).
</P>
<P>
He said that about 5.5 million tonnes of steel products were
produced last year, expressing hope that export of steel products
would earn the country 350 million dollars in this Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's foreign exchange revenue will drop to 9
billion dollars this Iranian year from 14 billion dollars in the
previous year, deputy governor of the Central Bank of Iran
Mohammad Jafar Mojarad stated here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted him as saying that 3.5

problem, various measures would be taken including use of the
foreign exchange assets and sale of oil in advance.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has retrenched 62,653 civil servants from its bloated
bureaucracy, Minister of State for Central Establishment Mateo
Qaresi announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moving 1998/99 budget estimates for his office at the National
Assembly in central Dodoma, he said the civil servants were laid
off from the central and local governments between 1993 and this
year.
</P>
<P>
He told parliament, however, that the government will no
longer lay off civil servants on a large scale unless the number
of them is found to be in excess, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Qaresi said his office has established that some of those
retrenched are yet to be paid their rightful dues and appealed to
the affected to send relevant particulars for payment.
</P>
<P>
The minister promised that the government will take
disciplinary action against those who willingly postpone issuing
benefits to the retrenchees.
</P>
<P>
Next January, the government will introduce an open
performance appraisal system to increase working efficiency of
civil servants, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government is preparing a "result oriented
management" system which will specify job description of every
civil servant, Qaresi said.
</P>
<P>
The system to be applicable in all ministries and independent
departments is geared toward more efficiency and productivity.
</P>
<P>
Qaresi said his office has established a unit responsible for
overseeing observation of ethics in offices with a view to
enforcing standing regulations and procedures.
</P>
<P>
Since the unit was established in January this year, it has
received numerous complaints from the public and workers with
regard to corruption, indiscipline, absenteeism and drunkenness,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Permanent Commission of Inquiry received
3,727 complaints in the last fiscal year (from July of 1997 to
June of 1998), 927 of which have been dealt with and 2,810 are
being heard.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Monday urged India and
Pakistan to settle their territorial disputes over Kashmir through
dialogue, but said the recent shootouts on the border were "no
reason for panic".
</P>
<P>
"The firing over the past few days is certainly a negative
development," Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said,
"but such incidents occur in the Summer, when snow melts in the
mountains and it becomes easier to cross the border."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Moscow's call for dialogue over Kashmir, noting
that both sides seem to be ready to talk, the Interfax new agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Clashes have increased along the line of control since India
and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in May, with each country
accusing the other of firing across the line first.
</P>
<P>
In the latest development, the Associated Press of Pakistan
(APP) said that the Pakistan army "blasted" an Indian base and
killed a large number of troops on Monday in an exchange of firing
in the Kashmir region.
</P>
<P>
APP said the Monday action was in response to "unprovoked
Indian firing" across a military control line, adding that at
least three people were killed on the Pakistan-controlled side of
Kashmir on Monday by Indian firing, raising the toll in five days
to 60.
</P>
<P>
India has put the death toll on their side at more than 30,
reports said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) is to present the new cabinet to the
Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) for approval on Wednesday,
PLC Press Office said in Ramallah on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's PLC special session in Ramallah, President
Arafat will present to the Council the new cabinet, and possibly a
ministerial statement, and after discussions the PLC will vote on
the new cabinet, the Office said.
</P>
<P>
The PLC has been demanding changes in Arafat's cabinet since
last summer, because of suspicions of corruption by PNA
ministries.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen of Arafat's 18 cabinet ministers offered their
resignations a year ago under pressure from legislators, but
Arafat took no action at the time.
</P>
<P>
Only in January this year did Arafat announce that he would
carry out a cabinet reshuffle. On June 24, he announced that he
accepted the year-old resignations and asked for some time to
carry out the changes.
</P>
<P>
Arafat then carried out political consulations with different
political parties and invited them to join the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is said to invite some economic experts and academics to
join his new cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Mogadishu Administration Set up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Candidates for the
administration of Somali capital Mogadishu were announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed were nominated as
the two co-chairmen of the supreme council, while Mohamed Qanyare
Afrah, Abdi Osman Farah, Osman Ali Atto and Musa Sudi Yalahow
were named as their deputies.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people including faction leaders Osman Ali Atto
and Muss Sudi Yalahow from all parts of the country have been
included in the supreme council for Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Ali Ahmed was officially nominated as the governor of
the capital and Colonel Abdi Hassan Awale named to be the head
of the future police force of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The date for the opening of the main installations of
Mogadishu, the airport and sea ports, are supposed to be August 4
or tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
This is the most difficult issue since Osman Ali Atto and many
other rivals within all factions of Mogadishu are trying to
oppose this administration.
</P>
<P>
The political situation in the Somali capital has been sketchy
following an exhaustingly long meeting by the faction leaders
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by faction leaders like Ali Mahdi
Mohamed, Hussein Mohamed Aidid, Osman Ali Atto, Mohamed Qanyareh
Afrah and many others, was aimed at concluding the formation of
Mogadishu's long-awaited administration.
</P>
<P>
Even though the meeting was behind closed doors, sources close
to the faction lenders said a serious argument over who would
sign the 10-page document for the transitional charter of the 16
districts of the capital has led to the abandonment of the
meeting by Osman Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
The meeting then continued without Osman Ali Atto. And the
rest agreed to fill Osman Atto's seat with his interior secretary
Colonel Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdid who fell out with his boss for
the modalities of Mogadishu's administration.
</P>
<P>
At 16:00 hours local time Monday, the faction leaders met
again at Villa Somalia, the former headquarters of the late
regime and the current base of Hussein Mohamed Aidid, where a
ceremony for the announcement of an administration for Mogadishu
was held.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Abdi Qeybdid, the interior secretary of Osman Ali
Atto, was the last to arrive to fill Osman Atto's place.
</P>
<P>
In the ceremony, Ahmed Dahir Kiar, the former secretary of
Hussein Aidid and the secretary of the new council, read the
names of the administration and its charter for the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of cheering people, hundreds of heavily armed
militiamen with more than one hundred battle wagons have gathered
around the headquarters of Hussein Mohamed Aidid for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
Loud speakers mounted in the area played the national anthem,
patriotic songs and those especially sung for festivals. Dozens
of street vendors with wheel barrows and other mobile grapefruit
juice makers also made the scene exceptionally vivid.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Greece could
work together well in the future, U.S. ambassador in Greece
Nicholas Burns said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his talks with Greek Foreign Undersecretary
Yiannos Kranidiotis, Burns described as "excellent" the talks
which covered a wide range of issues including Greek-U.S.
relations, Greek -Turkish relations and the Cyprus problem, the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Burns, who also had talks with Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos last week, said that U.S. and Greece were working very
closely on all these problems.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador added that his talks with both Pangalos and
Kranidiotis were evidence that the recent tension in Greek-U.S.
relations was over, and the two countries "can and will work
together well in the future."
</P>
<P>
Pangalos criticized recently U.S. President Bill Clinton for
not fulfilling his promise to solve the Cyprus problem, and
Washington reacted angrily that such remarks could damage the good
relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Talks Between UNSCOM, Iraq Break Down, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing talks on weapons
inspection between the U.N. chief arms inspector Richard Butler
and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz broke down, a
U.N. source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that such a thing happened in the
history of the relationship between Iraq and UNSCOM (the
U.N. Special Commission on disarmament in Iraq), which indicates
that their relations are worsening.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. source told Xinhua that the talks broke down soon
after the second round of talks between UNSCOM headed by Butler
and Iraqi side headed by Aziz started.
</P>
<P>
Then Butler made a phone call to the President of the Security
Council and informed the Security Council of the current
situation, said the U.N. source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The source said Butler had turned down a proposal from the
UNSCOM delegation that he hold one-to-one talks with Aziz to save
the talks.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM-Iraq talks were scheduled to last two days from
Monday to Tuesday. Under the current situation, the UNSCOM
delegation will probably leave Baghdad on Tuesday morning, a day
earlier than scheduled, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Butler said after the second round of talks that the talks have
reached an impasse and may have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we are going to meet tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day after the end of the first round of talks,
Aziz criticized Butler for continuing his same old working style
of ignoring essential issues of disarmament, while focusing minor
and insignificant issues to waste time, prolong work and distort
the picture of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Butler's working style served the U.S. policy which
wanted to keep the U.N. sanctions in place.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait. They can only be lifted after the U.N. weapons
inspectors verify that the country is free of weapons of mass
destruction.

LAGOS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Liberian Defense Minister Daniel
Chea has accused neighboring Guinea of planning to destabilize
his country, warning that Liberia would resist "militarily" any
destabilization attempt, a report reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted as saying that his government would
"militarily resist any attempt by Guinea to destabilize Liberia
and plunge this nation into turmoil."
</P>
<P>
He added that "the Liberian security network has confirmed
intelligence reports from Guinea that about 800 individuals are
being trained in Guinea to be dispatched to Liberia under the
cover of ECOMOG (West African Peace Monitoring Force) to
overthrow the one-year-old government of Liberia."
</P>
<P>
Chea said in an interview published Monday on Liberian
newspapers that "there will be no additional ECOMOG troops,
especially from Guinea. Anything to the contrary will be met with
force."
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Liberian President Charles Taylor
said that there was nothing wrong with armed security men on the
streets of Monrovia, arguing that "the security situation of
Liberia coming out of war is still a dangerous one."
</P>
<P>
Students and representatives of youth of the West African
country made appeals over the weekend, saying that the presence
of armed men on the streets remind them of the war.
</P>

But, Taylor said that most of those carrying arms on the
streets were former fighters drawn from all dissolved factions
and given at least five months of special training.

LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) - HSBC Holdings plc made a profit
before tax of 3686 million US dollars in the first six months of
1998, a fall of 599 million, or 14 percent, over the same period
in 1997, Keith Whitson, Group Chief Executive said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, Whitson told reporters at a press conference that net
interest income of 5651 million US dollars was 406 million, or 8
percent, higher than the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Other operating income rose by 735 million US dollars, or 21
percent, to 4318 million US dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
The charge for bad and doubtful debts was 1146 million US
dollars, which was 889 million US dollars higher than in the first
half of 1997, reflecting the continuing downturn within Asia and
deterioration in asset quality in several economies, according to
an interim report released at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Whitson also said the economic difficulties in Asia have had a
marked effect on the performance of certain parts of HSBC
Holdings' loan portfolio, but it "remains well placed within the
financial markets in which it operates."
</P>
<P>
While it is difficult to predict when Asia's economies will
recover, Whitson believes that "they will emerge after a period of
painful restructuring stronger and more competitive than before."

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Bankers Strike over Loan Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 12,000 Kenyan unionizable
bank workers staged a strike Monday in a bid to force the
government to scrap a tax on their low-interest staff loans and
fringe benefits.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of customers waited outside their branch offices,
while senior management staff in commercial banks provided
essential foreign exchange services and dealt with client
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Joseph Ngutu held tripartite talks with leaders
of the bankers' umbrella union, the Central Organization of Trade
Unions (COTU) and the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE), but
failed to find a solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The executive committee of All Banks Shop Stewards, which
called the strike, rejected the tripartite arrangement.
</P>
<P>
At a separate meeting, committee chairman Jacob Opiyo pledged
"an all-out standoff until the matter is conclusively resolved."
</P>
<P>
The strike has affected 63 banks and non-bank financial
institutions, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currency trade was severely hampered by the strike,
dealers said Monday. The central bank posted the Shilling at a
mean rate of 59.1500 against the U.S. Dollar from 59.0472 Friday.
</P>
<P>
A strike over the same issue paralyzed banking services
earlier this year but was called off when the government
suspended implementation of the tax.
</P>
<P>
The tax was re-imposed in June and a tax on other fringe
benefits was also introduced with the government citing the
current economic difficulties.

JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government Monday condemned the latest "senseless" killings of
civilians in Rwanda, the Foreign Affairs Department said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government condemns these latest senseless
attacks on innocent civilians as blatant acts of terrorism,
calculated to destabilize the efforts of the Rwandan government
and people to achieve justice and reconciliation after the
genocide of 1994," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to latest reports, rebels in Rwanda said to be
linked to the former Rwandan government killed 102 people in an
attack on a rural village about 60 kilometers north of the
capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria urged all parties involved in the violence to cease
their actions immediately and to stop pursuing a course which
would further delay the establishment of lasting peace in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"It is the (South African) government's conviction that these
actions have a clearly detrimental effect on the efforts of the
continent as a whole to bring about a better life for all its
people," said the statement.

The new proclamation and decree stipulate that additional
incentives will be given to entrepreneurs engaging in areas that
require big investment and have strategic significance, Haile
said.

<P>
He said entrepreneurs who invest in the new fields can import
capital goods and equipment free of custom's tax and the sectors
will also be free from income tax.

The general manager also said special attention is given to
invest in areas of education and health.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Forwards Letter to SEF (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) today sent a letter to the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) in Taiwan, expressing "strong
dissatisfaction and regret" over the latter's performance related
to the recent death of Lin Ti-chuan.
</P>
<P>
Lin, a Taiwan woman, was allegedly kidnapped and consequently
died in Haicheng, northeast China's Liaoning Province, in late
July.
</P>
<P>
ARATS noted that it had received five letters from SEF between
July 30 and August 3 concerning Lin's tragic death.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary investigation indicates the Lin's death was the
direct result of a business dispute between Wei Diangang, Lin's
boyfriend, and Li Guangzhi, director of the Dalian representative
office of Haicheng's Huamei Industrial Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"Local public security departments are handling the unfortunate
incident as a criminal case and are extending every possible
effort to uncover clues and apprehend the perpetrator(s),"
according to the letter. It goes on to say that ARATS has sent deputy
secretary-general Liu Gangqi to Haicheng to ensure Lin's family
receives all possible assistance.
</P>
<P>
The letter notes that ARATS and relevant departments joined in
a coordinated efforts to ensure Lin's family and relatives enjoyed
convenient transit through Hong Kong and entry to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"The allegations of some people in Taiwan that the family
encountered difficulties are absolutely untrue," according to the
letter.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Forwards Letter to SEF (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It also points out that SEF letters have repeatedly contained
groundless accusations that ARATS has refused to allow its
staffers to assist Lin's family with the case.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that the usual practice is for ARATS and SEF to
entrust each other with the responsibility to protect the
respective rights, interests, safety and personal property of
Taiwan compatriots and mainland residents involved in
cross-Straits incidents," according to the letter.
</P>
<P>
It adds that "facts prove the practice to be an unimpeded and
effective method which is in line with the current situation for
the cross-Straits relations."
</P>
<P>
The letter stresses that ARATS has never sent staffers to Taiwan
to assist in cases involving the personal safety or property of
mainland residents, while SEF staffers have never visited the
mainland to assist in cases involving Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
"Despite your clear understanding on this point, you have
repeatedly sent letters containing false accusations," says the
letter. "People on both sides of the Straits feel deep remorse
over Lin's case and we hold that you are taking advantage of the
incident to deliberately create and exacerbate differences in
order to sow dissension between compatriots across the straits."
</P>
<P>
"We hereby express our strong dissatisfaction and regret," says
the letter.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that SEF has also accused public security
departments on the mainland of "attempting to force Lin's family
to agree to an autopsy."
</P>
<P>
"Autopsies are part of legal procedures public security
departments must follow when investigating murder cases," said the
letter. "Public security departments on the mainland went to great
links to obtain the consent of Lin's family."
</P>
<P>
It adds that "SEF should understand the situation and cease and
desist in attempts to disrupt the investigation."
</P>
<P>
ARATS pledged to continue efforts to return Lin's remains to
Taiwan in accordance the wishes of her family and relevant
mainland regulations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chief Justice Rules White House Lawyers Must </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chief Justice William
Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that White
House lawyers must testify in the probe of alleged presidential
sex and cover-up, even as an appeal continues.
</P>
<P>
In a verbal ruling, Rehnquist rejected an attempt to prevent or
at least delay the testimony of Bruce Lindsey, a longtime adviser
for President Bill Clinton, and Lanny Breuer, a White House damage
control expert.
</P>
<P>
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had subpoenaed Breuer to
appear on Tuesday before the grand jury investigating accusations
that Clinton had an affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky and then pressured her and others to lie about it --
allegations Clinton has denied.
</P>
<P>
Both Breuer and Lindsey have testified previously to the grand
jury, but claimed the attorney-client privilege against divulging
confidential conversations with clients in refusing to testify
about some matters involving Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Starr's team has argued that as government lawyers, they should
be compelled to testify completely, and a federal judge and an
appeals court panel agreed. The White House has appealed that
decision to the Supreme Court and also asked for a stay that would
prevent the lawyers' testimony while the case proceeds.
Rehnquist's ruling denied that request.
</P>
<P>
However, Lindsey is not expected to be able to testify this
week as he is recovering from back surgery.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission approved
on Tuesday a humanitarian aid worth 45 million ECU (49.5 million
U.S. dollars) for Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The aid, to be managed by the European Community Humanitarian
Office, will be used to assist the people facing food shortages in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, has granted 66 million ECU (72.6 million dollars)
of aid to Sudan so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The new aid will co-fund the activities of the World Food
Program and other international organizations working to alleviate
the hunger-stricken region of Bahr El Ghazal.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 20 million ECU (22 million dollars) will fund the
aid programs to be conducted by the World Food Program, the United
Nations Children's Fund and the International Committee of the Red
Cross, while 25 million ECU (27.5 million dollars) will fund a
special program concerning food aid and food security by the World
Food Program.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program estimated that 700,000 people needed
emergency food aid in rebel-controlled areas of Bahr El Ghazal as
of early June, as compared to 250,000 people at the start of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The organization plans to get 15,000 tons of food a month to
aid a target population of 2.4 million people in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that a combination of drought and
escalating conflict has aggravated the food crisis in the Bahr El
Ghazal province in southern Sudan.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban
militia Tuesday continued advance in northern Afghanistan and
captured another province of Sar-e-pol, a Taliban official said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces made advance from two fronts -- Qliazar and
Tashkurghan -- and overran Sar-e-pol, located between Faryab and
Jowzjan provinces, said Saeedur Rehman, Taliban's diplomat in
Pakistan, reported the private News Network International (NNI).
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban official did not give any figures of
casualties on both sides during the offensive, NNI said.
</P>
<P>
No independent confirmation was immediately available.
</P>
<P>
Sar-e-pol was previously held by forces loyal to warlord Rashid
Dostum, one of the strongmen in the anti-Taliban northern
alliance.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the student militia captured Dostum's native
stronghold of Shiberghan, capital of Jowzjan province, and are
poised to march on Mazar-e-Sharif, around 12 km east of
Shiberghan.
</P>
<P>
Mazar-e-Sharif is the headquarters of the northern alliance
composed of forces led by Dostum, former Afghan military chief
Ahmad Masood and Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat.
</P>
<P>
After capturing Sar-e-pol, the Taliban have blocked the way of
the alliance forces' attack on Shiberghan.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Industrial Index Slips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's industrial index, the
barometer of the country's economic performance, continued its
downward trend Tuesday, losing 216.97 points to close at 6655.60.
</P>
<P>
The stock market, Africa's second largest one, was quietly
active and again weaker Tuesday, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the industrial index was likely to continue on
its downward trend in the absence of news to excite the market.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe raised its rediscount rate Monday
by 3.5 percent points to 35 percent to defend the Zimbabwean
Dollar which had fallen by 12.5 percent under heavy speculative
attack.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Dollar fell to a nine-month low against the
U.S. Dollar on Monday due to heavy import demand and lack of
support from the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said commercial banks were likely to hike interest
rates to above 40 percent in the wake of an increase in the

<HEADLINE> France Worried by UNSCOM Report on Failure of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- France Tuesday expressed concern
over the statement by William Butler, chief of U.N. Special
Commission on disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM), that the talks between
UNSCOM and Iraq almost collapsed.
</P>
<P>
``We are expecting fuller information from his (Butler's) side
when he presents his report to the U.N. Security Council Thursday
August 6 in New York,'' said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She reminded both UNSCOM and Iraq that a good cooperation
between them is necessary and inevitable for the lifting of the
sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Butler and his UNSCOM delegation cut short their stay in
Baghdad Tuesday after their talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz on the progress in the U.N. inspection mission broke
down Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He said that Aziz demanded him to tell the U.N. Security Council
to give Iraq a clean bill of health on its weapons programs, but he
rejected the request, citing that he had no such evidence.
</P>
<P>
Butler also said a proposal presented by him for accelerating
the process of disarmament had been rejected by Aziz.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Urges Cross-Straits Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, executive
vice-president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (Arats), today urged parties on either sides of the Taiwan
Straits to hold talks on procedural issues concerning political
negotiations at the earliest possible date, to be followed by
talks on practical and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seventh seminar on cross-Straits relations
which opened today in Beijing, Tang pointed out differences
between the two sides in political issues.
</P>
<P>
Arats President Wang Daohan and Koo Chen-fu, president of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (Sef) in Taiwan, have held a number
of talks on practical matters since 1993, but have failed to reach
agreements due to political differences, according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the two sides will boldly address
political differences and hold talks on procedural issues
concerning political negotiations. This is the only way to truly
solve practical matter and gradually settle political differences,
said Tang.
</P>
<P>
He said cross-Straits relations have witnessed considerable
progress over the past decade, and noted the substantial increase
in personnel, economic and trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the existence of some differences and even conflicts
between the two sides because of ideological discrepancies
resulted from the extended separation, but stressed that progress
in cross-Strait relations fully complies with the desires of
people on both sides.
</P>
<P>
He said the 21st century will offer both opportunities and
challenges for the Chinese nation, and called for people on both
sides of the straits to join in a concerted effort to achieve
common prosperity and reunification of the motherland.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese legislator has
called on governments at all levels to incorporate environmental
protection into their economic development plans.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), also called for firm action against
behavior which damages the environment. The high-ranking leader
made the comments at today's forum on implementation of the
environmental protection instructions President Jiang Zemin issued
on August 5, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that departments and governments at all levels
have accelerated efforts to expand afforested areas over the past
year in order to prevent further soil erosion and desertification,
with related efforts leading to significant improvements in the
ecological balance across the country.
</P>
<P>
"However, China still faces a grim task regarding efforts to
improve the natural environment, with overall environmental
conditions worsening despite efforts to tackle local problems,"
according to Buhe.
</P>
<P>
Deserts in northwest China, the Loess Plateau and areas in the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River are faced with the most serious
environmental problems in China.
</P>
<P>
Today's forum was jointly sponsored by the Publicity Department
of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the National
People's Congress, the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference and several central government
departments.

<HEADLINE> Most Canadians Gloomy About Financial Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Canadians feel
that their financial situation has worsened, shows a poll released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They also think that they are worse off than their parents, and the
younger generation will be worse off than them, says the Angus Reid
poll for the Globe and Mail and CTV television network.
</P>
<P>
Canadians have a more gloomy view of personal financial
situation than they did in 1989, before the start of the recession
that upset the career plans and income hopes of hundreds of
thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
Despite claims by politicians that things have improved, the
pessimism about personal finances is pervasive, says the poll
conducted between July 15 and July 22 involving 1,515 adult
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
The poll shows that 54 percent respondents felt it
harder to make ends meet, up from 38 percent in 1989, while 15
percent felt the opposite, down from 24 percent. Thirty-one
percent said it was about the same, down from 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
A comparison study of the financial situation among generations
has also revealed a dramatic shift since 1989. Forty-four percent
said they were better off than their parents' generation, down
from 74 percent nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, 40 percent said their generation was worse off, up
from 13 percent, while 15 percent felt about the same, up from 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
Expectations for the younger generation have also darkened,
with 57 percent of the respondents saying they would be worse off,
as compared with 41 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen percent Canadians predicted that the next generation
would be better off, down from 28 percent. Twenty-three percent said
they thought it would be about the same.

</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian president, who paid a visit to China in May, said
the exchange of visits by leaders of the two nations, including

development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He believed that it will be in the interest of the two sides to
extend mutual economic and cultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun said the smooth development in bilateral
relationship in recent years had opened up the way to a bright
future for the two countries to establish a friendly and
cooperative relationship oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
As a Central European country, Peng said, Bulgaria plays an
important role in maintaining the peace, security and stability in
this region and Europe as a whole.
</P>
<P>
China, on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, holds a
positive attitude to promoting economic cooperation and trade with
Bulgaria, she said, adding that the Chinese NPC is willing to do
its utmost in this area.

URUMQI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The magnitude 6.0 earthquake which
occurred in Jiashi County in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region Sunday has only caused relatively small property
losses, but no casualties, confirmed the local government.
</P>
<P>
Relief work is well under way in the seven townships affected
by the quake. By 00:30 this morning, the local seismological
bureau recorded 150 aftershocks, including two measuring 5.0 and
5.2 on the Richter scale respectively.
</P>
<P>
Three people were slightly injured, 229 sheep died, 360 houses
collapsed, and 39 small bridges, eight schools and two hospitals
were damaged in the quake, according to preliminary statistics.
</P>
<P>
The same area had been hit by successive quakes last year, said
local seismologists.
</P>
<P>
From January to April 1997, seven consecutive quakes with a
magnitude over six struck Jiashi County, causing scores of deaths
and the collapse of tens of thousands of houses, a rare
seismological phenomenon worldwide.

<P>
WUHAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- This capital of central China's
Hubei Province which is fighting the worst floods in four decades
raised more 10 million yuan from 142 local businesses and
institutions today in flood relief fund.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have been hit the hardest by the floods as they
come on a time when early rice is waiting to be reaped and late
rice to be planted. It is estimated that the floods have caused at
least one billion yuan in direct losses.
</P>
<P>
The local government has appropriated more than 6.2 million
yuan for disaster relief, as well as large amounts of tents, foods
and daily essentials, and resettled 140,000 flood victims.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that the city's leading officials each
donated 500 yuan for flood victims today.
</P>
<P>
On the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Wuhan with a
population of seven million today has thrived as a traffic and
business hub in central China thanks to its geographical
position.
</P>
<P>
However, this same geographical position has meant an unending
combat against the floods for the city since the day it came into

<HEADLINE> Regional Leaders Plan Summit on Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Southern African leaders are
planning a summit on the festering problems in the Great Lakes
region to be held Saturday in Zimbabwe's western resort of
Victoria Falls.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean government sources confirmed Tuesday that
preparations were underway for a summit on the Great Lakes region
to be hosted by President Robert Mugabe and that about seven
leaders including those from the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), Rwanda and Uganda are expected.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Tanzania, Zambia and Namibia were also invited, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we can confirm that a summit on the Great Lakes region
has been planned for Saturday. The leaders are expected to start
arriving on Friday," said a Zimbabwean Foreign Ministry official
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes region, riven by ethnic hatred, is on the boil
again with DRC President Laurent Kabila facing a revolt from
ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge troops in the east of the country.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who came to power in May 1997 after a seven-month
guerilla campaign from the east of the former Zaire backed by
Rwanda and Uganda, has accused his former allies of fomenting
unrest among his troops, particularly the mutinous Tutsi ethnic
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean government sources said the Victoria Falls summit
was suggested by three unnamed regional leaders during the recent
southern Africa international dialog (smart partnership) meeting
in Swakopmund, Namibia.

<HEADLINE> More Babies Born Out of Wedlock in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Almost one out of every four
babies are born outside marriage now in the European Union,
Eurostat reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The demographic report, prepared together with the Council of
Europe, said that the rate of babies born out of wedlock was less
than 10 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat, the Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the
European communities, said that outside-marriage births are
increasing throughout the 15-nation union and the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The bureau described the trend as reflecting the growing
popularity of cohabitation.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat figure showed that one in two live births in
Sweden and Denmark is outside marriage while one in two births in
Norway and two out of three births in Iceland, both European
Economic Area countries, are out of the wedlock.
</P>
<P>
Europe-wide, the statistical bureau added, marriage is in
decline.
</P>
<P>
The crude marriage rate in 1980 was 6.3 per 1,000 people
whereas it was down by last year to 5.0 per 1,000 people. Only
Denmark registered an increase from 5.2 per 1,000 people in 1980
to 6.5 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sweden posted the lowest marriage rate of 3.6 per 1,000 people
among the European countries surveyed by the Eurostat and the
Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
One of the most significant demographic changes, said Eurostat,
has been the fall in infant mortality, or deaths of babies under
the age of one. The mortality rate has halved or more in many
European countries in the last two decades.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Kinshasa Returning to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Kinshasa,
capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R. Congo), is
gradually returning to normal two days after a mutiny allegedly
staged by the Tutsi Banyamulenge soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen people, including 11 Banyamulenges and three
government soldiers, were killed and several others wounded in the
fighting over the past two days, press here reported.
</P>
<P>
Some military barricades were lifted Tuesday morning and
traffic was increasing as the situation was calming down.
</P>
<P>
Security forces were continuing their sweeping operations
against the rebels in the capital Tuesday morning, particularly
in the Kinsuka district where the mutinous soldiers were
reportedly holding out.
</P>
<P>
A source from the United Nations humanitarian agency here said
that security forces took away four U.N. employees because they
were Banyamulenges.
</P>
<P>
Some government forces, apparently backed by Banyamulenge and
Rwandan soldiers, declared an open rebellion against the
government of President Laurent Kabila in the eastern regions of
Nord Kivu and Sud Kivu at the Rwandan border.
</P>
<P>
The rebellion came after Kabila ordered the military officers
of Rwanda, who helped him come into power 15 months ago, to leave
the country.
</P>
<P>
In a clear warning against Rwanda and Uganda, a government
spokesman Pierre-Victor Mpoyo Monday asked D.R. Congo's neighbors
"not to mistake the fight."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the spokesman accused Rwanda of being behind the
rebellion, which was denied by Kigali.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fight engaged by the D.R. Congo government was
for "the peace process of the Great Lake region", including
Rwanda, Burundi and the eastern part of D.R. Congo.
</P>
<P>
Both the rebels and the government Tuesday claimed control of
the capital of Sud-Kivu, Bukavu, which is situated on the border
with Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese Minister of Justice Mwenze Kongolo said that the
troops loyal to President Kabila had seized Bukavu back from the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels are on the way of disappearing from Bukavu after
the intervention of the government troops," he said, adding that
the airport of Bukavu had "never fallen."
</P>
<P>
But he said that he did not have any information from Goma, the
capital of Nord-Kivu, where the headquarters of a rebellious
battalion was located.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have vowed to put an end to Kabila's rule in the
two provinces and said they would also take the neighboring
province of Maniema.
</P>
<P>
During an extra-ordinary session of his cabinet Monday, Kabila
said he intended to end the rebellion in the east by force,
official sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A nine-member delegation from
the Guangdong Provincial People's Procuratorate (GDPP) led by
Chief Procurator Zhang Xuejun Tuesday began a five-day visit to
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The delegation had a meeting with Lily Yam Kwan Pui-ying,
commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption
(ICAC) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting the two sides agreed to continue to strengthen
cooperation in fighting cross-boundary corruption more
effectively.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the GDPP and the ICAC have enjoyed good
cooperation in the past and the visit has allowed both parties to
enhance understanding of each other's work, and to exchange
information on the latest developments of the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
Yam and heads of the ICAC's three departments briefed the
delegation on the SAR's anti-corruption work after Hong Kong's
return to China and the latest corruption scene.
</P>
<P>
Yam noted that the Central Government had pledged full support
for Hong Kong's fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
"Since Hong Kong's reunification with the mainland, the ICAC
and GDPP, under the framework of 'one country, two systems', have
been able to build on the good relationship developed over the
past ten years or so, and have intensified cooperation in mutual
assistance in investigations," she said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting both sides agreed that regular meetings
between the two agencies in the future would be useful in
strengthening working relationship, and stressed the importance of
stepping up cooperation, exchanging investigation techniques and
sharing corruption prevention experience.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the ICAC, the GDPP delegation will also call on the
Department of Justice, Security Bureau, Correctional Services
Department and the Police before leaving Saturday.

</P>
<P>
The Chinese Army club was also fined for 1,500 Yuan (about 190
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Lin Ti-chuan Autopsy Scheduled for Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- An autopsy on the body of Lin
Ti-chuan, a Taiwan woman allegedly kidnapped and consequently died
in Haicheng, northeast China's Liaoning Province, on July 29, is
scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's press conference, Liu Linlin, deputy
director of the Anshan Municipal Public Security Bureau in
Liaoning, said a panel of five prestigious legal and medical
experts has been formed to conduct the autopsy.
</P>
<P>
The panel members from a noted medical university, the Ministry
of Public Security and local police units, are all noted
pathologists or experts on medical jurisprudence.
</P>
<P>
A number of the members have been engaged in medical
jurisprudence for several decades, with others noted for their
expertise in advanced criminal investigation technologies,
including DNA testing, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the panel has drafted out an autopsy plan
in strict accordance with relevant laws, and that Chen Yaochang, a
friend of the family and noted medical law expert from Taiwan
University, will observe the proceeding on behalf of Lin's family.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Boku, director of the Anshan Taiwan Affairs Office, has
also been invited to witness to the autopsy, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
The wishes of Lin's family will be honored and the autopsy will
be conducted at the Haicheng City Central Hospital, rather than
the Anshan Judicial Examination and Appraisal Center which offers
better facilities.
</P>
<P>
China's Criminal Law and Criminal Procedural Law defines
autopsies as a necessary procedure which enable law enforcement
departments investigating criminal cases to obtain sufficient
evidence and lead to the prosecution of criminal offenders in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Lin's relatives arrived in Haicheng on August 1 and reached an
agreement with related city departments on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liu expressed deep condolences, and thanked family members for
their cooperation with the local public security departments.
</P>
<P>
Lin's remains will be transported to Beijing following
tomorrow's autopsy and returned to Taiwan on August 8.

<P>
BRUSSELS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Tuesday approved a humanitarian aid worth 1.95 million ECU (2.145
million U.S. dollars) for Peru.
</P>
<P>
The aid, to be managed by the European Community Humanitarian
Office, will facilitate four non-governmental organizations from
Spain, Britain and the Netherlands in their aid programs in the
southern American country.
</P>
<P>
The commission fund will be used to assist those returning to
their homes after being displaced.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of people fled during the violence that
has affected Peru for over 12 years and many of them, however, are
returning but having great difficulty resettling on the land that
was abandoned for so long.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that funds to help returnees are
scarce in a country where main efforts were being made to grapple
with the effects of the El Nino freak weather patterns that had
caused floods and torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
The fund will assist an eight-month program to be implemented
by Oxfam of Britain, the Red Cross and the International
Solidarity, both of Spain, and the Medics Without Boundaries of
the Netherlands.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Relations between both sides of
the Taiwan Straits continued to develop in an all-round way in the
first half of this year because of advocacy by the Chinese
mainland of bilateral political negotiation and direct exchanges
of postal service, trade, air and shipping services, reports the
current issue of "Outlook."
</P>
<P>
This year, The Chinese mainland convened the first session of
the Ninth National People's Congress and the first session of the
Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, formed a cross-century central leadership
and maintained a stable currency.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton held fruitful talks with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin during his nine-day state visit to China,
the article states, and Clinton reiterated the "one-China" policy
and the commitment of abiding by the three Sino-US joint
communiques.
</P>
<P>
All these provide a favorable environment for the development
of cross-straits relations, the article states, and shows a sign
of hope for bilateral political negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland has adopted a series of measures to speed
up the process of officially ending the hostile state between both
sides of the Taiwan Straits under the principle of "one China"
since the latter half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The move has evoked great repercussions in Taiwan, the article
says. Public polls show that more than half of Taiwan residents
favor political negotiation between the two sides and 70 percent
of those interviewed agreed to direct exchanges of postal, trade,
air travel and shipping services. People of all social sectors in
Taiwan consider that businesslike talks are no longer suitable to
the development between both sides of the Taiwan Straits, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
More contacts between the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) have
been conducted recently.
</P>
<P>
ARATS President Tang Shubei said that both sides are working
toward a common ground for political negotiation. Some leading
officials in Taiwan said on many occasions that political talks
are unavoidable.

Non-governmental cultural, economic and trade exchanges between
both sides of the Taiwan Straits have increased since the
beginning of this year. More Taiwan compatriots, including members
of the Kuomintang and the Democratic Progressive Party, have
visited the Chinese mainland in the capacity of scholars, the
article states.
</P>
<P>
A large delegation composed of academics and professors of
universities in Taiwan attended the centennial anniversary of
Beijing University held in Beijing last May.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland remains the major source of Taiwan's
favorable trade balance. The indirect trade volume between the two
sides in 1997 totaled 24.5 billion U.S. dollars, with more than 20
billion dollars of Taiwan exports.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume registered substantial growth in the
first four months of this year. The Chinese mainland's exports to
Taiwan rose 26.4 percent, while imports from the latter were up 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of Taiwan-invested projects opened on the Chinese
mainland so far this year doubled that of last year and the amount
of funds involved increased by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
The article quotes Taiwan statistics that show in the first
four months of this year Taiwan approved the establishment of 211
projects in various parts of China's mainland, involving a total
investment of 467 million U.S. dollars, 108 million dollars more
than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people of all walks of life on the Chinese mainland
have enhanced cooperation with their counterparts in Taiwan by
visiting the island, the article states. A delegation of mass
media visited Taiwan last April, and more than 100 accomplished
scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences attended a seminar
on scientific and technological achievements held in Taipei in
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland will continue to implement the principle
of "placing hope on Taiwan people," accelerate bilateral
non-governmental exchanges, help Taiwan compatriots have a better
understanding of the Chinese mainland and the "one country, two
systems" formula and promote peaceful reunification of the
motherland, the article states.

<HEADLINE> PNA Rejects Israel's Latest Proposal on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) has rejected the latest proposal by Israel on the second
troop redeployment in the West Bank, Israel Radio reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Hassn Asfour, Palestinian coordinator of
peace negotiations, as saying that Israeli ideas were rejected
because they were in complete contradiction with the
U.S. withdrawal proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ideas were put forward by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser Yitzhak Molcho, who met with chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat for several hours on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, the PNA officials had threatened the
session would be the last one unless Israel showed up with new
proposals.
</P>
<P>
Asfour did not say whether the Palestinians would carry out
their threat to break off the negotiations now.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior Palestinian source told Israel Radio that
during the talks, Israel agreed to grant PNA certain civil powers
in the proposed "nature reserve."
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians rejected the idea outright. The source
maintained that it was too early to say whether the Palestinians
agree to further meetings.
</P>
<P>
Israel has so far resisted a U.S. and Palestinian-backed plan
to give the Palestinians 13 percent more of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is insisting that it will not accept the
Israeli proposal that 3 percent of that sum be called a "nature
reserve" with limitations on construction unless it is assured
that the area will receive the formal status of "Area B."
</P>
<P>
All Area B land is jointly controlled by Israel and the PNA in
an interim phase before becoming "Area A," which is exclusively
controlled by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Israeli diplomatic sources told Israel
Radio that they believe contacts with the Palestinians would be
renewed in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
They said that the ideas transferred by Molcho would allow for
progress in the negotiations if the Palestinians show good will.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
took a tour by air on the Judean desert area and examined
different possibilities for where the 3 percent of the further
redeployment designated for a "nature reserve" could be.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, executive
vice-president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (Arats), said today that the unfortunate death of Lin
Ti-chuan from Taiwan resulted from an alleged business dispute
must be dealt with soberly and rationally.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his deep regret and shock at Lin's death, Tang said
that the perpetrators must be apprehended at the earliest possible
date. He also pointed out the cooperation of Lin's family is a
must for obtaining further evidence.
</P>
<P>
The family has agreed to cooperate in related efforts, said
Tang, adding that concerned departments will honor the family's
wishes and return Lin's remains to Taiwan as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Tang said Arats dispatched a deputy secretary general to
Haicheng, a city in northeast China's Liaoning Province,
immediately after reports of the incident to assist local
departments in maintaining close contacts and assisting Lin's
family members from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Chinese people abhor incidents of this
nature, but pointed out the similar cases are common throughout
the world.
</P>
<P>
The case must be dealt with soberly and rationally, said Tang,
noting that constant vigilance must be maintained to prevent
someone from sabotaging cross-Straits relations by taking
advantage of the unfortunate incident.
</P>
<P>
Tang pointed to the proposed mainland tour by Koo Chen-fu,
president of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (Sef),
in mid-September or mid-October, and expressed hope the visit will
proceed in line with suggestions tabled by the Taiwan side.
</P>
<P>
The visit will provide Arats President Wang Daohan and Koo
Chen-fu with an excellent opportunity to freely and fully exchange
views concerning cross-Straits relations, according to Tang. He
also expressed hope that the Taiwan side will refrain from
creating obstacles and strictly adhere to its suggestions.

<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, WEST BANK, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat rejected Tuesday the latest
Israeli proposal on the second redeployment, saying it "had
nothing to do with" the U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks at a news conference after holding
near-two-hour talks with visiting Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile in the West Bank town Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli proposal, put forward at the latest round of talks
between the Israelis and the Palestinians Monday night, was very
far from consistent with the U.S. initiative, Arafat said. He did
not elaborate on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Israel has rejected the U.S. initiative which calls on Israel
to withdraw from an additional 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Palestinians will suspend talks with the Israelis
as they have threatened, Arafat said he and other Palestinian
officials were still considering the issue.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat met for several
hours with Yitzhak Molcho, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's adviser and the chief Israeli negotiator, on Monday
night. But neither would say after the meeting if enough progress
was made to keep the talks going.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials had threatened before the meeting that
it would be the last session unless the Israelis brought with
them new proposals.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was said to meet with Erekat and other Palestinian
negotiators in Gaza after the talks to hear their report.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Tuesday that Molcho proposed some "new
ideas" in the talks but it did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have opposed the Israeli idea that 3 percent
of the 13.1 percent due to be handed over to them by Israel be
designated as a "nature reserve" where the Palestinians will only
have limited powers.
</P>
<P>
Vasile said he visited Ramallah in an effort to promote
Romanian-Palestinian ties and to help advance the stalled peace
process. The prime minister, who arrived in Israel Sunday, held
talks with his Israeli counterpart Netanyahu Monday.

<HEADLINE> More Exchanges Across Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Trade across the Taiwan Straits
reached 24.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, 10.1 per cent more than
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
released the figures here today at the opening of a seminar on the
Taiwan Straits relationship.
</P>
<P>
Jing said that last year Taiwan investors put more than 1.6
billion U.S. dollars -- 31 per cent over 1996 -- into 728 projects
on the mainland, 90 percent more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two million Taiwan residents visited the mainland in
1997, a record high, while more than 8,400 mainland residents
visited Taiwan, 30 percent more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges in such areas as culture, sports and academics are
also very increasing across the straits, Jing said.

<HEADLINE> Export Earnings in Zambia to Plummet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's export earnings this
year are forecast to go down from last year's 1,159 million U.S.
dollars to a mere 888 million dollars due to the declining
earnings from copper and non-taditional exports.
</P>
<P>
as a result, the country's current account deficit is also
expected to deteriorate further to 602 million dollars as against
235.1 million dollars last year, weekly Financial Mail reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a recent Economists Intelligent Unit country
report on Zambia and Congo (Kinshasa) as saying that copper
prices are expected to further decline in 1998 and 1999 primarily
because of weak demand in Asia.
</P>
<P>
While non-traditional exports are expected to record growth in
1998, this will not be enough to offset the expected fall in
revenue from copper, Zambia's largest foreign exchange earner,
resulting from declining production and slump in prices.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the drop in export earnings will
overshadow the drop in imports and thus contribute to the
widening current account deficit this year.
</P>
<P>
The situation is likely to adversely affect industry and
consumers as production costs for firms using imported raw
materials will rise and this could lead to increasing consumer
prices, said the report.

<HEADLINE> IMF Terms Egypt's Privatization as Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) spoke highly of Egypt's privatization program, terming it "a
remarkable success story."
</P>
<P>
The comment was contained in IMF's latest report assessing
Egypt's economic performance since the reform drive started in
January 1996, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The pace of privatization that has been established compares
very favorably with recent international experience," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"The private sector's role has been increasing in virtually
every sector since 1996, with relatively large increases in
participation in industry, mining, construction, trade and
finance," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's current privatization effort ranks among the top four
countries. Its privatization rate of about 1.5 percent of (gross
domestic product) GDP a year, is bettered only by Hungary,
Malaysia and the Czech Republic," it said.
</P>
<P>
On its reform agenda, the government's central objective is to
increase the real growth, with a greater role for private sector
in economic activities.
</P>
<P>
The reform program envisages a shrink in the size of civil
service by 2 percent a year, privatization of nonfinancial
enterprises to decrease public sector's role by 25 percent, and
conversion half of state- and jointly-owned banks to the control
of private sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform drive, private sector was also invited to
invest in new infrastructure projects, such as the building of
power plants, airports and port facilities, in the form of the
build-operate-transfer (BOT).
</P>
<P>
So far, 84 public companies have been sold with a market value
of about 17.7 billion pounds (5.21 billion U.S. dollars),
accounting for about 7 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
And from January 1996 to the end of June 1997, the government
earned 5.2 billion pounds (1.53 billion dollars) from
privatization, with 40 percent of the money paying off debts owing
to banks, 55 percent to treasury and five percent as early
retirement pensions.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to sell 200 companies by the year 2000
either "in full or in part."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds Must Not Be Misused: Habibie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Tuesday said that foreign assistance must not be misused as the
loans reflected international confidence in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We must use foreign assistance carefully," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) agreed recently in
Paris to aid Indonesia with 7.894 billion U.S. dollars in addition
to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan totaling 6.3 billion
dollars. The foreign loans are scheduled to be disbursed in fiscal
year 1998/99.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said he was also happy that the People's Republic of
China had also extended financial aid to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Indonesian cooking oil producers here, the
head of state said he expected the national economy to recover in
September 1999 if various foreign loans were used in the right
way.
</P>
<P>
The government had made many plans to restore the national
economy's health but the support of all sides, including the
public and the bureaucracy itself, was needed to enable these
plans to succeed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should disturb the implementation of these plans,"
Habibie stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Design Gallery shops displaying
more than 1,000 new varieties of products were re-launched here
Tuesday in a bid to further promote design professionalism of high
quality Hong Kong products.
</P>
<P>
These products range from high quality menswear and tableware
products to innovative household appliances, stationery sets and
electronic merchandise.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1991, the Design gallery under the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC) has already featured more than 59,000
products from over 1,600 companies in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the re-launching ceremony, Michael Sze, executive
director of the TDC, said that Hong Kong is becoming more
sophisticated, more cosmopolitan, a competitor among global
cities.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We are re-launching our three Design Gallery shops,
and highlighting their new and improved image to reflect that
increasing sophistication."
</P>
<P>
"Our shops will continue to encourage originality and
creativity in Hong Kong product design, as they have done in the
past seven years," he added.
</P>
<P>
Playing an important role in fostering local design creativity,
the Design Gallery shops are more than just retail outlets for
local consumers to purchase high quality local brandname products,
they have also successfully served as a one-stop sourcing center
for local and overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
Sze presented six "Best Seller" awards of the Year 1997 to six
local companies at the re-launching ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Protests Force Change of Venue for Russian-U.S. Naval Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Protracted protests have forced
Russia and the United States to change the venue of a joint naval
exercise in Vladivostok in the Far East, a Russian officer said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Temerev, the Russian commander of the games, told a
news conference that the exercises, scheduled for August 6-7, will
be held in a different part of Primorye due to protests.
</P>
<P>
The new venue is a test site of the Pacific fleet in Clerk
islands, in the southeast of Amur Bay, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the exercises is to practice cooperation in
emergency situations, such as landing in a disaster-hit zone,
first-aid and evacuation of victims.
</P>
<P>
Local protesters picketed the naval pier of Vladivostok during
the mooring of the U.S. Germanytown landing ship for two hours.
About 50 people carrying red flags and banners chanted "Yankee go
home" and "Shame".
</P>
<P>
About 600 U.S. troops will take part in the exercises,
including a logistics group, units of the 31st Marine Corps, the
First Air Squadron and the Third Marine Division, Interfax quoted
the U.S. consulate in Vladivostok as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side, also consisting of some 600 people, includes
the Burny destroyer, the BDK-11 landing ship and five auxiliary
vessels.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Germantown landing ship will remain in Vladivostok
until August 10.
</P>
<P>
Despite the change of venue, the protesters, backed by the
Primorye Territory governor and the speaker of the local
legislative assembly, said they would continue to voice their
opposition to the exercises "in every way", the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee: India Wants to Improve Ties With China, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee said Tuesday that his country wanted to further
improve relations with China which he said his government had
never termed as India's biggest enemy.
</P>
<P>
During a debate on foreign policy Tuesday in Lok Sabha, the
lower house of Parliament, Vajpayee said that India stood for
intensifying its efforts to resolve outstanding border issues with
China.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister said that the talks between his
special emissary Jaswant Singh and Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan in Manila recently had helped untie knots in bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that his country was engaged in talks with key
nations on making its moratorium on further nuclear tests
internationally binding with a view to arriving at a decision
regarding adherence to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
However, Vajpayee assured the Parliament that it would be taken
into confidence before signing any international treaty.
</P>
<P>
Marking a shift from his earlier stand that India was prepared
to discuss adherence to only certain provisions of the CTBT,
Vajpayee indicated Tuesday in the Upper House that New Delhi was
willing to consider the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
the prime minister said New Delhi had been undertaking
dialogues with key interlocutors after satisfying itself that
India no longer required to conduct nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"We can maintain the credibility of our nuclear deterrent in
the future without testing," he said. "India remains committed to
this dialogue with a view to arriving at a decision regarding to
adherence to the CTBT."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee accused Pakistan of showing no interest in continuing
the bilateral talks for resolving outstanding issues between the
two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Squarely blaming Islamabad for attempting to internationalize
the Kashmir issue, he said that Pakistan was making Kashmir its
focal point in running its diplomacy while ignoring other vital
issues of trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that Kashmir was an integral part of India, Vajpayee
once again ruled out any third party mediation in the
Indo-Pakistani dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Saying that attempts by Pakistan to make Kashmir a flash point
would not succeed, Vajpayee rejected Islamabad's demand that New
Delhi should hold talks with the Hurriyat Conference, a
conglomerate of separatist bodies.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan is not happy with its present borders and
wants to change the status quo, adding that even Arab countries
had not supported Pakistani move to internationalize the Kashmir
issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Mogadishu is quiet Tuesday
despite political uncertainty in the wake of the announcement of
the capital's long-awaited administration at the absence of
faction leader Osman Ali Atto late Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that an administration of any form was
established for Mogadishu since the chaos began in the capital in
early 1991.
</P>
<P>
Atto dismissed the administration announced by Ali Mahdi,
Hussein Aidid and Mohamed Qanyare Afrah with his interior
secretary Colonel Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdid, saying that he
didn't recognize the co-chairmanship of Ali Mahdi and Hussein
Aidi for the supreme council of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The faction leader also made an appeal to the public as well
as to the international community not to recognize this
administration which he called as unlawful.
</P>
<P>
He said the center of the conflict between him and the
administration announcers is the way the constitution is formed
and who will have the final word and sign the approval of the
administration.
</P>
<P>
The faction leader characterized the administration as
non-representative. His message to the public which was also run
on his radio Monday night has warned that those who announced
this administration alone will shoulder the responsibility of its
consequences.
</P>
<P>
Atto declined to make clear whether he will fight the group or
not. But he said that he is holding another meeting with all
those who rejected this administration including Musa Sudi
Yalahow and Dr Hussein Bod's representatives, to formulate what
he called the convenient way of establishing Mogadishu's
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The people of the capital have long been looking forward to
hearing and seeing an effective administration for Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
However, despite many stumbling blocks, the analysts are
ruling out the possibility of a major breakout of armed clashes
between the various political rivals in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Among those other influential leaders who also oppose to this
administration is general Mohamed Sheikh Osman, the former
finance minister of the late regime.
</P>
<P>
He characterized the administration as a non-democratic and
aimed at hijacking the peace process in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
General Osman who is a clan compatriot has warned against any
armed clashes between the various groups of the capital.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's speeches at Hussein Aidid's headquarters at the
presence of Egyptian and Libyan diplomats including Al-Sayid
Ma'tuq Al-Zubaidi, the Libyan ambassador to Somalia, the faction
leaders have also announced that the air and sea ports are open
from Tuesday on.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been no sign of activities around the two
main installations despite the nomination of their general
managers.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people have gone to the air and sea ports Tuesday to
see if there are any changes.
</P>
<P>
However, neither the airport nor the seaport can be opened
without the basic equipments to run them such as tag boats,
cranes, large electric generators, air tower communications,
refueling system for the planes and descending stairs for the
large planes, and etc.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Government Gets Tough on Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian federal government
has begun going to court to overturn judges' decisions granting
citizenship to immigrants who spend little time in Canada, the
Globe and Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government is reviewing any case in which a judge granted
citizenship to an immigrant who spends more than 50 percent of his
time living abroad, and filing appeals to the court over certain
cases.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, the Department of Citizenship
and Immigration has taken 61 such cases before the Federal Court.
Five of these have been heard, with four being decided in the
government's favor.
</P>
<P>
Many of the cases have to do with immigrants from Hong Kong who
established residence in Canada and then returned to Hong Kong for
prolonged periods for business or other reasons.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Citizenship Act says that an immigrant must spend at
least three years (1,095 days) out of four within Canada to
qualify. The purpose of the residence requirement is to ensure
that an applicant can become familiar with Canada and become
integrated into Canadian society.
</P>
<P>
Physical presence is not defined under the act. However, case
law establishes that applicants can be absent and still qualify
under exceptional circumstances if, for example, the absences are
temporary and caused by business or study. During these absences,
the applicant and immediate family are required to maintain a
residence in Canada and pay income taxes here.
</P>
<P>
Citizenship registrar Norman Sabourin said the purpose of the
residence requirement is to make sure prospective citizens learn
about Canadian society, its values and laws.
</P>
<P>
If a person spends too much time outside Canada, he said, the

<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
earmarked four billion Naira (about 47 million U.S. Dollars) for
the local production of vaccine to eradicate childhood diseases
in the country.
</P>
<P>
A report from Tuesday's New Nigerian quoted Alhaji Tukur Mani,
permanent secretary of Nigerian Health Ministry, as saying this
was part of the federal government's efforts to provide good
health care delivery system for its citizens.
</P>
<P>
He told a media briefing Monday to mark 1998 National
Immunization Day that his government had embarked on various
projects on immunization to set the country free from diseases
that are preventable.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the efforts made by the Federal Government, he
said, the west African country still ranked among the three
countries yet to eradicate poliomyelitis.
</P>
<P>
At present, Mani noted, "immunization coverage for the target
diseases is low, surveillance remains poor and completeness of
reporting is estimated at 55 percent."
</P>
<P>
The health official disclosed that his government had devised
and implemented strategies toward improving the immunization
coverage in the country.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Mary Awosika, the national coordinator
and chief executive officer of NPI Management Board, said the
objective of the board was to develop and promote programs geared
toward reducing childhood mortality and morbidity through
adequate immunization coverage for all children under five years
old and pregnant women.

<HEADLINE> China Moves to Tap Overseas Oil Construction Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China is actively exploring
international oil construction markets, along with consistent
efforts to tap huge oil and gas resources domestically by inviting
foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
In coming years, China is expected to develop transnational oil
production focusing on the Middle East, Russia, Central Asia and
other countries and regions rich in oil, according to Qin Anmin,
president of the China Petroleum Engineering Construction
Enterprise Group (CPECEG).
</P>
<P>
Qin said that China plans to turn out 10 million tons of crude
oil through its overseas production by the turn of the
century. And by 2010 China will try to develop an annual overseas
oil capacity of 20 million tons, in addition to an annual gas
supply of 50 billion cubic meters, he said.
</P>
<P>
Presently, China is reporting headway in oil exploration and
development overseas. The China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC)
and its subsidiary China Petroleum Engineering Construction Corp.
(CPECC) have successfully obtained share-holding, operational and
leasing rights for oil fields in such countries as Peru, Canada,
Thailand and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China is enjoying great prospects in its oil and gas
exploration in Iraq, the Sudan and Russia. A cooperative gas
project in Central Asia is expected to provide China with 25
billion cubic meters of gas a year. Under the agreement, China
will build a long-distance gas pipeline running from the area
through China, Japan and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
In line with a Sino-Russian cooperative gas project, China will
build another long-distance gas pipeline in eastern Siberia which
will help supply China with an expected 25 billion cubic meters of
gas a year.
</P>
<P>
According to Qin, China has made marked progress in undertaking
oil projects overseas. The CPECC has so far signed overseas oil
construction contracts worth 1.67 billion U.S. dollars. It has
been listed among the world's top 225 contractors for five
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
The official said China is rich in oil resources, producing
more than 150 million tons of crude oil annually and having so far
verified total oil deposits of 17 billion tons, ranking 5th and
9th, respectively, in the world.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China's petroleum development strategy is to rely
mainly on domestic resources, speed up Sino-foreign cooperation in
exploring the western and offshore oil and gas resources, and step
up efforts to tap international oil markets.

<HEADLINE> Butler Cautions Against Exaggerating Tension with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler, chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission on disarmament in Iraq, or UNSCOM,
cautioned Tuesday against exaggerating the tension after the
collapse of his talks with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Before departing for Bahrain, the U.N. chief weapons inspector
said he would not use the word "crisis" to describe the relations
between the UNSCOM and Iraq after the latest talks.
</P>
<P>
"It's highly important not to exaggerate the situation," he was
quoted by the official Iraqi news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Butler and the UNSCOM delegation cut short their stay in
Baghdad Tuesday after their talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz on the progress in the U.N. inspection mission broke
down Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Butler said during the talks Aziz demanded him tell the
U.N. Security Council to give Iraq a clean bill of health on its
weapons programs, but he rejected the request citing the he had
no such evidence.
</P>
<P>
He said that the whole matter would be reported Thursday to the
U.N. Security Council when he returns to New York.
</P>
<P>
"I am certain that the (Security) Council will work to find a
solution and define what the next step should be," he added.
</P>
<P>
After Monday's talks, Aziz accused Butler of serving the
U.S. interest by attempting to prolong the inspection mission,
thus extending the crippling sanctions imposed by the U.N. after
the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Aziz rejected Butler's proposal for creating a new plan of
action as "old tricks and games."

<HEADLINE> Building Collapse Toll in Mumbai Rises to 22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The toll in the building
collapse in Mumbai has risen to 22 as rescuers searched Tuesday
for the dead and survivors from debris of an apartment building
which crumbled to the ground Monday night in the Indian commercial
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from Mumbai that the
toll was expected to go up further as some inmates of the
seven-story Govind Towers were still missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
The building, which collapsed around 20:05 local time Monday,
housed shops on the ground floor, residential apartments on the
first, second and third floors and a hotel on the upper three,
according to fire brigade sources.
</P>
<P>
Fire brigade personnel, making use of cranes, were busy in the
rescue operation. The clearing of the mountain of debris is
expected to continue till Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Residents said there was some unauthorized construction on the
top floor and they had complained to the municipality that the
15-year-old building had been tilting to one side for some months.
</P>
<P>
The police said, however, the civic authorities had served an
eviction notice to the residents, but they had stayed on
disregarding safety.
</P>
<P>
It was the first incident of building collapse in the
metropolis since the beginning of monsoon this year and the eighth
in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The National Herald daily said Tuesday that such incidents
have been a regular feature in the commercial capital of the
country during the last few years.
</P>
<P>
On the average, according to the daily, three to four buildings
collapse every year in Mumbai, killing scores of people.
</P>
<P>
Municipal authorities have become rather strict in granting
permission to build high-rise buildings in the metropolis due to
such unfortunate incidents, the paper added.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Bernard Barmasai and Mozambique's
Maria Mutola are both hopeful to break world records at Wednesday night's
Stockholm IAAF Grand Prix meeting, meet director Rajne Soderberg said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Barmasai will attempt to better his own mark of seven minutes 55.72 seconds
for the 3,000 meters steeplechase while Mutola is aiming to break the women's
800m mark of 1:53.28 set by Jarmila Kratochvilova of Czechoslovakia in Munich,
Germany, in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Barmasai, who set his own mark in Cologne almost 12 months ago, is tipped to
beat the record since his compatriot and world champion Wilson Boit Kipketer,
himself a former record holder at the distance, will also compete in the meet.
</P>
<P>
Stockholm is known as a venue where the 3,000m steeplsechase record can be
broken. Finland's Jouko Kuha (1968), Swede Anders Gaerderud (1975) and Kenyan
Peter Koech (1989) have all set records at the venue.
</P>
<P>
Russian Lyubov Gurina and Letitia Vriesde (Surinam), along with Morocco's
Hasna Benhassi will also join Mutola in the women's 800 meters.

<HEADLINE> Over Half Lebanese Oppose Longer President's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A public opinion poll published
Tuesday showed that 56 percent of the Lebanese opposed the
extension of President Elias Hrawi's term.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Lebanese pollster "Stat Ipsos", came
less than two months before the parliament elects the new
president.
</P>
<P>
Among the 1,000 polled, who came from all walks of life, 43
percent still believed that Hrawi was likely to be granted another
extension, while 42 percent said it was impossible.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi, 72, a Maronite Christian, was elected president in
October 1989 with strong Syrian backing.
</P>
<P>
While his first six-year term expired in 1995, the parliament
voted to approve an one-time constitutional amendment, allowing
him to stay on for an extra three and half years.
</P>
<P>
According to Lebanon's constitution, the country's top political
posts are equally shared by Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
The president comes from Maronite Christians, the prime
minister from Sunni Muslims, the house speaker from Shiite
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Presidential candidates have not yet been identified, but the
survey listed 15 Maronite political figures whom it said were
possible contenders.
</P>
<P>
The most favored candidate was Army Commander Emile Lahoud, who
garnered 30 percent support among the surveyed.
</P>
<P>
Local observers predicted Tuesday that Hrawi would visit Syria
soon to discuss with his Syrian counterpart Hafez Assad the
upcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has great influence on Lebanon, is believed to
play a decisive role in Lebanon's presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Professors to Receive High Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China will select 300-to-500
professors to receive a special subsidy of 100,000 yuan (12,000
U.S. dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest payment a Chinese teacher is expected to
get from the government. An ordinary university professor's
monthly salary is about 2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The special subsidy will be an additional award and not include
the salaries and welfare these professors normally receive.
</P>
<P>
These professors must be leading figures in their fields, a
spokesman for the Ministry of Education announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The program, known as "Project Yangtze," is aimed at easing the
problem of a shortage of talented young scholars in the country.
</P>
<P>
Most leading scholars are expected to retire around 2000 which
will leave an academic vacuum caused by the "Cultural Revolution"
20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials say they hope the program will help increase
Chinese academia's competitiveness and create a group of
world-renowned masters.
</P>
<P>
In another bid to encourage academics, Ka-shing Li, a famous
Hong Kong entrepreneur, will establish a foundation to award some
of the top-achieving professors. The top award will be 1 million
yuan (120,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
These special professors will be employed from China and
abroad.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Lt. Gen. Stripped From Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Lt. Gen. Prabowo
Subianto has been removed from his post as head of the Indonesian
Armed Forces (ABRI) Staff and Command School, Antara News Agency
Tuesday quoted a reliable source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo has not been reassigned to any other position as of
August 1, according to the source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The ABRI High Command also stripped Maj. Gen. Muchdi
Purwopranjoyo of his job as ABRI's deputy inspector general, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Both men were once commander of the Army's Special Forces unit
(Kopassus), a number of whose members are currently in military
police custody on suspicion of being involved in the abduction and
torture of scores of students and other political activists prior
to Soeharto's election to his 7th term as the country's head of
state and government last March.
</P>
<P>
After obtaining increasing clues about both men's roles in the
political abductions, ABRI Commander Gen. Wiranto signed the
decisions discharging the two from their official posts on July
31, the source said.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here Monday, Wiranto said Prabowo, Muchdi
and Kopassus's Group IV (intelligence) commander Col. Chairawan
would appear before the Officers Honorary Council, headed by Army
chief of staff Gen. Subagyo.
</P>
<P>
There are indications that the three officers have broken the
military code of ethics and have shown a lack of discipline in
performing their duties, Wiranto said, adding that 10 Kopassus
soldiers ranking below colonel will soon face a military tribunal
to answer charges they had been actively involved in the
abductions.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean FM Resigns Over Diplomatic Row With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Foreign Minister Park
Chung-soo resigned on Tuesday to take responsibility for the
recent diplomatic row with Russia, a presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
President Kim Dae-jung has accepted Park's resignation and on
Wednesday named current Ambassador-at-large Hong Soon-young as a
replacer, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The resignation came after Park was blamed at home for the
strained S. Korean-Russian relations stemmed from the diplomatic
row between the two nations starting last month.
</P>
<P>
On July 4, Russia ordered the expulsion of a South Korean
diplomat, Cho Sung-woo, on spy charges. Four days later, South
Korea retaliated by ordering the expulsion of a Russian diplomat
in Seoul, Oleg N. Abramkin.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later South Korea further agreed to withdraw five
more intelligence agents in Russia in line with the level of
Russian agents in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Hong, 61, was a former deputy foreign minister and
ex-ambassador to Moscow. His appointment is seen here as a move
aimed to patch up the tense bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Maintain Order in Flooded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANXIANG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police are stepping up
efforts to crack down on crime in flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
"Cases such as looting, robbery and stealing are on the rise,
as troublemakers are taking advantage of the severe flooding,"
said Li Weihe, director of the Public Security Bureau of Anxiang
County, central China's Hunan Province, which has been
experiencing its worst flooding in more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
"Through intensified efforts of local police, the situation is
getting better," said Li, who has been at his post for more than a
month.
</P>
<P>
On the night of July 24, when huge floods on the Yangtze River
engulfed more than 20,000 hectares of land in the county, many
local farmers were so helpless that they just left their precious
belongings on roofs and trees.
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning of the flooding, when night fell some
hooligans took boats to get things out of the water -- some even
went into rooms to plunder," he said.
</P>
<P>
This immediately put local police on the alert. On July 29, Guo
Zebao of Dexing Village was caught stealing pigs and electrical
appliances from a semi-submerged building.
</P>
<P>
Between July 26 and 30, six groups of more than 30 thieves were
seized. The number of offenses have been markedly reduced since
August, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has set up 16 police duty points along the
60-kilometer embankment, where the flood victims have been living
for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has also organized police-civilian defense squads to
conduct round-the-clock patrols on the river, and reinforced
safety efforts for financial, post and telecommunications, and
power departments.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 people have been staying on the levee, but no
massive riots or scrambles for relief supplies have taken place,
Li said, adding that the police will keep a close watch on such
cases until all displaced persons have been resettled.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Advocates Use of Native Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Tuesday called on all public officials and employees to
start using Filipino in their official discussions and
negotiations to gain a headstart in propagating the national
language.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he ordered the Department of Education, Culture and
Sports and the Commission on Higher Education to start using
Filipino as the mode of teaching in all state universities and
public schools.
</P>
<P>
"Let's not cite the effects of globalization and the
information revolution as excuses to suppress the propagation of
our national language," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said Filipinos should feel proud in speaking their national
language and should devote each day to encourage its widespread
use.
</P>
<P>
He advised government officials comfortable with speaking
English to start learning fluent Filipino, stressing that under
his administration, the use of the national language mandated by
the Constitution will be strictly followed.
</P>
<P>
"I want our Cabinet officials to be fluent and excellent in
speaking our national language not because I don't know how to
speak English but because most of them don't know how to speak
Filipino. How will they talk to ordinary citizens if they speak
English? We should lead by example," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the use of Filipino as the national language
would serve as the foundation for Filipinos to strengthen their
unity and defend their race, culture, history and destiny.

<HEADLINE> hke080447 -250,000 Int'l Passengers Transported by Air in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 250,000 foreign passengers
were transported by Myanmar's international airline and 11 other
foreign airlines in the 1997-98 fiscal year ending in March,
according to a latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Airways International, a joint venture airline
between state-run domestic Myanmar Airways and the Highsonic
Enterprise Private LTD of Singapore established in 1993, has been
flying externally with Boeing 737-400 aircraft, leased from the
Malaysian Airlines System, to seven destinations covering Bangkok,
Hong Kong, Dhaka, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Kunming and Jakarta,
and bringing back a considerable number of international
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Other foreign airlines that have regular flights to Yangon from
their respective capitals include Biman (Bangladesh), Royal Brunei
 Airlines, Air China, Druk Air (Bhutan), Indian Airlines, Lao
Aviation Co, All Nippon Airways (Japan), Malaysian Airlines
System, Pakistan International Airways, Silk Air (Singapore) and
Thai Airways International.
</P>
<P>
In early 1997, Myanmar and Indonesia signed a memorandum of
understanding on setting up of a joint venture to run domestic
services in the country with a plan to buy aircraft from the PT.
Triputra Unggul Utama Co of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, a Canadian helicopter company also reached an
agreement later in the year with the Myanmar Airways to form a
joint venture helicopter international company to transport
passengers domestically.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, a total of 900,000 passengers were
transported on the domestic routes in the 1997-98 by the state-run
Myanmar Airways and other joint venture airlines such as Air
Mandalay and Yangon Airways which have extended their flights to
Thailand's border towns of Chiangmai and Phuket.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Airways is operating its internal flight services
with a fleet of seven Fokker F-27 and three Fokker F-28 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Thai airlines have also been allowed to operate
direct chartered flights since the end of 1993 to Myanmar's
tourist sites Mandalay, Bagan, Tachilek, kengtung and Heho.
</P>
<P>
Another Japanese airline, the JAL, also initiated chartered
flight to Yangon from Fukuoka in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Despite Myanmar opened more air links with a number of foreign
countries in 1996 when the country launched a tourist year
campaign, the country received a smaller number of tourists in the
past two years. The country is taking measures to attract tourists
in the forthcoming tourist season beginning October.
</P>
<P>
Development works for Yangon International Airport is being
undertaken, while construction of new Hanthawaddy International
Airport in Bago division, 80 kilometers away from Yangon, and
Mandalay International Airport, 680 km from the capital, is also
being carried out.

<HEADLINE> 27 Sierra Leonean Rebels Surrender to ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven rebels loyal to the
outsted Sierra Leonean military junta of Johnny Paul Koromah,
surrendered to the west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG Monday
in Kenema, east Sierra Leone, media reports said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Koromah's men surrendered to the ECOMOG
since Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah granted amnesty
to the rebels last months, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ECOMOG Force Commander, Major-General Timothy
Shelpidi has said that his force will be able to flush out the
rebels as soon as support promised by the international community
arrives.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi told a U.N. conference in New York at the weekend
that what ECOMOG needs more logistic support, troops and an end
to illegal supplies to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said that flushing the rebels out of Sierra Leone will take
more time than people expected because the rebels now operate in
a terrain where is thickly forested and mountainous and has been
their base since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have resorted to guerrilla type of tactics,
destroying bridges and creating caters, thus slowing down the
movement of ECOMOG, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi also said that ECOMOG has ample evidence to show that
former fighters of Liberian President Charles Taylor have been
fighting alongside the rebels and providing them with supplies.
</P>
<P>
Once the rebels have no resupplies, they would have nothing to
fight with and would have no food and so would have to give up,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi expressed the hope that the decisions taken at a
recent mini-summit in Nigeria by leaders of Nigeria, Sierra Leone
and Liberia will end the supply of arms, ammunition and other
logistics to the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Halt Stockpile Wool Sales for 11 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government Tuesday announced a freeze on all sales from the
nation's wool stockpile for the rest of the 1998-99 season in a
bid to spur on low prices.
</P>
<P>
Australian Primary Industries Minister John Anderson said this
pause would provide an opportunity for the wool industry and the
government to take stock of the market situation and future likely
developments in textile and clothing industries around the world.
</P>
<P>
Under the move, the Australian government will legislate for a
freeze on all sales of wool from the country's 1.1-million-bale
stockpile for the remainder of the season, which started on July
1.
</P>
<P>
The decision, reached Tuesday by federal cabinet, would provide
relief for wool growers in the short-term by removing a
substantial volume of wool from the market, the minister said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The low prices were caused by weak demands from Australia's
major wool markets in Asia, which has been hard hit by the current
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said a major assessment of the world wool and textile
industry would form the basis for a future decision on future
stockpile management beyond June, 1999.

firmer at 2682.3.
</P>
<P>
Ord Minnett client adviser Don Chandler said Australia's
leading company BHP's 45.8-Australian-cent surge to close at 13.82
Australian dollars would have "added a couple of points" to the

much-anticipated announcement that National Australia Bank
Managing Director Don Argus would succeed Jerry Ellis as BHP
chairman next year.

dollars, while the Commonwealth Bank of Australia added 13 cents
to 20.45 Australian dollars and the Westpac bank found five cents

</P>
<P>
Among resources stock, Rio Tinto rose 28 cents to 18.50
Australian dollars, with ongoing speculation about the
Ango-Australian mining giant's interest in BHP's mineral division
helping to fuel the gain.
</P>
<P>
The gold index increased 0.2 points to 1027.1, in line with a
softening in the price of the precious metal.
</P>
<P>
The spot price of gold bullion in Sydney in afternoon trade was
285.40 U.S. dollars an ounce, down from Monday's 286.55 U.S.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Make Renewable Energy Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
soon declare a renewable energy policy to give the solar, wind,
biomass, thermal, wave and tidal energy sources a commercial
dimension, The Financial Express daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael
Ahmed while addressing a meeting here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The government has been encouraging private investment in
renewable energy sector," the minister said, adding that an
attractive package of incentives to the investors in the sector
would be offered in the national policy.
</P>
<P>
The renewable energy could be easily be used for rural
electrification and poverty alleviation, and the diversification
of energy sources would have national and social implications, he
stated.
</P>
<P>
The government has planned to increase the electricity
generation capacity by at least 1,000 mw from the available power
capacity of 1,900-2,000 mw at present in order to meet the
ever-increasing demand for electricity.
</P>
<P>
Though the country was producing renewable energy in large
scale, the other sources of renewable energy still remained
untapped, he observed.
</P>
<P>
A solar photovoltaic pilot project with a generation capacity
of 62 kw is being implemented by the Rural Electrification Board
with French financial and technical assistance, he told the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government had also floated a tender for
implementation of a waste energy project in Dhaka on BOO (build,
own and operate) basis, he added.

<HEADLINE> State Emergency Declared Islandwide in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Parliament Speaker
K.B. Ratnayake Tuesday announced that the state of emergency has
been extended Islandwide with effect from Monday midnight.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the emergency which carried out in 1994, has been
operative only in the country's north and east where Tamil rebels
are fighting against government troops for a separate Tamil state.
</P>
<P>
The move to impose emergency laws Islandwide was aimed at
postponing Provincial Council Elections (PCE) because the main
opposition United National party had refused the amend laws to
delay the vote which is due on August 28, informed sources here
said.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government had earlier said it was in no
position to provide security for the PCE because a large number of
troops and police had been deployed in the north of the country to
fight against the Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
But the Sri Lankan constitution doesn't allow the government to
delay the vote for the PCE, unless a state of emergency is
declared across the island country.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, Germany Sign Agricultural Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon and Germany have signed an
agreement on enhancing bilateral agricultural cooperation, the
Daily Star newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed here on Monday, Germany will provide
Lebanon with technical aid in raising milk cows, protecting animal
health, and promoting livestock sciences and agricultural
mechanization.
</P>
<P>
Germany also promised to support Lebanon's agro-industrial
projects through the government-backed German Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank will offer loans to Lebanese farmers as well as
consultation services in the fields of planning and investment.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of Agriculture Shawki Fakhoury said after the
signing ceremony that the agreement could be considered as an
alternative compensation for Lebanon's growing deficit in its
agricultural trade with Germany.
</P>
<P>
Fakhoury added that European countries refuse to buy Lebanon's
agricultural products because they are of the same variety.
</P>
<P>
This has prompted the country to sign identical agreements with
France and Bulgaria, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country also planned to strike deals with
Spain, Ireland and other countries in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon imports an annual 3.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Issues Anti-Smuggling Circular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) today issued an urgent circular
to strengthen the management of foreign trade enterprises in a bid
to combat smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The circular required foreign trade administrations at all
levels to enhance the policy publicity and supervision for all
traders, including those foreign-funded ventures with trading
rights.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, all traders are prohibited to permit
enterprises with no trading rights to sign import or export
contracts or conduct import and export businesses by using the
traders' names in transactions. All non-trading enterprises
affiliated with the trading companies should halt their
relationship immediately and stop their commercial activities, it
said.
</P>
<P>
As for import proxy, the circular banned the traders from
serving as agents with no knowledge of the real contents of the
imported goods, receivers, and foreign traders. Trading
enterprises are not allowed to serve as import agents for
companies claimed to fully handle their own customer affairs,
goods and custom procedures, it said. Smuggling which occurs in
such transactions will result in the punishment of traders as the
agents, the circular stressed.
</P>
<P>
Also, except for authorized state trading companies and
overseas-funded enterprises with trading rights, other trading
companies are not allowed to serve as import agents.
</P>
<P>
The circular urged relevant departments to strengthen the
management of the processing trade. All foreign trade
administrations should strictly check the processing contracts and
the processing capabilities of the enterprises in an effort to
prevent smuggling and other illegal activities in the name of
processing trade.
</P>
<P>
For the processing of sensitive commodities, the foreign trade
departments should strictly approve the volume of imported
materials and the duration of the processing, and oversee the
ensured sales of finished products, the circular said. Trading
management authorities should terminate the approval of processing
contracts for those involved in smuggling activities, it added.
</P>
<P>
The circular also requires all local foreign trade
administrations to strictly control the quota-license issuance and
prohibits the issuance of licenses beyond the quota or their
authorized scope. All trading companies are prohibited from
selling import and export licenses in the name of joint management
or proxy.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, MOFTEC will warn, adjourn or
withdraw the import and export rights for violators. People
involved in the smuggling will be penalized in accordance with
relevant laws, it said.
</P>
<P>
The circular also requires foreign trade administrations at all
levels to actively cooperate with law enforcement organs, such as
the Customs houses, in their efforts to end smuggling and other
illegal activities.

<HEADLINE> Ferature: Tibetan Rural Residents Eager for Knowledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- One rainy evening, Bazhub, Tibetan
headmaster of the evening school in Chazhub Village, had to teach
his students to write Tibetan letters by candlelight because of a
power failure.
</P>
<P>
His intense students were not young pupils, but adults who
are already parents.
</P>
<P>
The Chazhub evening school is one of 52 in Nedong County in the
Tibet Autonomous Region, and is located near the famous Chazhub
Temple at the foot of the Tongku Lhakang Monastery, the first
palace in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
To enable all adults under 45 years old to be able to read and
write by the end of the century, Nedong County has set up 162 free
classes for farmers and herdsmen. More than 2,300 people are now
attending these classes after work.
</P>
<P>
Memar, a thirty-year-old woman in the junior class at Chazhub
evening school, said she and her husband missed their chance to go
to school when they were young. Now they feel that even farm work
demands knowledge, so they attend the school for two hours every
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Her husband Dawa, 37, in the senior class next door, was
studying math. Giving quick answers to the questions, he put on a
proud look.
</P>
<P>
He said: "One month of study is very fruitful. After I graduate
from here, I needn't turn to asking others when I prepare the
pesticide."
</P>

An official of Nedong County said that at the end of the 1970s,
80 percent of all Tibetans in the county were illiterate. The
Tibetans now have come to realize that the major impediment to
economic growth is illiteracy among the people.
</P>
<P>
The campaign against illiteracy has been quite successful. By the
end of last year, the illiteracy rate in this county dropped to 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Schooling has made the Tibetans rich. Last year, the income per
capita in Nedong County reached 1,400 yuan, 40 percent higher than
the average for the region.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expects to Join WTO in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan expects to become a member
of the the World Trade Organization (WTO) next year as it plans to
submit its membership application by mid-1999, a trade official
was quoted as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Halayqa, secretary-general of the Jordanian Ministry
of Industry and Trade, told the semi-official Jordan Times that
Jordnian government was encouraged by the results of the three
rounds of talks it has held with the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and the WTO concluded their second formal round of talks
last month after responding to the WTO's demands on abolishing the
Supply Ministry, fixing the ceiling on customs, and raising the
quality of agricultural products to international standards.
</P>
<P>
The two sides began their first contact in October 1996 and
held the first formal round of talks in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
As the two sides have reached a consensus and Jordan is ready
to accept WTO's criteria on the outstanding issues, the way for
the kingdom's accession to the organization would be smooth, said
Halayqa, who attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
One of the issues that remains unresolved is protecting the
intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutic field, which
Jordan has to do much work in the coming months, Halayqa said.
</P>
<P>
The strategy that Jordan will adopt in dealing with the issue
is to hold bilateral talks with the main trade partners to win
broad-based support before holding formal meetings with the WTO,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it has reached an agreement with the European
Union, in which the kingdom was granted a three-year grace period
to implement laws on protection intellectual property rights for
its pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
To assist Jordan in its bid for the WTO membership, the United
Nations Development Programme has launched a 300,000 U.S. dollar
project to train Jordanian negotiators in developing technical and
mediation skills for talks with the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Flower Business Booming in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua)-- Flowers and potted landscapes are
growing in popularity in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This spring the city's flower market prospered with a record
daily sales volume of 500,000 bouquets.
</P>
<P>
Peng Zhigang, owner of an inn near Zhongguancun in western
Beijing, turned his inn into a floral shop at the beginning of
this year. His flowers sold very well in April and early May when
Beijing University was observing its centennial and a computer
festival was held in Zhongguancun, a district known for
electronics products.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Flower Association, the city now has
more than 250 floral shops and three large wholesale floral
markets. The sales volume last year was 96 million bouquets and
that of this year is expected to go up by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Flowers have become daily consumer goods rather than festival
luxuries for more and more Beijing people. Now people take flowers
instead of fruits or cakes when visiting friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 overseas corporations and 200 restaurants are
also big consumers of flowers.

doctors have to return before August 30, if they are unable to
return on or before the given date the ministry will take legal
action against them.
</P>
<P>
It was said that many Sri Lanka's doctors who have gone to

the training.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Delegation Leaves Baghdad After Collapse of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. arms inspector Richard
Butler and his colleagues cut their trip short and left Baghdad
Tuesday morning after talks on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Neither Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission for
disarmament in Iraq, or UNSCOM, nor Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz gave specifics on what was discussed and what led to
the collapse of the talks held Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who had been scheduled to stay in Baghdad till
Wednesday, will be in New York Wednesday to brief the
U.N. Security Council on his trip to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
An informed U.N. source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
told Xinhua that Aziz had told Butler he would not continue talks
with him.
</P>
<P>
When Butler asked Aziz whether his words meant that Iraq would
stop cooperation with the UNSCOM, which is in charge of destroying
Iraqi nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, Aziz replied "I
did not say that."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday night after the talks, Aziz said
Iraq was willing to continue cooperation, but it cannot work when
Butler was not ready to tell the truth to the Security Council
about the disarmament progress.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also said that he had rejected Butler's proposal for a
new plan of action, saying it made no sense when UNSCOM was
ignoring essential issues and focusing on minor and insignificant
ones to waste time.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Butler of serving the U.S. interests by
trying to prolong the crippling sanctions imposed by the
U.N. after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"Since this is the wish of the American administration to
perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current situation, to
keep the sanctions on the people of Iraq. ... as long as this is
the American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American policy,"
Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions will not be lifted until UNSCOM certifies
that Baghdad has destroyed all banned weapons. Upset by the
U.S. stance, Iraqi leaders have vowed to lift the crippling
sanctions within this year.
</P>
<P>
In February, tensions reached the brink of military
confrontation when U.S. and British forces were dispatched to the
Gulf to pressure Iraq to comply with the inspections.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan defused the crisis by
brokering an agreement with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to open
eight presidential palaces to inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The situation was further improved in June when Butler gave
Iraq a "blueprint" of what it must do to comply with
U.N. resolutions that must be met for the sanctions to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Butler and UNSCOM specialists arrived in Baghdad Sunday to
determine the progress made in Iraq's disarmament efforts.
</P>
<P>
After two fruitless rounds of talks Monday, the two sides
seemed to be heading for a crisis once again.

<HEADLINE> TAZARA Eyes Rwanda, Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA)
is looking for funds to extend its rail line from Kasama in
Zambia's Northern Province to its northern port Mpulungu on the
Tanganyika Lake in order to eventually expand its services to
Burundi and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by TAZARA Managing Director, Kingston
Mkandawire, during the just-ended three-day Agriculture and
Commercial Show in Lusaka, Zambia Daily Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The extention of the TAZARA line will boost business among the
three countries-- Zambia, Burundi and Rwanda, said Mkandawire.
</P>
<P>
The call for the development of the stretch Kasama-Mpulungu,
on which cargo is currently carried by trucks, follows a recent
request from Burundian Commerce Minister Gregoire Banyiyezako for
co-financing the construction of the rail line with Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Burundi imports and exports 75 percent of its goods through
Mpulungu Port.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government, however, is yet to respond to the
call, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The rail line has for a long time been transporting goods like
maize, fertiliser, cement and sugar from Zambia to these
countries using trucks via Kasaka, a route which takes a lot of
time.
</P>
<P>
Mkandawire said that cargo transport to Burundi and Rwanda by
railway will be cheap and safe as the
rail company has an ambitious plan aiming at better services.
</P>
<P>
He added that TAZARA has in the past lost customers who
prefered Beira port of Mozambique and Durban in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Jilin Province Lavishes Investment in Technical Upgrading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Jilin Province, an old
industrial base in northeast China, has earmarked eight billion
yuan for technical upgrading projects this year, a rise of 39
percent over last year's investment for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Most of the investment will go into 30 major industrial
projects now undergoing structural adjustments, and 64 key state
projects, said a local official.
</P>
<P>
These projects will generate an extra 56.8 billion yuan in
earnings from sales, and 9.8 billion yuan in pre-tax profits
annually, when their respective technical upgrading is completed.
</P>
<P>
Now, Jilin is home to 1,930 state-owned enterprises, including
469 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The province's state-owned enterprises suffered 2.1 billion
yuan in economic losses in the first five months of this year,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
Deputy governor Li Jieche said his province will pool more
funds to help technical upgrading of the province's enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He added that private businessmen and overseas investors are
all welcome to invest in the upgrading projects in an effort to
turn money-losing state-owned enterprises into profitable ones.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait-Funded Irrigation Project Making Progress in Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwait-funded irrigation
project in northwest China's Ningxia, home of 1.78 million Chinese
moslems, has been progressing smoothly with first-phase
sub-project to start trial operation next month, according to
local officials.
</P>
<P>
The whole project, China's biggest aid-the-poor water
conservation undertaking, is expected to absorb 3.34 billion yuan
(about 400 million U.S. dollars) of investment and open up 130,000
hectares of irrigated land within six years.
</P>
<P>
The aid-the-poor project is expected to help 200,000 farmers
rise above the country's poverty line and to resettle another
800,000 farmers from poor mountainous counties in southern Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
An official with the regional government said the first-phase
construction of the huge project has received 140 million
U.S. dollars of government loans from Kuwait and is expected to
receive 700 million yuan (about 84 million U.S. dollars) from the
central government as well as 905 million yuan (about 109 million
U.S. dollars) from the local government.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the first Kuwait-funded agricultural project in
China.
</P>
<P>
China has been attaching great attention to the aid-the-poor
project and its impoverished population has been reduced from 250
million in 1978 to 50 million in 1997.

TAIYUAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China's first
artificially-propagated female giraffe Andan, now 20 years old,
gave birth to her seventh baby on Monday at the Taiyuan Zoo in

<HEADLINE> PNG to Have Its First Stock Exchange: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Papua New Guinea (PNG)
Prime Minister Bill Skate Tuesday announced the formation of his
country's first stock exchange and plans to wipe out his country's
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
In an address to Australia's National Press Club, Skate said
PNG's first stock exchange would be set up, but did not say when
it would be operational.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to bring in a stock exchange in Papua New
Guinea," said the prime minister, who arrived in Australia Sunday
for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to put in professional people, it's going to be so
transparent and that is going to give the right signal to the
investors throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
Skate also said he was confident of eradicating the country's
deficit of 400 million Kina (about 168 million U.S. dollars) and
would soon be delivering on long promised plans to reform the
country's financial system.
</P>
<P>
The PNG economy is in crisis, with a collapse in prices for one
of its major exports, timber, plunging the country into debt and
devastating the currency, the Kina.
</P>
<P>
Skate said he planned to wipe out the country's deficit through
a combination of privatizing the state-owned mineral resources
company Orogen and other yet to be disclosed measures.
</P>
<P>
The visiting prime minister's talks with the Australian
government included how Australia could further assist PNG in
dealing with the aftermath of PNG's tsunami disaster, which
devastated a 30-km stretch of the country's remote northwest
coastline and killed more than 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 4.2 million people, PNG, which won
independence from Australia in 1975, is Australia's largest aid
recipient. Australia's annual aid to PNG totals 180 million U.S.
dollars, about 40 percent of the nation's overseas aid budget.

<HEADLINE> World's Oldest Stone-carved Urban Map Found in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A stone-carved map produced about
700 years ago has been found in Guilin, a picturesque city and a
famous tourist attraction in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
The map is believed to be the world's oldest on urban plane
figure, Chinese archeologists said.
</P>
<P>
The 2.9 meter-long and 2.98 meter-wide map depicts the general
situation of Guilin during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279),
when it was an important military and trade center in southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
The map was produced in 1272, and was one of the only two
preserved urban maps dating back to the Southern Song Dynasty. The
other was about Suzhou in east China, archeologists said.
</P>
<P>
"The map first revealed the karst topography in the world, and
it is the oldest military map preserved intact in China," said Tan
Fasheng, director of the Research Department of the Guilin Museum.
</P>
<P>
"In producing the map, the unknown authors had used different
scales, which coordinate between the city shapes and the
landscapes, and highlights important city parts," said Ma Chong, a
researcher from the city's Place Names Office.
</P>
<P>
The map has 36 marks among which emerged model symbols, an
evidence of the advanced level of cartography in ancient China,
archeologists said.
</P>
<P>
The map has 146 language marks, most of them for military
purposes, and the map shows the city was strongly fortified, said
Su Hongji, an archeologist with the Guilin Museum.

<HEADLINE> Visa Talks Undergoing Between Mozambique, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations on visa exemption
between Mozambique and Zimbabwe have been going well, said
Mozambican Minister of Planning and Finance Tomaz Salomao.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks during his recent inspection
trip to the central Manica Province bordering Zimbabwe, the daily
Noticias newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The visa exemption talks will greatly facilitate the flows of
investment, personnel and materials between the two countries,
said Salomao.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican minister noted that the agreement on visa
exemption reached between Mozambique and Malawi about two years
ago has borne positive fruits.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that after an agreement is reached for visa
exemption between his country and Zimbabwe, similar negotiations
will be initiated with other southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in the last two months, some 60
Zimbabwean farmers visited the central, southern and northern
parts of Manica Province to find out the possibilities of
investing in agriculture, husbandry and agro-industry in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government of Manica has reportedly issued a
decree in which it offers preferential status for those
Zimbabwean farmers willing to invest in the reaches of Zambeze
River.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Jobs, Higher Pay for Graduates in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The number of university and
college graduates obtaining employment in New Zealand has fallen
for the first time since 1992, though those finding jobs are
earning more, according to a recruitment survey here.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was published Tuesday in The Evening Post, a
Wellington-based newspaper, said the Asian financial crisis could
be blamed for some firms cancelling or curbing their graduate
recruitment programs.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed a 15.2 percent fall in graduates getting jobs
in the year ending June 1998, compared to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"These results are significant, given that this is the first
time since the survey began in 1992 that we have seen a decrease,"
the paper quoted survey team leader Kevin McBride as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, salaries rose between 2.7 percent to 8
percent. Median-base salaries for graduates in their first year
working climbed to 32,000 N.Z. dollars (16,300 U.S. dollars) from
30.500 N.Z. dollars (15,600 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Zambian Police Doubled in Four Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian police has increased
its personnel from 6,000 nationwide in 1994 by over 100 percent
under a recently launched reform program.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Beenwell Chimfwembe said in an interview here
Monday that there are currently about 13,000 policemen and that
the Zambian government is targeting to recruit up to 27,000 by
the year 2000, the government-owned Zambia Daily Mail reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chimfwembe did not say whether there are external donors
financing the reforms, but he said that the exercise was
initiated by the Zambian government and that the resources from
donor countries are being channeled to the areas it thinks
worthwhile, including the police service.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has promised to release money for the
acquisition of communication equipment, the rehabilitation of
police stations and accommodation in police camps, said the
police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Chimfwembe noted that the whole exercise is, however,
dependent on how quickly the funds are made available.
</P>
<P>
He added that since Lusaka is experiencing an upswing in
crime, it will be given priority in the acquisition of utility
equipment.
</P>
<P>
In the past months, Lusaka has been experiencing a series of
armed robberies and brutal manslaughters which forced the police
to intensify their fight against the ever rising crimes.

<HEADLINE> Transportation Improved in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Ten years ago, tourists found it
inconvenient to go to Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region since there
was only one railway and one small airport linking it with the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Now tourists flocking to visit this only autonomous region of
Chinese Muslims find travel choices by air, land and water are
plentiful because of marked improvement in transportation
conditions.
</P>
<P>
For six consecutive years, highways in the region have been
expanding at an annual rate of 330 kilometers, bringing the total
roadways to 8,700 kilometers. A highway network featuring 13
national and provincial roads and more than 100 county and
township roads has been formed.
</P>
<P>
While only the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway passes through the
region, a new electrified railway has opened plus its first
regional rail, extending the total length to 837 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Before 1997, Ningxia remained the only region in the country
incapable of accommodating large aircraft. This situation ended in
September when Hedong Airport, capable of handling Boeing 747
aircraft, went into operation in the regional capital of Yinchuan.
</P>
<P>
Travelers in the region also can use six highway bridges across
the Yellow River, the major waterway in the region.

TIANJIN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A new-tech industrial park in the
port city of Tianjin is attracting an increasing amount of
individual investment.
</P>
<P>
Of the 130 million yuan of the total capital of the 246 firms
newly registered in the park this year, private entrepreneurs
account for 108 million yuan (13 million U.S. dollars),
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts attribute the growth in private investment to
several factors including further relaxed government policies for
the private economy, policies encouraging laid-off workers from
state-owned enterprises to play their role in economic
development, more technicians applying their research to wider
fields, and an enhanced awareness of investment in
technology.

<HEADLINE> Israel Proposes New Ideas at Talks: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel proposed several "new
ideas" on its West Bank troop withdrawal at the talks held with
Palestinian negotiators Monday night, Israel Radio reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's legal advisor Yitzhak
Molcho met for several hours secretly with chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat at a undisclosed location in Jerusalem, but
neither side would say whether enough progress was made to keep
the talks going.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Israeli sources as saying that the Israel put
forward several "new ideas" at the meeting and was waiting for
response from the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not disclose what the new ideas are. The
Palestinian side had warned before the Monday talks that if Israel
did not come up with new ideas, the round of talks would be the
last.
</P>
<P>
Erekat went directly to Gaza after the meeting to brief Yasser
Arafat, President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), on
the talks.
</P>
<P>
The chief Palestinian negotiator said "nothing special" was
produced at the Monday talks.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Erekat demanded that Israel present its
withdrawal map to explain where was the proposed 3 percent area,
which Israel wants to turn into nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and other top palestinian officials would review the
session's outcome and then decide what steps to take next, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said it was still too earlier to say whether the
PNA would halt the talks, which were resumed on July 19 with an
aim to break the 16 month long deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The sticking point is that Israel has rejected the U.S. plan
calling for a 13.1 percent withdrawal, which the PNA has already
endorsed.
</P>
<P>
In the earlier rounds of talks, Israel proposed that 3 percent
of the proposed withdrawal be turned into nature reserves in which
both sides should refrain from building. The PNA has so far
refused to accept the demand, citing it had already made
compromise by accepting the trimmed U.S. pullback plan.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Firm to Jointly Utilize Yak Blood Component </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai Province in northwest
China has reached an agreement with a U.S. biology-technology
corporation to jointly utilize the blood of yaks, which contains
large amounts of a commercial substance known as SOD (super
dioxide dismutase).
</P>
<P>
Yaks are one of the province's most abundant animals, living at
elevations of more than 3,000 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
Yu Mantang, a Chinese researcher, found that yak blood contains
large amounts of SOD while conducting gene research on the blood
of the animal. Yu also discovered that the SOD content of the yak
blood is three times that of domestic animals in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Yaks living in China's Qinghai and Sichuan provinces as well as
the Tibet Autonomous Region are estimated at more than 14 million,
accounting for 85 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
SOD has wide applications in pharmaceuticals, food, nutrition
and cosmetics. Agreements have been reached with the KuiXave
Biolink Inc, a U.S.-based corporation, to introduce advanced
equipment for manufacturing SOD products.
</P>
<P>
Preparations have been under way for the project, which is
expected to boost poverty-relief efforts in the province.

<HEADLINE> Regeneration Technique Helps Severed Foot Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Regenration technique has helped
a Chinese patient's severed left foot grow by five centimeters in
about three months.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Chinese doctors have used this
technique on a severed foot.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old patient in Dalian City, northeast China, had
his left foot cut off by a steel wire last December, and the
remaining portion of the foot was only eight centimeters long,
making it impossible to walk.
</P>
<P>
Doctors from the No. 5 People's Hospital in Dalian and their
counterparts from Japan's Tokyo University used the regeneration
technique which included installing bone-lengthening equipment on
the severed foot to help the bone grow.
</P>
<P>
According to the doctors, the foot grew by one millimeter daily
during the three-month procedure.
</P>
<P>
They said they now have taken the bone-lengthening equipment
off the patient, as the injured foot has basically resumed its
function.
</P>
<P>
The doctors predict the patient will be able to walk normally in
another three months.

GUANGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Emily commutes to work from
Hong Kong to Guangzhou by direct bus every Monday.
</P>
<P>
She left her job in Hong Kong because there she was only an
ordinary staff worker, but now she is a mid-level executive at a
Sino-foreign joint venture in the capital of south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The number of Hong Kong people looking for jobs in neighboring
Guangdong is on the rise. For example, the Hong Kong Branch of the
Guangzhou-based South China Human Resources Market opened in March
and has so far received 200 applications and 600 inquiries.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong residents are mostly welcomed by local
enterprises. "Our company wants to lure property experts from Hong
Kong, since Hong Kong has a mature property market," said
Mr. Zhao, the head of a real estate company in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
According to Director Pan of the Guangzhou Municipal Personnel
Bureau, the human resources of Guangdong and Hong Kong are
complementary. The rich resource of experienced personnel in
finance, trade, enterprise management and real estate are most
welcomed by Guangdong Province, which has one of the most dynamic
economies in China.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more and more electrical and computer
technicians are coming from Guangdong to work in Hong Kong to fill
the shortage there, thanks to intensified personnel exchanges
between the two places.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Industrialists Apply for Prices Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industries has applied to the government for price increases of
maize meal, flour, cooking oils and bread.
</P>
<P>
Acting Chief Executive of the confedeation, Farai Zizhou told
a news conference here Monday that manufacturers expected the
government to make a decision on the matter "in the very near
future", the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Although there is no legislation preventing price increases
of edible oils, wheat, flour and bread, manufacturers have not
unilaterally increased prices of their products following a
government/business understanding reached early in the year,"
Zizhou said.
</P>
<P>
He said that significant adjustments were necessary to prevent
the collapse of a number of companies as manufacturers had been
facing massive cost increases for raw materials, electricity,
wages, transport, packaging and services.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers have proposed to increase the price of maize
meal by 14.5 percent, flour by 20.05 percent, cooking oils by
12.5 percent and bread by 21.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zizhou said the proposed increases are a result of price hikes
of raw materials which rose by between 8.3 percent and 57.14
percent with packaging costs up to 20 percent, financing costs hiking
to 35 percent, post and telecommunications charges up to 50
percent, and wage increases of between 30 and 34 percent.

WUHAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese-made components used in
producing two types of "Citroen-Fukang" cars by a Sino-French
automobile joint venture in Central China account for more than 80
percent of the cars' parts, up from 60 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Some 82.17 percent of the parts used to build the 1.4-liter
series "Citroen-Fukang" are made in China, and 80.78 percent
domestic parts are used in "Citroen-Fukang" cars with
electronic-direct-injection motors.
</P>
<P>
The Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Company was jointly built by
France's Citroen Automobile company in Wuhan, capital of Hubei
Province, at a cost of nearly 10.4 billion yuan for the first
phase of construction, one of the country's largest Sino-foreign
joint venture of its kind.
</P>
<P>
This joint venture began operations in 1996 and is expected
ultimately to turn out 300,000 "Citroen-Fukang" cars a year. It
can now produce a dozen varieties of 1.4-liter and 1.6-liter
"Citroen-Fukangs."
</P>
<P>
And Chinese-made components now account for 67.46 percent of
the parts used in producing the 1.6-liter "Citroen-Fukang."
</P>

CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal Al Ganzouri received Monday
U.S. Ambassador Danial Kurtzer and Daid Brown, director of the
USAID in Cairo. The U.S. officials confirmed that the
U.S. government and Congress would continue to provide assistance
to Egypt over the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials expressed confidence in Egyptian economy and
the competency of the government.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>

Al Gomhuria:
</P>

the partnership negotiations with the European Union (EU) will be
frozen until the dumping issues against Egyptian textile exports
to EU markets were settled.

move means an overt acceptance of practising dumping against the
EU states.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>

-- Egypt and Kuwait signed Monday a media cooperation protocol
at the conclusion of the bilateral media talks, co-chaired by

<HEADLINE> Joined Twins Born in Central China's Hunan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A pair of joined female twins
have been born in Liuyang City in central China's Hunan Province,
a rarely seen event in China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The twins, joined together from the chest to the abdomen, were
born on August 1 and weighed 4.4 kilograms. One of the girls
was also born with a cleft palate.
</P>
<P>
The baby girls were transferred from No.5 Liuyang Hospital to
the Hunan Children's Hospital in Changsha for better treatment.
</P>
<P>
The twins often touch each other with their four hands and
blink their eyes simultaneously when facing the camera as someone
takes their picture.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jianxin, father of the twins, said his wife had been in
good conditions while pregnant and he never expected to have
joined twins.
</P>
<P>
The twins' mother had ultrasonic testing in the fifth month of
pregnancy, and the fetus was discovered to have two heads and two
hearts.
</P>
<P>
Doctors thought the fetus was twins, and the mother had no
further testing after that.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Zhou Xiaoyu at the children's hospital said the survival
rate for joined twins is very low, and their survival depends on
early separation.
</P>
<P>
The doctor emphasised that smooth separation depends on the
overall condition of the twins.
</P>
<P>
Plans for the separation operation are expected to be made
after a complete physical examination of the joined girls.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Value of the Zimbabwean Dollar
has dropped again under heavy speculative pressure from
importers.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate fell to the level of 25 Zimbabwean Dollars
to one U.S. Dollar Monday before the Reserve Bank intervened late
in the day, freezing the rate at 23 Zimbabwean Dollars to the
U.S. Dollar, the daily Herald newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some commercial banks were Monday buying U.S. Dollars for 21
Zimbabwean Dollars and selling them for 25 Zimbabwean Dollars,
the huge margin showing the volatility and uncertainty of
trading.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, said in a
statement Monday that it had become necessary to raise the
rediscount rate to bring about stability to the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The rediscount rate, the rate at which other banks borrow from
the Reserve Bank went up from 31.5 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Domestic price inflation, the statement said, had
progressively increased from 20.1 percent in December last year
to about 30 percent by June this year. This had caused real
rates to be eroded.
</P>
<P>
To hike the rediscount rate by 3.5 percent will in turn
force the commercial banks to increase their minimum lending
rates. This will make borrowing from banks by both businesses and
individuals more expensive.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were
killed, 15 seriously injured and 90 others feared trapped under
the debris when a seven-storey building collapsed Monday night in
a northwest suburb of Mumbai, India's commercial capital.
</P>
<P>
The "Govind Apartments", which crumbled to the ground around
2005 local time yesterday, housed shops on the ground floor,
residential apartments on the first, second and third floors and a
hotel on the upper three, the Statesman newspaper reported
Tuesday, quoting fire brigade sources.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers pulled 13 people from the rubble and admitted them to
three city hospitals while two others were discharged after first
aid, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Residents said there was some unauthorized construction on the
top floor and they had complained to the municipality that the
15-year-old building had been tilting to one side for some months.
</P>
<P>
The police said, however, the civic authorities had served an
eviction notice to the residents, but they had stayed on
disregarding safety.
</P>
<P>
Another daily, the National Herald, said today that such
incidents have been a regular feature in the commercial capital of
the country during the last few years.
</P>
<P>
On the average, according to the daily, three to four buildings
collapse every year in Mumbai, killing scores of people.
</P>
<P>
Municipal authorities have become rather strict in granting
permission to build high-rise buildings in the megalopolis due to
such unfortunate incidents, the paper added.

translated into Chinese, the Chinese government needs time to
discuss whether to import the movie, which is based on a Chinese
folk story.
</P>
<P>
China imports a limited number of foreign films annually,
accounting for only 10 to 15 percent of the films distributed in
the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The artistic taste and story line of a foreign movie, and
the Chinese government's policies are both elements affecting the
decision-making process, they said.
</P>
<P>
An official from the China Film Corporation said that whether
or not to import "Mulan" will be a complicated issue.
</P>
<P>
The only imported film from Walt Disney has been Mickey Mouse
movies, but that was many years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Mulan" has been translated into six languages and has
attracted worldwide attention. Fans have opened more than 30 sites
about the movie on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Hua Mulan was an ancient Chinese heroine who served in
the army in place of her old and sickly father. Nobody guessed she
was a female until the war ended, because she well disguised
herself as a man.
</P>
<P>
Some Walt Disney producers have said that Mulan represents the
trend of women's liberation, and equality between men and women,
according to media reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) today
vowed to increase its support of the foreign trade sector by
promising five billion yuan in financing to a leading foreign
trade company.
</P>
<P>
The bank clinched a cooperative agreement with the China
National Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation
(Minmetals) today, promising it huge financing this year and next
year in forms of long-term local-currency and
foreign-exchange loans, bill acceptance, and guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Financing is extremely important to foreign trade companies at
present because of the difficulties they have encountered during
the sweeping Asian financial crisis, that began in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The nation's foreign trade sector will need to grow ten percent
this year to support the economic growth goal of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade sector has always been given top priority in
receiving loans from the BOC, and the bank's outstanding loans to
these foreign trade companies had reached 234.6 billion yuan by the
end of June.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the bank will also provide
Minmetals with financial services such as consulting,
representation in domestic and international settlements and
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
It will also aid the corporation, a large enterprise group
whose core business is international trade, in the fields of trade,
investment, real estate and financial expansion, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Minmetal's annual trade volume has for years been among the top
five of China's 500 largest specialized foreign trade firms.
</P>
<P>
The BOC this year signed lending agreements valued at more than
42 billion yuan with dozens of large enterprises in an effort to
boost national economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Denies Arms Sales to Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria Monday denied accusations
that it was engaged in armament trade with terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
In response to a New York Times report, the Bulgarian Ministry
of Trade and Tourism said that the Bulgarian government has never
granted licenses to any Bulgarian companies for exporting weapons
to terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria strictly observes all restrictions imposed by the
United Nations Security Council, including the embargo on arms
sales to a list of countries "with poor human rights records or
aggressive designs on their neighbors," the Bulgarian Telegraph
Agency (BTA) quoted the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
In any case where Bulgarian-made weapons are resold to
terrorist organizations, the Bulgarian government shall not be
held responsible, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In Bulgaria, the Commission for Controlling and Licensing
Foreign Trade in Arms and Dual-purpose Technologies, under the
Ministry of Trade and Tourism, is the only organization which has
the right to issue export licenses to Bulgarian companies.
</P>
<P>
The BTA said the New York Times alleged that Bulgaria "has
turned into an armament market for rebels and terrorists of all
sorts of political, ethnic and religious organizations."

<P>
COLOMBO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's exports to India will
increase four-fold once the Indian government removes tariff
barriers on 2000 products in October this year, according to trade
ministry sources here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the South Asian Summit recently, Indian leader announced
that India would remove these tariff barriers, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They quoted Trade Minister Kingsley Wickremaratne as saying
that the product range which will find lucrative markets in India
include spices, fibre and fibre based products, rubber and rubber
based products, graphite, gems and jewelry among a host of others.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka at present has 380 commodities available for export
to India, of which 106 items have been requested by Sri Lanka for
the removal of tariff barriers by India.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that a further boon to the promotion of Sri
Lankan exports to India was the reduction in the criteria in
relation to the Rules of Origin whereby value addition of products
in the South Asian region needed to be only 30 percent for exports
within the region while earlier it was 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
This will not only pave the way for additional exports from Sri
Lanka to India but also for joint ventures and alliances in
industry and commerce.
</P>
<P>
At present Sri Lanka exports 47 million U.S. dollars worth of
commodities to India and imports 187.5 million dollars worth of
commodities from India.

DHAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will get 15 million U.S.
dollars from the Netherlands government for dredging of Gorai
river, it was learned from the Netherlands Embassy here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An agreement in this regard was signed here Monday between
Bangladesh and the Dutch dredging company, Boskalis.
</P>
<P>
The work on the 30 million dollar-project is expected to begin
next month, and the Bangladeshi government will contribute the
remaining 15 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
After the Ganges Water Treaty signed in 1996 between Bangladesh
and India, the possibility of opening the mouth of the Gorai river
by capital dredging has been explored.
</P>
<P>
The project, when it is implemented, will allow fresh water to
flow into the Southwest region of Bangladesh, and the fresh water
flow will reverse the salinity in the region, retard the process
of "top dying" of Sundari trees in the southwest Bangladesh's
Sundarbans mangrove, the largest on in the world, which is being
seriously threatened by "top-Dying Disease".
</P>
<P>
Besides, the project will also have major positive impact on
agriculture, on drinking water supply and on the industries of the

<HEADLINE> IBM Finds Way to Build Faster Computer Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 3 (Xinhua) -- International Business
Machines Corp. said Monday it has found a way of making
microprocessor chips that can boost their performance by 35
percent, according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
The computer giant said in a statement that its "silicon-on-
insulator" (SOI) technology is a key advance that will allow it to
make chips with a special insulation layer between each transistor
and the chips' silicon base, reducing electrical interference that
saps energy and performance.
</P>
<P>
SOI, which comes just 11 months after IBM's previous microchip
breakthrough -- the copper chip -- can require as little as a
third of the power used by current chips, thus extending battery
life for portable devices such as cellular phones and hand-held
computers, IBM said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe SOI, with its high-performance and low-power
characteristics, is a significant breakthrough in chip
technology," said Mike Attardo, general manager of IBM
microelectronics division. "Like our copper chips, SOI will
accelerate the industry's constant drive to create smaller, more
powerful, less expensive electronic goods," he added.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that, using the new technology, a
computer microprocessor designed to run at 400 megahertz could run
at more than 500 MHz.
</P>
<P>
While other companies also have been working on SOI technology,
IBM said it would be the first to introduce it commercially.

<HEADLINE> Piped Gas Replaces Straw for Cooking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers are saying
farewell to the traditional use of straw as cooking fuel since
newly developed piped gas, made from straw, is entering into rural
households.
</P>
<P>
Using straw as firewood has a long history in China. But,
compared with natural gas popular in the cities, it is inefficient
and causes pollution to the environment.
</P>
<P>
With the new method invented by the Energy Research Institute
of the Shandong Provincial Academy of Sciences, straw is ground up
before being gasified and piped into households.
</P>
<P>
On the average, one kilogram of straw can produce two cubic
meters of gas, thus more than double the calories of straw
burning, according to Sun Li, a research fellow at the institute.
</P>
<P>
Teng Shaohua, a farmer in Shandong Province, said cooking is
much more convenient now that her village has built a gas station
using straw as materials. "Just turn it on," she said, showing
the reporter her new gas utensil, "It's no longer sooty and smoky."
</P>
<P>
A straw gas station usually costs 300,000 yuan (36,100 U.S.
dollars), and each family only pays 15 to 18 yuan per month for
the supply.
</P>
<P>
Each year, China produces 700 million tons of straw, of which
about half is used for fodder and manure, and the rest become
fuel.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science and Technology has decided to
popularize this technology across the country. To date, this type
of gas has been introduced into over 20,000 households in over 100
villages in Shandong, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Henan and
Shaanxi provinces.

PRAGUE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign tourist
arrivals in the Czech Republic continued to decline, down 2.3
percent in the first half of this year from the same period last

UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Danilo Turk, the current
president of the Security Council of the United Nations, said on
Monday that the disarmament talks between the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) and Iraq have broken down.
</P>
<P>
Turk said Richard Butler, Executive Chairman of UNSCOM in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, would
come back to the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York on
Wednesday to brief the Council on his trip to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"This is a difficult time. It is disturbing. We will have to

<P>
Butler, who went to Baghdad days ago, brought with him a "road
map" for Iraq to follow in its disarmament, and it was unclear
what has caused the breakdown of the talks, Turk added.
</P>

<P>
JAKARTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
ready to help private companies service 60 percent of their
foreign debts which will mature in one to two years, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
The government's Debt Restructuring Agency (INDRA) wants to
help reschedule the repayment of corporate debts that will mature
this year and spread them over eight years, INDRA Chairman Sumitro
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 companies have reported their corporate debts to the
central bank, Bank Indonesia, Antara News Agency Tuesday quoted
Sumitro as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had a total of 138 billion U.S. dollars foreign debts
by the end of April, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country's corporate and interbank debts have
reached 74.3 billion U.S. dollars, consisting of 60.3 billion
dollars possessed by private companies and 13.6 incurred by banks.
</P>
<P>
The corporate debt which will mature this year amounts to 34
billion U.S. dollars, consisting of 27 billion dollars incurred by
private companies and 7 billion dollars possessed by banks.
</P>
<P>
Sumitro said only companies which have agreed with foreign
creditors to restructure the repayment of their debts over eight
years could use the services of INDRA.
</P>
<P>
INDRA is voluntary in nature, meaning it does not require all
companies with foreign debts to joint it. he said, adding they are
free to settle their corporate debts on their own.
</P>
<P>
"They could settle (their foreign debts) using the bankruptcy
law or through direct negotiations with foreign creditors," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts held that the private debt was one the major
reasons for the prolonged economic crisis in Indonesia.

announced on Monday that a general election would be held on
September 5, three years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held in Malta's capital
Valletta, Sant said he made the decision after discussions with
President Ugo Mifsud Bonnici.
</P>
<P>
Elections were not due until 2001, but Sant told the president
that he had to announce early elections because of the unstable
situation within his Labor party.
</P>
<P>
With a one-vote majority in parliament, the ruling Labor party
was sworn in on October 26, 1996. But the party has been divided
on many issues such as government reforms, economic and foreign
policies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe the decision is based on the crisis
within the ruling party, rather than attacks from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Labour party won 50.72 percent of the votes in the last
general elections, enabling it to oust the Nationalist Party which
had been in power since 1987.

<HEADLINE> Italy Becomes Fourth Largest Contributor to EU Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Italy was the fourth largest
contributor to the 1997 European Union budget following Germany,
France and Britain, the EU budget commission said.
</P>
<P>
Italy accounted for more than 11 percent of the total EU
budget, with a contribution of 8.66 billions Ecus (9.4 billion
U.S. dollars) to the total budget of 76.16 billion Ecus (83
billion dollars), the Italian news agency ANSA quoted a
commission report as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The largest slice of the EU budget, or 45 percent, came from a
quota of the revenue drawn by the member states from value added
tax, while 35 percent came from a percentage of each country's
gross national product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
The remaining 20 percent was from agricultural duties and other
tariffs imposed on non-EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures are "sensitive" in view of a fund debate
linked to the planned EU enlargement to include some Central and
Eastern European nations in the next decade.

the May riots, local press Tuesday quoted Chairman of the Joint
Fact-finding Team Marzuki Darusman as saying.

including rapes of ethnic Chinese women", Marzuki told a group of
Taiwanese women human rights activists here Monday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attorney General Urges Greater Efforts to Keep Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno told the largest U.S. lawyers' organization on Monday that
more must be done to keep guns away from children and help end a
national "culture of violence."
</P>
<P>
"There can be very few people in the United States who disagree
with the proposition that no one should possess a gun unless they
know how to safely and lawfully use it, and evidence a willingness
and capacity to do so," The Associated Press quoted Reno as
telling a meeting of the American Bar Association's policy-making
House of Delegates held in Toronto, Canada.
</P>
<P>
"States must enact and enforce laws requiring gun owners to
store their weapons securely so that children cannot get access to
them," Reno added.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the recent fatal shootings inside the U.S. Capitol
and killings at a number of schools around the country, Reno said
gun-related violence is a major threat to Americans' safety.
While Toronto had only 100 gun killings from 1992 through 1996,
Chicago -- a similar-sized U.S. city -- had 3,063 gun homicides
during that same period.
</P>
<P>
Every day in the United States, about 100 people die from
gun-related injuries, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, reducing the number of injuries and deaths influenced by
others must clearly continue to be a national priority," the
attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general called for federal, state and local
efforts to enforce gun laws and carry out prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
"We need to teach these young people that guns kill and maim
for life... that guns really do kill," Reno said. "The bottom
line is that lawyers can change our country's attitude about
guns... We can end the culture of violence in this nation."
</P>
<P>
On July 21, the U.S. Senate rejected a bill to require all
handguns sold in the United States include safety locks designed
to prevent accidents.
</P>
<P>
The ABA's House of Delegates passed a resolution Monday seeking
stronger efforts to deal with school gun violence, including
firearms education, mediation to head off disputes and stronger
laws to keep guns away from young people.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Taxpayers will be handed back at least 12 billion Australian
dollars (7.44 billion U.S. dollars) in personal income taxes as
Prime Minister John Howard will use to persuade them to embrace a
10 percent goods and services tax under the government's historic
tax package to be released next week.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Sydney Water Services clearly misled the public when it
claimed last Thursday and Friday (July 30 and 31) that the
Prospect plant was being bypassed at the height of the crisis, the
plant's private operator confirmed that it was not taken off-line
or bypassed at any stage, but had continued to supply treated and
filtered water directly to the main system.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Details of the federal government's proposed tax reforms
will be revealed on Thursday next week, effectively signaling the
start of an election campaign leading to a poll likely to be held
in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia faces a 30 billion Australian dollars (18.6
billion U.S. dollars) conversion cost for digital television over
the next 10 years, with householders bearing the bulk of the
expense, an independent market research house predicted Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Campaign Finance Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives approved Monday a bill that would reform campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
The House approved a measure to ban so-called "soft money" --
unregulated donations that go to party committees rather than
political candidates. The bill still faces competition from other
House campaign finance proposals due for votes later this week and
a potential barrier in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The measure, sponsored by Representatives Christopher Shays of
Connecticut and Marty Meehan of Massachusetts, would place tighter
restrictions on "issue advocacy" ads within 60 days of an
election. Those ads theoretically do not target individual
candidates and are therefore not subject to federal disclosure
laws.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved on a 237-186 vote, survived weeks of debate
and votes on amendments its backers said were designed to strip
away support and splinter the bipartisan coalition in favor of
revamping fund-raising laws.
</P>
<P>
The vote on the bill, which is similar to one that died in the
Senate earlier this year, will be followed this week by votes on
nine remaining campaign finance measures pitted against one
another in a wide-ranging debate that began in May. The leading
vote-getter wins.
</P>
<P>
But Senate Republican leaders have shown little inclination to
even take up the issue when they return from their summer recess
in September.

<HEADLINE> Smokers in New Zealand Under Intense Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Smokers in New Zealand will
come under intense pressure to stub out smoking as New Zealand
Associate Health Minister Tuariki Delamere has disclosed his plans
"to hit smokers in the pocket through another tax rise".
</P>
<P>
Delamere's open hostility towards smokers came as Smokingfree
Coalition research was released showing smoking had fallen 10
percent since tax rise of 50 cents a packet in May this year.
</P>
<P>
This year's tax rise was the first in seven years, with tax
making up about 70 percent of the price of each packet.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion, a Wellington-based newspaper, today quoted the
New Zealand associate health minister as saying that tougher
measures remained his goal, including a smoking ban in public
buildings and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Delamere told an Action on Smoking and Health meeting here
yesterday evening that he wanted the tax to rise another 50 cents
a packet in next year's budget, pushing the price close to eight
NZ dollars (more than four U.S. dollars) a packet.
</P>
<P>
"It's my goal to literally destroy (tobacco companies)," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"They know full well that smoking is a killer but they are so
well versed in the art of deception and exploiting peer pressure
to lure teenagers," Delamere said.
</P>
<P>
According to the associate health minister, there are about
4,500 smoking-related deaths a year in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Smokingfree Coalition Director Barbara Langford said at the
meeting that the new research findings showed a price rise was the
right spur for some to quit smoking.

LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The English premier league said in
a statement on Monday that it had got written assurance from its
top clubs not to participate in a proposed European Super League.
</P>
<P>
"We have received the written assurances we required from those
clubs who have been at the forefront of recent speculation," the
league said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Our clubs have pledged to work together to take forward a
discussion on the future shape of European club competitions."
</P>
<P>
League spokesman Mike Lee said a routine meeting of premier
league clubs in September would discuss European issues.
</P>
<P>
"We will look then at any further representations we may need
to make to UEFA," he said.
</P>
<P>
League and cup champions Arsenal, Manchester United and
Liverpool have been widely named as the clubs most likely to be
approached by any new European league. United have already
publicly denied any involvement.

The English Football Association issued a warning against top
clubs on Sunday that they faced being kicked out of the premier
league and F.A. Cup if they joined a Super League.

<HEADLINE> Agreement Reached over N. Irish Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A Protestant brotherhood and
Catholic residents in Northern Irish city of Londonderry reached
an "understanding" over a potential flashpoint parade on Monday,
reports from Belfast said.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came after a weekend of negotiation between
the pro-British Protestant Apprentice Boys and the Bogside
Residents's Group over Saturday's planned march in Londoderry, the
second largest city in the province.
</P>
<P>
The threat of a confrontation at Saturday's parade had been
casting a shadow over efforts to bring peace to Northern Ireland,
which witnessed a historic peace agreement last April aimed at
ending 30 years of violence.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Apprentice Boys said agreement had been
reached with residents of the mainly Catholic city to permit its
annual march to go ahead on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Its main parade would pass through the city as usual but only
13 representatives would lay a wreath at the city's war memorial,
the scene of ugly clashes in the past, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mo Mowlam, Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, welcomed the
compromise, saying she hoped it would be an example to other
disputed marches.
</P>
<P>
"It is a victory for common sense and I believe it will be
welcomed eagerly by the people of Derry and indeed throughout the
whole of Northern Ireland," she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It shows what can be achieved when people talk with each other
and respect the other person's point of view," she added.
</P>
<P>
As many as 20,000 people take part in the march every year,
held to commemorate the lifting in 1689 of the Siege of Derry, the
longest military siege in British history.

<HEADLINE> IFC Indexes to Add Hong Kong "Red Chips" and Drop Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) Monday announced two changes to the components
of the IFC Investable (IFCI) index, to add Hong Kong "red chips"
and drop Portuguese equities.
</P>
<P>
The IFCI index measures returns on stocks that are available to
foreign investors, and the IFC Global (IFCG) index, is designed as
the broadest indicator of market movements, showing the
performance of the most active stocks in their respective stock
markets even if they are unavailable to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, IFC will Hong Kong "red chips" to its
Investable and Global Index series for China on November 2, 1998.
"Red chips" are commonly defined as those stocks that are listed
on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and incorporated in the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), but are owned directly
or indirectly in significant proportions by the Chinese government
or a Chinese state-owned enterprise. At least 35 percent of the
share holdings of "red chips" in the Hang Seng China Affiliated
Corporation (Red Chip) Index are held by state-owned organizations
or provincial or municipal authorities in China. At the end of
June, there were 43 Hang Seng "red chips" with a total market
capitalization of approximately 15 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the IFC China Indexes include three classes of
shares: A-, B- and H- classes, of which only the B-shares and
H-shares are investable by foreigners and included in the IFCI
Index. B-shares, listed either on the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock
exchanges, represented e58 percent of the IFCI market
capitalization on June 30, 1998, while H-shares constituted the
remaining 42 percent of the IFCI China on June 30, 1998. H-shares
do not have large government holdings.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, IFC will discontinue the IFCI
and IFCG Index series for Portugal and also remove Portugal from
all regional and composite IFCI and IFCG Indexes on April 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The decision is based on the country's entry into the European
Monetary Union. Portugal is the first country to be selected from
"graduation" from the IFC's emerging markets indexs.
</P>
<P>
IFC is a member of the World Bank Group, financing the private
sector projects in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Colombia New President Vow New Relationship With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana, after meeting U.S. President Bill Clinton, said here on
Monday that there will be a "new beginning" in his country's
soured relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Today marks a new beginning in the U.S.-Colombian relations.
The years of mistrust are now behind us," Pastrana told reporters
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana, who was elected on June 21 to succeed Ernesto Samper,
said the meeting with Clinton was "candid and full of optimism."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the White House said Pastrana expressed a
commitment to cooperate with the U.S. in fighting drug trafficking
and a desire to peacefully end Colombia's long-running war against
guerrilla insurgents.
</P>
<P>
Clinton pledged to work with Congress to boost U.S. aid to
Colombia for anti-drug efforts, economic development, humanitarian
assistance and private investment, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
The United States also would work with other international
donors and financial institutions to help Colombia's economy,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"I feel I can speak for both President Clinton and myself when
I say that as of today, an era of change, of positive, productive
change has begun between our two countries," Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
The White House said Pastrana had accepted an invitation from
Clinton to return to Washington for a state visit later this year.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the U.S. and Colombia has been sour
since the U.S. State Department revoked Samper's travel visa in
1996 and twice "decertified" Colombia as an ally in the anti-drug
war.

<HEADLINE> OAU Says Badme is Ethiopia's Land: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin said Monday the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has
affirmed that Badme and its environs were under Ethiopian
administration prior to the Eritrean occupation on May 12.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Mesfin upon his arrival here from a
two-day OAU ministerial meeting on Ethio-Eritrean border dispute
in Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum told local journalists that "the OAU ministerial report
established beyond doubts the fundamental fact that the disputed
Badme and Shiraro areas were under Ethiopian administration
before the Eritrean invasion on May 12, 1998."
</P>
<P>
Seyoum said the report by the Ministerial Committee of the
Peace Mission will be presented to the OAU mandated heads of
state who are expected to hold consultations and pass decisions
in two or three weeks time.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ministerial Committee had separate talks with both
Ethiopian and Eritrean delegations on their respective stance on
the solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The committee, he said, has prepared a report on the basis of
evidences by the ambassadors and briefing of the delegations, a
copy of which has given to both countries.
</P>
<P>
The result of the Ouagadougou meeting has come out with the
truth, the Ethiopian foreign minister asserted.

<HEADLINE> Talks Between UNSCOM, Iraq Break Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The talks on weapons inspection
between the U.N. chief arms inspector Richard Butler and Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz broke down Monday.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Butler's refusal to go to the U.N. Security Council
to tell the truth about disarmament issue in Iraq led to the
break-down of the talks.
</P>
<P>
This is the first ever break-down of talks between Iraq and
UNSCOM, or the U.N. Special Commission on disarmament in Iraq,
which indicates that their relations are worsening.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. source told Xinhua that the talks broke down soon after
the second round of talks between UNSCOM headed by Butler and
Iraqi side headed by Aziz started.
</P>
<P>
Then Butler made a phone call to the President of the Security
Council and informed the Security Council of the current
situation, said the U.N. source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The source said Butler had turned down a proposal from the
UNSCOM delegation that he hold one-to-one talks with Aziz to save
the talks.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM-Iraq talks were scheduled to last two days from
Monday to Tuesday. Under the current situation, the UNSCOM
delegation will probably leave Baghdad on Tuesday morning, a day
earlier than scheduled, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Butler said after the second round of talks that the talks have
reached an impasse and may have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we are going to meet tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the break-down of the talks with
Butler, Aziz said Iraq's position is that it had fulfilled all the
requirement under relevant U.N. resolution long time ago.
</P>
<P>
"All Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have been destroyed and
its ability to produce those weapons were destroyed. The
monitoring system has been established since 1994," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
"I asked Mr. Butler if he has any physical evidence contrary to
the declaration of Iraq... he kept silent," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Butler proposed a new program of action, but he
rejected it, because Butler was unable to report the truth to the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"What is the use for a new program if you are going to repeat
the same tricks?" Aziz said he asked Butler.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that Iraqi leadership had to assess the situation
and draw necessary conclusions.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a clear end to the suffering of Iraqi people,
there should be a clear end to the lifing of sanctions (off
Iraq)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Iraq is ready to continue cooperation and continue
its obligation, but it cannot do so when UNSCOM is not ready to
report the truth to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day after the end of the first round of talks,
Aziz criticized Butler for continuing his same old working style
of ignoring essential issues of disarmament, while focusing minor
and insignificant issues to waste time, prolong work and distort
the picture of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Butler's working style served the U.S. policy which
has the aim to keep the U.N. sanctions in place.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait. They can only be lifted after the U.N. weapons
inspectors verify that the country is free of weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Govt Extends Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government
announced Monday that it would expand a unilateral cease-fire in
the south starting Tuesday to facilitate the flow of aid in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by senior Sudanese government
officials upon arrival here to attend the Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development (IGAD) ministerial meeting on the
peaceful resolution of the conflict in southern Sudan due to kick
off Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Ethiopian News Agency, head of
the Sudanese government delegation Riech Machar and Foreign
Minister Mustafa Osman said at the airport that the Sudanese
government will make immediate and complete cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire is part of their government's effort to resolve
the conflict peacefully, the senior Sudanese government officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government earlier agreed on cease-fire to
facilitate food delivery to people affected by drought in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The three-day third round talks between the Sudanese
government and the rebel Sudan people's liberation army will be
under the auspices of the 7-nation IGAD. The delegation of the
Sudan people's liberation army led by Deputy Chairman Salva Kir
arrived here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two sides resumed in Nairobi, Kenya last
October after a three-year hiatus. The two sides held a second
round talks in Nairobi in May this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Spending Increases as Personal Incomes Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Americans kept spending at
a strong pace in June despite their personal incomes posted the
smallest growth in about three years, the Commerce Department
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The personal incomes rose by just 0.2 percent in June, just
half of the 0.4 percent May gain. The big decline reflected in
part a loss of 2 billion U.S. dollars, at an annual rate, in wages
because of the two-month-long General Motors strike, which had not
been settled until last week.
</P>
<P>
The government separately reported that construction spending
rose 1.7 percent in June, the biggest growth in more than a year,
as spending for residential construction rose to an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Overall construction spending went up to a seasonally adjusted
644 billion dollars in June, the second highest level on record.
The stronger increase reflected a 1.6 percent rise in
single-family homes and a 2.1 percent increase in non-residential
buildings. Construction activity this year has been pushed by
falling interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percent rise in June incomes matched gains in April
1997 and October 1996 and was the smallest since a 0.1 percent
rise in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic
activity, rose at a strong 0.6 percent clip in June. While this
was slower than the 0.9 percent surge in May, that gain had been
the strongest in nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
Even with the strong June increase in consumer spending, the
overall economy slows significantly in the second quarter. The
government reported Friday that the gross domestic product (GDP),
the economy's total output of goods and services, rose at an
annual rate of just 1.4 percent in the spring, a dramatic slowdown
from a 5.5 percent growth rate in the first three months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Americans' disposable personal income, the amount left over
after paying taxes, was up 0.2 percent in June, the same increase
as the overall income figure.
</P>
<P>
The continued strong growth in spending and the slowdown in
incomes pushed the amount Americans were able to save down to 0.2
percent in June, the lowest level since the government began
keeping monthly statistics in 1959. The savings rate had dipped to
0.5 percent in May after a 1.1 percent rate in April.

LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The British government Monday

an effort to resolve their border clashes which have killed more
than 80 people over the past few days.
</P>

British Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett said in a

"It is therefore important for India and Pakistan to work

the two countries to set up talks to address their border
incidents.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett also stressed that it is essential that India and

they need to take positive steps on nuclear non-proliferation and

<HEADLINE> U.S. Offers no Mediation over Kashmir unless Invited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that it would not offer to mediate between India and
Pakistan over Kashmir unless invited by both sides.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to assist the parties in this process at the
request of both parties. We don't offer to mediate unless
requested by both sides," State Department spokesman James Rubin
said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Rubin called on both India and Pakistan to resume talks on
Kashmir that ended with no results in Colombo, Sri Lankan, last
week.
</P>
<P>
The United States "urged the two countries to resume the
senior-level dialogue as soon as possible, and to approach these
talks imaginatively and constructively," he said.
</P>
<P>
There intensive exchanges of fire between Indian and Pakistani
troops on the Kashmir frontier last week, which just tapered off
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The volatility of Kashmir is a stark remainder of the pressing
need for India and Pakistan to resolve their differences. This is
particularly true now following the Indian and Pakistani nuclear
tests, which have significantly raised the states in their
disputes," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States had sent messages to the two parties
urging restraint from "provocative actions."
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said there were no plans for any direct U.S.
intervention. "I'm talking about a diplomatic message from our
government to the Indian and Pakistani governments. Not a new trip
or a new envoy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's
several meeting with both sides.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Talbott is going to continue to do that, and there
are additional meetings planned in the coming weeks."
</P>
<P>
"That is the diplomatic effort that we're doing, and we believe
there is enough reason for optimism to continue working on it," he
added.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin cautioned reporters not to expect any likely
breakthrough "by any stretch of the imagination."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says NATO Approves Plans for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, Aug 3 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has approved contingency plans for possible
use of military force in the Kosovo crisis, said the United States
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has now approved a range of contingency plans for the use
of military force," said State Department spokesman James Rubin at
a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the plans needs to be further refined.
"The secretary-general (of NATO) has requested further refinement
of those initially approved plans that were approved in recent
days," he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Rubin's disclosure appeared designed to
pressure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt an
offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels in Serbia's Kosovo
province.
</P>
<P>
"I hope President Milosevic understands this," Rubin noted,
adding that the remaining work by NATO planners "is continuing
apace. And we would expect that work to further refine the options
to be done very, very quickly."
</P>
<P>
Rubin declined to give any details of the contingency plans,
but a meeting in Luxembourg last week, NATO foreign ministers
asked military experts to look at possible preventive deployments
in Albania and Macedonia, which border Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO itself has not announced the plans.
</P>
<P>
NATO had indicated that air strikes against Serbia's military
target was an option. But later it did not mention the use of
force any more, which analysts say, is partly because of the
opposition of Russia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said that the campaign of armed violence by
the separatist ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army has also
complicated plans to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said it was up to NATO's political leaders to decide
whether action was needed, but that the two factors making the
military planning necessary, including the refugee problem and the
risk of regional instability, were getting worse.
